He served as the 30th Premier of New Brunswick from 1999 to 2006. Lord was appointed as board chair of Ontario Power Generation in 2014. Early life Lord was born in Roberval, Quebec, the youngest of four children of Marie-√âmilie (Morin), a former teacher, and Ralph Frank Lord, a pilot. His father was anglophone and his mother was francophone,http://www.cbc.ca/nbvotes2003/parties/lord.html and he was raised in a bilingual household in Moncton, New Brunswick, where he spent the rest of his early life.Trichur, Rita (December 22, 2012). \\"A wireless speaker with a political calling\\", The Globe and Mail, p. B3. After graduating from high school, he earned a bachelor's degree in social science with a major in economics, as well as a bachelor's degree in common law, from the Universit√© de Moncton. While Lord attended the Universit√© de Moncton, he had some electoral success being elected the president of the Universit√© de Moncton student union (FEECUM) and served for three terms. Lord married his wife Diane in 1990; they have two children. One of his brothers, Roger Lord, is an internationally acclaimed concert pianist. Election as leader In 1997, Lord was elected leader of the PC Party of New Brunswick and then became the MLA for the district of Moncton East in a 1998 by-election. Much of Lord's success came from the countless months he spent meeting party members across New Brunswick, and in part because he was also flawlessly bilingual and able to draw a strong concentration of support in the Moncton area, one of four cities in which members could vote. Lord defeated Norman Betts, who was the perceived frontrunner, as well as Margaret-Ann Blaney, who, with Betts, would go on to serve in Lord's cabinet and Cleveland Allaby. Premier On June 7, 1999, Lord's PC party overcame an early deficit in the polls to pull out a landslide victory in the provincial general election, winning 44 of 55 seats in the legislature. At just 33 years of age, Lord (on June 21) became one of the youngest Premiers in Canadian history. Using the successful tactics from the 1994 United States elections of Republican Congressional leader, Newt Gingrich, Lord was elected on his \\"200 Days of Change\\" platform, consisting of 20 promises of things he would do within the first 200 days of his mandate if he were elected premier. In 2002, Lord delivered what the media and others hailed as an electrifying speech at the national Progressive Conservative Party of Canada convention in Edmonton, Alberta, which started speculation that he might run for a job in federal politics, specifically, replacing Joe Clark as federal PC leader. A very strong movement of influential conservatives erupted after Edmonton to lobby the Premier into federal politics, everything from a website to a coast to coast organizationShawn Berry, \\"Tory Youth leader in P.E.I. backs Lord for federal leadership\\". NB Telegraph-Journal, A1, September 9th 2002 was being set up to woo the Premier to leave Fredericton and head to Ottawa. A short time later, Lord shot down any notions that that might happen, choosing instead to remain focused on provincial politics and the 2003 New Brunswick election. That election was not kind to Lord, with the Liberals using the issue of rising car insurance to catch the PC Party off guard. The Party wasn't able to regain its footing until relatively late in the campaign, and barely held on to a majority over the Liberal Party led by Shawn Graham. Lord was again courted for federal politics in late 2003, when the PC Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance merged into the Conservative Party of Canada. In the end, Lord opted to stay in New Brunswick due to his young family and the fact that his departure would force his party into a minority government situation. In 2004, Lord's government came under fire over a variety of unpopular stances, most notably changes to health care. These included closures of beds at hospitals in Miramichi and Dalhousie, and consolidation of four hospitals in the Upper Saint John River Valley into one. The Liberals, under leader Shawn Graham, led in public opinion polls as of the summer of 2004 and maintained that lead; however, Lord remained the most favoured Leader to be Premier of New Brunswick for a time. On August 10, 2006, Lord announced that on August 19, he would be calling an election for September 18. This election call was in response to the loss of a caucus member, Peter Mesheau, who announced his intention to resign to work in the private sector. The resignation would have caused Lord to slip into a minority government and the subsequent by-election could have flipped the balance of power to the Liberals. Lord decided that instead of a by-election deciding the fate of his government, he would let the people choose. Some observers saw Lord's election call as a bold move considering his popularity numbers had only recently started to surpass the Liberal Leader. In the head to head campaign that followed, Lord lost the government to the Liberals, who took 29 seats to 26 for the Conservatives. The Tories did manage to win the popular vote, besting the Liberals 47.5% to 47.2%. Lord left the Premier's Office on October 3, 2006. On December 13, 2006, Lord announced that he was resigning as PC leader, further he said he would resign his legislative seat in Moncton East on January 31, 2007. Post-Premier After leaving politics, Lord took a position as senior counsel with the law firm McCarthy Tetrault, splitting time between their offices in Montreal and Ottawa while continuing to maintain his residence in Fredericton. On December 3, 2007, Lord was appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper as head of the Bilingualism Committee. He reviewed Canada's Official Language Laws, and he made suggestions where improvements can be made.pm.gc.ca: \\"Prime Minister announces Bernard Lord will lead Cross-Canada Official Languages consultations\\" In December 2007, Lord was named as the President of the 2009 CHL Memorial Cup selection-committee. In October 2008, it was announced that Lord would be appointed as president and CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, a lobbyist group that represents cellular, messaging, mobile radio, fixed wireless and mobile satellite carriers, as well as companies that develop and produce products and services for the industry. Lord was named in 2013 to the board of Ontario's public utility provider, Ontario Power Generation, and he was appointed as board chair in March 2014 by the government of Kathleen Wynne. He was tasked with cutting expenses after an auditor's report that came out late in the term of his predecessor, Jake Epp, criticized the agency for cost overruns and excessive executive wages and bonuses. On June 15, 2016, Lord was named as the Chief Executive Officer of Medavie Blue Cross effective September 1, 2016.

It is a loose term for over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic subgroups, located principally in the central and southern interior of Borneo, each with its own dialect, customs, laws, territory and culture, although common distinguishing traits are readily identifiable. Dayak languages are categorised as part of the Austronesian languages in Asia. The Dayak were animist in belief; however, many converted to Islam and since the 19th century there has been mass conversion to Christianity. History The Dayak sociolinguistic map as described by Tjilik Riwut in 1954, which divided the Dayak groups into Ngaju, Apu Kayan, Iban, Klemantan, Murut, Punan and Ot Danum. The Dayak people of Borneo possess an indigenous account of their history, mostly in oral literature, partly in writing in papan turai (wooden records), and partly in common cultural customary practices. Among prominent accounts of the origin of the Dayak people is the mythical oral epic of \\"Tetek Tahtum\\" by the Ngaju Dayak of Central Kalimantan; it narrates that the ancestors of the Dayak people descended from the heavens before moving from inland to the downstream shores of Borneo. The independent state of Nansarunai, established by the Ma'anyan Dayaks prior to the 12th century, flourished in southern Kalimantan. The kingdom suffered two major attacks from the Majapahit forces that caused the decline and fall of the kingdom by the year 1389; the attacks are known as Nansarunai Usak Jawa (meaning \\"the destruction of the Nansarunai by the Javanese\\") in the oral accounts of the Ma'anyan people. These attacks contributed to the migration of the Ma'anyans to the Central and South Borneo region. The colonial accounts and reports of Dayak activity in Borneo detail carefully cultivated economic and political relationships with other communities as well as an ample body of research and study concerning the history of Dayak migrations. In particular, the Iban or the Sea Dayak exploits in the South China Seas are documented, owing to their ferocity and aggressive culture of war against sea dwelling groups and emerging Western trade interests in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1838, British adventurer James Brooke arrived to find the Sultan of Brunei fending off rebellion. Sarawak was in chaos, in the view of the European colonist Brooke. Brooke put down the rebellion, and was made Governor of Sarawak in 1841, with the title of Rajah. Brooke suppressed headhunting and \\"piracy\\", namely the resistance of indigenous peoples to British naval authority around Borneo, and was also involved in looting, plunder, and the violent erasure of villages. Brooke's most famous Iban enemy was Libau \\"Rentap\\"; Brooke led three expeditions against him and finally defeated him at Sadok Hill. Brooke had many Dayaks in his forces at this battle, and famously said \\"Only Dayaks can kill Dayaks. So he deployed Dayaks to kill Dayaks.\\" Sharif Mashor, a Melanau from Mukah, was another enemy of Brooke. During World War II, Japanese forces occupied Borneo and treated all of the indigenous peoples poorly ‚Äì massacres of the Malay and Dayak peoples were common, especially among the Dayaks of the Kapit Division.http://pariwisata.kalbar.go.id/index.php?op=deskripsi&u1;=1&u2;=1&idkt;=4 In response, the Dayaks formed a special force to assist the Allied forces. Eleven US airmen and a few dozen Australian special operatives trained a thousand Dayaks from the Kapit Division in guerrilla warfare. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers and provided the Allies with vital intelligence about Japanese-held oil fields. During the Malayan Emergency the British military hired Dayak headhunters to kill anti- colonial fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army. News of this reached parliament in 1952 after The Daily Worker published photographs of Royal Marines posing with Dayak trackers holding the severed heads of suspected communists. Initially the British government denied any involvement in headhunting, until Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttleton confirmed to parliament that the photographs were indeed authentic. Coastal populations in Borneo are largely Muslim in belief, however these groups (Tidung, Banjarese, Bulungan, Paser, Kutainese, Bakumpai) are generally considered to be Malayised and Islamised native of Borneo and heavily amalgamated by the Malay people, culture and sultanate system. These groups identified themselves as Melayu or Malay subgroup due to the closer cultural identity to the Malay people, compared from the Dayak umbrella classification, as the latter are traditionally associated for their pagan belief and tribal lifestyle. The Dayak people classification are largely limited among the ethnic groups traditionally concentrated in southern and interior Sarawak and Kalimantan. Other native groups in dwelling in northern Sarawak, parts of Brunei and Sabah, chiefly the Bisayah, Orang Ulu, Kadazandusun, Melanau, Rungus and dozens of smaller group were categorised under a separate classification apart from the Dayaks due to the difference in culture and history. Other groups in coastal areas of Sabah and northeastern Kalimantan; namely the Illanun, Taus≈´g, Sama and Bajau, although inhabiting and (in the case of the Tausug group) ruling the northern tip of Borneo for centuries, have their cultural origins from the southern Philippines. These groups though may be indigenous to coastal northeastern Borneo, they are nonetheless not Dayak, but instead are grouped under the separate umbrella term of Moro, especially in the Philippines. Ethnicity Various indigenous Malay and Dayak homeland in Indonesian Borneo. In contrast to the coastal Borneo which predominantly inhabited by ethnic Malay and Banjarese people, the Dayak groups were located further in the inland Kalimantan. Apart from Kalimantan, the Dayak groups can be found in the Malaysian state of Sarawak and Brunei. The term \\"Dayak\\", a local Malay word (\\"daya\\", \\"daya'\\" or \\"dayuh\\") equivalent to \\"savages\\", started out as a derogatory term used by coastal dwellers that was adopted by the British and Dutch colonial administrations as a general term referring to all non-Muslims tribes in the interior. There are seven main ethnic divisions of Dayaks according to their respective native languages, customs and cultures which are: *1. Ngaju *2. Apo Kayan including Orang Ulu *3. Iban (Sea Dayak) or Hivan *4. Bidayuh (Land Dayak) or Klemantan *5. Kadazan, Dusun, Murut *6. Punan *7. Ot Danum Under the main classifications, there are dozens of ethnics and hundreds of sub-ethnics dwelling in the Borneo island. There are over 30 ethnic Dayak groups speaking different languages. This cultural and linguistic diversity parallels the high biodiversity and related traditional knowledge of Borneo. The above list of Dayak clusters by Tjilik Riwut was revised by the First International Dayak Congress and Exhibition in 2017 to become: Ngaju-Ot Danum, Apo Kayan-Kenyan, Iban, Klemantan, Kadazan-Dusun and Punan. Languages Dayaks do not speak just one language, even if just those on the island of Borneo (Kalimantan) are considered. Their indigenous languages belong in the general classification of Malayo-Polynesian languages and to diverse groups such as Land Dayak, Malayic, Sabahan, and Barito languages.See the language list at Most Dayaks today are bilingual, in addition to their native language, are well-versed in Malay. Many of Borneo's languages are endemic (which means they are spoken nowhere else). It is estimated that around 170 languages and dialects are spoken on the island and some by just a few hundred people, thus posing a serious risk to the future of those languages and related heritage. Headhunting and peacemaking The gallery in the interior of a Kajan Dayak house with skulls and weapons along the wall, exhibiting their headhunters culture In the past, the Dayak were feared for their ancient tradition of headhunting practices (the ritual is also known as Ngayau by the Dayaks). Among the Iban Dayaks, the origin of headhunting was believed to be meeting one of the mourning rules given by a spirit which is as follows: * The sacred jar is not to be opened except by a warrior who has managed to obtain a head, or by a man who can present a human head, which he obtained in a fight; or by a man who has returned from a sojourn in enemy country. Often, a war leader had at least three lieutenants (called manuk sabong) who in turn had some followers. The war (ngayau) rules among the Iban Dayaks are listed below: * If a warleader leads a party on an expedition, he must not allow his warriors to fight a guiltless tribe that has no quarrel with them. * If the enemy surrenders, he may not take their lives, lest his army be unsuccessful in future warfare and risk fighting empty-handed war raids (balang kayau). * The first time that a warrior takes a head or captures a prisoner, he must present the head or captive to the warleader in acknowledgement of the latter's leadership. * If a warrior takes two heads or captives, or more, one of each must be given to the warleader; the remainder belongs to the killer or captor. * The warleader must be honest with his followers in order that in future wars he may not be defeated (alah bunoh). Dutch Colonial government in Eastern and Southern Borneo successfully curtailed the traditional headhunting culture by the Dayaks. In reality not all Dayaks were Hunter-gatherers, most Dayaks in the 19th century are actually farmers, mainly engaging with shifting cultivation. They also gathered forest goods and animal hunting. There were various reasons for headhunting as listed below: * For soil fertility Dayaks hunted fresh heads before the paddy harvesting seasons after which a head festival would be held in honour of the new heads. * To add supernatural strength which Dayaks believed to be centred in the soul and head of humans. Fresh heads can give magical powers for communal protection, bountiful paddy harvesting and disease curing. * To exact revenge for murders based on \\"blood credit\\" principle unless \\"adat pati nyawa\\" (customary compensation token) is paid. * To pay dowry for marriages e.g. \\"derian palit mata\\" (eye blocking dowry) for Ibans once blood has been splashed prior to agreeing to marriage and, of course, new fresh heads show prowess, bravery, ability and capability to protect his family, community and land * For foundation of new buildings to be stronger and meaningful than the normal practice of not putting in human heads. * For protection against enemy attacks according to the principle of \\"attack first before being attacked\\". * As a symbol of power and social status ranking where the more heads someone has, the more respect and glory due to him. The warleader is called tuai serang (warleader) or raja berani (king of the brave) while kayau anak (small raid) leader is only called tuai kayau (raid leader) whereby adat tebalu (widower rule) after their death would be paid according to their ranking status in the community. * For territorial expansion where some brave Dayaks intentionally migrated into new areas such as Mujah \\"Buah Raya\\" or migrated from Skrang to Paku to Kanowit while infighting among Ibans themselves in Batang Ai caused the Ulu Ai Ibans to migrate to Batang Kanyau River in Kapuas, Kalimantan and then proceed to Katibas and later on Ulu Rajang in Sarawak. The earlier migrations from Kapuas to Batang Ai, Batang Lupar, Batang Saribas and Batang Krian rivers were also made possible by fighting the local tribes like Bukitan. Reasons for abandoning headhunting are: * Suppression of headhunting and piracy through punitive expeditions and enactment of relevant laws by the colonial governments such by Brooke in Sarawak and Dutch in Kalimantan. * Peacemaking agreements at Tumbang Anoi, Kalimantan in 1874 and Kapit, Sarawak in 1924. * Coming of Christianity, with education where Dayaks are taught that headhunting is murder and against the Christian Bible's teachings. * Dayaks' own realisation that headhunting was more to lose than to gain The Dayak longhouses along the Kahayan River taken in Tumbang Anoi village (c. 1894), the village witnessed the Tumbang Anoi Agreement 20 years earlier in 1874 that ended the headhunting practise by the Dayak people in Dutch Borneo (Kalimantan). Among the most prominent legacy during the colonial rule in the Dutch Borneo (present-day Kalimantan) is the Tumbang Anoi Agreement held in 1874 in Damang Batu, Central Kalimantan (the seat of the Kahayan Dayaks). It is a formal meeting that gathered all the Dayak tribes in Kalimantan for a peace resolution. In the meeting that is reputed taken several months, the Dayak people throughout the Kalimantan agreed to end the headhunting tradition as it believed the tradition caused conflict and tension between various Dayak groups. The meeting ended with a peace resolution by the Dayak people. After mass conversions to Christianity, and anti-headhunting legislation by the colonial powers was passed, the practice was banned and appeared to have disappeared. However, the Brooke-led Sarawak government, although banning unauthorized headhunting, actually allowed \\"ngayau\\" headhunting practices by the Brooke-supporting natives during state-sanctioned punitive expeditions against their own fellow people's rebellions throughout the state, thereby never really extinguished the spirit of headhunting especially among the Iban natives. The state-sanctioned troop was allowed to take heads, properties like jars and brassware, burn houses and farms, exempted from paying door taxes and in some cases, granted new territories to migrate into. This Brooke's practice was in remarkable contrast to the practice by the Dutch in the neighbouring West Kalimantan who prohibited any native participation in its punitive expeditions. Initially, James Brooke (the first Rajah of Sarawak) did engage the British Navy troop in the Battle of against the Iban and Malay of the Saribas region and the Iban of Skrang under Rentap's charge but this resulted in the Public Inquiry by the British government in Singapore. Thereafter, the Brooke government gathered a local troop who were its allies. Subsequently, the headhunting began to surface again in the mid-1940s, when the Allied Powers encouraged the practice against the Japanese Occupation of Borneo. It also slightly surged in the late 1960s when the Indonesian government encouraged Dayaks to purge Chinese from interior Kalimantan who were suspected of supporting communism in mainland China and also in the late 1990s when the Dayak started to attack Madurese emigrants in an explosion of ethnic violence. The British Empire deployed many Dayak headhunters during the Malayan Emergency against pro-independence fighters led by the Malayan Communist Party. This caused a scandal in the British parliament in 1952 when the Daily Worker published photographic evidence of British soldiers posing with said decapitated heads as trophies. Headhunting resurfaced in 1963 among Dayak soldiers during the Confrontation Campaign by President Sukarno of Indonesia against the newly created formation of Malaysia between the pre-existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak on 16 September 1963. Subsequently, Dayak trackers recruited during the Malayan Emergency against the Communists' Insurgency wanted to behead enemies killed during their military operations but disallowed by their superiors. Headhunting or human sacrifice was also practised by other tribes such as follows: * Toraja community in Sulawesi used adat Ma‚Äô Barata (human sacrifice) in Rambu Solo‚Äô ritual which is still held until the arrival of the Hindi Dutch which is a custom to honour someone with a symbol of a great warrior and bravery in a war. * In Gomo, Sumatra, there ware megalithic artefacts where one of them is \\"batu pancung\\" (beheading stone) on which to tie any captive or convicted criminals for beheading. * One distinction was their ritual practice of head hunting, once prevalent among tribal warriors in Nagaland and among the Naga tribes in Myanmar. They used to take the heads of enemies to take on their power. Agriculture, land tenure and economy Bahau Dayak performers during the Hudoq festival (Harvest festival) in Samarinda, the Residency of South and East Kalimantan, Dutch East Indies (present-day East Kalimantan, Indonesia). (Taken c. 1898‚Äì1900) Traditionally, Dayak agriculture was based on actually Integrated Indigenous Farming System. Iban Dayaks tend to plant paddy on hill slopes while Maloh Dayaks prefer flat lands as discussed by King.Victor T. King, Some aspects of Iban-Maloh contact in West Kalimantan. Agricultural Land in this sense was used and defined primarily in terms of hill rice farming, ladang (garden), and hutan (forest). According to Prof Derek Freeman in his Report on Iban Agriculture, Iban Dayaks used to practice twenty seven stages of hill rice farming once a year and their shifting cultivation practices allow the forest to regenerate itself rather than to damage the forest, thereby to ensure the continuity and sustainability of forest use and/or survival of the Iban community itself.J. D. Freeman, Report on the Iban.J. D. Freeman, Iban Agriculture. The Iban Dayaks love virgin forests for their dependency on forests but that is for migration, territorial expansion and/or fleeing enemies. Dayaks organised their labour in terms of traditionally based land holding groups which determined who owned rights to land and how it was to be used. The Iban Dayaks practice a rotational and reciprocal labour exchange called to complete works on their farms own by all families within each longhouse. The \\"green revolution\\" in the 1950s, spurred on the planting of new varieties of wetland rice amongst Dayak tribes. To get cash, Dayaks collect jungle produce for sales at markets. With the coming of cash crops, Dayaks start to plant rubber, pepper, cocoa, etc. Nowadays, some Dayaks plant oil palm on their lands while others seek employment or involve in trade. One belief is when people die hornbills come into their souls. The main dependence on subsistence and mid-scale agriculture by the Dayak has made this group active in this industry. The modern day rise in large-scale monocrop plantations such as palm oil and bananas, proposed for vast swathes of Dayak land held under customary rights, titles and claims in Indonesia, threaten the local political landscape in various regions in Borneo. Further problems continue to arise in part due to the shaping of the modern Malaysian and Indonesian nation-states on post-colonial political systems and laws on land tenure. The conflict between the state and the Dayak natives on land laws and native customary rights will continue as long as the colonial model on land tenure is used against local customary law. The main precept of land use, in local customary law, is that cultivated land is owned and held in right by the native owners, and the concept of land ownership flows out of this central belief. This understanding of adat is based on the idea that land is used and held under native domain. Invariably, when colonial rule was first felt in the Kalimantan Kingdoms, conflict over the subjugation of territory erupted several times between the Dayaks and the respective authorities. Religion and festivals Dayak chief as seen holding a spear and a Klebit Bok shield. A Native of Borneo (June 1853, X, p.60) =Kaharingan= The Dayak indigenous religion has been given the name Kaharingan, and may be said to be a form of animism. The name was coined by Tjilik Riwut in 1944 during his tenure as a Dutch colonial Resident in Sampit, Dutch East Indies. In 1945, during the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese referred Kaharingan as the religion of the Dayak people. During the New Order in the Suharto regime in 1980, the Kaharingan is registered as a form of Hinduism in Indonesia, as the Indonesian state only recognises 6 forms of religion i.e. Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism respectively. The integration of Kaharingan with Hinduism is not due to the similarities in the theological system, but due to the fact that Kaharingan is the oldest belief in Kalimantan. Unlike the development in Indonesian Kalimantan, the Kaharingan is not recognised as a religion both in Malaysian Borneo and Brunei, thus the traditional Dayak belief system is known as a form of folk animism or pagan belief on the other side of the Indonesian border. The best and still unsurpassed study of a traditional Dayak religion in Kalimantan is that of Hans Scharer, Ngaju Religion: The Conception of God among a South Borneo People; translated by Rodney Needham (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1963). The practice of Kaharingan differs from group to group, but shamans, specialists in ecstatic flight to other spheres, are central to Dayak religion, and serve to bring together the various realms of Heaven (Upper-world) and earth, and even Under-world, for example healing the sick by retrieving their souls which are journeying on their way to the Upper-world land of the dead, accompanying and protecting the soul of a dead person on the way to their proper place in the Upper-world, presiding over annual renewal and agricultural regeneration festivals, etc.See Scharer, ibid., for many examples of shamanistic soul flight, ceremonies, etc. The most detailed study of the shamanistic ritual at funerals is by Waldemar St√∂hr, Der Totenkult der Ngadju Dajak in S√ºd-Borneo. Mythen zum Totenkult und die Texte zum Tantolak Matei (Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966). Death rituals are most elaborate when a noble (kamang) dies. On particular religious occasions, the spirit is believed to descend to partake in celebration, a mark of honour and respect to past ancestors and blessings for a prosperous future. A sandung, which houses the remains of a Pesaguan Dayak in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. As the rise of Christianity within the Dayak community since the 19th century, the traditional burial based on Kaharingan belief is on the verge of extinction. =Iban religion= Among Iban Dayaks, their belief and way of life can be simply called the Iban religion () as per Jenson's book with the same title and has been written by Benedict Sandin and others extensively. It is characterized by a supreme being in the name of Bunsu (Kree) Petara who has no parents and creates everything in this world and other worlds. Under Bunsu Petara are the seven gods whose names are: Sengalang Burong as the god of war and healing, Biku Bunsu Petara as the high priest and second in command, Menjaya as the first shaman (manang) and god of medicine, Selampandai as the god of creation, Sempulang Gana as the god of agriculture and land along with Semarugah, Ini Inda/Inee/Andan as the naturally born doctor and god of justice and Anda Mara as the god of wealth. The life actions and decision-making processes of Iban Dayaks depend on divination, augury and omens. They have several methods to receive omens where omens can be obtained by deliberate seeking or chance encounters. The first method is via dream to receive charms, amulets ( or medicine () and curse () from any gods, people of Panggau Libau and Gelong and any spirits or ghosts. The second method is via animal omens (burong laba) which have long-lasting effects such as from deer barking which is quite random in nature. The third method is via bird omens (burong bisa) which have short term effects that are commonly limited to a certain farming year or a certain activity at hands. The fourth method is via pig liver divination after festival celebration At the end of critical festivals, the divination of the pig liver will be interpreted to forecast the outcome of the future or the luck of the individual who holds the festival. The fifth but not the least method is via or (self-imposed isolation) to receive amulet, curse, medicine or healing. There are seven omen birds under the charge of their chief Sengalang Burong at their longhouse named Tansang Kenyalang (Hornbill Abode), which are Ketupong (Jaloh or Kikeh or Entis) (Rufous Piculet) as the first in command, Beragai (Scarlet-rumped trogon), Pangkas (Maroon Woodpecker) on the righthand side of Sengalang Burong's family room while Bejampong (Crested Jay) as the second in command, Embuas (Banded Kingfisher), Kelabu Papau (Senabong) (Diard's Trogon) and Nendak (White-rumped shama) on the lefthand side. The calls and flights of the omen birds along with the circumstances and social status of the listeners are considered during the omen interpretations. The praying and propitiation to certain gods to obtain good omens which indicate God's favour and blessings are held in a series of three-tiered classes of minor ceremonies (), intermediate rites ( or ) and major festivals () in ascending order and complexity. Any Iban Dayak will undergo some forms of simple rituals and several elaborate festivals as necessary in their lifetime from a baby, adolescent to adulthood until death. The longhouse where the Iban Dayaks stay is constructed in a unique way to function as for both living or accommodation purposes and ritual or religious practices. Nearby the longhouse, there is normally a small and simple hut called langkau ampun/sukor (forgiveness/thanksgiving hut) built to place offerings to deities. Sometimes, when potentially bad omens are encountered, a small hut is quickly built and a fire is started before saying prayers to seek good outcomes. A Hudoq mask, performed mainly in the Hudoq festival in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Held in September‚ÄìOctober each year, the event is celebrated as a harvest festival by the Bahau, Busang, Modang, Ao'heng and Penihing Dayak groups in Mahakam river basin. Common among all these propitiations are that prayers to gods and/or other spirits are made by giving offerings (\\"piring\\"), certain poetic leka main and animal sacrifices (\\"genselan\\") either chickens or pigs. The number (leka or turun) of each piring offering item is based on ascending odd numbers which have meanings and purposes as below: * piring 1 for piring jari (feeding) * piring 3 for piring ampun (mercy) or seluwak (wastefulness spirit) * piring 5 for piring minta (request) or bejalai (journey) * piring 7 for piring gawai (festival) or bujang berani (brave warrior) * piring 9 for sangkong (including others) or turu (leftover included) contains offering of various traditional foods and drinks while is made by sacrificing chickens for bird omens or pigs for animal omens. is commonly held for any general purposes before holding any rites or festivals during which a simple ceremony is done to prepare and divide offerings into certain portions followed by a (prayer and cleansing) poetic speeches. This most simple ceremonies have categories such as held at the longhouse family room, performed at the family ruai gallery, (cleansing) carried out at the and river, (request for rain or sunniness). The intermediate and medium-sized propitiatory rites are known as (ritually working) with its main highlight called (poetic incantation) that is recited by bards besides miring ceremonies. This category is smaller than or sometimes relegated from the full-scaled and thus costly festivals for cost savings but still maintaining the effectiveness to achieve the same purpose. Included in this category are \\"sandau ari\\" (mid-day ritual) held at the tanju verandah, (unripe feast), (luck feast), (head feast) and (life caring feasts. The major festivals comprise at least seventh categories which are related to major aspects of Iban's traditional way of life i.e. agriculture, headhunting, fortune, health, death, procreation and weaving. With paddy being the major sustenance of life among Dayaks, so the first major category comprises the agricultural-related festivals which are dedicated to paddy farming to honour Sempulang Gana who is the deity of agriculture. It is a series of festivals that include Gawai Batu (Whetstone Festival), Gawai Ngalihka Tanah (Soil Ploughing Festival), Gawai Benih (Seed Festival), Gawai Ngemali Umai (Farm Healing Festival), Gawai Matah (Harvest Initiation Festival) and Gawai Basimpan (Paddy Storing Festival). According to Derek Freeman, there are 27 steps of hill paddy farming. One common ritual activity is called \\"mudas\\" (making good) any omens found during any farming stages, especially the early bush clearing stage. The second category includes the headhunting-related festivals to honour the most powerful deity of war, Sengalang Burong that comprises Gawai Burong (Bird Festival) and Gawai Amat/Asal (Real/Original Festival) with their successive ascending stages with most famous one being Gawai Kenyalang (Hornbill Festival). This is perhaps the most elaborate and complex festivals which can last into seven successive days of ritual incantation by lemambang bards. It is held normally after instructed by spirits in dreams. It is performed by tuai kayau (raid leader) called bujang berani (leading warriors) and war leader (tuai serang) who are known as \\"raja berani\\" (bravery king). In the past, this festival is vital to seek divine intervention to defeat enemies such as Baketan, Ukit and Kayan during migrations into new territories. The Islamised Bakumpai Dayak that mainly concentrated in Barito River system, South Kalimantan. (photo taken circa 1920s) With the suppression of headhunting, the next important and third category relates to the death-related rituals among which the biggest celebration is the Soul Festival (Gawai Antu) to honour the souls of the dead especially the famous and brave ones who are invited to visit the living for the Sebayan (Haedes) to feast and to bestow all sorts of helpful charms to the living relatives. The (brave king) can be honoured by his descendants up to three times via Gawai Antu. Other mortuary ceremonies are (flower separation) held three days after burial, (mourning termination), () or (entombing festival). The fourth category in term of complexity and importance is the fortune-related festivals which consist of Gawai Pangkong Tiang (Post Banging Festival) after transferring to a new longhouse, Gawai Tuah (Luck Festival) with three ascending stages to seek and to welcome lucks, and Gawai Tajau (Jar Festival) to welcome newly acquired jars. The fifth category consists of the health-related festivals to request for curing from sickness by Menjaya or Ini Andan such as in Gawai Sakit (Sickness Festival) which is held after other smaller attempts have failed to cure the sicked persons such as (touching), (various manang rituals), (to ask Keling for curing via magical power) and (to ask for curing by ) in the ascending order. Manang is consecrated via an official ceremony called (Manang Consecration Festival). The shaman () of the Iban Dayaks have various types of (ritual healing ceremony) to be held in accordance with the types of sickness determined by him through his glassy stone to see the whereabouts of the soul of the sick person. Besides, Gawai Burung can also be used for healing certain difficult-to-cure sickness via magical power by Sengalang Burong especially nowadays after headhunting has been stopped. Other self-caring ritual ceremonies that are related to wellness and longevity are (hair adding ceremony), (destiny ceremony) and (life-bamboo ceremony). The sixth category of festivals pertains to procreation. Gawai Lelabi (River Turtle Festival) is held to pray to the deity of creation called Selampadani, to announce the readiness of daughters for marriage and to solicit a suitable suitor. This is where those men with trophy head skulls become leading contenders. The wedding ceremony is called Melah Pinang (Areca nut Splitting). The god of creation Selampandai is invoked here for the fertility of the daughters to bear many children. There is a series of ritual rites from birth to adolescence of children. The Dayak tribe during an Erau ceremony in Tenggarong, Dutch Borneo The last and seventh category is Gawai Ngar (Cotton-Dyeing Festival) which is held by women who are involved in weaving for conventional use and ritual purposes. Ritual textiles woven by Iban women are used in the Bird Festival and in the past used to receive trophy heads. The ritual textiles have specific (anthropomorphic) motifs that represent (trophy head), (shrine pole), cultural heroes of Panggau and Gelong, deities and (demon figure). Over the last two centuries, some Dayaks converted to Christianity, abandoned certain cultural rites and ancestors practices. All Dayak God and Deity has been labeled as mythology and converted Dayak Christian are not allowed to worship this Dayak's God and Deity indirectly making Dayak people had forgotten their original religion and ritual. Christianity was introduced by European missionaries in Borneo. Religious differences between Muslim and Christian natives of Borneo has led, at various times, to communal tensions. Relations, however between all religious groups are generally good. Many Christian Dayak has changed their name to European name but some minority still maintain their ancestors' traditional names. Since Iban has been converted to Christianity, some of them abandoned their ancestors' beliefs such as 'Miring' or celebrate 'Gawai Antu' but many celebrate only Christianized traditional festivals. However, some think there is no need to abandon their tribal beliefs to be replaced by new religions which may lead to loss of their identity and culture. They require only the appropriate modernization of their way of life to be in sync with the development and progress of contemporary time. Despite the destruction of pagan religions in Europe by Christians, most of the people who try to conserve the Dayaks' religion are local people and certain missionaries. For example, Reverend William Howell contributed numerous articles on the Iban language, lore and culture between 1909 and 1910 to the Sarawak Gazette. The articles were later compiled in a book in 1963 entitled, The Sea Dayaks and Other Races of Sarawak. Bidayuh or Klemantan celebrates Gawai Padi (Paddy Festival) or Gawai Adat Naik Dingo (Paddy Storing Festival.

Original watercolour painting by Carl Schwaner, 1853. Dayak Festival in a traditional Longhouse, 1846, Dutch Borneo. Kinship in Dayak society is traced in both lines of genealogy (). Although, in Dayak Iban society, men and women possess equal rights in status and property ownership, political office has strictly been the occupation of the traditional Iban patriarch. There is a council of elders in each longhouse. Overall, Dayak leadership in any given region, is marked by titles, a Penghulu for instance would have invested authority on behalf of a network of Tuai Rumah's and so on to a Pemancha, Pengarah to Temenggung in the ascending order while Panglima or Orang Kaya (Rekaya) are titles given by Malays to some Dayaks. Individual Dayak groups have their social and hierarchy systems defined internally, and these differ widely from Ibans to Ngajus and Benuaqs to Kayans. In Sarawak, Temenggong Koh Anak Jubang was the first paramount chief of Dayaks in Sarawak and followed by Tun Temenggong Jugah Anak Barieng who was one of the main signatories for the formation of Federation of Malaysia between Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak with Singapore expelled later on. He was said to be the \\"bridge between Malaya and East Malaysia\\". The latter was fondly called \\"Apai\\" by others, which means father. He received no western or formal education. The most salient feature of Dayak social organisation is the practice of Longhouse domicile. This is a structure supported by hardwood posts that can be hundreds of metres long, usually located along a terraced river bank. At one side is a long communal platform, from which the individual households can be reached. The Iban of the Kapuas and Sarawak have organised their Longhouse settlements in response to their migratory patterns. Iban longhouses vary in size, from those slightly over 100 metres in length to large settlements over 500 metres in length. Longhouses have a door and apartment for every family living in the longhouse. For example, a longhouse of 200 doors is equivalent to a settlement of 200 families. The tuai rumah (long house chief) can be aided by a tuai burong (bird leader), tuai umai (farming leader) and a manang (shaman). Nowadays, each long house will have a Security and Development Committee and ad hoc committee will be formed as and when necessary for example during festivals such as Gawai Dayak. The Dayaks are peace-loving people who live based on customary rules or adat asal which govern each of their main activities. The adat is administered by the tuai rumah aided by the Council of Elders in the longhouse so that any dispute can be settled amicably among the dwellers themselves via berandau (discussion). If no settlement can be reached at the longhouse chief level, then the dispute will escalate to a more senior leader in the region or pengulu (district chief) level in modern times and so on. Among the main sections of customary adat of the Iban Dayaks are as follows: * (House building rule) * (Marriage, adultery and divorce rule) * (Child bearing and raising rule) * (Agricultural and land use rule) * (Headhunting rule) and adapt ngintu anti Pala (headskull keeping) * (Hunting, fishing, fruit and honey collection rule) * (Widow/widower, mourning and soul separation rule) * (festival rule) * (Order of life in the longhouse rule) * (Weaving, past times, dance and music rule) * (Bird and animal omen, dream and pig liver rule) * (Journey rule) The Dayak life centres on the paddy planting activity every year. The Iban Dayak has their own year-long calendar with 12 consecutive months which are one month later than the Roman calendar. The months are named in accordance to the paddy farming activities and the activities in between. Other than paddy, also planted in the farm are vegetables like , pumpkin, round brinjal, cucumber, corn, and other food sources like tapioca, sugarcane, sweet potatoes and finally after the paddy has been harvested, cotton is planted which takes about two months to complete its cycle. The cotton is used for weaving before commercial cotton is traded. Fresh lands cleared by each Dayak family will belong to that family and the longhouse community can also use the land with permission from the owning family. Usually, in one riverine system, a special tract of land is reserved for the use by the community itself to get natural supplies of wood, rattan and other wild plants which are necessary for building houses, boats, coffins and other living purposes, and also to leave living space for wild animals which is a source of meat. Beside farming, Dayaks plant fruit trees like kepayang, dabai, rambutan, langsat, durian, isu, nyekak and mangosteen near their longhouses or on their land plots to mark their ownership of the land. They also grow plants which produce dyes for colouring their cotton treads if not taken from the wild forest. Major fishing using the tuba root is normally done by the whole longhouse as the river may take some time to recover. Any wild meat obtained will be distributed according to a certain customary law which specifies the game catcher will the head or horn and several portions of the game while others would get an equally divided portion each. This rule allows every family a chance to supply of meat which is the main source of protein. Headhunting was an important part of Dayak culture, in particular to the Iban and Kenyah. The origin of headhunting in Iban Dayaks can be traced to the story of a chief name Serapoh who was asked by a spirit to obtain a fresh head to open a mourning jar but unfortunately he killed a Kantu boy which he got by exchanging with a jar for this purpose for which the Kantu retaliated and thus starting the headhunting practice. There used to be a tradition of retaliation for old headhunts, which kept the practice alive. External interference by the reign of the Brooke Rajahs in Sarawak via \\"bebanchak babi\\" (peacemaking) in Kapit and the Dutch in Kalimantan Borneo via peacemaking at Tumbang Anoi curtailed and limited this tradition. Apart from mass raids, the practice of headhunting was then limited to individual retaliation attacks or the result of chance encounters. Early Brooke Government reports describe Dayak Iban and Kenyah War parties with captured enemy heads. At various times, there have been massive coordinated raids in the interior and throughout coastal Borneo before and after the arrival of the Raj during Brooke's reign in Sarawak. The Ibans' journey along the coastal regions using a large boat called \\"bandong\\" with sails made of leaves or cloths may have given rise to the term, Sea Dayak, although, throughout the 19th Century, Sarawak Government raids and independent expeditions appeared to have been carried out as far as Brunei, Mindanao, East coast Malaya, Jawa and Celebes. Cock fighting is a favourite amusement of the Sea Dayaks, or Ibans Tandem diplomatic relations between the Sarawak Government (Brooke Rajah) and Britain (East India Company and the Royal Navy) acted as a pivot and a deterrence to the former's territorial ambitions, against the Dutch administration in the Kalimantan regions and client sultanates. In the Indonesian region, toplessness was the norm among the Dayak people, Javanese, and the Balinese people of Indonesia before the introduction of Islam and contact with Western cultures. In Javanese and Balinese societies, women worked or rested comfortably topless. Among the Dayak, only big breasted women or married women with sagging breasts cover their breasts because they interfered with their work. Once marik empang (top cover over the shoulders) and later shirts are available, toplessness has been abandoned.Hans Peter Duerr. \\"Der Mythos vom Zivilisationsproze√ü 4. Der erotische Leib\\" Metal-working is elaborately developed in making (machetes ‚Äì in Malay and Indonesian). The blade is made of a softer iron, to prevent breakage, with a narrow strip of a harder iron wedged into a slot in the cutting edge for sharpness in a process called (iron-smithing). In headhunting it was necessary to be able to draw the quickly. For this purpose, the is fairly short, which also better serves the purpose of trailcutting in dense forest. It is holstered with the cutting edge facing upwards and at that side there is an upward protrusion on the handle, so it can be drawn very quickly with the side of the hand without having to reach over and grasp the handle first. The hand can then grasp the handle while it is being drawn. The combination of these three factors (short, cutting edge up and protrusion) makes for an extremely fast drawing-action. The ceremonial used for dances are as beautifully adorned with feathers, as are the costumes. There are various terms to describe different types of Dayak blades. The Nyabor is the traditional Iban Scimitar, Parang Ilang is common to Kayan and Kenyah Swordsmiths, pedang is a sword with a metallic handle and Duku is a multipurpose farm tool and machete of sorts. Normally, the sword is accompanied by a wooden shield called a which is decorated with a demon face to scare off the enemy. Another weapons are (spear) and (blowpipe) with lethal poison at the tip of its laja. To protect the upper body during combat, a (armour) which is made of animal hard skin such as leopards is worn over the shoulders via a hole made for the head to enter. Dayaks normally build their longhouses on high posts on high ground where possible for protection. They also may build kuta (fencing) and kubau (fort) where necessary to defend against enemy attacks. Dayaks also possess some brass and cast iron weaponry such as brass cannon (bedil) and iron cast cannon meriam. Furthermore, Dayaks are experienced in setting up animal traps (peti) which can be used for attacking enemy as well. The agility and stamina of Dayaks in jungles give them advantages. However, at the end, Dayaks were defeated by handguns and disunity among themselves against the colonialists. Dayaks carry their babies in baskets or carriers such as this one. The motifs on the beaded panel and the additional embellishments such as shells, claws etc. are meant for the protection of the child. Courtesy of the Wovensouls Collection, Singapore Most importantly, Dayaks will seek divine helps to grant them protection in the forms of good dreams or curses by spirits, charms such as (normally poisonous), empelias (weapon straying away) and engkerabun (hidden from normal human eyes), animal omens, bird omens, good divination in the pig liver or by purposely seeking supernatural powers via or or (learning knowledge) especially kebal (weapon-proof). During headhunting days, those going to farms will be protected by warriors themselves and big agriculture is also carried out via labour exchange called (which means a large number of people working together) until completion of the agricultural activity. Kalingai or pantang (tattoo) is made unto bodies to protect from dangers and other signifying purposes such as travelling to certain places. The traditional Iban Dayak male attire consists of a sirat (loincloth) attached with a small mat for sitting), lelanjang (headgear with colourful bird feathers) or a turban (a long piece of cloth wrapped around the head), marik (chain) around the neck, engkerimok (ring on thigh) and simpai (ring on the upper arms). The Iban Dayak female traditional attire comprises a short \\"kain tenun betating\\" (a woven cloth attached with coins and bells at the bottom end), a rattan or brass ring corset, selampai (long scarf) or marik empang (beaded top cover), sugu tinggi (high comb made of silver), simpai (bracelets on upper arms), tumpa (bracelets on lower arms) and buah pauh (fruits on hand).http://www.miricommunity.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t;=35112 The Dayaks especially Ibans appreciate and treasure very much the value of pua kumbu (woven or tied cloth) made by women while ceramic jars which they call tajau obtained by men. Pua kumbu has various motives for which some are considered sacred. Tajau has various types with respective monetary values. The jar is a sign of good fortune and wealth. It can also be used to pay fines if some adat is broken in lieu of money which is hard to have in the old days. Beside the jar being used to contain rice or water, it is also used in ritual ceremonies or festivals and given as baya (provision) to the dead. The adat tebalu (widow or widower fee) for deceased women for Iban Dayaks will be paid according to her social standing and weaving skills and for the men according to his achievements in lifetime. Dayaks being accustomed to living in jungles and hard terrains, and knowing the plants and animals are extremely good at following animals trails while hunting and of course tracking humans or enemies, thus some Dayaks became very good trackers in jungles in the military e.g. some Iban Dayaks were engaged as trackers during the anti-confrontation by Indonesia against the formation of Federation of Malaysia and anti- communism in Malaysia itself. No doubt, these survival skills are obtained while doing activities in the jungles, which are then utilised for headhunting in the old days.

The team was known as MN 1001, with 17 October was celebrated annually as a special day for the Indonesian Air Force Paskhas, which traces its origins to that pioneer paratroop operation in Borneo. Politics=Kalimantan= Organised Dayak political representation in the Indonesian State first appeared during the Dutch administration, in the form of the Dayak Unity Party (Parti Persatuan Dayak) in the 1930s and 1940s. The feudal Sultanates of Kutai, Banjar and Pontianak figured prominently prior to the rise of the Dutch colonial rule. Political circumstances aside, the Dayaks in the Indonesian side actively organised under various associations beginning with the Dayak League (Sarekat Dayak) established in 1919 in Banjarmasin, to the Partai Dayak in the 1940s, which serves as an early Pan-Dayakism in Indonesia and to the present day, where Dayaks occupy key positions in government. The violent massacre of the Malay sultans, local rulers, intellectuals and politicians by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Pontianak incidents of 1943‚Äì1944 in West Borneo (present-day West Kalimantan province) created a social opportunity for the Dayak people in the West Kalimantan political and administrative system during the Orde Lama era in the Sukarno regime, as a generation of predominantly Malay administrator in West Borneo was lost during the genocide perpetrated by the Japanese. The Dayak ruling elite were mostly left unscratched due to the fact that they were then mainly located in the hinterland and because the Japanese were not interested, thus giving an advantage for the Dayak leaders to fill the administrative and political position after the Indonesian independence. In the 1955 Indonesian Constituent Assembly election, the Dayak Unity Party managed to gain: * 146,054 votes (0.4% of the nationwide vote) ** One seat in the People's Representative Council from West Kalimantan * 33.1% of the votes in West Kalimantan (becoming the second largest political party after Masjumi) ** the party attained 9 out of 29 seats in the West Kalimantan Regional Representative Council. * 1.5% votes in Central Kalimantan (the party managed to obtain 6.9% of the vote in the Dayak-majority areas in the province) The party was later disbanded after an order by the then-president Sukarno that prohibited an ethnic-based party. The members of the party were then continued their careers in other political parties. Oevaang Oerey joined the Indonesian Party (Partai Indonesia), whilst some others joined the Catholic Party (Partai Katolik). Among the most prominent Indonesian Dayak politician is Tjilik Riwut, a member of Central Indonesian National Committee, he was honoured as the National Hero of Indonesia (Gelar Pahlawan Nasional Indonesia) in 1998 for his major contribution during the Indonesian National Revolution. He had served as the Central Kalimantan Governor between 1958 and 1967. While in 1960, Oevaang Oeray was appointed as the 3rd Governor of West Kalimantan, becoming the first governor of Dayak origin in the province. He held the office until 1966. He is also known as one of the founding fathers of Dayak Unity Party in 1945 and had been actively assisting the Brunei Revolt in 1962 during the height of Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. Under Indonesia, Kalimantan is now divided into five self-autonomous provinces i.e. North, West, East, South and Central Kalimantan. Under Indonesia's transmigration programme, which was initiated by the Dutch in 1905, settlers from densely populated Java and Madura were encouraged to settle in the Indonesian provinces of Borneo. The large-scale transmigration projects continued following Indonesian independence, causing social strains. In 2001 the Indonesian government ended the transmigration of Javanese settlement of Indonesian Borneo. During the killings of 1965‚Äì66 Dayaks killed up to 5,000 Chinese and forced survivors to flee to the coast and camps. Starvation killed thousands of Chinese children who were under eight years old. The Chinese refused to fight back, since they considered themselves \\"a guest on other people's land\\" with the intention of trading only. 75,000 of the Chinese who survived were displaced, fleeing to camps where they were detained on coastal cities. The Dayak leaders were interested in cleansing the entire area of ethnic Chinese. In Pontianak, 25,000 Chinese living in dirty, filthy conditions were stranded. They had to take baths in mud. The massacres are considered a \\"dark chapter in recent Dayak history\\". From 1996 to 2003 there were violent attacks on Indonesian Madurese settlers, including executions of Madurese transmigrant communities. The violence included the 1999 Sambas riots and the Sampit conflict in 2001 in which more than 500 were killed in that year. Order was restored by the Indonesian Military. =Sarawak= Dayaks political representation in Sarawak compare very poorly with their organised brethren in the Indonesian side of Borneo, partly due to the personal fiefdom that was the Brooke Rajah dominion, and possibly to the pattern of their historical migrations from the Indonesian part to the then pristine Rajang Basin. Reconstituted into British crown colony after the end of Japanese occupation in World War II, Sarawak obtained independence from the British on 22 July 1963, alongside Sabah (North Borneo) on 31 August 1963, and would join the Federation of Malaya and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 under the belief of being equal partners in the \\"marriage\\" as per the 18 and 20-point agreements and the Malaysia Agreement of 1963. Dayak political activism in Sarawak had its roots in the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) and Parti Pesaka Anak Sarawak (PESAKA) during post-independence construction in the 1960s. These parties shaped to a certain extent Dayak politics in the state, although never enjoying the real privileges and benefits of Chief Ministerial power relative to its large electorate due to their own political disunity with some Dayaks joining various political parties instead of consolidating inside one single political party. It appears that this political disunity is caused by the fact of inter-ethnic and intra- ethnic warfares among the various Dayaks ethnic groups in their past history that led to political rivalries at the loss of the whole Dayak people's power. The Dayaks need to forget their past, close ranks to unite under one umbrella party and prioritize the whole Dayak interests above all personal interests. The first Sarawak Chief Minister was Datuk Stephen Kalong Ningkan, who was removed as the chief minister in 1966 after court proceedings and amendments to both Sarawak state constitution and Malaysian federal constitution due to some disagreements with Malaya with regards to the 18-point Agreement as conditions for the formation of Malaysia. Datuk Penghulu Tawi Sli was appointed as the second Sarawak chief minister who was a soft-spoken seat- warmer fellow and then replaced by Tuanku Abdul Rahman Ya'kub (a Melanau Muslim) as the third Sarawak chief minister in 1970 who in turn was succeeded by Abdul Taib Mahmud (a Melanau Muslim) in 1981 as fourth Sarawak chief minister. After Taib Mahmud resigned on 28 February 2014 to become the next Sarawak's governor, he appointed his brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, as the next Sarawak Chief Minister, who has in turn been succeeded by Abang Johari Openg in 2017. Wave of Dayakism which is Dayak nationalism has surfaced at least thrice among the Dayaks in Sarawak while they are on the opposition side of politics as follows: * Sarawak Alliance made up of SNAP and PESAKA managed to win the Sarawak Local Council Election in 1963 over the opposition pact of SUPP and PANAS, proceeding to make Stephen Kalong Ningkan as the first Sarawak Chief Minister and signing up of the Malaysia Agreement at London in 1963. * SNAP won 18 seats (with 42.70% popular vote) out of total 48 seats in Sarawak state election, 1974 while the remaining 30 seats won by Sarawak National Front. This resulted in the first Iban becoming the Opposition Leader in the Malaysian Parliament i.e. Datuk Sri Edmund Langgu being the leading Iban MP from SNAP with the SNAP president James Wong being detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA). * PBDS (Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak), a breakaway of SNAP in Sarawak state election in 1987 won 15 seats while its partner Permas only won 5 seats. Overall, the Sarawak National Front won 28 constituencies with PBB 14; SUPP 11 and SNAP 3. In both cases, SNAP and PBDS (now both party are defunct) had joined the Malaysian National Front as the ruling coalition. The Dayak people are still struggling to unite under one political force, perhaps due to self-enrichment of joining politics, different riverine geographical origins and past intra- and inter-tribal wars among themselves. However, the Dayak themselves fail to recognize this weakness in their political strategy. A full treatment of Dayak politics is studied by Jawan Jayum in his PhD thesis.

Published since 1974, El Vocero was at first the third of the four largest Puerto Rico newspapers, trailing El Mundo and El Nuevo D√≠a and leading El Reportero and The San Juan Star in sales. With the temporary demise in the late 1980s of El Mundo, El Vocero became even more popular, becoming the island's second largest newspaper. From 1985 to 2013 it was owned by Caribbean International News Corp.http://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el- vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html The owners of Caribbean International News Corp, and therefore owners of El Vocero, were Elliot Stein, I. Martin Pompadur and The Henry Crown Co. In the beginning, El Vocero was known as a sensationalist tabloid that dramatized all the violent news. Writers included Tomas De Jesus Mangual and others. However, in the early 2000s, the newspaper changed its direction, becoming a mainstream newspaper, adding a much broader coverage of entertainment as well as business related news, and carrying more political news, as in the situation in Vieques. In addition to its regular news section, El Vocero also has business, entertainment, sports, and travel sections. On April 8, 2007, Gaspar Roca, the paper's founding publisher and editor in chief died due to respiratory arrest. He was replaced by his son Miguel Roca. As of January 2011 Miguel Roca was no longer working at the newspaper, and was replaced by a San Juan-based construction lawyer named Peter Miller. Due to financial difficulties, in December 2013 El Vocero went bankrupt (Chapter 7). The new owner and publisher is Publi-Inversiones, formed by a group of local entrepreneurs. https://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el- vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html First free newspaper In July 31, 2012, El Vocero changed its format, becoming the first free daily circulation newspaper in Puerto Rico. Later on other free daily newspapers were introduced, including the Swedish-owned Metro newspaper http://www.metro.pr/locales/llega-a-la-isla-nuestro-periodico- metro/pGXljy!U4tUa7roPeSM/ as well as the GFR Media-owned Indice.http://www.elnuevodia.com/gfrmedialanzanuevaplataformacomercial-1351933.html Vocero was well received by its readers, and its circulation grew. As soon as Vocero went free, a newspaper war ensued. First, the San Juan Star, which is distributed by Vocero‚Äôs competitors, GFR Media, accused Vocero of being financed by the government. At the same time, another GFR Media paper, Primera Hora, launched a media campaign squarely directed at Vocero, titled ‚ÄúEl Que No Tiene La Voz del Pueblo No Vale Na‚Äô‚Äù.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=762-CoPx7xs A couple of months later, however, GFR Media launched its own free paper, Indice. In October 2012, GFR‚Äôs flagship newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, published an investigation in which it claimed that El Vocero was financed by the government. At the same time, El Vocero published its own series of articles demonstrating how the Ferre family had used the government to obtain financing for its own enterprises. Controversial financing by the government The newspaper has been characterized as propaganda for the New Progressive Party since El Vocero allegedly received funds from the 2009 to 2013 NPP-controlled central government. According to an investigation by El Voceros main competitor, the newspaper El Nuevo D√≠a, the company has received more than $24.9 million, even when it had a debt of $21,141,200 in taxes. El Voceros editor-in-chief responded by stating that neither the newspaper nor its parent company have received government funds through any means, and dismissed El Nuevo D√≠a's allegations as part of a series of attacks driven by the newspaper's new-found success as a free publication. A new EL VOCERO since 2013 In 2013, a group of businessmen from Puerto Rico acquired the rights to the name of the publication EL VOCERO and took it upon themselves to keep the publication alive. On the first of December of that same year, the newspaper was re- launched with a new editorial philosophy and a new design. The daily newspaper EL VOCERO was originally founded in 1974 and, due to it being part of a foreign investment fund, was managed under a different structure. It is published in San Juan, Monday through Friday, and it is distributed completely free across 4,500 establishments and 100 traffic light intersections in the 78 municipalities. Apart from the printed version being available five days a week, there is a digital daily newspaper published every day, including Saturdays and Sundays. According to Gaither International, a market research firm, and its MBP analysis of 18+ readership, EL VOCERO is the most read newspaper in Puerto Rico, Mondays through Fridays. EL VOCERO of Puerto Rico has maintained its domain in the news industry by being the newspaper with the biggest circulation on the island, with more than 154 thousand printed copies audited by the Certified Audit Circulation (CAC). On Thursdays, the number of copies increases to 215 thousand. In addition to the printed copies, there are 100,000 digital subscribers who receive the newspaper through their email every morning. Since 2013, EL VOCERO and its employees have been managed by Publi-Inversiones Puerto Rico, Inc. Under the direction of experienced managers, EL VOCERO has solidified its honest and responsible editorial policy, and it has strengthened its compromise with the well-being of Puerto Rican families. Through its journalistic investigations that have uncovered improper actions and schemes of fraud, the publication is characterized by its role as an oversight body of the Government and public finances. Its investigation of the ‚ÄúPetroleum Cartel,\\" for example, revealed how members of The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had been taking advantage of the fuel business and enriching themselves through commissions and bribes for over a decade. The newspaper is staffed with a robust team of journalists experts in politics, law and order, government, economics, sports, entertainment, gastronomy, travel and more, making EL VOCERO a publication with complete and objective coverage of the news on the island. It is available to readers for free through its printed copy and digital replica, its webpage elvocero.com, its mobile app, and its social media pages. Aside from the daily newspaper, the publication also produces three magazines. Zona, which is marketed for men, and M√≠rame Siempre, which covers social events, fashion, and philanthropy, are sold monthly at a cost of $2.50. Bienestar Total, dedicated to health and lifestyle, is distributed for free on a quarterly basis in medical offices, hospitals, gymnasiums, and in other points of interests. El VOCERO‚Äôs central offices are located on 1064, Avenida Ponce de Le√≥n, San Juan, Puerto Rico.http://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el- vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html ReferencesExternal links * Official site * Category:1974 establishments in Puerto Rico Category:Mass media in San Juan, Puerto Rico Category:Spanish-language newspapers published in Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican brands ","title":"El Vocero"},{"id":"170712","text":"Events in the year 1897 in music.

He was Minister of National Defense from 1944 to 1951, and the second democratically elected President of Guatemala, from 1951 to 1954. He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history. The landmark program of agrarian reform √Årbenz enacted as president was very influential across Latin America. √Årbenz was born in 1913 to a wealthy family, son of a Swiss German father and a Guatemalan mother. He graduated with high honors from a military academy in 1935, and served in the army until 1944, quickly rising through the ranks. During this period, he witnessed the violent repression of agrarian laborers by the United States-backed dictator Jorge Ubico, and was personally required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners, an experience that contributed to his progressive views. In 1938 he met and married Mar√≠a Vilanova, who was a great ideological influence on him, as was Jos√© Manuel Fortuny, a Guatemalan communist. In October 1944 several civilian groups and progressive military factions led by √Årbenz and Francisco Arana rebelled against Ubico's repressive policies. In the elections that followed, Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo was elected president, and began a highly popular program of social reform. √Årbenz was appointed Minister of Defense, and played a crucial role in putting down a military coup in 1949. After the death of Arana, √Årbenz contested the presidential elections that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, by a margin of over 50%. He took office on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. His policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and √Årbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. √Årbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an apology for √Årbenz's overthrow. Early life Arbenz's parents, Hans Jakob Arbenz and Octavia Guzm√°n Caballeros √Årbenz was born in Quetzaltenango, the second-largest city in Guatemala, in 1913. He was the son of a Swiss German pharmacist, Hans Jakob Arbenz Gr√∂bli, who immigrated to Guatemala in 1901. His mother, Octavia Guzm√°n Caballeros, was a Ladino woman from a middle-class family who worked as a primary school teacher. His family was relatively wealthy and upper-class; his childhood has been described as \\"comfortable\\". At some point during his childhood, his father became addicted to morphine and began to neglect the family business. He eventually went bankrupt, forcing the family to move to a rural estate that a wealthy friend had set aside for them \\"out of charity\\". Jacobo had originally desired to be an economist or an engineer, but since the family was now impoverished, he could not afford to go to a university. He initially did not want to join the military, but there was a scholarship available through the Escuela Polit√©cnica for military cadets. He applied, passed all of the entrance exams, and entered as a cadet in 1932. His father committed suicide two years after √Årbenz entered the academy. Military career and marriage √Årbenz seated next to his wife Maria Cristina Vilanova in 1944. His wife was a great ideological influence upon him, and they shared a desire for social reform. √Årbenz excelled in the academy, and was deemed \\"an exceptional student\\". He became \\"first sergeant\\", the highest honor bestowed upon cadets; only six people received the honor from 1924 to 1944. His abilities earned him an unusual level of respect among the officers at the school, including Major John Considine, the US director of the school, and of other US officers who served at the school. A fellow officer later said that \\"his abilities were such that the officers treated him with a respect that was rarely granted to a cadet.\\" √Årbenz graduated in 1935. After graduating, he served a stint as a junior officer at Fort San Jos√© in Guatemala City and later another under \\"an illiterate Colonel\\" in a small garrison in the village of San Juan Sacatep√©quez. While at San Jos√©, √Årbenz had to lead squads of soldiers who were escorting chain gangs of prisoners (including political prisoners) to perform forced labor. The experience traumatized √Årbenz, who said he felt like a capataz (i.e., a \\"foreman\\"). During this period he first met Francisco Arana. √Årbenz was asked to fill a vacant teaching position at the academy in 1937. √Årbenz taught a wide range of subjects, including military matters, history, and physics. He was promoted to captain six years later, and placed in charge of the entire corps of cadets. His position was the third highest in the academy and was considered one of the most prestigious positions a young officer could hold. In 1938 he met his future wife Mar√≠a Vilanova, the daughter of a wealthy Salvadoran landowner and a Guatemalan mother from a wealthy family. They were married a few months later, without the approval of Mar√≠a's parents, who felt she should not marry an army lieutenant who was not wealthy. Mar√≠a was 24 at the time of the wedding, and Jacobo was 26. Mar√≠a later wrote that, while the two were very different in many ways, their desire for political change drew them together. √Årbenz stated that his wife had a great influence on him. It was through her that √Årbenz was exposed to Marxism. Mar√≠a had received a copy of The Communist Manifesto at a women's congress and left a copy of it on Jacobo's bedside table when she left for a vacation. Jacobo was \\"moved\\" by the Manifesto, and he and Mar√≠a discussed it with each other. Both felt that it explained many things they had been feeling. Afterwards, Jacobo began reading more works by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin and by the late 1940s was regularly interacting with a group of Guatemalan communists.  October revolution and defense ministership  President Jorge Ubico in the 1930s. Like his predecessors, he gave a number of concessions to the United Fruit Company and supported their harsh labor practices. He was forced out of power by a popular uprising in 1944. =Historical background= In 1871 the government of Justo Rufino Barrios passed laws confiscating the lands of the native Mayan people and compelling them to work in coffee plantations for minimal compensation. Several United States-based companies, including the United Fruit Company, received this public land, and were exempted from paying taxes. In 1929 the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won the election that followed in 1931, an election in which he was the only candidate. With the support of the United States, Ubico soon became one of Latin America's most brutal dictators. Ubico abolished the system of debt peonage introduced by Barrios and replaced it with a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure such as roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing landowners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, including allowing them to execute workers as a \\"disciplinary\\" measure. The result of these laws was a tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys. He gave away hectares of public land to the United Fruit Company, and allowed the US military to establish bases in Guatemala. =October revolution= √Årbenz, Jorge Toriello (center), and Francisco Arana (right) in 1944. The three men formed the junta that ruled Guatemala from the October Revolution until the election of Ar√©valo. In May 1944 a series of protests against Ubico broke out at the university in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on June 22, 1944. The protests, which by this point included many middle-class members and junior army officers in addition to students and workers, gained momentum, eventually forcing Ubico's resignation at the end of June. Ubico appointed a three-person junta led by General Federico Ponce Vaides to succeed him. Although Ponce Vaides initially promised to hold free elections, when the congress met on July 3, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to appoint Ponce Vaides interim president. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration were continued. Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders, who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. √Årbenz had been one of the few officers in the military to protest the actions of Ponce Vaides. Ubico had fired √Årbenz from his teaching post at the Escuela Polit√©cnica, and since then √Årbenz had been living in ElSalvador, organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. √Årbenz was one of the leaders of the plot within the army, along with Major Aldana Sandoval. √Årbenz insisted that civilians also be included in the coup, over the protests of the other military men involved. Sandoval later said that all contact with the civilians during the coup was through √Årbenz. On October 19, 1944, a small group of soldiers and students led by √Årbenz and Francisco Javier Arana attacked the National Palace in what later became known as the \\"October Revolution\\". Arana had not initially been a party to the coup, but his position of authority within the army meant that he was key to its success. They were joined the next day by other factions of the army and the civilian population. Initially, the battle went against the revolutionaries, but after an appeal for support their ranks were swelled by unionists and students, and they eventually subdued the police and army factions loyal to Ponce Vaides. On October 20, the next day, Ponce Vaides surrendered unconditionally. √Årbenz and Arana both fought with distinction during the revolt, and despite the idealistic rhetoric of the revolution, both were also offered material rewards: √Årbenz was promoted from captain to lieutenant colonel, and Arana from major to full colonel. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly. The resignation of Ponce Vaides and the creation of the junta has been considered by scholars to be the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution. However, the revolutionary junta did not immediately threaten the interests of the landed elite. Two days after Ponce Vaides' resignation, a violent protest erupted at Patzic√≠a, a small Indian hamlet. The junta responded with swift brutality, silencing the protest. The dead civilians included women and children. Elections subsequently took place in December 1944. Although only literate men were allowed to vote, the elections were broadly considered free and fair. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. The winner of the 1944 elections was a teacher named Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo, who ran under a coalition of leftist parties known as the \\"Partido Acci√≥n Revolucionaria'\\" (\\"Revolutionary Action Party\\", PAR), and won 85% of the vote. Arana did not wish to turn over power to a civilian administration. He initially tried to persuade √Årbenz and Toriello to postpone the election, and after Ar√©valo was elected, he asked them to declare the results invalid. √Årbenz and Toriello insisted that Ar√©valo be allowed to take power, which Arana reluctantly agreed to, on the condition that Arana's position as the commander of the military be unchallenged. Ar√©valo had no choice but to agree to this, and so the new Guatemalan constitution, adopted in 1945, created a new position of \\"Commander of the Armed Forces\\", a position that was more powerful than that of the defense minister. He could only be removed by Congress, and even then only if he was found to have broken the law. When Ar√©valo was inaugurated as president, Arana stepped into this new position, and √Årbenz was sworn in as defense minister. =Government of Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo= Ar√©valo described his ideology as \\"spiritual socialism\\". He was anti-communism and believed in a capitalist society regulated to ensure that its benefits went to the entire population. Ar√©valo's ideology was reflected in the new constitution that was ratified by the Guatemalan assembly soon after his inauguration, which was one of the most progressive in Latin America. It mandated suffrage for all but illiterate women, a decentralization of power, and provisions for a multiparty system. Communist parties were forbidden. Once in office, Ar√©valo implemented these and other reforms, including minimum wage laws, increased educational funding, and labor reforms. The benefits of these reforms were largely restricted to the upper-middle classes and did little for the peasant agricultural laborers who made up the majority of the population. Although his reforms were based on liberalism and capitalism, he was viewed with suspicion by the United States government, which would later portray him as a communist. When √Årbenz was sworn in as defense minister under President Ar√©valo, he became the first to hold the portfolio, since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, √Årbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist Jos√© Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found √Årbenz to be different from the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until √Årbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like √Årbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like √Årbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence √Årbenz in the future. On December 16, 1945, Ar√©valo was incapacitated for a while after a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would take the opportunity to launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later came to be known as the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Ar√©valo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back √Årbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; √Årbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees. The land reforms brought about by the Ar√©valo administration threatened the interests of the landed elite, who sought a candidate who would be more amenable to their terms. They began to prop up Arana as a figure of resistance to Ar√©valo's reforms. The summer of 1949 saw intense political conflict in the councils of the Guatemalan military between supporters of Arana and those of √Årbenz, over the choice of Arana's successor. On July 16, 1949, Arana delivered an ultimatum to Ar√©valo, demanding the expulsion of all of √Årbenz's supporters from the cabinet and the military; he threatened a coup if his demands were not met. Ar√©valo informed √Årbenz and other progressive leaders of the ultimatum; all agreed that Arana should be exiled. Two days later, Ar√©valo and Arana had another meeting; on the way back, Arana's convoy was intercepted by a small force led by √Årbenz. A shootout ensued, killing three men, including Arana. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that √Årbenz probably had orders to capture, rather than to kill, Arana. Arana's supporters in the military rose up in revolt, but they were leaderless, and by the next day the rebels asked for negotiations. The coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded. √Årbenz and a few other ministers suggested that the entire truth be made public; however, they were overruled by the majority of the cabinet, and Ar√©valo made a speech suggesting that Arana had been killed for refusing to lead a coup against the government. √Årbenz kept his silence over the death of Arana until 1968, refusing to speak out without first obtaining Ar√©valo's consent. He tried to persuade Ar√©valo to tell the entire story when the two met in Montevideo in the 1950s, during their exile: however, Ar√©valo was unwilling, and √Årbenz did not press his case. =1950 election= √Årbenz's role as defense minister had already made him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950 the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that √Årbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, as well as from labor unions. √Årbenz carefully chose the PIN as the party to nominate him. Based on the advice of his friends and colleagues, he believed it would make his candidacy appear more moderate. √Årbenz himself resigned his position as Defense Minister on February 20 and declared his candidacy for the presidency. Ar√©valo wrote him an enthusiastic personal letter in response but publicly only reluctantly endorsed him, preferring, it is thought, his friend V√≠ctor Manuel Giordani, who was then Health Minister. It was only the support √Årbenz had, and the impossibility of Giordani being elected, that led to Ar√©valo deciding to support √Årbenz. Prior to his death, Arana had planned to run in the 1950 presidential elections. His death left √Årbenz without any serious opposition in the elections (leading some, including the CIA and US military intelligence, to speculate that √Årbenz personally had him eliminated for this reason). √Årbenz had only a couple of significant challengers in the election, in a field of ten candidates. One of these was Jorge Garc√≠a Granados, supported by some members of the upper-middle class who felt the revolution had gone too far. Another was Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, who had been a general under Ubico and had the support of the hardline opponents of the revolution. During his campaign, √Årbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Ar√©valo. √Årbenz was expected to win the election comfortably because he had the support of both major political parties of the country, as well as that of the labor unions, which campaigned heavily on his behalf. In addition to political support, √Årbenz had great personal appeal. He was described as having \\"an engaging personality and a vibrant voice\\". √Årbenz's wife Mar√≠a also campaigned with him; despite her wealthy upbringing she had made an effort to speak for the interests of the Mayan peasantry and had become a national figure in her own right. √Årbenz's two daughters also occasionally made public appearances with him. The election was held on November 15, 1950, with √Årbenz winning more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were largely free and fair with the exception of the disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. √Årbenz got more than three times as many votes as the runner-up, Yd√≠goras Fuentes. Fuentes claimed electoral fraud had benefited √Årbenz, but scholars have pointed out that while fraud may possibly have given √Årbenz some of his votes, it was not the reason that he won the election. √Årbenz's promise of land reform played a large role in ensuring his victory. The election of √Årbenz alarmed US State Department officials, who stated that Arana \\"has always represented the only positive conservative element in the Ar√©valo administration\\" and that his death would \\"strengthen materially\\", and that \\"developments forecast sharp leftist trend within the government.\\" √Årbenz was inaugurated as president on March 15, 1951. Presidency Colonel Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n addressing the crowd at his inauguration as the President of Guatemala in 1951 =Inauguration and ideology= In his inaugural address, √Årbenz promised to convert Guatemala from \\"a backward country with a predominantly feudal economy into a modern capitalist state\\". He declared that he intended to reduce dependency on foreign markets and dampen the influence of foreign corporations over Guatemalan politics. He said that he would modernize Guatemala's infrastructure without the aid of foreign capital. Based on advice from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he set out to build more houses, ports, and roads. √Årbenz also set out to reform Guatemala's economic institutions; he planned to construct factories, increase mining, expand transportation infrastructure, and expand the banking system. Land reform was the centerpiece of √Årbenz's election campaign. The revolutionary organizations that had helped put √Årbenz in power kept constant pressure on him to live up to his campaign promises regarding land reform. Agrarian reform was one of the areas of policy which the Ar√©valo administration had not ventured into; when √Årbenz took office, only 2% of the population owned 70% of the land. Historian Jim Handy described √Årbenz's economic and political ideals as \\"decidedly pragmatic and capitalist in temper\\". According to historian Stephen Schlesinger, while √Årbenz did have a few communists in lower-level positions in his administration, he \\"was not a dictator, he was not a crypto-communist\\". Schlesinger described him as a democratic socialist. Nevertheless, some of his policies, particularly those involving agrarian reform, would be branded as \\"communist\\" by the Guatemalan upper class and the United Fruit Company. Historian Piero Gleijeses has argued that although √Årbenz's policies were intentionally capitalist in nature, his personal views gradually shifted towards communism. His goal was to increase Guatemala's economic and political independence, and he believed that to do this Guatemala needed to build a strong domestic economy. He made an effort to reach out to the indigenous Mayan people, and sent government representatives to confer with them. From this effort he learned that the Maya held strongly to their ideals of dignity and self-determination; inspired in part by this, he stated in 1951 that \\"If the independence and prosperity of our people were incompatible, which for certain they are not, I am sure that the great majority of Guatemalans would prefer to be a poor nation, but free, and not a rich colony, but enslaved.\\" Although the policies of the √Årbenz government were based on a moderate form of capitalism, the communist movement did grow stronger during his presidency, partly because Ar√©valo released its imprisoned leaders in 1944, and also through the strength of its teachers' union. Although the Communist party was banned for much of the Guatemalan Revolution, the Guatemalan government welcomed large numbers of communist and socialist refugees fleeing the dictatorial governments of neighboring countries, and this influx strengthened the domestic movement. In addition, √Årbenz had personal ties to some members of the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour, which was legalized during his government. The most prominent of these was Jos√© Manuel Fortuny. Fortuny played the role of friend and adviser to √Årbenz through the three years of his government, from 1951 to 1954. Fortuny wrote several speeches for √Årbenz, and in his role as agricultural secretary helped craft the landmark agrarian reform bill. Despite his position in √Årbenz's government, however, Fortuny never became a popular figure in Guatemala, and did not have a large popular following like some other communist leaders. The communist party remained numerically weak, without any representation in √Årbenz's cabinet of ministers. A handful of communists were appointed to lower-level positions in the government. √Årbenz read and admired the works of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin (before Khrushchev's report); officials in his government eulogized Stalin as a \\"great statesman and leader ... whose passing is mourned by all progressive men\\". The Guatemalan Congress paid tribute to Joseph Stalin with a \\"minute of silence\\" when Stalin died in 1953, a fact that was remarked upon by later observers. √Årbenz had several supporters among the communist members of the legislature, but they were only a small part of the government coalition. =Land reform= Farmland in the Quetzaltenango Department, in western Guatemala The biggest component of √Årbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. √Årbenz drafted the bill himself with the help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on June 17, 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. It transferred uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty-stricken laborers, who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own. √Årbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the shortage of capital more acute. The official title of the agrarian reform bill was Decree 900. It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than . If the estates were between and in size, uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The owners were compensated with government bonds, the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated. The value of the land itself was the value that the owners had declared in their tax returns in 1952. The redistribution was organized by local committees that included representatives from the landowners, the laborers, and the government. Of the nearly 350,000 private land-holdings, only 1,710 were affected by expropriation. The law itself was cast in a moderate capitalist framework; however, it was implemented with great speed, which resulted in occasional arbitrary land seizures. There was also some violence, directed at landowners as well as at peasants who had minor landholdings of their own. √Årbenz himself, a landowner through his wife, gave up of his own land in the land reform program. By June 1954, 1.4 million acres of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had received land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit to the people who received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, √Årbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. The law also included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities. Contrary to the predictions made by detractors of the government, the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity, and to an increase in cultivated area. Purchases of farm machinery also increased. Overall, the law resulted in a significant improvement in living standards for many thousands of peasant families, the majority of whom were indigenous people. Gleijeses stated that the injustices corrected by the law were far greater than the injustice of the relatively few arbitrary land seizures. Historian Greg Grandin stated that the law was flawed in many respects; among other things, it was too cautious and deferential to the planters, and it created communal divisions among peasants. Nonetheless, it represented a fundamental power shift in favor of those that had been marginalized before then. In 1953 the reform was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but the Guatemalan Congress later impeached four judges associated with the ruling. =Relationship with the United Fruit Company= Route Map of the Great White Fleet of the United Fruit Company. The company had held the monopoly of freight and passenger maritime transportation to and from Puerto Barrios in Guatemala since 1903. Map of railway lines in Guatemala and El Salvador. The lines were owned by the IRCA, the subsidiary of the United Fruit Company that controlled the railroad in both countries; the only Atlantic port was controlled by the Great White Fleet, also a UFC subsidiary. The relationship between √Årbenz and the United Fruit Company has been described by historians as a \\"critical turning point in US dominance in the hemisphere\\". The United Fruit Company, formed in 1899, had major holdings of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. By 1930, it had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. In return for the company's support, Ubico signed a contract with it that included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, and exemptions from virtually all taxes. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic Ocean. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65million USdollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government. As a result, the company was seen as an impediment to progress by the revolutionary movement after 1944. Thanks to its position as the country's largest landowner and employer, the reforms of Ar√©valo's government affected the UFC more than other companies, which led to a perception by the company that it was being specifically targeted by the reforms. The company's labor troubles were compounded in 1952 when √Årbenz passed Decree900, the agrarian reform law. Of the that the company owned, 15% were being cultivated; the rest of the land, which was idle, came under the scope of the agrarian reform law. Additionally, √Årbenz supported a strike of UFC workers in 1951, which eventually compelled the company to rehire a number of laid-off workers. The United Fruit Company responded with an intensive lobbying campaign against √Årbenz in the United States. The Guatemalan government reacted by saying that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that \\"to the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation's welfare.\\" In 1953 of uncultivated land was expropriated under √Årbenz's agrarian reform law, and the company was offered compensation at the rate of 2.99 USdollars to the acre, twice what it had paid when buying the property. This resulted in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had close ties to the company. The company had begun a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; overall, the company spent over a half-million dollars to influence both lawmakers and members of the public in the US that the Guatemalan government of Jacobo √Årbenz needed to be overthrown. Coup d'√©tat A CIA memorandum dated May 1975 which describes the role of the Agency in deposing the Guatemalan government of President Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n in June 1954 (1‚Äì5) =Political motives= Several factors besides the lobbying campaign of the United Fruit Company led the United States to launch the coup that toppled √Årbenz in 1954. The US government had grown more suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution as the Cold War developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with US corporations on an increasing number of issues. The US was also concerned that it had been infiltrated by communists although historian Richard H. Immerman argued that during the early part of the Cold War, the US and the CIA were predisposed to see the revolutionary government as communist, despite Ar√©valo's ban of the communist party during his 1945‚Äì1951 presidency. Additionally, the US government was concerned that the success of √Årbenz's reforms would inspire similar movements elsewhere. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to attempt to reduce communist influences. √Årbenz's enactment of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFortune, a covert operation to overthrow √Årbenz. The plan had originally been suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles, had close ties to the United Fruit Company. John Foster Dulles had previously represented United Fruit Company as a lawyer, and his brother, then-CIA director Allen Dulles was on the company's board of directors. Thomas Dudley Cabot, a former CEO of United Fruit, held the position of director of International Security Affairs in the State Department. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made the Eisenhower administration more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. =Operation PBSuccess= The CIA operation to overthrow Jacobo √Årbenz, code-named Operation PBSuccess, was authorized by Eisenhower in August 1953. Carlos Castillo Armas, once Arana's lieutenant, who had been exiled following the failed coup in 1949, was chosen to lead the coup. Castillo Armas recruited a force of approximately 150 mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. In January 1954, information about these preparations were leaked to the Guatemalan government, which issued statements implicating a \\"Government of the North\\" in a plot to overthrow √Årbenz. The US government denied the allegations, and the US media uniformly took the side of the government; both argued that √Årbenz had succumbed to communist propaganda. The US stopped selling arms to Guatemala in 1951, and soon after blocked arms purchases from Canada, Germany, and Rhodesia. By 1954, √Årbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from Czechoslovakia, an action seen as establishing a communist beachhead in the Americas. The shipment of these weapons was portrayed by the CIA as Soviet interference in the United States' backyard, and acted as the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup. √Årbenz had intended the shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militia, in the event of army disloyalty, but the US informed the Guatemalan army chiefs of the shipment, forcing √Årbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and the chiefs of his army. Castillo Armas' forces invaded Guatemala on June 18, 1954. The invasion was accompanied by an intense campaign of psychological warfare presenting Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli, with the intent of forcing √Årbenz to resign. The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station known as the \\"Voice of Liberation\\", whose transmissions broadcast news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributed to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population. √Årbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily, but he worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a US invasion. √Årbenz ordered Carlos Enrique D√≠az, the chief of the army, to select officers to lead a counter-attack. D√≠az chose a corps of officers who were all known to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to √Årbenz. By June 21, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa under the command of Colonel V√≠ctor M. Le√≥n, who was believed to be loyal to √Årbenz. The leaders of the communist party also began to have their suspicions, and sent a member to investigate. He returned on June 25, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. PGT Secretary General Alvarado Monz√≥n informed √Årbenz, who quickly sent another investigator of his own, who brought back a message asking √Årbenz to resign. The officers believed that given US support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and √Årbenz was to blame for it. The message stated that if √Årbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas. On June 25, √Årbenz announced that the army had abandoned the government, and that civilians needed to be armed in order to defend the country; however, only a few hundred individuals volunteered. Seeing this, D√≠az reneged on his support of the president, and began plotting to overthrow √Årbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed US ambassador John Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for √Årbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to √Årbenz and informed him of their decision. √Årbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8 pm on June 27, 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning in order to eliminate the \\"pretext for the invasion,\\" and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution. He walked to the nearby Mexican Embassy, seeking political asylum. Later life=Beginning of exile= After √Årbenz's resignation, his family remained for 73 days at the Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated a new set of operations against √Årbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of √Årbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as √Årbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, √Årbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, Mar√≠a Cristina Vilanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of √Årbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign. The family then initiated a long journey in exile that would take them first to Mexico, then to Canada, where they went to pick up Arabella (the √Årbenzs' oldest daughter), and then to Switzerland via the Netherlands and Paris. They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on √Årbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president did not wish to renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such a gesture would have marked the end of his political career. √Årbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA- orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960. A close friend of √Årbenz, Carlos Manuel Pellecer, turned out to be a spy working for the CIA. =Europe and Uruguay= After being unable to obtain citizenship in Switzerland, the √Årbenz family moved to Paris, where the French government gave them permission to live for a year, on the condition that they did not participate in any political activity, then to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. After only three months, he moved to Moscow, which came as a relief to him from the harsh treatment he received in Czechoslovakia. While traveling in the Soviet Union and its vassal states, he was constantly criticized in the press in Guatemala and the US, on the grounds that he was showing his true communist colors by going there. After a brief stay in Moscow, √Årbenz returned to Prague and then to Paris. From there he separated from his wife: Mar√≠a traveled to ElSalvador to take care of family affairs. The separation made life increasingly difficult for √Årbenz, and he slipped into depression and took to drinking excessively. He tried several times to return to Latin America, and was finally allowed in 1957 to move to Uruguay. The CIA made several attempts to prevent √Årbenz from receiving a Uruguayan visa, but these were unsuccessful, and the Uruguayan government allowed √Årbenz to travel there as a political refugee. √Årbenz arrived in Montevideo on May 13, 1957, where he was met by a hostile \\"reception committee\\" organized by the CIA. However, he was still a figure of some note in leftist circles in the city, which partially explained the CIA's hostility. While √Årbenz was living in Montevideo, his wife came to join him. He was also visited by Ar√©valo a year after his own arrival there. Although the relationship between Ar√©valo and the √Årbenz family was initially friendly, it soon deteriorated due to differences between the two men. Ar√©valo himself was not under surveillance in Uruguay and was occasionally able to express himself through articles in the popular press. He left for Venezuela a year after his arrival to take up a position as a teacher. During his stay in Uruguay, √Årbenz was initially required to report to the police on a daily basis; eventually, however, this requirement was relaxed somewhat to once every eight days. Mar√≠a √Årbenz later stated that the couple was pleased by the hospitality they received in Uruguay, and would have stayed there indefinitely had they received permission to do so. = Daughter's suicide and death = After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a representative of the Fidel Castro government asked √Årbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up in the spirit of the recent revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome. In 1965 √Årbenz was invited to the Communist Congress in Helsinki. Soon afterwards, his daughter Arabella committed suicide in Bogot√°, an incident that badly affected √Årbenz. Following her funeral, the √Årbenz family remained indefinitely in Mexico City, while √Årbenz himself spent some time in France and Switzerland, with the ultimate objective of settling down in Mexico. On one of his visits to Mexico, √Årbenz contracted a serious illness, and by the end of 1970 he was very ill. He died soon after. Historians disagree as to the manner of his death: Roberto Garcia Ferreira stated that he died of a heart attack while taking a bath, while historian Cindy Forster wrote that he committed suicide. In October 1995, √Årbenz's remains were eventually repatriated to Guatemala, accompanied by his widow Mar√≠a. The Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala awarded him with a posthumous decoration soon after. Guatemalan government apology Following years of campaigning, the Arbenz Family took the Guatemalan Government to Inter- American Commission on Human Rights in Washington D.C. It accepted the complaint in 2006, leading to five years of stop-and-start negotiations. In May 2011 the Guatemalan government signed an agreement with √Årbenz's surviving family to restore his legacy and publicly apologize for the government's role in ousting him. This included a financial settlement to the family, as well as the family's insistence on social reparations and policies for the future of the Guatemalan people, a first for a judgement of this kind from the OAS. The formal apology was made at the National Palace by Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom on October 20, 2011, to Jacobo √Årbenz Vilanova, the son of the former president, and a Guatemalan politician. Colom stated, \\"It was a crime to Guatemalan society and it was an act of aggression to a government starting its democratic spring.\\" The agreement established several forms of reparation for the next of kin of √Årbenz Guzm√°n. Among other measures, the state: * held a public ceremony recognizing its responsibility * sent a letter of apology to the next of kin * named a hall of the National Museum of History and the highway to the Atlantic after the former president * revised the basic national school curriculum (Curr√≠culo Nacional Base) * established a degree program in Human Rights, Pluriculturalism, and Reconciliation of Indigenous Peoples * held a photographic exhibition on √Årbenz Guzm√°n and his legacy at the National Museum of History * recovered the wealth of photographs of the √Årbenz Guzm√°n family * published a book of photos * reissued the book Mi esposo, el presidente √Årbenz (My Husband President √Årbenz) * prepared and published a biography of the former president, and * issued a series of postage stamps in his honor. The official statement issued by the government recognized its responsibility for \\"failing to comply with its obligation to guarantee, respect, and protect the human rights of the victims to a fair trial, to property, to equal protection before the law, and to judicial protection, which are protected in the American Convention on Human Rights and which were violated against former President Juan Jacobo √Årbenz Guzman, his wife, Mar√≠a Cristina Villanova, and his children, Juan Jacobo, Mar√≠a Leonora, and Arabella, all surnamed √Årbenz Villanova.\\" Legacy A mural celebrating Jacobo √Årbenz, his agrarian reform, and the \\"Ten Years of Spring\\" Historian Roberto Garcia Ferreira wrote in 2008 that √Årbenz's legacy was still a matter of great dispute in Guatemala itself, while arguing that the image of √Årbenz was significantly shaped by the CIA media campaign that followed the 1954 coup. Garcia Ferreira said that the revolutionary government represented one of the few periods in which \\"state authority was used to promote the interests of the nation's masses.\\" Forster described √Årbenz's legacy in the following terms: \\"In 1952 the Agrarian Reform Law swept the land, destroying forever the hegemony of the planters. √Årbenz in effect legislated a new social order ... The revolutionary decade ... plays a central role in twentieth-century Guatemalan history because it was more comprehensive than any period of reform before or since.\\" She added that even within the Guatemalan government, √Årbenz \\"gave full compass to Indigenous, campesino, and labor demands\\" in contrast to Ar√©valo, who had remained suspicious of these movements. Similarly, Greg Grandin stated that the land reform decree \\"represented a fundamental shift in the power relations governing Guatemala\\". √Årbenz himself once remarked that the agrarian reform law was \\"most precious fruit of the revolution and the fundamental base of the nation as a new country.\\" However, to a large extent the legislative reforms of the √Årbenz and Ar√©valo administrations were reversed by the US-backed military governments that followed. In popular culture The Guatemalan movie The Silence of Neto (1994), filmed on location in Antigua Guatemala, takes place during the last months of the government of √Årbenz. It follows the life of a fictional 12-year-old boy who is sheltered by the √Årbenz family, set against a backdrop of the struggle in which the country is embroiled at the time. The story of √Årbenz's life and subsequent overthrow in the CIA sponsored coup d'√©tat has been the subject of several books, notably PBSuccess: The CIA's covert operation to overthrow Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz June‚ÄìJuly 1954 by Mario Overall and Daniel Hagedorn (2016), American Propaganda, Media, And The Fall Of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman by Zachary Fisher (2014), as well as New York Times Best Seller The Devil's Chessboard by Author David Talbot (Harper Collins 2015). The Arbenz story was also the subject of the multi award-winning 1997 documentary by Andreas Hoessli Devils Don't Dream!

He served as the ninth White House Press Secretary under the Johnson administration from 1965 to 1967. He also worked as a network TV news commentator for ten years. Moyers has been extensively involved with public broadcasting, producing documentaries and news journal programs. He has won numerous awards and honorary degrees for his investigative journalism and civic activities. He has become well known as a trenchant critic of the corporately structured U.S. news media. Life and career=Early years and education= President Johnson (right) meets with special assistant Moyers in the White House Oval Office, 1963 Born Billy Don Moyers in Hugo in Choctaw County in southeastern Oklahoma, he is the son of John Henry Moyers, a laborer, and Ruby Johnson Moyers. Moyers was reared in Marshall, Texas. Moyers began his journalism career at 16 as a cub reporter at the Marshall News Messenger in Marshall in East Texas. In college, he studied journalism at the North Texas State College in Denton, Texas. In 1954, US Senator Lyndon B. Johnson employed him as a summer intern and eventually promoted him to manage Johnson's personal mail. Soon after, Moyers transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, where he wrote for The Daily Texan newspaper. In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. While in Austin, Moyers served as assistant news editor for KTBC radio and television stations, owned by Lady Bird Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson. During the academic year 1956‚Äì1957, he studied issues of church and state at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Rotary International Fellow. In 1959, he completed a Master of Divinity degree at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. Moyers served as Director of Information while attending SWBTS. He was also a Baptist pastor in Weir in Williamson County, near Austin. Moyers was ordained in 1954. Moyers planned to enter a Doctor of Philosophy program in American Studies at the University of Texas. During Senator Johnson's unsuccessful bid for the 1960 Democratic U.S. presidential nomination, Moyers served as a top aide, and in the general campaign he acted as liaison between Democratic vice-presidential candidate Johnson and the Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. =Kennedy and Johnson administrations= During the Kennedy Administration, Moyers was first appointed as associate director of public affairs for the newly created Peace Corps in 1961. He served as Deputy Director from 1962 to 1963. When Lyndon B. Johnson took office after the Kennedy assassination, Moyers became a special assistant to Johnson, serving from 1963 to 1967. Moyers and Pamela Turnure are the last surviving people identifiable in the photograph taken of Johnson's swearing in. He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964 Great Society legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as White House press secretary. After the resignation of White House Chief of Staff Walter Jenkins because of a sexual misdemeanor in the run up to the 1964 election, President Lyndon B. Johnson, alarmed that the opposition was framing the issue as a security breach, ordered Moyers to request FBI name checks on 15 members of Goldwater's staff to find \\"derogatory\\" material on their personal lives.Hoover's men ran name checks on 15 of them, producing derogatory information on two (a traffic violation on one and a love affair on another) \\"Hoover's Political Spying for Presidents, TIME, 1975 \\" Goldwater himself only referred to the Jenkins incident off the record. The Church Committee stated in 1975 that \\"Moyers has publicly recounted his role in the incident, and his account is confirmed by FBI documents.\\" In 2005, Laurence Silberman claimed that Moyers denied writing the memo in a 1975 phone call.Silberman, Acting Deputy Attorney General in 1975, says Moyers called his office and said the document was a \\"phony CIA memo\\" but declined Silberman's offer to conduct an investigation to clear his name. \\"\\"Hoover's Institution,\\" The Wall Street Journal, 2005 \\" Moyers responded that Silberman's account of the conversation was at odds with his. \\"Removing J. Edgar's name, Robert Novak, CNN, 2005 \\" Moyers said he had a different recollection of the telephone conversation. Moyers also sought information from the FBI on the sexual preferences of White House staff members, most notably Jack Valenti. Moyers indicated his memory was unclear on why Johnson directed him to request such information, \\"but that he may have been simply looking for details of allegations first brought to the president by Hoover.\\" Moyers approved (but had nothing to do with the production) of the infamous \\"Daisy Ad\\" against Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential campaign. Goldwater blamed him for it, and once said of Moyers, \\"Every time I see him, I get sick to my stomach and want to throw up.\\" The ad is considered the starting point of the modern- day harshly negative campaign ad. Moyers giving a press conference at the White House in 1965 Journalist Morley Safer in his 1990 book \\"Flashbacks\\" wrote that Moyers and President Johnson met with and \\"harangued\\" Safer's boss, CBS president Frank Stanton, about Safer's coverage of the Marines torching Cam Ne village in the Vietnam War. During the meeting, Safer alleges, Johnson threatened to expose Safer's \\"communist ties\\". This was a bluff, according to Safer. Safer says that Moyers was \\"if not a key player, certainly a key bystander\\" in the incident. Moyers stated that his hard-hitting coverage of conservative presidents Reagan and Bush were behind Safer's 1990 allegations. In The New York Times on April 3, 1966, Moyers offered this insight on his stint as press secretary to President Johnson: \\"I work for him despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies.\\" On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, even in the face of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. \\"I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me,\\" he told them. \\"I would have to say now: It would depend on who his opponent is.\\"Daniel Ellsberg, Secrets, 197f The full details of his rift with Johnson were not made public. =Journalism=Newsday Moyers served as publisher for the Long Island, New York, daily newspaper Newsday from 1967 to 1970. The conservative publication had been unsuccessful,\\"Bill Moyers.\\" Contemporary Heroes and Heroines, Book IV. Gale Group, 2000. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2010. but Moyers led the paper in a progressive direction, bringing in leading writers such as Pete Hamill, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Saul Bellow, and adding new features and more investigative reporting and analysis. Circulation increased and the publication won 33 major journalism awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes.\\"Bill Moyers.\\" Newsmakers 1991, Issue Cumulation. Gale Research, 1991. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2010.Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2010. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2010. But the owner of the paper, Harry Guggenheim, a conservative, was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing the \\"left- wing\\" coverage of Vietnam War protests. The two split over the 1968 presidential election, with Guggenheim signing an editorial supporting Richard Nixon, when Moyers supported Hubert Humphrey. Guggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative Times-Mirror Company over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later. Bill Moyers Journal In 1971 he began working for the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), hosting a news program called Bill Moyers Journal, which ran until 1981 with a hiatus from 1976 to 1977, and then again from 2007 to 2010. CBS News In 1976 he moved to CBS, where he worked as editor and chief correspondent for CBS Reports until 1980, then as senior news analyst and commentator for the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather from 1981 to 1986. He was the last regular commentator for the network broadcast. During his last year at CBS, Moyers made public statements about declining news standards at the network and declined to renew his contract with CBS, citing commitments with PBS. The Power of Myth series In 1986 Moyers and his wife, Judith Suzanne Davidson Moyers, formed Public Affairs Television. Among their first productions was the PBS 1988 documentary series Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, consisting of six one-hour interviews between Moyers and mythologist Joseph Campbell. The documentary covers Campbell's exploration of the monomyth and the hero cycle, or the story of the hero, as it manifests itself in various cultures. Campbell's influence is clearly seen in the work of George Lucas's Star Wars saga. In the first interview, filmed at George Lucas' \\"Skywalker Ranch\\", Moyers and Campbell discuss the relationship between Campbell's theories and Lucas's creative work. Twelve years after the making of The Power of Myth, Moyers and Lucas met again for the 1999 interview, the Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers, to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas's films. The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis In 1987 Moyers produced and hosted a scathing documentary, The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis, covering the infringement on the limitations on government and the executive branch provided by the Constitution. It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans as a reason to threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS. In Search of the Constitution Also in 1987 Moyers produced an 11-part documentary celebrating the bicentennial of the signing of the U.S. Constitution and critically analyzing the present state of affairs and the intervening 200 years. Four episodes of In Search of the Constitution were interviews of sitting Supreme Court justices and the remainder contained discussions with prominent scholars. The mini series was produced by Madeline Amgott. A World of Ideas In 1988, Moyers produced an interview series featuring writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and historians he had become acquainted with. The series broke new ground for national television by bringing thoughtful, intelligent, provocative, and noteworthy people to the screen, most of whom had little prior exposure in the mass media. The series was revived in 1990. Moyers published companion books for both the first series and the second. NBC News Moyers briefly joined NBC News in 1995 as a senior analyst and commentator, and the following year he became the first host of sister cable network MSNBC's Insight program. He was the last regular commentator on the NBC Nightly News. NOW with Bill Moyers Moyers hosted the TV news journal NOW with Bill Moyers on PBS for three years, starting in January 2002. He retired from the program on December 17, 2004, but returned to PBS soon after to host Wide Angle in 2005. When he left NOW, he announced that he wished to finish writing a biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. Faith and Reason In 2006, he presented two public television series. Faith and Reason, a series of conversations with esteemed writers of various faiths and of no faith, explored the question \\"In a world in which religion is poison to some and salvation to others, how do we live together?\\" Moyers on America The series, Moyers on America, analyzed in depth the ramifications of three important issues: the Jack Abramoff scandal, evangelical religion and environmentalism (Evangelical environmentalism), and threats to open public access of the Internet. Bill Moyers Journal On April 25, 2007, Moyers returned to PBS with Bill Moyers Journal. In the first episode, \\"Buying the War\\", Moyers investigated what he called the general media's shortcomings in the runup to the War in Iraq. On November 20, 2009, Moyers announced that he would be retiring from his weekly show on April 30, 2010. Moyers & Company In August 2011 Moyers announced a new hour-long weekly interview show, Moyers & Company, which premiered in January 2012. In that same month, Moyers also launched BillMoyers.com. Later reduced to a half hour, Moyers & Company was produced by Public Affairs Television and distributed by American Public Television.08-25-2011 Bill Moyers, Host of New Public Television Series Moyers & Company, Keynote Speaker at APT Fall Marketplace 2011 The show has been heralded as a renewed fulfillment of public media's stated mission to air news and views unrepresented or underrepresented in commercial media. The program concluded on January 2, 2015. = Awards = In 1995, Bill Moyers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. The same year, he also won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. When he became a recipient of the 2006 Lifetime Emmy Award, the official announcement noted that ‚ÄúBill Moyers has devoted his lifetime to the exploration of the major issues and ideas of our time and our country, giving television viewers an informed perspective on political and societal concerns,\\" and that \\"The scope of and quality of his broadcasts have been honored time and again. It is fitting that the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences honor him with our highest honor‚Äîthe Lifetime Achievement Award.\\" He has received well over thirty Emmys and virtually every other major television journalism prize, including a gold baton from the Alfred I. duPont- Columbia University Awards, a lifetime Peabody Award,63rd Annual Peabody Awards , May 2004. and a George Polk Career Award (his third George Polk Award) for contributions to journalistic integrity and investigative reporting. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, including a doctorate from the American Film Institute. In 2011, Moyers received the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College. Commentary=Regarding the U.S. media=On the media and class warfare In a 2003 interview with BuzzFlash.com, Moyers said, \\"The corporate right and the political right declared class warfare on working people a quarter of a century ago and they've won.\\" He noted, \\"The rich are getting richer, which arguably wouldn't matter if the rising tide lifted all boats.\\" Instead, however, \\"[t]he inequality gap is the widest it's been since 1929; the middle class is besieged and the working poor are barely keeping their heads above water.\\" He added that as \\"the corporate and governing elites are helping themselves to the spoils of victory,\\" access to political power has become \\"who gets what and who pays for it.\\" Meanwhile, the public has failed to react because it is, in his words, \\"distracted by the media circus and news has been neutered or politicized for partisan purposes.\\" In support of this, he referred to \\"the paradox of Rush Limbaugh, ensconced in a Palm Beach mansion massaging the resentments across the country of white-knuckled wage earners, who are barely making ends meet in no small part because of the corporate and ideological forces for whom Rush has been a hero. ... As Eric Alterman reports in his recent book‚Äîa book that I'm proud to have helped make happen‚Äîpart of the red- meat strategy is to attack mainstream media relentlessly, knowing that if the press is effectively intimidated, either by the accusation of liberal bias or by a reporter's own mistaken belief in the charge's validity, the institutions that conservatives revere‚Äîcorporate America, the military, organized religion, and their own ideological bastions of influence‚Äîwill be able to escape scrutiny and increase their influence over American public life with relatively no challenge.\\" On media bias When he retired in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, \\"I'm going out telling the story that I think is the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a partisan propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people.\\" =On Karl Rove and U.S. politics= ;\\"The Progressive Story of America\\" speech On June 4, 2003, Moyers gave a speech at the \\"Take Back America\\" conference. In it, Moyers defined what he considered Karl Rove's influence on George W. Bush's administration. Moyers asserted that, from his reading of Rove, the mid-to-late 19th century was to Rove a \\"cherished period of American history.\\" He further stated, \\"From his own public comments and my reading of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of William McKinley ... and modeled himself on Mark Hanna, the man who virtually manufactured McKinley\\", a man whose primary \\"passion\\" was attending to corporate and imperial power. Furthermore, Moyers indicated that Hanna gathered support for McKinley's presidential campaign from \\"the corporate interests of the day\\" and was responsible for Ohio and Washington coming under the rule of \\"bankers, railroads and public utility corporations.\\" He submitted that political opponents of this transfer of power were \\"smeared as disturbers of the peace, socialists, anarchists, or worse.\\" Moyers also referred to what historian Clinton Rossiter called the period of \\"the great train robbery of American intellectual history,\\" when \\"conservatives‚Äîor better, pro-corporate apologists\\" began using terms such as progress, opportunity, and individualism to make \\"...the plunder of America sound like divine right.\\" He added that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was also used by conservative politicians, judges, and publicists to justify the idea of a \\"natural order of things\\" as well as \\"the notion that progress resulted from the elimination of the weak and the 'survival of the fittest.'\\" He concludes, \\"This 'degenerate and unlovely age', as one historian calls it, exists in the mind of Karl Rove, the reputed brain of George W. Bush, as the seminal age of inspiration for the politics and governance of America today.\\" Presidential draft initiative On July 24, 2006, liberal political commentator Molly Ivins published an article entitled Run Bill Moyers for President, Seriously on the progressive website Truthdig. Then in October 2006 Ralph Nader wrote an article supporting a Moyers candidacy. There was no effect from the op-eds, and Moyers did not run. Allegations of bias Corporation for Public Broadcasting chairman Kenneth Tomlinson was a regular critic of Moyers; in 2003, he wrote to Pat Mitchell, the president of PBS, that NOW with Bill Moyers \\"does not contain anything approaching the balance the law requires for public broadcasting.\\" In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned a study of the show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board.Labaton, Stephen (November 16, 2005). \\"Ex-Chairman of Public Broadcasting Violated Laws, Inquiry Suggests\\" . The New York Times. Tomlinson said that the study supported what he characterized as \\"the image of the left- wing bias of NOW\\". George Neumayr, the executive editor of The American Spectator, a conservative magazine, told the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that \\"PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A of that very strident, left-wing bias... [Moyers] uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans.\\" Moyers, who left the show in 2004 before returning in 2007, replied by saying that his journalism showed \\"the actual experience of regular people is the missing link in a nation wired for everything but the truth.\\" Moyers characterized Tomlinson as \\"an ally of Karl Rove and the right-wing monopoly's point man to keep tabs on public broadcasting.\\" Tomlinson, he said, \\"found kindred spirits at the right-wing editorial board of The Wall Street Journal where the 'animal spirits of business' are routinely celebrated.\\" Moyers also responded to these accusations in a speech given to The National Conference for Media Reform, saying that he had repeatedly invited Tomlinson to debate him on the subject but had repeatedly been ignored. He spoke about this again a few months later in a speech called \\"Democracy, Secrecy and Ideology\\" on the 20th anniversary of the National Security Archive. Organizations Moyers is a former director of the Council on Foreign Relations (1967-1974), and a member of the Bilderberg Group and since 1990 has been president of the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy. Personal life Moyers at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2018 Moyers married Judith Suzanne Davidson (a producer) on December 18, 1954. They have three children and five grandchildren. His son William Cope Moyers (CNN producer, Hazelden Foundation spokesman) struggled to overcome alcoholism and crack addiction as detailed in the book Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption. He includes letters from Bill Moyers in his book, which he says are \\"a testament to a father's love for his son, a father's confusion with his son, and ultimately, a father's satisfaction with his son.\\" His other son, John Moyers, assisted in the foundation of TomPaine.com, \\"an online public affairs journal of progressive analysis and commentary.\\" He and his wife live in Bernardsville, New Jersey.Staff. \\"DWI FOR MOYERS\\", St. Paul Pioneer Press, August 3, 2002.

They are found through much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, occurring in mountains over most of the range. Firs are most closely related to the genus Cedrus (cedar). Douglas firs are not true firs, being of the genus Pseudotsuga. The genus name is derived from the Latin \\"to rise\\" as a reference to their height. The common English name originates with the Old Norse, fyri, or the Old Danish, fyr. They are large trees, reaching heights of tall with trunk diameters of when mature. Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the way in which their needle-like leaves are attached singly to the branches with a base resembling a suction cup, and by their cones, which, like those of true cedars (Cedrus), stand upright on the branches like candles and disintegrate at maturity. Identification of the different species is based on the size and arrangement of the leaves, the size and shape of the cones, and whether the bract scales of the cones are long and exserted, or short and hidden inside the cone.  Leaves  File:Abies alba PID1015-3.jpgA. alba ‚Äì the underside of leaves have 2 whitish strips formed by wax-covered stomatal bands; the bases of the needles are shaped like suction cups. Abgragra-top.jpgA. grandis foliage ‚Äì upper side of the leaves Abies Orjen foliage.jpgAtypical A. alba foliage from Dinaric calcareous fir forests on Mt. Orjen Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the unique attachment of their needle-like leaves to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup. The leaves are significantly flattened, sometimes even looking like they are pressed, as in A. sibirica. The leaves have two whitish lines on the bottom, each of which is formed by wax-covered stomatal bands. In most species, the upper surface of the leaves is uniformly green and shiny, without stomata or with a few on the tip, visible as whitish spots. Other species have the upper surface of leaves dull, gray-green or bluish-gray to silvery (glaucous), coated by wax with variable number of stomatal bands, and not always continuous. An example species with shiny green leaves is A. alba, and an example species with dull waxy leaves is A. concolor. The tips of leaves are usually more or less notched (as in A. firma), but sometimes rounded or dull (as in A. concolor, A. magnifica) or sharp and prickly (as in A. bracteata, A. cephalonica, A. holophylla). The leaves of young plants are usually sharper. The way they spread from the shoot is very diverse, only in some species comb-shaped, with the leaves arranged on two sides, flat (A. alba)  Cones  Abies cone & bits.jpgIntact and disintegrated Bulgarian fir cones Abies holophylla Manchurian Fir cones.jpgImmature cones of some of species or races are green, not purple-bluish: for instance, Manchurian fir. Manchurian Fir Abies holophylla disintegrating cones.jpgDisintegrating cones of Manchurian fir Firs differ from other conifers in having erect, cylindrical cones long that disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. In contrast to spruces, even large fir cones do not hang, but are raised like candles. Mature cones are usually brown, young in summer can be green, for example: :A. grandis, A. holophylla, A. nordmanniana or purple and blue, sometimes very dark: :A. fraseri, A. homolepis (var. umbellata green), A. koreana ('Flava' green), A. lasiocarpa, A. nephrolepis (f. chlorocarpa green), A. sibirica, A. veitchii (var. olivacea green).

Because this genus has no insect or decay resistance qualities after logging, it is generally recommended in construction purposes for indoor use only (e.g. indoor drywall on framing). Fir wood left outside cannot be expected to last more than 12 to 18 months, depending on the type of climate it is exposed to. Nordmann fir, noble fir, Fraser fir and balsam fir are popular Christmas trees, generally considered to be the best for this purpose, with aromatic foliage that does not shed many needles on drying out. Many are also decorative garden trees, notably Korean fir and Fraser fir, which produce brightly coloured cones even when very young, still only tall. Other firs can grow anywhere between tall. Fir Tree Appreciation Day is June 18. Abies religiosa‚Äîsacred fir, is the overwinter host for the monarch butterfly . Firs are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes abella (recorded on white fir), autumnal moth, conifer swift (a pest of balsam fir), the engrailed, grey pug, mottled umber, pine beauty and the tortrix moths Cydia illutana (whose caterpillars are recorded to feed on European silver fir cone scales) and C. duplicana (on European silver fir bark around injuries or canker). Abies spectabilis or Talispatra is used in Ayurveda as an antitussive (cough suppressant) drug.  References  Bibliography  Philips, Roger.

It reaffirmed flexibility of TRIPS member states in circumventing patent rights for better access to essential medicines. In Paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Doha Declaration, governments agreed that: :\\"4. The TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all. :In this connection, we reaffirm the right of WTO Members to use, to the full, the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose. :5. Accordingly and in the light of paragraph 4 above, while maintaining our commitments in the TRIPS Agreement, we recognize that these flexibilities include: :(a) In applying the customary rules of interpretation of public international law, each provision of the TRIPS Agreement shall be read in the light of the object and purpose of the Agreement as expressed, in particular, in its objectives and principles. :(b) Each Member has the right to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licenses are granted. :(c) Each Member has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency. :(d) The effect of the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement that are relevant to the exhaustion of intellectual property rights is to leave each Member free to establish its own regime for such exhaustion without challenge, subject to the MFN and national treatment provisions of Articles 3 and 4. :6. We recognize that WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement. We instruct the Council for TRIPS to find an expeditious solution to this problem and to report to the General Council before the end of 2002.\\" These provisions in the Declaration ensure that governments may issue compulsory licenses on patents for medicines, or take other steps to protect public health. Current status In 2005, WTO members reached agreement on an amendment to the TRIPS Agreement to make permanent the temporary waiver contained in the August 30 WTO Decision, which itself fulfilled the requirement of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of November 14, 2001. This decision created a mechanism to allow WTO members to issue compulsory licences to export generic versions of patented medicines to countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector. The 2005 Ministerial Declaration stated: > \\"We reaffirm the importance we attach to the General Council Decision of 30 > August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on > the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, and to an amendment to the TRIPS > Agreement replacing its provisions. In this regard, we welcome the work that > has taken place in the Council for TRIPS and the Decision of the General > Council of 6 December 2005 on an Amendment of the TRIPS > Agreement.\\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min05_e/final_text_e.htm#public_health The amendment, the first ever to the TRIPS Agreement, was circulated to WTO members for formal adoption. A deadline of December 1, 2007 was set for members to accept the permanent amendment. For the amendment to be put into effect, at least two-thirds of members must formally adopt it. On November 30, 2007, Peter Mandelson, the then European Union's Trade Commissioner, announced that the European Union formally accepted the World Trade Organization -approved protocol of December 2005, amending the TRIPS Agreement. However, in order for the decision to have legal effect, two-thirds of the WTO's 153 Members are required to ratify the agreement. The current total of Members accepting the amendment is 45.WTO website, 'Members accepting amendment of the TRIPS Agreement', available at http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/amendment_e.htm In 2008 a decision was made to extend the deadline for accepting the TRIPS agreement amendment. The deadline was extended until 31 December 2009 or \\"such later date as may be decided by the Ministerial Conference.\\" http://docsonline.wto.org/imrd/directdoc.asp?DDFDocuments/t/WT/L/711.doc The General Council further extended the deadline in 2011 to 31 December 2013.See supra note 2.  Reception  The Doha Declaration received positive reception, with many public health officials considering it an important step in prioritizing public health over intellectual property rights \\"in certain situations.\\" However, other issues and hindrances to medication access still exist, such as a lack of resources and infrastructure. Pascal Lamy, who was the European Commissioner for Trade at the time of the declaration, stated that the agreement \\"solved about 10 percent of the problem of access to medicines by developing countries.\\" See also * Doha Development Round of trade negotiations * TRIPS ReferencesExternal links * TRIPS and public health - WTO Website * Text of the Doha Declaration * WTO explanation of the declaration Category:Diplomatic conferences in Qatar Category:Intellectual property treaties Category:World Trade Organization Category:2001 in international relations ","title":"Doha Declaration"},{"id":"170728","text":"This is a list of original programming currently broadcast by the American television network NBC.

Located on a part of the Niagara Escarpment, the park comprises 156 square kilometres and is one of the largest protected areas in southern Ontario, forming the core of UNESCO's Niagara Escarpment World Biosphere Reserve.[Canada Newswire; Parks Canada hosts opening ceremony for a new visitor centre at Fathom Five National Marine Park of Canada and Bruce Peninsula National Park of Canada; August 16, 2006] The park offers opportunities for many outdoor activities, including hiking, camping, and bird watching. The park has trails ranging in difficulty from easy to expert, and connects to the Bruce Trail. The park also offers visitors vistas to view either the sunrise or sunset, the rocks of the Niagara Escarpment, and the wildlife, which includes black bear, many species of birds, wild orchids, massasauga rattlesnake, and much more. The park was the subject of a short film in 2011's National Parks Project, directed by Daniel Cockburn and scored by John K. Samson, Christine Fellows and Sandro Perri. Geology \\"The Grotto\\" at Bruce Peninsula National Park The Niagara Escarpment runs from near Rochester, New York, to Tobermory, then on to Manitoulin, St. Joseph Island and other islands located in northern Lake Huron where it turns westwards into the Upper Peninsula of northern Michigan, south of Sault Ste. Marie. The escarpment then extends southwards into Wisconsin following the Door Peninsula and then more inland from the western coast of Lake Michigan and Milwaukee ending northwest of Chicago near the Wisconsin-Illinois border. It forms the backbone of the Bruce Peninsula and shapes the northern boundary of most of the park and provides the park with some of its most spectacular scenery. The rock of the escarpment is very old. Approximately 400 million years ago, this area was covered by a shallow tropical sea teeming with life in the form of plant-like animals, crustaceans, living corals and mollusks. It would have looked much like the present-day Great Barrier Reef of Australia. When the sea began to dry up, the minerals dissolved in it became more and more concentrated. Magnesium in the water was absorbed into the limestone, which then became a harder, slightly different sort of rock, called dolomite. The harder dolomite forms much of the rock of the escarpment cliffs along Bruce Peninsula National Park's Georgian Bay shoreline. At Niagara Falls, the dolomite \\"caprock\\" is more resistant to erosion than the rock below it, creating the sculptured cliffs for which the area is famous. Since the last Ice Age, water levels in the region have undergone great changes. Softer limestone has been eroded away by water action, leaving magnificent overhanging cliffs at various points along the shore. These are the big attraction of the Cyprus Lake trails. Where erosion has cut more deeply, caves have been formed, such as the famed \\"Grotto\\" on the shore between the Marr Lake and Georgian Bay Trails. Great blocks of dolomite, undercut by wave action, have tumbled from the cliffs above and can be clearly seen below the surface of the deep, clean waters of Georgian Bay. Climate The park has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. In the northern parts of the Peninsula, the climate is among the most temperate in Canada. The climate of park is influenced by both Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, which significantly moderate temperatures. As a result, they tend to prolong milder temperatures in the fall and cooler temperatures in spring. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of while winters are cool, averaging . Summers are dominated by hot, humid air masses from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. In winter, Pacific air masses predominate, bringing in warm and humid air although cold, dry air from the Arctic highs can occur, bringing in colder and drier conditions. Warm air masses coming from the Gulf of Mexico are rare during winter but are responsible for bringing January and February thaws. Spring and fall are characterized by complex weather patterns with contrasting and rapidly changing influences from the different regional air masses. The park receives of precipitation per year. This is evenly distributed throughout the year with fall (September‚ÄìNovember) being the wettest. Precipitation is slightly lower than inland areas due to the limited influence that the narrow peninsula has when air masses travel over it compared to more interior locations. Fauna Animals that inhabit this national park are chipmunks, squirrels, red foxes, raccoons, coyotes, black bears, porcupines, snowshoe hares, skunks, white-tailed deer, snakes and frogs. Visitors' centre In 2006, a new visitors' centre opened to serve Fathom Five National Marine Park and the Bruce Peninsula National Park. Designed by Andrew Frontini of Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners, the CAD $7.82 million centre, approached by a boardwalk, features an information centre, reception area, exhibit hall and theatre. A 20-metre viewing tower was also constructed to provide visitors with aerial views of the surrounding park and Georgian Bay. The centre was designed with environmental sustainability in mind, receiving $224,000 from the Federal House in Order initiative for implementation of innovative greenhouse gas reduction technology.

It occurs in both male and female mammalian genitalia. In female bodies, it collects around the clitoris and in the folds of the labia minora; in males, smegma collects under the foreskin. Females Human vulva with visible female smegma between the labia The accumulation of sebum combined with dead skin cells forms smegma. Smegma clitoridis is defined as the secretion of the apocrine glands of the clitoris, in combination with desquamating epithelial cells. Glands that are located around the clitoris and the labia majoris secrete sebum. If smegma is not removed frequently it can lead to clitoral adhesion which can make clitoral stimulation (such as masturbation) painful (clitorodynia). Males Human penis with visible male smegma behind the glans In males, smegma helps keep the glans moist and facilitates sexual intercourse by acting as a lubricant. Smegma is completely benign. Smegma was originally thought to be produced by sebaceous glands near the frenulum called Tyson's glands; however, subsequent studies have failed to find these glands. Wright states that smegma is produced from minute microscopic protrusions of the mucosal surface of the foreskin and that living cells constantly grow towards the surface, undergo fatty degeneration, separate off, and form smegma. Parkash et al. found that smegma contains 26.6% fats and 13.3% proteins, which they judged to be consistent with necrotic epithelial debris. Newly produced smegma has a smooth, moist texture. It is thought to be rich in squalene and contain prostatic and seminal secretions, desquamated epithelial cells, and the mucin content of the urethral glands of Littr√©. Smegma contains cathepsin B, lysozymes, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase and cytokines, which aid the immune system. According to Wright, little smegma is produced during childhood, although the foreskin may contain sebaceous glands. She also says that production of smegma increases from adolescence until sexual maturity when the function of smegma for lubrication assumes its full value, and from middle-age production starts to decline and in old age virtually no smegma is produced. √òster reported that the incidence of smegma increased from 1% among 6- to 7-year-olds and 8- to 9-year-olds to 8% among 14- to 15-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds (an overall incidence of 5%). There is no evidence that smegma causes penile cancer, but its presence over a long period of time may irritate and inflame the penis, which may increase the risk of cancer. It may also make it harder to see very early cancers. Other animals In healthy animals, smegma helps clean and lubricate the genitals. In veterinary medicine, analysis of this smegma is sometimes used for detection of urogenital tract pathogens, such as Tritrichomonas foetus. Accumulation of smegma in the equine preputial folds and the urethral fossa and urethral diverticulum can form large \\"beans\\" and promote the carriage of Taylorella equigenitalis, the causative agent of contagious equine metritis.Primary Industries Ministerial Council of Australia and New Zealand (2002).

Only a small percentage of light penetrates the canopy so understory vegetation is generally shade-tolerant. The understory typically consists of trees stunted through lack of light, other small trees with low light requirements, saplings, shrubs, vines and undergrowth. Small trees such as holly and dogwood are understory specialists. In temperate deciduous forests, many understory plants start into growth earlier than the canopy trees to make use of the greater availability of light at this time of year. A gap in the canopy caused by the death of a tree stimulates the potential emergent trees into competitive growth as they grow upwards to fill the gap. These trees tend to have straight trunks and few lower branches. At the same time, the bushes, undergrowth and plant life on the forest floor become more dense. The understory experiences greater humidity than the canopy, and the shaded ground does not vary in temperature as much as open ground. This causes a proliferation of ferns, mosses and fungi and encourages nutrient recycling, which provides favorable habitats for many animals and plants. Understory structure The understory is the underlying layer of vegetation in a forest or wooded area, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor. Plants in the understory comprise an assortment of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees together with specialist understory shrubs and herbs. Young canopy trees often persist in the understory for decades as suppressed juveniles until an opening in the forest overstory permits their growth into the canopy. In contrast understory shrubs complete their life cycles in the shade of the forest canopy. Some smaller tree species, such as dogwood and holly, rarely grow tall and generally are understory trees. The canopy of a rainforest is typically about 10m (33ft) thick, and intercepts around 95% of the sunlight. The understory receive less intense light than plants in the canopy and such light as does penetrate is impoverished in wavelengths of light that are most effective for photosynthesis. Understory plants therefore must be shade tolerant--they must be able to photosynthesize adequately using such light as does reach their leaves. They often are able to use wavelengths that canopy plants cannot. In temperate deciduous forests towards the end of the leafless season, understory plants take advantage of the shelter of the still leafless canopy plants to \\"leaf out\\" before the canopy trees do. This is important because it provides the understory plants with a window in which to photosynthesize without the canopy shading them. This brief period (usually 1-2 weeks) is often a crucial period in which the plant can maintain a net positive carbon balance over the course of the year. As a rule forest understories also experience higher humidity than exposed areas. The forest canopy reduces solar radiation, so the ground does not heat up or cool down as rapidly as open ground. Consequently, the understory dries out more slowly than more exposed areas do. The greater humidity encourages epiphytes such as ferns and mosses, and allows fungi and other decomposers to flourish. This drives nutrient cycling, and provides favorable microclimates for many animals and plants, such as the pygmy marmoset.

Catgirls are found in various fiction genres and in particular Japanese anime and manga. History The portrayal of catgirls goes back until at least 1924 when Kenji Miyazawa (Japanese author of children's literature in the early Sh≈çwa period of Japan) created (The 4th of narcissus month) where the first \\"Modern Day\\" Nekomimi Cat girl appears as in the story, a beautiful, cat-eared woman. The first anime titled The King‚Äôs Tail (Osama no Shippo) involving catgirls was made in 1949 by Mitsuyo Seo. In America, Catwoman and Cheetah were created by DC Comics that date back to 1940. In 1978, catgirls were further made popular when the series The Star of Cottonland (Wata no Kuni Hoshi) started. By the 1990s catgirls were common in Japanese anime and manga. Catgirls have since been featured in various media worldwide. Enough of a subculture has developed for various themed conventions and events to be held around the world, such as Nekocon. Reception Japanese philosopher Hiroki Azuma has stated that catgirl characteristics such as cat ears and feline speech patterns are examples of moe-elements. Azuma argued that although some otaku sexual expression involves catgirl imagery, few otaku have the sexual awareness to understand how such imagery can be perceived as perverted. In a 2010 critique of the manga series Loveless, the feminist writer T. A. Noonan argued that, in Japanese culture, catgirl characteristics have a similar role to that of the Playboy bunny in western culture, serving as a fetishization of youthful innocence.

They are mostly natives of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species reaching the Southern Hemisphere in the Andes in South America. Their typical flowers are catkins and often appear before leaves. In the past, the family was often divided into two families, Betulaceae (Alnus, Betula) and Corylaceae (the rest). Recent treatments, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, have described these two groups as subfamilies within an expanded Betulaceae: Betuloideae and Coryloideae. Evolutionary history The Betulaceae are believed to have originated at the end of the Cretaceous period (about 70 million years ago) in central China. This region at the time would have had a Mediterranean climate due to the proximity of the Tethys Sea, which covered parts of present-day Tibet and Xinjiang into the early Tertiary period. This point of origin is supported by the fact that all six genera and 52 species are native to this region, many of those being endemic. All six modern genera are believed to have diverged fully by the Oligocene, with all genera in the family (with the exception of Ostryopsis) having a fossil record stretching back at least 20 million years from the present. According to molecular phylogeny, the closest relatives of the Betulaceae are the Casuarinaceae, or the she-oaks. Uses Corylus avellana foliage and nuts The common hazel (Corylus avellana) and the filbert (Corylus maxima) are important orchard plants, grown for their edible nuts. The other genera include a number of popular ornamental trees, widely planted in parks and large gardens; several of the birches are particularly valued for their smooth, brightly coloured bark. The wood is generally hard, tough and heavy, hornbeams particularly so; several species were of significant importance in the past where very hard wood capable of withstanding heavy wear was required, such as for cartwheels, water wheels, cog wheels, tool handles, chopping boards, and wooden pegs. In most of these uses, wood has now been replaced by metal or other man-made materials.

The name \\"hawthorn\\" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis. Etymology The generic epithet, Crataegus, is derived from the Greek \\"strength\\" because of the great strength of the wood and \\"sharp\\", referring to the thorns of some species. p. 491 The name haw, originally an Old English term for hedge (from the Anglo-Saxon term , \\"a fence with thorns\\"), also applies to the fruit. Description Plant of Crataegus monogyna C. monogyna Crataegus species are shrubs or small trees, mostly growing to tall,Phipps, J.B., O'Kennon, R.J., Lance, R.W. (2003). Hawthorns and medlars. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K. with small pome fruit and (usually) thorny branches. The most common type of bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees. The thorns are small sharp-tipped branches that arise either from other branches or from the trunk, and are typically 1‚Äì3 cm long (recorded as up to in one case). The leaves grow spirally arranged on long shoots, and in clusters on spur shoots on the branches or twigs. The leaves of most species have lobed or serrated margins and are somewhat variable in shape. The fruit, sometimes known as a \\"haw\\", is berry-like but structurally a pome containing from one to five pyrenes that resemble the \\"stones\\" of plums, peaches, etc., which are drupaceous fruit in the same subfamily. Ecology Hawthorns provide food and shelter for many species of birds and mammals, and the flowers are important for many nectar-feeding insects. Hawthorns are also used as food plants by the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species, such as the small eggar moth, E. lanestris. Haws are important for wildlife in winter, particularly thrushes and waxwings; these birds eat the haws and disperse the seeds in their droppings. Uses=Culinary use= Crataegus monogyna 'Crimson Cloud' in Elko, Nevada The \\"haws\\" or fruits of the common hawthorn, C. monogyna, are edible, but the flavor has been compared to over- ripe apples. In the United Kingdom, they are sometimes used to make a jelly or homemade wine.Wright, John (2010), Hedgerow: River Cottage Handbook Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, (pp. 73‚Äì74) The leaves are edible, and if picked in spring when still young, are tender enough to be used in salads.Richard Mabey, Food for Free, Collins, October 2001. The young leaves and flower buds, which are also edible, are known as \\"bread and cheese\\" in rural England. In the southern United States, fruits of three native species are collectively known as mayhaws and are made into jellies which are considered a delicacy. The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used red and black hawthorn fruit for food. On Manitoulin Island, Ontario, some red-fruited species are called hawberries. During the pioneer days, white settlers ate these fruits during the winter as the only remaining food supply. People born on the island are now called \\"haweaters\\". The fruits of Crataegus mexicana are known in Mexico as tejocotes and are eaten raw, cooked, or in jam during the winter. They are stuffed in the pi√±atas broken during the traditional pre-Christmas celebration known as Las Posadas. They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called rielitos, which is manufactured by several brands. The 4 cm fruits of the species Crataegus pinnatifida (Chinese hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small crabapple fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including haw flakes and being coated in sugar syrup and put on a stick tanghulu. The fruits, which are called Â±±Ê•Ç shƒÅn zhƒÅ in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks; these could in turn be used in other dishes (for instance, many older recipes for Cantonese sweet and sour sauce call for shƒÅnzhƒÅ jam). In South Korea, a liquor called sansachun (ÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨Ï∂ò) is made from the fruits. In Iran, the fruits of Crataegus (including Crataegus azarolus var. aronia, as well as other species) are known as z√¢lz√¢lak and eaten raw as a snack, or made into a jam known by the same name. The fruits of North America's Crataegus greggiana are made into preserves. =Research= A 2008 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of previous studies concluded that evidence exists of \\"a significant benefit in symptom control and physiologic outcomes\\" for an extract of hawthorn used as an adjuvant in treating chronic heart failure. A 2010 review concluded that \\"Crataegus [hawthorn] preparations hold significant potential as a useful remedy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease\\". The review indicated the need for further study of the best dosages and concluded that although \\"many different theoretical interactions between Crataegus and orthodox medications have been postulated ... none have [yet] been substantiated. Phytochemicals found in hawthorn include tannins, flavonoids, oligomeric proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. =Traditional medicine= Several species of hawthorn have been used in traditional medicine. The products used are often derived from C. monogyna, C. laevigata, or related Crataegus species, \\"collectively known as hawthorn\\", not necessarily distinguishing between these species. The dried fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida (called shƒÅn zhƒÅ in Chinese) are used in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as a digestive aid. A closely related species, Crataegus cuneata (Japanese hawthorn, called sanzashi in Japanese) is used in a similar manner. Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in herbal medicine where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function. The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used black hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: ka«Ça; approximate pronunciation: kasha) for food, and red hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: «Çup«Çi; approximate pronunciation: shupshi) in traditional medicine. Side effects Overdose can cause cardiac arrhythmia and low blood pressure, while milder side effects include nausea and dizziness. Patients taking digoxin should avoid taking hawthorn. =Landscaping= Many species and hybrids are used as ornamental and street trees. The common hawthorn is extensively used in Europe as a hedge plant. During the British Agricultural Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, hawthorn saplings were mass propagated in nurseries to create the new field boundaries required by the Inclosure Acts.Williamson, Tom (2013), An Environmental History of Wildlife in England 1650 ‚Äì 1950 Bloomsbury Academic, (p. 104) Several cultivars of the Midland hawthorn C. laevigata have been selected for their pink or red flowers. Hawthorns are among the trees most recommended for water conservation landscapes. =Grafting= Hawthorn rootstock on a medlar tree in Totnes, United Kingdom Hawthorn can be used as a rootstock in the practice of grafting. It is graft-compatible with Mespilus (medlar), and with pear, and makes a hardier rootstock than quince, but the thorny suckering habit of the hawthorn can be problematic. Seedlings of Crataegus monogyna have been used to graft multiple species on the same trunk, such as pink hawthorn, pear tree, and medlar, the result being trees which give pink and white flowers in May and fruits during the summer. \\"Chip budding\\" has also been performed on hawthorn trunks to have branches of several varieties on the same tree. Such trees can be seen in Vigo, Spain, and in the northwest of France (mainly in Brittany). =Bonsai= Many species of Hawthorn make excellent bonsai trees. They are grown and enjoyed for their display of flowers. =Other uses= The wood of some Crataegus species is hard and resistant to rot. In rural North America, it was prized for use as tool handles and fence posts. First Nations people of western Canada used the thorns for durable fish hooks and minor skin surgeries. Folklore The Scots saying \\"Ne'er cast a cloot til Mey's oot\\" conveys a warning not to shed any cloots (clothes) before the summer has fully arrived and the Mayflowers (hawthorn blossoms) are in full bloom. The custom of employing the flowering branches for decorative purposes on 1 May is of very early origin, but since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752, the tree has rarely been in full bloom in England before the second week of that month. In the Scottish Highlands, the flowers may be seen as late as the middle of June. The hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been used by them to deck the altar of Hymenaios. The supposition that the tree was the source of Jesus's crown of thorns doubtless gave rise around 1911 to the tradition among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on Good Friday, and probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that ill luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns. Branches of Glastonbury thorn (C. monogyna 'Biflora', sometimes called C. oxyacantha var. praecox), which flowers both in December and in spring, were formerly highly valued in England, on account of the legend that the tree was originally the staff of Joseph of Arimathea. Robert Graves, in his book The White Goddess, traces and reinterprets many European legends and myths in which the whitethorn (hawthorn), also called the May-tree, is central. Hawthorn trees demarcate a garden plot, according to legend, they are strongly associated with the fairies In Celtic lore, the hawthorn plant was used commonly for inscriptions along with yew and apple. It was once said to heal the broken heart. In Ireland, the red fruit is, or was, called the Johnny MacGorey or Magory. Serbian folklore that spread across Balkan notes that hawthorn (Serbian –≥–ª–æ–≥ or glog) is essential to kill vampires, and stakes used for their slaying must be made from the wood of the thorn tree. In Gaelic folklore, hawthorn (in Scottish Gaelic, sgitheach and in Irish, sceach) 'marks the entrance to the otherworld' and is strongly associated with the fairies.Campbell, John Gregorson (1900, 1902, 2005) The Gaelic Otherworld. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. p.345 Lore has it that it is very unlucky to cut the tree at any time other than when it is in bloom; however, during this time, it is commonly cut and decorated as a May bush (see Beltane).Danaher, Kevin (1972) The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs Dublin, Mercier. pp.86‚Äì127 This warning persists to modern times; it has been questioned by folklorist Bob Curran whether the ill luck of the DeLorean Motor Company was associated with the destruction of a fairy thorn to make way for a production facility. The superstitious dread of harming hawthorn trees prevalent in the British Isles may also be connected to an old belief that hawthorns, and more especially 'lone thorns' (self-seeded specimens standing in isolation from other trees) originate from lightning or thunderbolts and give protection from lightning strikes.Hope, Alec Derwent, A Midsummer Eve's Dream: variations on a theme by William Dunbar pub. The Viking Press, New York 1970. Hawthorn trees are often found beside clootie wells; at these types of holy wells, they are sometimes known as rag trees, for the strips of cloth which are tied to them as part of healing rituals.Healy, Elizabeth (2002) In Search of Ireland's Holy Wells. Dublin, Wolfhound Press pp.56‚Äì7, 69, 81 'When all fruit fails, welcome haws' was once a common expression in Ireland. According to a medieval legend, the Glastonbury thorn, C. monogyna 'Biflora', which flowers twice annually, was supposed to have miraculously grown from a walking stick planted by Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury in Somerset, England. The original tree was destroyed in the sixteenth century during the English Reformation, but several cultivars have survived. Since the reign of King James I, it has been a Christmas custom to send a sprig of Glastonbury thorn flowers to the Sovereign, which is used to decorate the royal family's dinner table.Palmer, Martin and Palmer, Nigel ( The Spiritual Traveler: England, Scotland, Wales : the Guide to Sacred Sites and Pilgrim Routes in Britain, Hidden Spring, (p. 200) In the Victorian era, the hawthorn represented hope in the language of flowers. The hawthorn ‚Äì species unspecified ‚Äì is the state flower of Missouri. The legislation designating it as such was introduced by Sarah Lucille Turner, one of the first two women to serve in the Missouri House of Representatives. Propagation Although it is commonly stated that hawthorns can be propagated by cutting, this is difficult to achieve with rootless stem pieces. Small plants or suckers are often transplanted from the wild. Seeds require stratification and take one or two years to germinate.Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada. Macmillan, New York. Seed germination is improved if the pyrenes that contain the seed are subjected to extensive drying at room temperature, before stratification.Bujarska- Borkowska, B. (2002) Breaking of seed dormancy, germination and seedling emergence of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.). Dendrobiology. 47(Supplement): 61‚Äì70. Uncommon forms can be grafted onto seedlings of other species. Taxonomy The number of species in the genus depends on taxonomic interpretation. Some botanists in the past recognised 1000 or more species, many of which are apomictic microspecies. A reasonable number is estimated to be 200 species. The genus is classified into sections which are further divided into series. Series Montaninsulae has not yet been assigned to a section.

They are considered one of the most important and influential artists of all time in Latin America. History Los Jaivas appeared in Chilean music in 1963 as a progressive-rock-andino group, mixing rock with South American ancestral music. The Parra brothers met Mario Mutis and Eduardo \\"Gato\\" Alquinta (gato is the Spanish word for cat) in their childhood and joined to play music. They acquired fame in Vi√±a del Mar, by playing at diverse parties and shows. The band took refuge in Argentina after the military dictatorship took over in Chile. In 1977, they headed to France, where they resided for a long time. The first major change in the band occurred in 1988 when Gabriel died in Peru in a car crash. His daughter Juanita took his place behind the drums. In January 2003, the main singer, Gato Alquinta, died in Coquimbo, Chile, of a heart attack while swimming in the sea. Gato's three sons soon joined the band to replace him: Ankatu (guitar), Eloy (saxophone) and Aurora (vocals). Aurora left shortly after, and Eloy died of a heart attack in 2004 . Ankatu, however, is still a member of the band.  Name  The original name of the band, proposed by Rolando Fuentes (a friend of founding member Claudio Parra during high school) was High-bass.This version was told by Claudio Parra and Rolando Fuentes to the audience during a concert in November 4th, 2017 at Colegio Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Apoquindo, Santiago, Chile At that time in Chile, it was customary to use English names for musical bands. Another source indicates that the name is a reference to the members differences in height, since the word in Spanish for bass guitar is the same as that for short (bajo). Another source explains the name as a reference to the bass guitar played at a very high volume compared to the other instruments. They quickly realized that an English-sounding name was not appropriate for a folk band, so they changed it to Jaivas (HIGH-BASS), a \\"Chileanized\\" pronunciation of \\"high bass\\" which ignores the fact that bass (the musical instrument) rhymes with base and lace in English, as opposed to the word bass (the fish) which rhymes with cass and lass, which is how the syllable vas is pronounced in the band's name. The spelling of Jaivas is a misspelling of the word jaibas, which means crabs in Spanish.http://etimologias.dechile.net/?jaiba  Homage  A homage was made to Los Jaivas on the occasion of their 50th anniversary, at the Festival del Huaso de Olmu√© realised in Olmu√©, Chile, on 23‚Äì26 January 2014.http://www.tvn.cl/especiales/olmue2014/artistas/los-jaivas-1043460 Members *Alan Reale (guitar, vocals) *Juanita Parra (drums) *Mario Mutis (vocals, electric guitar, bass, percussion) *Claudio Parra (piano, vocals) *Francisco Bosco (saxophone, organ) *Carlos Cabezas (charango, vocals, violin, flute) =Former members= *Ankatu Alquinta (vocals, guitar) *Gabriel Parra ‚Ä† (drums) *Eduardo \\"Gato\\" Alquinta ‚Ä† (vocals, guitar) *Eduardo Parra (organ, percussion) *Eloy Alquinta ‚Ä† (vocals, saxophone, percussion) *Aurora Alquinta (vocals) *Carlos Edumuybueno (guitar) *Julio Anderson (bass) *Carlos Canzani (bass, guitar) *Alberto Ledo (charango, quena) *Marcelo Mu√±oz (drums) *Fernando Flores (bass) Discography *El Volant√≠n 1971 *Todos juntos 1972 *La Ventana 1973 *Palomita blanca (Movie soundtrack) 1973 (Released in 1995) *Sue√±os de Am√©rica 1974 *Los Jaivas (El indio) 1975 *Canci√≥n Del Sur 1977 *Mambo de Machaguay (Compilation) 1978 *Alturas de Macchu Picchu (based on lyrics from The Heights of Macchu Picchu by Pablo Neruda) 1981 *Aconcagua 1982 *Obras de Violeta Parra 1984 *Si tu no est√°s 1989 *Hijos de la Tierra 1995 *Trilogia: El Rencuentro 1997 *Mamalluca 1999 *En El Bar-Restaurant Lo Que Nunca Se Supo (Compilation) 2000 *Los Jaivas En Concierto: Gira Chile 2000 (Live) 2000 *Arrebol 2001 *Obras Cumbres (Compilation) 2003 *La Vor√°gine I, Pan Negro (Improvisations 1969-70) 2003 *La Vor√°gine II, La Reforma (Improvisations 1969-70) 2003 *La Vor√°gine III, El T√≥tem (Improvisations 1969-70) 2003 *La Vor√°gine IV, Mucha Intensidad (Improvisations 1969-70) 2003 *La Vor√°gine V, ¬øQu√© Hacer?

The Canadian flora is depauperate because of the near total glaciation event in the Pleistocene. Due to the vast area of Canada, a tree that is common in one area may be completely absent in another. In particular, many warm- temperate trees can only be grown on the mild Pacific coast (where gardens may contain additional species not listed here).

The five typical aspens are all native to cold regions with cool summers, in the north of the Northern Hemisphere, extending south at high altitudes in the mountains. The White Poplar, by contrast, is native to warmer regions, with hot, dry summers. These trees are all medium-sized deciduous trees ranging tall. All of the species in section Populus typically grow in large clonal colonies derived from a single seedling, and spreading by means of root suckers; new stems in the colony may appear at up to 30‚Äì40 metres from the previous trees. Each individual tree can live for 40‚Äì150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long- lived, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground, spreading about a metre per year, sometimes eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts can grow from the roots. One colony of American aspen (P. tremuloides) in Utah, given the nickname of \\"Pando\\", has been estimated to be 80,000 years old (disputed), making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens. Species Some of the species in the section are: *Populus adenopoda ‚Äì Chinese aspen (China, south of P. tremula) *Populus alba ‚Äì white poplar (northwest Africa, southern Europe, east to central Asia) *Populus davidiana ‚Äì Korean aspen (Korea) *Populus grandidentata ‚Äì bigtooth aspen (eastern North America, south of P. tremuloides) *Populus koreana ‚Äì Korean poplar (Korea) *Populus ningshanica *Populus qiongdaoensis *Populus rotundifolia *Populus sieboldii ‚Äì Japanese aspen (Japan) *Populus simonii ‚Äì Simon's poplar (Korea) *Populus suaveolens ‚Äì Manchurian poplar (Korea) *Populus tomentosa, Chinese white poplar (China) *Populus tremula ‚Äì Eurasian aspen (northern Europe and Asia) *Populus tremuloides ‚Äì American aspen (northern and western North America) *Populus wulianensis Natural hybrids between species in the section include: *Populus √ó canescens: grey poplar, P. alba √ó P. tremula *Populus √ó hopeiensis: P. davidiana √ó P. tomentosa *Populus √ó pseudotomentosa: P. adenopoda √ó P. tomentosa Ecology Aspens do not thrive very well in the shade, and it is difficult for aspen seedlings to grow in an already mature aspen stand. Fire indirectly benefits aspen trees, since it allows the saplings to flourish in open sunlight in the burned landscape. Lately, aspens have an increased popularity in forestry, mostly because of their fast growth rate and ability to regenerate from sprouts, making the reforestation after harvesting much cheaper, since no planting or sowing is required. In contrast with many trees, aspen bark is base-rich, meaning that aspens are important hosts for bryophytesThe Biodiversity and Management of Aspen woodlands: Proceedings of a one-day conference held in Kingussie, Scotland, on 25th May 2001 and act as food plants for the larvae of butterfly (Lepidoptera) species‚Äîsee List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars. Young aspen bark is an important seasonal forage for the european hare and other animals in early spring. Aspen is also a tree of choice of the european beaver. Uses Aspen wood is white and soft, but fairly strong, and has low flammability. It has a number of uses, notably for making matches and paper where its low flammability makes it safer to use than most other woods. Shredded aspen wood is used for packing and stuffing, sometimes called excelsior (wood wool). It is also a popular animal bedding, since it lacks the phenols associated with pine and juniper, which are thought to cause respiratory system ailments in some animals. Heat-treated aspen is a popular material for the interiors of a sauna. While standing trees sometimes tend to rot from the heart outward, the dry timber weathers very well, becoming silvery-grey and resistant to rotting and warping, and has traditionally been used for rural construction in the northwestern regions of Russia (especially for roofing, in the form of thin slats). The Ojibwe used the inner bark of the trunk as a poultice, and the Cree ate the inner bark in the spring as a mild purgative.Native American ethnobotany, pp. 427‚Äì433, Daniel E. Moerman 1998.

The Fox Broadcasting Company, commonly referred to as the Fox network or simply Fox, is an American commercial broadcasting television network owned by the Fox Corporation. Though it was officially launched on October 9, 1986, Fox began its official primetime setup on April 5, 1987, with the series Married... with Children and The Tracey Ullman Show airing that night. As of October 2012, Fox maintains 19.5-hours of programming per week. The animated comedy series The Simpsons is one of Fox's most popular shows, becoming the network's first series to rank among the top 30-highest-rated shows of a television season after its original debut, and is the longest running sitcom, as well as animated series, of all time, contributing to the channel's success. According to Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly, \\"The Simpsons turned Fox from the little network that could into the little network that could not be ignored.\\" The science fiction television series The X-Files also contributed to the network's success, which led to two spin-offs Millennium and The Lone Gunmen. Fox began airing in high-definition on September 12, 2004, with a series of National Football League (NFL) American football games. Fox had a programming block for children titled Fox Kids, which ran from September 8, 1990 to September 7, 2002. Unlike the \\"three larger networks\\", which aired primetime programming from 8 to 11 p.m. (EST) Mondays to Saturdays and 7 to 11 p.m. (EST) Sundays, Fox has traditionally avoided programming in the 10 p.m. (EST) time interval, leaving that hour to affiliates to program locally. On April 21, 2012, Fox celebrated its 25th- anniversary, with a two-hour television special featuring people related to Fox and its shows. It presented Fox's programs 24, American Idol, Cops, Family Guy, Married... with Children, The Simpsons, and The X-Files, among other programs. The network's adult cartoons are listed under the Animation Domination banner, which is a Sunday night programming block. Fox is a full member of the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA) and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB).

The Lorentz force on the particles acts perpendicular to both the magnetic field lines and the particles' motion through them, creating an acceleration of charged particles that causes them to emit radiation as a result of the acceleration they undergo as they spiral around the lines of the magnetic field. The name of this radiation derives from the cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator used since the 1930s to create highly energetic particles for study. The cyclotron makes use of the circular orbits that charged particles exhibit in a uniform magnetic field. Furthermore, the period of the orbit is independent of the energy of the particles, allowing the cyclotron to operate at a set frequency. Cyclotron radiation is emitted by all charged particles travelling through magnetic fields, not just those in cyclotrons. Cyclotron radiation from plasma in the interstellar medium or around black holes and other astronomical phenomena is an important source of information about distant magnetic fields. Properties The power (energy per unit time) of the emission of each electron can be calculated: : {-dE \\\\over dt}={\\\\sigma_t B^2 v^2 \\\\over c \\\\mu_o} where E is energy, t is time, \\\\sigma_t is the Thomson cross section (total, not differential), B is the magnetic field strength, v is the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field, c is the speed of light and \\\\mu_o is the permeability of free space. Cyclotron radiation has a spectrum with its main spike at the same fundamental frequency as the particle's orbit, and harmonics at higher integral factors. Harmonics are the result of imperfections in the actual emission environment, which also create a broadening of the spectral lines. The most obvious source of line broadening is non-uniformities in the magnetic field; as an electron passes from one area of the field to another, its emission frequency will change with the strength of the field. Other sources of broadening include collisional broadening as the electron will invariably fail to follow a perfect orbit, distortions of the emission caused by interactions with the surrounding plasma, and relativistic effects if the charged particles are sufficiently energetic. When the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, cyclotron radiation is known as synchrotron radiation. The recoil experienced by a particle emitting cyclotron radiation is called radiation reaction. Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron. Cyclotrons are prime examples of systems which experience radiation reaction. Examples In the context of magnetic fusion energy, cyclotron radiation losses translate into a requirement for a minimum plasma energy density in relation to the magnetic field energy density. Cyclotron radiation would likely be produced in a high altitude nuclear explosion. Gamma rays produced by the explosion would ionize atoms in the upper atmosphere and those free electrons would interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce cyclotron radiation in the form of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). This phenomenon is of concern to the military as the EMP may damage solid state electronic equipment.

Biography=Early years= Lamartine was born in M√¢con, Burgundy, on 21 October 1790. His family were members of the French provincial nobility, and he spent his youth at the family estate. Lamartine is famous for his partly autobiographical poem, \\"Le lac\\" (\\"The Lake\\"), which describes in retrospect the fervent love shared by a couple from the point of view of the bereaved man. Lamartine was masterly in his use of French poetic forms. Raised a devout Catholic, Lamartine became a pantheist, writing Jocelyn and La Chute d'un ange. He wrote Histoire des Girondins in 1847 in praise of the Girondists. Lamartine made his entrance into the field of poetry with a masterpiece, Les M√©ditations Po√©tiques (1820), and awoke to find himself famous. He was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1825. He worked for the French embassy in Italy from 1825 to 1828. In 1829, he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He was elected a deputy in 1833. In 1835 he published the \\"Voyage en Orient\\", a brilliant and bold account of the journey he had just made, in royal luxury, to the countries of the Orient, and in the course of which he had lost his only daughter. From then on he confined himself to prose. =Political career= Around 1830, Lamartine's opinions shifted in the direction of liberalism. When elected in 1833 to the National Assembly, he quickly founded his own \\"Social Party\\" with some influence from Saint-Simonian ideas and established himself as a prominent critic of the July Monarchy, becoming more and more of a republican in the monarchy's last years. He was briefly in charge of the government during the turbulence of 1848. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 24 February 1848 to 11 May 1848. Due to his great age, Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure, Chairman of the Provisional Government, effectively delegated many of his duties to Lamartine. He was then a member of the Executive Commission, the political body which served as France's joint Head of State. Lamartine was instrumental in the founding of the Second Republic of France, having met with Republican Deputies and journalists in the H√¥tel de Ville to agree on the makeup of its provisional government. Lamartine himself was chosen to declare the Republic in traditional form in the balcony of the H√¥tel de Ville, and ensured the continuation of the Tricouleur as the flag of the nation. On 25 February 1848 Lamartine said about the Tricolored Flag: \\"I spoke as a citizen earlier, well! Now listen to me, your Foreign Minister. If I remove the tricolor, know it, you will remove half the external force of France! Because Europe knows the flag of his defeats and of our victories in the flag of the Republic and of the Empire. By seeing the red flag, they'll see the flag of a party! This is the flag of France, it is the flag of our victorious armies, it is the flag of our triumphs that must be addressed before Europe. France and the tricolor is the same thought, the same prestige, even terror, if necessary, for our enemies! Consider how much blood you would have to make for another flag fame! Citizens, for me, the red flag, I am not adopting it, and I'll tell you why I'm against with all the strength of my patriotism. It's that the tricolor has toured the world with the Republic and the Empire with your freedoms and your glory, and the red flag was that around the Champ-de- Mars, dragged into the people's blood.\\"Alphonse de Lamartine, Trois mois au pouvoir, Paris, Michel L√©vy, 1848. During his term as a politician in the Second Republic, he led efforts that culminated in the abolition of slavery and the death penalty, as well as the enshrinement of the right to work and the short-lived national workshop programs. A political idealist who supported democracy and pacifism, his moderate stance on most issues caused many of his followers to desert him. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the presidential election of 10 December 1848, receiving fewer than 19,000 votes. He subsequently retired from politics and dedicated himself to literature. =Final years and legacy= Lamartine photographed in 1865 He published volumes on the most varied subjects (history, criticism, personal confidences, literary conversations) especially during the Empire, when, having retired to private life and having become the prey of his creditors, he condemned himself to what he calls \\"literary hard-labor to exist and pay his debts\\". Lamartine ended his life in poverty, publishing monthly installments of the Cours familier de litt√©rature to support himself. He died in Paris in 1869. Nobel prize winner Fr√©d√©ric Mistral's fame was in part due to the praise of Alphonse de Lamartine in the fortieth edition of his periodical Cours familier de litt√©rature, following the publication of Mistral's long poem Mir√®io. Mistral is the most revered writer in modern Occitan literature. Lamartine is considered to be the first French romantic poet (though Charles-Julien Lioult de Ch√™nedoll√© was working on similar innovations at the same time), and was acknowledged by Paul Verlaine and the Symbolists as an important influence. Other interests Lamartine's House in Plovdiv, Bulgaria Alphonse de Lamartine was also an Orientalist with a particular interest in Lebanon and the Middle East. He travelled to Lebanon, Syria and the Holy Land in 1832‚Äì33. During that trip, while he and his wife, the painter and sculptor Elisa de Lamartine, were in Beirut, on 7 December 1832, their only remaining child, Julia, died at ten years of age. During his trip to Lebanon he had met prince Bashir Shihab II and prince Simon Karam, who were enthusiasts of poetry. A valley in Lebanon is still called the Valley of Lamartine as a commemoration of that visit, and the Lebanon cedar forest still harbors the \\"Lamartine Cedar\\", which is said to be the cedar under which Lamartine had sat 200 years ago. Lamartine was so influenced by his trip that he staged his 1838 epic poem La Chute d'un ange (The Fall of an Angel) in Lebanon. Raised by his mother to respect animal life, he found the eating of meat repugnant, saying 'One does not have one heart for Man and one for animals. One has a heart or one does not'. His writings in La chute d‚Äôun Ange (1838) and Les confidences (1849) would be taken up by supporters of vegetarianism in the twentieth century.

It is distinguished by a natural, four-beat, lateral gait called the paso llano. This breed is protected by the Peruvian government through Decree number 25919 of Peru enacted on November 28, 1992, and has been declared a Cultural Heritage of the Nation by the National Institute of Culture (INC). Due to the isolation suffered for about 400 years and the selection made by their breeders, this breed is very particular in their body proportions and an ambling gait or \\"paso llano\\" that is characteristic. It is typical of the northern Peruvian regions of the country from which it originated. Trujillo city is considered the \\"Cradle of typical Peruvian Paso Horse.\\" History Smooth-gaited horses, generally known as Palfreys, existed in the Middle Ages, and the Jennet in particular was noted for its ambling gaits.Bennett, Deb. (1998). Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship, First Edition, Amigo Publications. Peruvian Pasos trace their ancestry to these ambling Jennets; as well as to the Barb, which contributed strength and stamina; and to the Andalusian which added style, conformation and action.\\"Peruvian Paso.\\" Horse Breeds of the World, International Museum of the Horse. Accessed July 4, 2008Albright, Verne. \\"Peruvian Paso\\" . Oklahoma State University. Accessed July 03, 2008. Horses arrived in South America during the Spanish Conquest, beginning with the arrival of Pizarro in 1531. Foundation bloodstock came from Spain, Jamaica, Panama and other areas of Central America. Importations increased after 1542, when the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castilla. This later became the Viceroyalty of Peru, an important center of Spain's New World viceroyalties in the eighteenth century. Peruvian Paso in traditional equipment Don Pedro Venturo Zapata was a major breeder of the Paso horse in his \\"Hacienda Higuereta y Anexos - Negociacion Vinicola Pedro Venturo S.A.\\" from 1925 to 1952. Once in Peru, they were used primarily for transportation and breeding stock. In the north of Peru, the vast size of sugar and cotton plantations meant that overseers needed to travel long distances, often taking days to cross the plantation. In the south of Peru, the arid deserts that separated settlements required sturdy, strong horses. In both cases, smooth-gaited horses with good endurance were required. On the other hand, Peru did not develop a livestock-based economy, and thus did not need to breed for the speed or agility characteristic of stock horses. Over time, Peruvian breeders kept the bloodlines clean and selectively bred primarily for gait, conformation, and temperament. They wanted strong, hardy animals that were comfortable to ride and easy to control. Over four centuries, their dedication to breeding only the best gaited bloodstock resulted in the modern Peruvian Paso. A decline in the use of the Peruvian Paso horse was seen in the southern part of Peru in the early 1900s, following the building of major highways that allowed motor travel to replace the use of the horse. Many of the major breeders in the area gave their best horses away to peasants living in the nearby quebradas (valleys). It was in one of these quebradas that breeder Gustavo de la Borda found the horse that was to become the most important modern sire in the breed, Sol de Oro (Viejo).Sol De Oro The Peruvian Paso continued to flourish in the northern regions because it was still needed for transportation on the haciendas. This changed with the harsh Agrarian Reforms instituted by the government of Juan Velasco Alvarado in the late 1960s that had a devastating effect on the Peruvian Paso horse within Peru. Major breeding operations were broken up and breeding stock was lost. Because interest in the Peruvian Paso horse was growing in the United States and Central America at the same time, many of the finest Peruvian Paso horses were exported, leading to a period where it appeared the Peruvian Paso horse would fade in its homeland. The past thirty years have seen a resurgence in the Peruvian Paso horse's fortune in Peru. The annual National Show in Lima is a major event in Peruvian cultural life. The Peruvian Paso has been declared a Patrimonio Cultural (Cultural Heritage) of Peru in an attempt to shore up the breed within the country. There are now laws in place that restrict the export of national champion horses. Peruvian Paso horses are noted internationally for their good temperament and comfortable ride. As of 2003, there are approximately 25,000 horses worldwide, used for pleasure riding, trail, horse shows, parades, and endurance riding. Characteristics The gaits of the Peruvian Paso are natural, as shown by this foal =Appearance= The horse is medium-sized, usually standing between tall, with an elegant yet powerful build. The Peruvian horse has a deep chest, heavy neck and body with substance without any trace of being hound gutted in the flank area. A low set, quiet tail, clamped tightly between the buttocks is a vital quality. Stallions have a broader chest and larger neck than mares, and are known for their quality temperament. The coat color can be varied; and is seen in chestnut, black, bay, brown, buckskin, palomino, gray, roan or dun. Solid colors, grays and dark skin are considered the most desirable. The mane and forelock are lustrous, fine and abundant. White markings are acceptable on the legs and face. =Gait= Instead of a trot, the Peruvian Paso performs an ambling four beat gait between the walk and the trot. There are two official gaits, called the \\"Paso Llano\\" or \\"even step\\", and the \\"sobreandando\\" which is a bit closer in timing to the pace. Both gaits can be performed at a variety of speeds. The fast sobreandando is often the speed of a canter. Both acceptable gaits are lateral, having four beats and is performed in a lateral sequence ‚Äî left hind, left fore, right hind, right fore. The Peruvian Horse can also canter, will trot and pace at liberty, and do a natural relaxed walk. The Peruvian Paso performs two variations of the four-beat gait. The first, the paso llano, is isochronous, meaning that there are four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm. This is the preferred gait. The second gait, the sobreandando, is often faster. Instead of four equal beats, the lateral beats are closer together in a 1-2, 3-4 rhythm, with the pause between the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other side is longer. Peruvian Paso in motion This characteristic gait was utilized for the purpose of covering long distances over a short period of time without tiring the horse or rider. The gait is natural and does not require extensive training. Purebred Peruvian Paso foals can be seen gaiting alongside their dams within a few hours of their birth. The gait supplies essentially none of the vertical bounce that is characteristic of the trot, and hence posting (moving up and down with each of the horse's footfalls) is unnecessary. It is also very stable, as the execution of the gait means there are always two, and sometimes three, feet on the ground.Example of Peruvian Paso's execution of the gait Because the rider feels no strain or jolt, gaited horses such as the Peruvian Paso are often popular with riders who have back trouble. Termino A unique trait of the Peruvian Paso gait is termino -- an outward swinging leg action, originating from the shoulder, in which the front lower legs roll to the outside during the stride forward, similar to a swimmer's arms. Individual horses may have more or less termino. High lift or wide termino is not necessarily a sign of a well gaited horse; in fact it may be detrimental to a good gait. =Br√≠o= Br√≠o refers to a horse‚Äôs vigor, energy, exuberance, courage and liveliness; it automatically implies that these qualities are willingly placed in the service of the rider. Horses with true brio are willing workers. Their attention does not wander but is focused on the handler or rider, and thus they are quick to react and fast to learn. Horses with brio attract attention, and combined with the stamina of the breed have reserves they can tap to travel long distances for many hours. Breeders and judges look for Br√≠o, often translated as \\"spirit,\\" but this does not capture the complexity of the term. Br√≠o describes a somewhat contradictory temperament, which combines arrogance, spirit, and the sense of always being on parade, with a willingness to please the rider. Br√≠o is an intangible quality of controlled energy that creates a metamorphosis in ordinary-looking horses and is an important trait of the Peruvian Paso. Peruvian Pasos showing their gait =Genetic conditions= Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD) is a connective tissue disorder akin to Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome now being researched in all breeds of horse, but was originally noted in the Peruvian Paso. Originally thought to be a condition of overwork and older age, the disease is now recognized as hereditary and has been seen in horses of all ages, including foals. The latest research has led to the renaming of the disease after the possible systemic and hereditary components now being delineated by the University of Georgia.

The two best-known and most important events are The National Horse Competition Caballo de Paso Peruano held in Pachacamac and at the Internacional de la Primavera during the months of September and October in Trujillo city and during the international Marinera Festival in January. Peru's National Institute of Culture has declared that the horses are part of Peru's national cultural heritage. Name Because of the shared word Paso, a close relationship between the Peruvian Paso and the Paso Fino breed is incorrectly assumed. \\"Paso\\" simply means \\"step,\\" in Spanish, and does not imply a common breed or origin. Although the two breeds share ancestors in the Old World, and have some similarities, they were developed independently for different purposes. The two breeds are different and easily distinguishable. The Peruvian is somewhat larger, deeper in the body and wider. The Paso Fino is not bred for \\"termino\\" in its stride. The Peruvian Paso has been called the \\"national horse\\" of Peru. On the other hand, the Paso Fino was developed from horses throughout northern Latin America and the Caribbean, with major centers of development in Colombia and Puerto Rico. The Peruvian Paso is also increasingly referred to in North America as the \\"Peruvian Horse\\" in an attempt to differentiate its breed from that of the Paso Fino.

He was a professor at the Colegio de San Nicol√°s Obispo in Valladolid and was ousted in 1792. He served in a church in Colima and then in Dolores. After his arrival, he was shocked by the rich soil he had found. He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes, but in New Spain (modern Mexico) growing these crops was discouraged or prohibited by the authorities so as to avoid competition with imports from Spain.Mexico: From Independence to Revolution, 1810‚Äì1910, edited by W. Dirk Raat, p. 21 In 1810 he gave the famous speech, \\"Cry of Dolores\\", calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Fernando VII (held captive by Napoleon) by revolting against the European-born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy. He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians who attacked and killed both Spanish Peninsulares and Criollo elites, even though Hidalgo's troops lacked training and were poorly armed. These troops ran into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops; most of Hidalgo's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calder√≥n Bridge.Minster, Christopher. Mexican War of Independence: The Battle of Calderon Bridge After the battle, Hidalgo and his remaining troops fled north, but Hidalgo was betrayed, captured and executed.  Early years  Hidalgo was the second-born child of Don Crist√≥bal Hidalgo y Costilla Espinoza de los Monteros and Do√±a Ana Mar√≠a Gallaga Mandarte Villase√±or, both criollos. On his maternal side, he was of Basque ancestry. His most recent identifiable Spanish ancestor was his maternal great-grandfather, who was from Durango, Biscay. On his paternal side, he descended from criollo families native of Tejupilco, who were well-respected families within the criollo community. Hidalgo's father was an hacienda manager in Valladolid, Michoac√°n, where Hidalgo spent the majority of his life. Eight days after his birth, Hidalgo was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in the parish church of Cuitzeo de los Naranjos. Hidalgo's parents had three other sons; Jos√© Joaqu√≠n, Manuel Mariano, and Jos√© Mar√≠a, before their mother died when Hildalgo was nine years old. A step brother named Mariano was born later. In 1759, Charles III of Spain ascended to the throne of Spain; he soon sent out a visitor- general with the power to investigate and reform all parts of colonial government. During this period, Don Crist√≥bal was determined that Miguel and his younger brother Joaqu√≠n should both enter the priesthood and hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Being of significant means he paid for all of his sons to receive the best education the region had to offer. After receiving private instruction, likely from the priest of the neighboring parish, Hidalgo was ready for further education.  Education, ordination, and early career  Portrait of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1753-1811), by Jos√© In√©s Tovilla, 1912 At the age of fifteen Hidalgo was sent to Valladolid (now Morelia), Michoac√°n, to study at the Colegio de San Francisco Javier with the Jesuits, along with his brothers. When the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767, he entered the Colegio de San Nicol√°s, where he studied for the priesthood. Etching depicting Hidalgo's portrait, on a pamphlet celebrating Mexican independence. He completed his preparatory education in 1770. After this, he went to the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico in Mexico City for further study, earning his degree in philosophy and theology in 1773. His education for the priesthood was traditional, with subjects in Latin, rhetoric and logic. Like many priests in Mexico, he learned some Indian languages, such as Nahuatl, Otomi, and Pur√©pecha. He also studied Italian and French, which were not commonly studied in Mexico at this time. He earned the nickname \\"El Zorro\\" (\\"The Fox\\") for his reputation for cleverness at school. Hidalgo's study of French allowed him to read and study works of the Enlightenment current in Europe but, at the same time, forbidden by the Catholic church in Mexico. Hidalgo was ordained as a priest in 1778 when he was 25 years old. From 1779 to 1792, he dedicated himself to teaching at the Colegio de San Nicol√°s Obispo in Valladolid (now Morelia); it was \\"one of the most important educational centers of the viceroyalty.\\"Virginia Guedea, \\"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 640 He was a professor of Latin grammar and arts, as well as a theology professor. Beginning in 1787, he was named treasurer, vice-rector and secretary, becoming dean of the school in 1790 when he was 39. As rector, Hidalgo continued studying the liberal ideas that were coming from France and other parts of Europe. Authorities ousted him in 1792 for revising traditional teaching methods there, but also for \\"irregular handling of some funds.\\"Guedea, \\"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla\\", p. 641. The Church sent him to work at the parishes of Colima and San Felipe Torres Mochas until he became the parish priest in Dolores, Guanajuato, succeeding his brother Jos√© Joaqu√≠n a few weeks afrter his death on 19 September 1802. Although Hidalgo had a traditional education for the priesthood, as an educator at the Colegio de San Nicol√°s he had innovated in teaching methods and curriculum. In his personal life, he did not advocate or live the way expected of 18th-century Mexican priests. Instead, his studies of Enlightenment-era ideas caused him to challenge traditional political and religious views. He questioned the absolute authority of the Spanish king and challenged numerous ideas presented by the Church, including the power of the popes, the virgin birth, and clerical celibacy. As a secular cleric, he was not bound by a vow of poverty, so he, like many other secular priests, pursued business activities, including owning three haciendas;Guedea, \\"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla\\", p. 640. but contrary to his vow of chastity, he formed liaisons with women. One was with Manuela Ramos Pichardo, with whom he had two children, as well as a child with Bibiana Lucero. He later lived with a woman named Mar√≠a Manuela Herrera, fathering two daughters out of wedlock with her, and later fathered three other children with a woman named Josefa Quintana. These actions resulted in his appearance before the Court of the Inquisition, although the court did not find him guilty. Hidalgo was egalitarian. As parish priest in both San Felipe and Dolores, he opened his house to Indians and mestizos as well as creoles.  Parish priest in Dolores  Statue of Hidalgo in front of his church at Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato In 1803, aged 50, he arrived in Dolores accompanied by his family that included a younger brother, a cousin, two half sisters, as well as Mar√≠a and their two children. He obtained this parish in spite of his hearing before the Inquisition, which did not stop his secular practices. After Hidalgo settled in Dolores, he turned over most of the clerical duties to one of his vicars, Fr. Francisco Iglesias, and devoted himself almost exclusively to commerce, intellectual pursuits and humanitarian activity. He spent much of his time studying literature, scientific works, grape cultivation, and the raising of silkworms. He used the knowledge that he gained to promote economic activities for the poor and rural people in his area. He established factories to make bricks and pottery and trained indigenous people in the making of leather. He promoted beekeeping. He was interested in promoting activities of commercial value to use the natural resources of the area to help the poor. His goal was to make the Indians and mestizos more self-reliant and less dependent on Spanish economic policies. However, these activities violated policies designed to protect agriculture and industry in Spain, and Hidalgo was ordered to stop them. These policies as well as exploitation of mixed race castas fostered resentment in Hidalgo toward the Peninsular-born Spaniards in Mexico. In addition to restricting economic activities in Mexico, Spanish mercantile practices caused misery for the native peoples. A drought in 1807‚Äì1808 caused a famine in the Dolores area, and, rather than releasing stored grain to market, Spanish merchants chose instead to block its release, speculating on yet higher prices. Hidalgo lobbied against these practices.  \\"Grito de Dolores\\" or \\"Cry of Dolores\\"  Mexico's National Palace after Hidalgo's death and is rung each year on independence day by the president Fearing his arrest, Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio, as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo, to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release prison inmates in Dolores on the night of 15 September 1810. They managed to set eighty free. On the morning of 16 September 1810, Hidalgo celebrated Mass, which was attended by about 300 people, including hacienda owners, local politicians and Spaniards. There he gave what is now known as the Grito de Dolores (Cry of Dolores), calling the people of his parish to leave their homes and join with him in a rebellion against the current government, in the name of their King. Hidalgo's Grito did not condemn the notion of monarchy or criticize the current social order in detail, but his opposition to the events in Spain and the current viceregal government was clearly expressed in his reference to bad government. The Grito also emphasized loyalty to the Catholic religion, a sentiment with which both Creoles and Peninsulares could sympathize.  Hidalgo's army ‚Äì from Celaya to Monte de las Cruces  Hidalgo, as the father of Mexico, carrying his banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe (a 1905 painting by Antonio Fabr√©s) Hidalgo was met with an outpouring of support. Intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people followed Hidalgo with a great deal of enthusiasm. Hidalgo permitted Indians and mestizos to join his war in such numbers that the original motives of the Quer√©taro group were obscured. Allende was Hidalgo's co-conspirator in Quer√©taro and remained more loyal to the Quer√©taro group's original, more creole objectives. However, Hidalgo's actions and the people's response, meant he would lead and not Allende. Allende had acquired military training when Mexico established a colonial militia; Hidalgo had no military training at all. The people who followed Hidalgo also had no military training, experience or equipment. Many of these people were poor who were angry after many years of hunger and oppression. Consequently, Hidalgo was the leader of undisciplined rebels. Hidalgo's leadership gave the insurgent movement a supernatural aspect. Many villagers that joined the insurgent army came to believe that Fernando VII himself commanded their loyalty to Hidalgo and the monarch was in New Spain personally directing the rebellion against his own government. They believed that the king commanded the extermination of all peninsular Spaniards and the division of their property among the masses. Historian Eric Van Young believes that such ideas gave the movement supernatural and religious legitimacy that went as far as messianic expectation. Map of Hidalgo's Campaign. Hidalgo and Allende left Dolores with about 800 men, half of whom were on horseback. They marched through the Baj√≠o area, through Atotonilco, San Miguel el Grande (present-day San Miguel de Allende), Chamucuero, Celaya, Salamanca, Irapuato and Silao, to Guanajuato. From Guanajuato, Hidalgo directed his troops to Valladolid, Michoac√°n. They remained here for a while and then decided to march towards Mexico City. From Valladolid, they marched through the State of Mexico, through the cities of Maravatio, Ixtlahuaca, Toluca coming as close to Mexico City as the Monte de las Cruces, between the Valley of Toluca and the Valley of Mexico. Through sheer numbers, Hidalgo's army had some early victories. Hidalgo first went through the economically important and densely populated province of Guanajuato. One of the first stops was at the Sanctuary of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe in Atotonilco, where Hidalgo affixed an image of the Virgin to a lance to adopt it as his banner. He inscribed the following slogans to his troops‚Äô flags: \\"Long live religion! Long live our most Holy Mother of Guadalupe! Long live America and death to bad government!\\" For the insurgents as a whole, the Virgin represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility, invoked more to identify allies rather than create ideological alliances or a sense of nationalism. The extent and the intensity of the movement took viceregal authorities by surprise. San Miguel and Celaya were captured with little resistance. On 21 September 1810, Hidalgo was proclaimed general and supreme commander after arriving to Celaya. At this point, Hidalgo's army numbered about 5,000. However, because of the lack of military discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting and ransacking the towns they were capturing. They began to execute prisoners as well. This caused friction between Allende and Hidalgo as early as the capture of San Miguel in late September 1810. When a mob ran through this town, Allende tried to break up the violence by striking at the insurgents with the flat of his sword. This brought a rebuke from Hidalgo, accusing Allende of mistreating the people. the Virgin of Guadalupe carried by Hidalgo and his insurgent militia. Liberal bishop-elect Manuel Abad y Queipo denounced the insurgents' use of her image as a sacrilege. On 28 September 1810, Hidalgo arrived at the city of Guanajuato with rebels, who were, for the most part, armed with sticks, stones, and machetes. The town's Spanish and Creole populations took refuge in the heavily fortified Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas granary defended by Quartermaster Ria√±os. The insurgents overwhelmed the defenses after two days and killed everyone inside, an estimated 400 ‚Äì 600 men, women and children. Allende strongly protested these events and while Hidalgo agreed that they were heinous, he also stated that he understood the historical patterns that shaped such responses. The mass's violence as well as Hidalgo's inability or unwillingness to suppress it caused the creoles and peninsulares to ally against the insurgents out of fear. This also caused Hidalgo to lose any support from liberal creoles he might otherwise have attained. Flag El Doliente de Hidalgo, was captured by the Spanish army in Zit√°cuaro, Michoac√°n, 2 January 1812. From Guanajuato, Hidalgo set off for Valladolid on 10 October 1810 with 15,000 men. When he arrived at Ac√°mbaro, he was promoted to generalissimo and given the title of His Most Serene Highness, with power to legislate. With his new rank he had a blue uniform with a clerical collar and red lapels meticulously embroidered with silver and gold. This uniform also included a black baldric that was also embroidered with gold. There was also a large image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in gold on his chest. Hidalgo and his forces took Valladolid with little opposition on 17 October 1810. Here, Hidalgo issued proclamations against the peninsulares, whom he accused of arrogance and despotism, as well as enslaving those in the Americas for almost 300 years. Hidalgo argued that the objective of the war was \\"to send the gachupines back to the motherland\\" because their greed and tyranny lead to the temporal and spiritual degradation of the Mexicans. Hidalgo forced the Bishop- elect of Michoacan, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on 24 September 1810. Later, the Inquisition issued an excommunication edict on 13 October 1810 condemning Hidalgo as a seditionary, apostate, and heretic. The insurgents stayed in the city for some days preparing to march to the capital of New Spain, Mexico City. The canon of the cathedral went unarmed to meet Hidalgo and got him to promise that the atrocities of San Miguel, Celaya and Guanajuato would not be repeated in Valladolid. The canon was partially effective. Wholesale destruction of the city was not repeated. However, Hidalgo was furious when he found the cathedral locked to him. So he jailed all the Spaniards, replaced city officials with his own and looted the city treasury before marching off toward Mexico City. On 19 October, Hidalgo left Valladolid for Mexico City after taking 400,000 pesos from the cathedral to pay expenses. Hidalgo and his troops left the state of Michoac√°n and marched through the towns of Maravatio, Ixtlahuaca, and Toluca before stopping in the forested mountain area of Monte de las Cruces. Here, insurgent forces engaged Torcuato Trujillo's royalist forces. Hidalgo's troops forced the royalist troops to retreat, but the insurgents suffered heavy casualties for their efforts, as they had when they engaged trained royalist soldiers in Guanajuato.  Retreat from Mexico City  Missive that gives the explanation to avoid the attack on Mexico city, 1753 ‚Äì Chihuahua, Chihuahua, M√©xico, 1811. thumbleft250pxImage extracted from Vicente's book Riva Palacio, Julio Z√°rate (1880) \\"M√©xico a trav√©s de los siglos\\" ( Mexico through the centuries) Tomo III: \\"La guerra de independencia\\" (The war of independence) (1808 - 1821). After the Battle of Monte de las Cruces on 30 October 1810, Hidalgo still had some 100,000 insurgents and was in a strategic position to attack Mexico City. Numerically, his forces outnumbered royalist forces. The royalist government in Mexico City, under the leadership of Viceroy Francisco Venegas, prepared psychological and military defenses. An intensive propaganda campaign had advertised the insurgent violence in the Baj√≠o area and stressed the insurgents' threat against social stability. Hidalgo found the sedentary Indians and castes of the Valley of Mexico as much opposed to the insurgents as were the creoles and Spaniards. Hidalgo's forces came as close as what is now the Cuajimalpa borough of Mexico City. Allende wanted to press forward and attack the capital, but Hidalgo disagreed. Hidalgo's reasoning for this decision is unclear and has been debated by historians. One probable factor was that Hidalgo's men were undisciplined and unruly and had suffered heavy losses whenever they encountered trained troops. As the capital was guarded by some of the best- trained soldiers in New Spain, Hidalgo might have feared a bloodbath. Hidalgo instead decided to turn away from Mexico City and move to the north through Toluca and Ixtlahuaca with a destination of Guadalajara. After turning back, insurgents began to desert. By the time he got to Aculco, just north of Toluca, his army had shrunk to 40,000 men. General Felix Calleja attacked Hidalgo's forces, defeating them on 7 November 1810. Allende decided to take the troops under his command to Guanajuato, instead of Guadalajara. Hidalgo arrived in Guadalajara on 26 November with more than 7,000 poorly armed men. He initially occupied the city with lower-class support because Hidalgo promised to end slavery, tribute payment and taxes on alcohol and tobacco products. Hidalgo established an alternative government in Guadalajara with himself at the head and then appointed two ministers. On 6 December 1810, Hidalgo issued a decree abolishing slavery, threatening those who did not comply with death. He abolished tribute payments that the Indians had to pay to their creole and peninsular lords. He ordered the publication of a newspaper called Despertador Americano (American Wake Up Call). He named Pascacio Ortiz de Letona as representative of the insurgent government and sent him to the United States to seek support there, but Ortiz de Letona was apprehended by the Spanish army en route to Philadelphia and promptly executed. During this time, insurgent violence mounted in Guadalajara. Citizens loyal to the viceregal government were seized and executed. While indiscriminate looting was avoided, the insurgents targeted the property of creoles and Spaniards, regardless of political affiliation. In the meantime, the royalist army had retaken Guanajuato, forcing Allende to flee to Guadalajara. After he arrived at the city, Allende again objected to Hidalgo concerning the insurgent violence. However, Hidalgo knew the royalist army was on its way to Guadalajara and wanted to stay on good terms with his own army. After Guanajuato had been retaken by royalist forces, Bishop Manuel Abad y Queipo excommunicated Hidalgo and those following or helping him on 24 December 1810. Bishop Abad y Queipo had formerly been a friend of Hidalgo and also worked for the welfare of the people, but the bishop was adamantly opposed to Hidalgo's tactics and the resultant disruptions, alleged \\"sacrileges\\" and purported ill-treatment of priests. The Inquisition pronounced an edict against him with charges including denying that God punishes sins in this world, doubting the authenticity of the Bible, denouncing the popes and Church government, allowing Jews not to convert to Christianity, denying the perpetual virginity of Mary, preaching that there was no hell, and adopting Lutheran doctrine with regard to the Eucharist. Fearful of losing the support of his army, Hidalgo responded that he had never departed from Church doctrine in the slightest degree. Royalist forces marched to Guadalajara, arriving in January 1811 with nearly 6,000 men. Allende and Abasolo wanted to concentrate their forces in the city and plan an escape route should they be defeated, but Hidalgo rejected this. Their second choice then was to make a stand at the Calderon Bridge (Puente de Calder√≥n) just outside the city. Hidalgo had between 80,000 and 100,000 men and 95 cannons, but the better trained royalists decisively defeated the insurgent army, forcing Hidalgo to flee towards Aguascalientes. At Hacienda de Pabell√≥n, on 25 January 1811, near Aguascalientes, Allende and other insurgent leaders took military command away from Hidalgo, blaming him for their defeats. Hidalgo remained as head politically but with military command going to Allende.

Hidalgo made it to Saltillo, where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by General Jos√© de la Cruz in the name of Venegas in return for Hidalgo's surrender. A short time later, they were betrayed and captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baj√°n (Norias de Baj√°n) on 21 March 1811 and taken to Chihuahua.  Execution  State of Durango's prison where Hidalgo was imprisoned in his capture in 1811. The Altar of the Fatherland; the spot where Hidalgo was executed by the Spanish in the present-day Government Palace of Chihuahua, Chihuahua City Hidalgo was turned over to the bishop of Durango, Francisco Gabriel de Olivares, for an official defrocking and excommunication on 27 July 1811. He was then found guilty of treason by a military court and executed. He was tortured through the flaying of his hands, symbolically removing the chrism placed upon them at his priestly ordination. There are many theories about how he was executed, the most famous that he was killed by firing squad in the morning of 30 July and then decapitated. Before his execution, he thanked his jailers, two soldiers, Ortega and Melchor, for their humane treatment. At his execution, Hidalgo stated \\"Though I may die, I shall be remembered forever; you all will soon be forgotten.\\" His body and the bodies of Allende, Aldama and Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez were decapitated, and the heads were put on display in the four corners of the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. The heads remained there for ten years until the end of the Mexican War of Independence to serve as a warning to other insurgents. Hidalgo's headless body was first displayed outside the prison and then buried in the Church of St Francis in Chihuahua. Those remains were transferred to Mexico City in 1824. Hidalgo's death resulted in a political vacuum on the insurgent side until 1812. The royalist military commander, General F√©lix Calleja, continued to pursue rebel troops. Insurgent fighting evolved into guerrilla warfare, and eventually the next major insurgent leader, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos P√©rez y Pav√≥n, who had led rebel movements with Hidalgo, became head of the insurgents, until Morelos himself was captured and shot in 1815.  Legacy  Independence Monument, front view. Mural of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. \\"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla had the unique distinction of being a father in three senses of the word: a priestly father in the Roman Catholic Church, a biological father who produced illegitimate children in violation of his clerical vows, and the father of his country.\\"Profile, mexconnect.com; accessed 31 January 2014. He has been hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agust√≠n de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between 16 September, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and 27 September, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, and 16 September 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \\"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\\" Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. Jos√© Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas McGinty University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15‚Äì16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. He is the namesake of Hidalgo County, Texas. The remains of Hidalgo lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City. Next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence. His birthday is a civic holiday in Mexico.

This new unit is usually a subdivision of the same country as its surroundings. Many cities around the world form a separate local government unit. The most common reason is that the population of the city is too large for the city to be subsumed into a larger local government unit. However, in a few cases, full sovereignty may be attained, in which case the unit is usually called a city-state. It is an extreme form of urban autonomy, which can be expressed in less formal terms or by ordinary legislation such as a city charter.  History  Urban autonomy has a long history back to the prehistoric urbanization and the original Mediterranean city-states of classical times, e.g. Ancient Athens, Ancient Rome. In medieval times such measures as the Magdeburg rights established special status for cities and their residents in commercial relations. In general it receded as European cities were incorporated into nation-states especially in the 17th century to 20th century, eventually losing many special rights.  Theory of urban secession  Modern theorists of local civic economies, including Robert J. Oakerson and Jane Jacobs, argue that cities reflect a clash of values, especially of tolerances versus preferences, with views of the city varying from a pure community to that of a pure marketplace. Suburbanites have a strong tendency to view the city as a marketplace since they do not participate in its street life voluntarily, nor do they consider the city to be a safe and comfortable place to live in. By contrast, those who choose downtown living tend to see it as more of a community, but must pay careful attention to their tolerances (for smog, noise pollution, crime, taxation, etc.). Ethics and thus politics of these interest groups vastly differ. Secession (the setup of entirely new legislative and executive entities) is advocated by certain urban theorists, notably Jane Jacobs, as the only way to deal politically with these vast differences in culture between modern cities and even their nearest suburbs and essential watersheds. She stated that \\"cities that wish to thrive in the next century must separate politically from their surrounding regions.\\" She rejected the lesser \\"Charter\\" and less formal solutions, arguing the full structure of real regional government were necessary, and applied to the urban area alone. In particular she rejected the idea that suburban regions should have any say over the rules in the city: \\"they have left it, and aren't part of it.\\" Jacobs herself lived in an urban neighborhood (The Annex, Toronto) which would have been paved over in the 1970s by a highway project to serve the suburbs, the Spadina Expressway, had the proponents of urban secession not stopped it. Jacobs likewise took part in blocking the development of the Lower Manhattan Expressway in the 1960s, opposing Robert Moses. These freeways are examples of the clash of urban community versus suburban market interests. Advocates of highway development and suburban participation in urban government theorize that cities which protect themselves from the suburbs, forcing them to become self-sufficient small towns, cutting off the freeways, forcing commuters into subways, etc., are committing suicide by forcing business out into the suburbs. Advocates respond that cities depend more on their quality of life to attract migrants and professionals, and that telecommuting makes it possible for workers in the city to live anywhere, coming into town less frequently, without the rush. Examples=City-states= An example of a formally seceded urban region with full sovereignty is Singapore (from Malaysia). Monaco and Vatican City are also financially and politically independent urban areas, so are Hong Kong and Macau, which have got the status of special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China, separated from their original province of Kwangtung for more than a century as European enclaves. The reasons for these as city-states are historical and unrelated to any principle of urban secession. =Asia= In China, both Beijing and Tianjin are independent of the surrounding province of Hebei, of which they were formerly a part. Similarly, Shanghai is now independent from Jiangsu and Chongqing from Sichuan. In Japan, Tokyo, as well as being a city, forms a prefecture, falling into a special category of \\"metropolitan prefecture\\" having some of the attributes of a city and some of a prefecture. Within Tokyo, there are smaller units, \\"wards\\", \\"cities\\", \\"towns\\", etc., but some of the responsibilities normally assigned to cities and towns in other Japanese prefectures are handled by the Tokyo metropolitan government instead. In both South Korea and North Korea, special cities are independent from their surrounding provinces and city-states under direct governance from the central government. Examples are Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon and Ulsan in South Korea and Pyongyang and Rason in North Korea. In South Korea, the main criterion for granting secession from the province is a population reaching one million. Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, administers six cities, formerly part of the Republic of China's Taiwan Province, as special municipalities: Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, New Taipei and Taoyuan. (The People's Republic of China, which claims Taiwan, continues to recognise these municipalities as an integral part of PRC's purported Taiwan Province; the People's Republic of China regards Taiwan as its 23rd province, with Taipei as its capital.) In Thailand, the capital Bangkok operates independently of any province and is considered a special administrative area. It is a primate city in terms of its large population, having nearly 8% of Thailand's total population. =Europe= In Germany there are two cities ‚Äî Berlin and Hamburg ‚Äî that are Bundesl√§nder in themselves (thus, they are city-states within a federal system). The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen is also a city-state, comprising two cities: Bremen and Bremerhaven. The city of Vienna is a federal state within the Republic of Austria. One of the cantons of Switzerland, Basel-Stadt, is considered to be a city-state. The Brussels capital region, a densely built-up area consisting of 19 communes including the capital city Brussels, became one of Belgium's three regions after the country was turned into a federation in 1970. (In Belgium there are special circumstances due to the country's language communities.) Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the biggest cities in Russia, have a federal city status. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the city of Sevastopol is also administered as a federal city, though Ukraine and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a city with special status within Ukraine. In Bulgaria the capital Sofia is an oblast of its own - Sofia-grad, while the surrounding area is divided between the Pernik Oblast and the Sofia Oblast. In the United Kingdom, London secessionism has gathered momentum following the Brexit referendum, when the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, but Greater London, which is its own region (unlike other urban areas in the UK), voted to remain in the EU. =North America= There are no city-states in North America. The District of Columbia in the United States and Distrito Federal in Mexico are federal government districts and not ordinary municipalities. As such, they are subject to the direct authority, respectively, of the U.S. and Mexican federal governments. The residents of Washington, D.C. did not elect their own mayor and city council until 1972, when the United States Congress extended home rule to the city. However, the actions of the mayor and city council must still be approved, at least retroactively, by the Congress, and no legislation passed by the Government of the District of Columbia can take effect until and unless the U.S. Congress approves it. Canada Urban secession is one of many possible solutions pondered by some Canadian cities as they contemplate their problems. It is one that is considered politically useful because of the strong secessionist movement in Quebec, as well as the weaker secessionist movements in Newfoundland (formerly independent), Alberta and British Columbia. In Quebec, with a secessionist movement and linguistic dichotomy, the division of a newly independent Quebec has been a strong undercurrent, with some having a Province of Montreal remaining in Canada, sometimes containing only the West Island and the West Shore of Montreal. For many decades, the urban communities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver have been configured separately from their respective provinces, for purposes of apportioning Members of Parliament after the national censuses conducted every five years. United States Various proposals have been made for New York City to secede from New York State. On a lower level, some states permit or have permitted a city to secede from its county and become a county-equivalent jurisdiction in its own right. Whether the new county-equivalent jurisdiction is considered to be a consolidated city-county like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or San Francisco, California or an independent city like St. Louis, Missouri is a matter for each such state to decide. In November 2018, the Georgia General Assembly allowed voters in a wealthy enclave of Stockbridge, Georgia to decide if they wanted to secede, which they then declined to do.. =Oceania= The 2007 Royal Commission on Auckland Governance was set up by the New Zealand Government to investigate possible changes to the administration of Auckland. The city was in 2009 named as the country's only supercity with the merging of several former councils, and in 2010 the Auckland Region became a unitary authority governed by the Auckland Council. Suggestion has since been made that the region could become an independent city state.Harvey, B., and Hamlin, C., \\"Splitsville\\", Metro, 21 December 2017. Retrieved 26 October 2019.

In the early 2000s he expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006). He later played against type with multiple roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012). He is also known for appearing in period pieces such as The Remains of the Day (1993) and Sense and Sensibility (1995). Most recently, he received critical acclaim for his portrayals of St. Clair Bayfield in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016); Phoenix Buchanan, an antagonist in Paddington 2 (2017); and Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal (2018). He was BAFTA-nominated for all three performances, and received Golden Globe Award nominations for Florence Foster Jenkins and A Very English Scandal. Grant is known as a meticulous performer who approaches his roles like a character actor, working hard to make his acting appear spontaneous.Dave Kehr, At the Movies: For Hugh Grant, Natural Does It, New York Times (17 May 2002) Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms. The entertainment media's coverage of his life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media. He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal. In a career spanning more than 35 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling but rather a career that developed by happenstance. Early life=Family= Grant was born on 9 September 1960 at Hammersmith Hospital in White City, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b. Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d. Hounslow, London, July 2001) and Captain James Murray Grant (b. 1929). His grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant, DSO was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II. Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as \\"a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders and aristocracy\\". His ancestors include Sir Walter Raleigh, Walter Raleigh King (2019) Sunk Down among the People: The Story of the Descendants of Sir Walter Raleigh Kindle Direct Publishing. ASIN: B081SKM5HD William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, James Stewart, John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Sir Evan Nepean, and a sister of former Prime Minister Spencer Perceval. Grant's father was an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya and Germany. He ran a carpet firm, pursued hobbies such as golf and painting watercolours, and raised his family in Chiswick, west London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane. In September 2006, a collection of Capt. Grant's paintings was hosted by the John Martin Gallery in a charity exhibition, organised by his son, called \\"James Grant: 30 Years of Watercolours\\". His mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French and music for more than 30 years in the state schools of west London. She died at the age of 67, 18 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On Inside the Actors Studio in 2002, he credited his mother with \\"any acting genes that [he] might have\\". Both his parents were children of military families, but, despite his parents' backgrounds, he has stated that his family was not always affluent while he was growing up. He spent many of his childhood summers shooting and fishing with his grandfather in Scotland. Grant has an older brother, James \\"Jamie\\" Grant, who is a New York-based investment banker. = Education = Grant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in Hammersmith; he was then educated at an independent preparatory school, Wetherby School. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school. He also represented Latymer on the quiz show Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each. In 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford. He studied English and graduated with 2:1 honours. Viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet, he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and was Fabian in a production of Twelfth Night. He also starred in his first film, Privileged (1982), produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation. Actress Anna Chancellor, who met Grant while she was still at university, has recalled, \\"I first met Hugh at a party at Oxford. There was something magical about him. He was a star even then, without having done anything.\\" He received an offer from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD in the history of art, but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant. Career=1982‚Äì1986: First film; stage and comedy work= After making his debut in the Oxford-financed film Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled in a variety of jobs, such as working as an assistant groundsman at Fulham Football Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows, and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager. At a screening of Privileged at BAFTA in London, he was approached by a talent agent offering to represent him. Still intending to begin his MPhil at the Courtauld Institute, Grant declined, but then later reconsidered, thinking that acting for a year would be a good way to save some money for his studies. Soon afterwards he was offered a supporting role in The Bounty (1984) starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, but was prevented from playing the role because he didn't yet have an Equity card, which could only be earned through acting in regional theatre. To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate in Nottingham. Richard Digby Day directed him in small roles at the Nottingham Playhouse in Lady Windermere's Fan, an avant-garde production of Hamlet, and Coriolanus.Smith, Madeline C.; Eaton, Richard (eds). Eugene O'Neill Production Personnel: A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Directors, Producers, and Scenic and Costume Designers in Stage and Screen Presentations of the Plays. McFarland & Company, 2005. p. 80. Bored with small acting parts, Grant created a sketch-comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington. The Jockeys of Norfolk proved a hit at the 1985 Edinburgh Festival Fringe after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on Russell Harty's BBC2 TV show Harty Goes to.... In 1986 he played Eric Birling in a production of An Inspector Calls at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, directed by Richard Wilson, giving a performance that Grevel Lindop, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, described as \\"outstanding\\".Lindop, Grevel. \\"A modern morality: J. B. PRIESTLEY, An Inspector Calls; Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester\\". Times Literary Supplement. 11 April 1986. p. 394. =1985‚Äì1993: Maurice and other projects= In 1985 and 1986, Grant had minor roles in eight television productions, including TV films, historical miniseries, and single episodes of series. His first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory's Edwardian drama film Maurice (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster's novel. He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively.*Venice Film Festival 1987 Awards on IMDb During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he balanced small roles on television with film work, which included playing Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in the BAFTA Award-nominated White Mischief (1987), and a supporting role in The Dawning (1988) opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons. In 1988 he had a leading role in Ken Russell's horror film, The Lair of the White Worm. He was Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called Remando al viento (1988), and portrayed legendary champagne merchant Charles Heidsieck in the television film Champagne Charlie (1989). In 1990, he had a small role in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent; the film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay son in the ABC made-for-television film Our Sons. In 1991 he starred as Frederic Chopin in Impromptu, opposite Judy Davis as his lover George Sand. Although his performance received little mention at the time, 25 years after the fact David Yearsley in CounterPunch wrote: In 1992, he appeared in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an \\"anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty\\" by the Washington Post. In 1993 he had a supporting role in the Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day. In typical tongue-in-cheek style, Grant later jokingly called many of the productions of his early career \\"Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America.\\" =1993‚Äì1999: Four Weddings and a Funeral and stardom= Grant at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival At 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). \\"If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny\\", he later recalled. Released in 1994 with Grant as the protagonist, Four Weddings and a Funeral became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244 million, making him an overnight international star. His entry in The Trouble with Men: Masculinities in European and Hollywood Cinema states: The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter (Richard Curtis), who is known for writing about himself and his own life. Grant later expressed: In July 1994, he signed a two-year production deal with Castle Rock Entertainment and by October, he became founder and director of the UK-based Simian Films Limited. He appointed his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, as the head of development to look for prospective projects. Simian Films produced two Grant vehicles in the 1990s and lost a bid to produce About a Boy to Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions. The company closed its US office in 2002 and Grant resigned as director in December 2005. Before the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant had reunited with its director Mike Newell for the tragicomedy An Awfully Big Adventure (1995), which was labelled a \\"determinedly off-beat film\\" by The New York Times. He portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, \\"It shows that he has range as an actor\\", but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film \\"plays like a vanity production for Grant\\". Janet Maslin, praising Grant as \\"superb\\" and \\"a dashing cad under any circumstances\\", commented, \\"For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today.\\" His next role was as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain (1995). Grant's first studio-financed Hollywood project was opposite Julianne Moore in Chris Columbus's comedy Nine Months (1995). Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. The Washington Post called it a \\"grotesquely pandering caper\\" and singled out Grant's performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend's unexpected pregnancy, for his \\"insufferable muggings\\". Grant himself has been highly critical of his performance in Nine Months, stating in a 2016 interview: Next in 1995, he starred as Emma Thompson's suitor in her Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, directed by Ang Lee. In 1995 he also performed in Restoration; Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that Grant is \\"having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter\\", and Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times said he has \\"some delicious moments\\" in the film. He made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller Extreme Measures. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with Siskel writing \\"Hugh Grant's work in Extreme Measures is a refreshing standout.\\" After a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363 million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, \\"Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.\\" Reactions to his Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, \\"Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out.\\" The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with what The New York Times called \\"a delightfully funny deadpan\\". Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, \\"Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [and] strikes one wrong note and then another\\", whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, \\"If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he'd accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That's how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures.\\" =2000‚Äì2004: Continued romantic comedy roles= While promoting Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks (2000) on NBC's The Today Show in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, \\"It's my millennium of bastards\\". Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in the words of film critic Andrew Sarris, as \\"a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [who] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters Mr. Allen has ever created\\". In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: \\"Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.\\" In 2000, Grant also joined the Supervisory Board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company. In 2001, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary was proclaimed by Variety to be \\"as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh ‚Äì and nice ‚Äì poster image as any comic turn in memory\\". The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281 million worldwide. He was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as \\"a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that he knows all too well\\". In 2002, Grant's \\"immaculate comic performance\\" (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) was determined by the Washington Post to be \\"that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings\\". Rolling Stone wrote, \\"The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs\\", while Roger Ebert observed that \\"the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource\\". Released a day after the blockbuster Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129 million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden- Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2002. \\"His performance can only be described as revelatory\\", wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that \\"Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness.\\" The New York Observer concluded: \\"[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance.\\" About a Boy also marked a notable change in his boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it \\"looked good on him\\". He added that Grant's \\"pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency.\\" He was paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.'s Two Weeks Notice (2002), which made $199 million internationally but received poor reviews. The Village Voice concluded that Grant's creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was \\"little more than a Britishism machine\\". Two Weeks Notice was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as \\"the ultimate romantic comedy\\" and accumulated $246 million at the international box office. It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations. Roger Ebert claimed that \\"Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian\\" and has \\"so much self- confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport\\". Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called his performance \\"an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair\\" as the star \\"flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style\\". In 2004, he reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262 million commercially. =2006‚Äì2015: Mid-career experimentation= Grant in Brussels, October 2008 Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next re- teamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of the New York Times, \\"nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit\\". American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self- loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this \\"just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant\\", and critic Carina Chocano said, \\"He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy.\\" In 2007, he starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as \\"a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough\\". Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The film, with its revenues totalling $145 million, allowed him to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame.\\" In 2009, he starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. Grant was featured in the Wachowskis' and Tom Tykwer's epic science fiction film Cloud Atlas in 2012, playing six different dark characters. In the same year, Grant lent his voice to the Aardman stop motion animation The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite (2014), starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics;The Rewrite review ‚Äì Irish times director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favourites of the year and called Grant a \\"perfect leading man\\".Jonathan Dean (20 December 2015), \\"Wanted: the director who got political\\", The Sunday Times, Culture, p. 7. In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.; Entertainment Weekly described his performance as \\"the only bit of fun\\" in the film, and Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that \\"while it can't be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably\\". =2016‚Äìpresent: Mature career renaissance= In 2016, Grant played St. Clair Bayfield, partner of the title character, in the film Florence Foster Jenkins, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Meryl Streep. His performance drew raves from film critics as \\"career-best\\" (Screen International), \\"one of his best performances in years\\" (Indiewire), \\"best work of his career\\" (Variety) where he \\"goes deeper, darker and riskier\\" (Rolling Stone). Rafer Guzman of Newsday said \\"Surely the 55-year-old actor has just sealed his first-ever Oscar nomination.\\" Carrie Rickey of Yahoo! Movies commented that Grant \\"deserves the Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the recognition ‚Äî finally ‚Äî that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors\\". He was nominated for his first individual Screen Actors Guild Award and also earned nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Critics' Choice Award, a Satellite Award and a European Film Award. Several critics put his work among the best acting performances of the year. Most award pundits predicted Grant would receive his first Academy Award nomination for his performance, but he was not nominated. His next appearance was as Phoenix Buchanan, a villain in the family film Paddington 2, which was a commercial and critical success. The Guardian described his performance as \\"scene- stealing\\", while IGN commented \\"Grant continues to make an astonishing comeback in his career, once again by playing into his expert comedic abilities as Phoenix Buchanan, who dons each of his ridiculous disguises with a kind of egotistical obliviousness that Grant is perfect at pulling off.\\"] Grant went on to win London Film Critics' Circle Award for Supporting Actor of the Year and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. Grant's performance was ranked as the 22nd greatest movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019. In 2018, Grant returned to television screens after 25 years, as Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal, which marked his second collaboration with director Stephen Frears. The miniseries, and in particular Grant, were widely and highly praised. Digital Spy's review stated that \\"There's always been a bit of the devil in Grant's best turns, and in Thorpe, a man with a fully- realised dark side, he's found his richest part in years\\". The New Statesman wrote, \\"Hugh Grant is Thorpe, and everything about his performance is exactly so. It's the role of Grant's life, and he performs it even more brilliantly than he did Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2.\\" The Sunday Times stated, \\"It's become tediously predictable to praise this drama but, as Thorpe, Hugh Grant really has proved he's getting better as he's getting older\\". The Guardian called him \\"utterly captivating\\", and the Boston Globe wrote, \\"Grant is a revelation\\". The New Yorker stated, \\"Hugh Grant gives a brilliant performance as Thorpe, whose arrogance, charm, and profoundly evasive nature he captures with subtlety. A quarter century after Grant established himself as everyone's crush with his romantic-comedy d√©but, in Four Weddings and a Funeral ... the actor, who is now in his late fifties, has turned out to have a gift for conveying what happens to an individual when charm curdles into something considerably darker.\\" For his performance, Grant was nominated for several awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award, British Academy Television Award. In 2019, Grant played another against-type role, in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, his second collaboration with the director following The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Grant plays Fletcher, a seedy and unscrupulous tabloid reporter, which he called \\"a fun bit of casting\\" referring to his Hacked Off campaigning. He has stated he based his character on reporters who \\"used to be my enemies and now they're my friends\\". Even though the film received mostly mixed reviews, Grant's performance was praised. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called Grant \\"a beating comic heart\\" of the film, adding that \\"he weighs up every wry line with relish, and Ritchie makes strong use of his deadpan comic talents.\\" Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal also highly praised his work, writing, \\"[I]n a word, Mr. Grant is sensational. In two more words, he's absolutely hilarious; it's some of the best work he's done on screen.\\" In 2020, Grant will headline another television project by starring in the HBO miniseries The Undoing, opposite Nicole Kidman. The miniseries is set to premiere on October 25, 2020. Screen persona Grant has predominantly been a comedy (especially a romantic comedy) actor for almost all of his mainstream film career. While some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a one-trick pony. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator, said, \\"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\\" Many of Grant's films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to his \\"comic overreactions‚Äîthe mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids\\". She added: \\"He's got more tics than Benny Hill.\\" His penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get \\"his jiving and shucking under control\\". Film historian David Thomson opined in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that Grant equated merely \\"itchy mannerisms\\" with screen acting.David Thomson A New Biographical Dictionary of Film, London: Little Brown, 2002, p. 352. Published in New York by Knopf. On his choice of roles, Grant has said: Grant's screen persona in his films of the 2000s gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad. Claudia Puig of USA Today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally \\"gone [were] the self-conscious 'Aren't I adorable' mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies\\". According to Carina Chocano, amongst film critics, the two tropes most commonly associated with Grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in Bridget Jones's Diary and About a Boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself. Nonetheless, Grant has occasionally acted in dramas. He played a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film An Awfully Big Adventure, which received critical praise, and for \\"a very quiet, dignified\\" performance as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin in James Lapine's biopic film Impromptu. In 2012, he played six \\"incredibly evil\\" characters in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas, an experience he has spoken about positively. Grant said: Personality Grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in the media for his guarded privacy. On probing of his personal life, he has remained steadfast in \\"offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough\\". He has described himself as a reluctant actor, has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be \\"a phase\\" in his life, lasting no more than ten years. A 2007 Vogue profile referred to him as a man with a \\"professionally misanthropic mystique\\". He has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: \\"It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with the way they used to release films, more slowly, let them build?\\" The director Mike Newell has said: \\"There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy.\\" Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that \\"he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless\\". British newspapers regularly refer to him as \\"grumpy\\". Grant is a self- confessed \\"committed and passionate\\" perfectionist on a film set. The American film critic Dave Kehr has written that Grant \\"is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role ‚Äì someone who works hard to make it look easy ‚Äì though that isn't a trait he admires in himself\\". He is noted by co-workers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard. He dropped his agent in 2006, ending a 10-year relationship with CAA. He has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career: \\"They've known for years that I have total control. I've never taken any advice on anything.\\"  In the media = Libel lawsuits = In 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a \\"highly defamatory\\" article published in January 1995. The company's newspaper, Today, which ceased publication the following November, had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a \\"foul-mouthed tongue lashing\\" on the set of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. On 27 April 2007, he accepted undisclosed damages from the Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' \\"allegations and factual assertions are false\\". Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: \\"I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.\\" He went on to take the opportunity to stress, \\"I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist.\\" = Legal issues = On 27 June 1995, Grant was arrested in Los Angeles, California, in a police vice operation near Sunset Boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown. He pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180, placed on two years' summary probation, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program by Judge Robert J. Sandoval. The arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of his first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, he did not make excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, \\"What the hell were you thinking?\\" Grant answered, \\"I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it.\\" On Larry King Live, he declined host Larry King's repeated invitations to probe his psyche, saying that psychoanalysis was \\"more of an American syndrome\\" and he himself was \\"a bit old fashioned\\". He told the host: \\"I don't have excuses.\\" CNN reported that \\"Many are also applauding Grant for his refreshing honesty in a culture that has become fed up with overuse of the word 'abuse,' but Grant did not resort to an excuse.\\" Radio host Scott Shannon said, \\"He went ahead and faced the music and handled it with tongue [in] cheek.\\" In April 2007, he was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo Ian Whittaker. Grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident. Charges were dropped on 1 June 2007 by the Crown Prosecution Service on the grounds of \\"insufficient evidence\\". = Phone hacking expos√© = In April 2011, Grant published an article in the New Statesman titled \\"The Bugger, Bugged\\" about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (n√©e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \\"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament ‚Äì that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\\" When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to \\"drag their feet\\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \\"20 percent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\\" Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \\"turning the tables\\" on a tabloid journalist. Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of murdered Milly Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in his appearance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011. Grant later said: \\"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I've been doing for the last 25 years.\\" On 5 February 2018, Mirror Group Newspapers apologised for its actions towards Grant and other public figures, calling the affair \\"morally wrong\\". This came after Grant accepted a six-figure sum to settle a High Court action. He donated the payout to the press campaign group Hacked Off.  Personal life = Relationships = Hurley (pictured in 2008) was in a much publicised relationship with Grant between 1987 and 2000. In 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont. He began dating Hurley during filming, and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention. She accompanied him to the Los Angeles premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral in a plunging black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins. After 13 years together, they separated in May 2000. He is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002. The book The Trouble with Men: Masculinities in European and Hollywood Cinema writes of their relationship: Grant has had five children with two women. In September 2011, he had a daughter, Tabitha, with Tinglan Hong, who was sometimes misreported in the press as a receptionist at a Chinese restaurant in London. His daughter's Chinese name is Xiao Xi, meaning \\"happy surprise\\". Grant and Hong had a \\"fleeting affair\\", according to his publicist. He has said that Hong has been \\"badly treated\\" by the media; the press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter, with Hong obtaining an injunction to allow him to visit them in peace. In September 2012, Grant had his second child, a son, with Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein. Hong and Grant reunited briefly and she gave birth to Grant's third child, a son, in December of that same year. In December 2015, he and Eberstein had their second child, a girl. In early 2018, their third child, Grant's fifth, was born. Grant and Eberstein married on 25 May 2018. =Political views= In 2011, Grant appeared at the Liberal Democrats' conference on the News International phone-hacking scandal, where he briefly met then-party leader Nick Clegg. Grant said that he was attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that \\"You, more than any of the other parties, have a good bill of health. You have never been in bed with these scumbags.\\"Emma Griffiths, Hugh Grant reverts to type to charm Lib Dems , BBC News (18 September 2011). In the 2015 UK general election, Grant expressed support for Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander and later hosted a dinner for the Liberal Democrats, in which he met the winner of a draw of donors to the Liberal Democrats.Tom Watson should be Prime Minister, says Hugh Grant , Express & Star (4 May 2015). In an email sent by former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, Grant wrote: \\"I am not a Lib Dem, a Tory, a Labourite or anything in particular but I recognise political guts.\\" In the 2015 election, he endorsed two Labour candidates: Tom Watson and his former agent, Michael Foster.Katy Forrester, Hugh Grant jokes about seeing his former agent in the BATH in hilarious video for Labour MP candidate , Mirror (20 April 2015). During the 2019 UK general election Grant campaigned for tactical voting to stop a Conservative majority and Brexit. He was seen canvassing with Liberal Democrats candidates, Labour candidates, and independent Dominic Grieve. = Sports = Grant during the second round of Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, October 2007 As a young boy, he played rugby union on his school's first XV team at centre and also played football. He is a fan of Fulham and is also a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers. He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south- west London after college and remains an \\"impassioned Fulham supporter\\". His other interests include tennis and snooker. In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England vs Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: \\"I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen\\". = Relationships with co-stars = After production on Restoration ended, Grant's co-star, Robert Downey Jr., revealed to Gayl Murphy on Hollywood Correspondent that he and Grant did not get along during filming. Downey went on to say that: \\"I kinda think he's a jerk. Don't know, I just think he is. My personal experience with him is I think he's this kind of self-important, kind of, like, boring flash-in-the-pan a‚Äîhole Brit.\\" In 2018, Grant confirmed the on-set tension he and Downey had had, stating: \\"He [Downey] hated me. He took one look at me and wanted to kill me. I was so hurt.\\" As a result of Grant's confirmation of their decades-long feud, Downey later went to Twitter to make amends with Grant, to which Grant agreed. In addition to the confirmation, Grant also said that he and Drew Barrymore did not get along during production of Music & Lyrics. \\"Well, Drew, I think did hate me a bit. But I admired her. We just were very different human beings\\", Grant said. \\"She was very L.A. and I was an old grumpy Londoner. The funny thing is, although it was fractionally tense on the set of that film, I think the chemistry is rather good between us. Sometimes tension makes a good crackle.\\" Barrymore had also been one out of three leading ladies Grant listed whom he did not get along with, the others being Julianne Moore and Rachel Weisz. However, on a Graham Norton Show appearance, Grant stated he did not know why he mentioned Weisz and he was probably \\"going for a 'comedy triple'\\".The Graham Norton Show. Episode dated 15 April 2016. There are several co-stars with whom Grant enjoyed working, some becoming great friends with him afterwards, such as Sandra Bullock and Sarah Jessica Parker. He has also praised Meryl Streep, who co-starred with him on Florence Foster Jenkins, calling her \\"a genius\\", while only noting that she had trouble with her eyesight during production. He also got along well with his Bridget Jones's Diary co-star Ren√©e Zellweger, calling her 'delightful'. Other leading ladies he enjoyed working with include Emma Thompson, who collaborated with Grant on Love Actually, Impromptu, Sense and Sensibility, and The Remains of the Day. He also recalled having good experiences with Four Weddings and a Funeral co- star Andie Macdowell, whom he called a \\"Southern peach charmer\\", and Nine Months co-star Robin Williams, whom he called \\"a genius on another level\\" and \\"very kind\\".

Their first album, Egg, was their most dub-based effort. Each successive album has gone more in a quasi- world music direction. After some recording for Crooklyn Dub Consortium and Wordsound, Interpretive Belief System, HiM settled on a lineup of Scharin with Bundy K. Brown, Rob Mazurek and Jeff Parker, members or occasional members of Tortoise and Isotope 217. Their first album was the underground hit Sworn Eyes, produced by Doug Scharin. A few personnel changes followed, and the revamped lineup including members of June of 44. Golden released Our Point of Departure in 1999, which signified a very clear shift toward a more jazz-like sound, followed by a major American and European tour. In 2003, HiM released Many In High Places Are Not Well on Fat Cat Records, which was received as their most successful and fully realized release. Peoples was released in mid-2006, featuring a cleaner sound with more vocals than any of HiM's previous releases. Included in this line-up are Martin Perna and Jordan McLean from Antibalas, Griffin Rodriguez from Need New Body/Icy Demons, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade). The latest HiM records, 1110 and „Çì,released in 2008 and 2009 on Afterhours in Tokyo, are collaborations between Doug Scharin, Josh Larue and the Tokyo-based group, Ultra Living.

In contrast to emotions or feelings, moods are less specific, less intense and less likely to be provoked or instantiated by a particular stimulus or event. Moods are typically described as having either a positive or negative valence. In other words, people usually talk about being in a good mood or a bad mood. Mood also differs from temperament or personality traits which are even longer-lasting. Nevertheless, personality traits such as optimism and neuroticism predispose certain types of moods. Long term disturbances of mood such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder are considered mood disorders. Mood is an internal, subjective state but it often can be inferred from posture and other behaviors. \\"We can be sent into a mood by an unexpected event, from the happiness of seeing an old friend to the anger of discovering betrayal by a partner. We may also just fall into a mood.\\"Schinnerer, J.L. Research also shows that a person's mood can influence how they process advertising. Mood has been found to interact with gender to affect consumer processing of information. Etymology Etymologically, the word mood derives from the Old English which denoted military courage, but could also refer to a person's humor, temper, or disposition at a particular time. The cognate Gothic translates both \\"mood, spiritedness\\" and \\"anger\\". Types of mood Positive mood Positive mood can be caused by many different aspects of life as well as have certain effects on people as a whole. Good mood is usually considered a state without an identified cause; people cannot pinpoint exactly why they are in a good mood. People seem to experience a positive mood when they have a clean slate, have had a good night sleep, and feel no sense of stress in their life. There have been many studies done on the effect of positive emotion on the cognitive mind and there is speculation that positive mood can affect our minds in good or bad ways. Generally, positive mood has been found to enhance creative problem solving and flexible yet careful thinking.A positive mood, 2010 Some studies have stated that positive moods let people think creatively, freely, and be more imaginative. Positive mood can also help individuals in situations in which heavy thinking and brainstorming is involved. In one experiment, individuals who were induced with a positive mood enhanced performance on the Remote Associates Task (RAT), a cognitive task that requires creative problem solving. Moreover, the study also suggests that being in a positive mood broadens or expands the breadth of attentional selection such that information that may be useful to the task at hand becomes more accessible for use. Consequently, greater accessibility of relevant information facilitates successful problem solving. Positive mood also facilitates resistance to temptations, especially with regards to unhealthy food choices. Positive mood has also been proven to show negative effects on cognition as well. According to the article \\"Positive mood is associated with implicit use of distraction\\", \\"There is also evidence that individuals in positive moods show disrupted performance, at least when distracting information is present\\".Biss, R. 2010 The article states that other things in their peripheral views can easily distract people who are in good moods; an example of this would be if you were trying to study in the library (considering you are in a positive mood) you see people constantly walking around or making small noises. The study is basically stating that it would be harder for positive moods to focus on the task at hand. In particular, happy people may be more sensitive to the hedonic consequences of message processing than sad people. Thus, positive moods are predicted to lead to decreased processing only when thinking about the message is mood threatening. In comparison, if message processing allows a person to maintain or enhance a pleasant state then positive moods need not lead to lower levels of message scrutiny than negative moods.Ziegler, R. 2010 It is assumed that initial information regarding the source either confirms or disconfirms mood-congruent expectations. Specifically, a positive mood may lead to more positive expectations concerning source trustworthiness or likability than a negative mood. As a consequence, people in a positive mood should be more surprised when they encounter an untrustworthy or dislikable source rather than a trustworthy or likable source. Negative mood Like positive moods, negative moods have important implications for human mental and physical wellbeing. Moods are basic psychological states that can occur as a reaction to an event or can surface for no apparent external cause. Since there is no intentional object that causes the negative mood, it has no specific start and stop date. It can last for hours, days, weeks, or longer. Negative moods can manipulate how individuals interpret and translate the world around them, and can also direct their behavior. Negative moods can affect an individual's judgment and perception of objects and events. In a study done by Niedenthal and Setterland (1994), research showed that individuals are tuned to perceive things that are congruent with their current mood. Negative moods, mostly low-intense, can control how humans perceive emotion-congruent objects and events. For example, Niedenthal and Setterland used music to induce positive and negative moods. Sad music was used as a stimulus to induce negative moods, and participants labeled other things as negative. This proves that people's current moods tend to affect their judgments and perceptions. These negative moods may lead to problems in social relationships. For example, one maladaptive negative mood regulation is an overactive strategy in which individuals over dramatize their negative feelings in order to provoke support and feedback from others and to guarantee their availability. A second type of maladaptive negative mood regulation is a disabling strategy in which individuals suppress their negative feelings and distance themselves from others in order to avoid frustrations and anxiety caused by others' unavailability. Negative moods have been connected with depression, anxiety, aggression, poor self-esteem, physiological stress and decrease in sexual arousal. In some individuals, there is evidence that depressed or anxious mood may increase sexual interest or arousal. In general, men were more likely than women to report increased sexual drive during negative mood states. Negative moods are labeled as nonconstructive because it can affect a person's ability to process information; making them focus solely on the sender of a message, while people in positive moods will pay more attention to both the sender and the context of a message. This can lead to problems in social relationships with others. Negative moods, such as anxiety, often lead individuals to misinterpret physical symptoms. According to Jerry Suls, a professor at the University of Iowa, people who are depressed and anxious tend to be in rumination. However, although an individual's affective states can influence the somatic changes, these individuals are not hypochondriacs. Although negative moods are generally characterized as bad, not all negative moods are necessarily damaging. The Negative State Relief Model states that human beings have an innate drive to reduce negative moods. People can reduce their negative moods by engaging in any mood-elevating behavior (called Mood repair strategies), such as helping behavior, as it is paired with positive value such as smiles and thank you. Thus negative mood increases helpfulness because helping others can reduce one's own bad feelings.Baumann, Cialdini, & Kenrick, 1981 Factors which affect mood=Lack of sleep= Sleep has a complex, and as yet not fully elucidated, relationship with mood. Most commonly if a person is sleep deprived he/she will become more irritable, angry, more prone to stress, and less energized throughout the day. \\"Studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood. University of Pennsylvania researchers found that subjects who were limited to only 4.5 hours of sleep a night for one week reported feeling more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted. When the subjects resumed normal sleep, they reported a dramatic improvement in mood.\\"Dr. Lawrence J. Epstein Generally, evening oriented people, as compared to morning ones, show decreased energy and pleasantness and heightened tension. However, in a subset of cases sleep deprivation can, paradoxically, lead to increased energy and alertness and enhanced mood. This effect is most marked in persons with an eveningness type (so called night- owls) and people suffering from depression. For this reason it has sometimes been used as a treatment for major depressive disorder. =Nutrition= Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women. Red meat is found to be protective against mood and anxiety disorders. Fruits and vegetables are associated with positive mood, independent of demographic or lifestyle factors. Research indicates that alcohol and energy drinks are associated with mood changes. =Facial expression= Research studies have indicated that voluntary facial expressions, such as smiling, can produce effects on the body that are similar to those that result from the actual emotion, such as happiness. Paul Ekman and his colleagues have studied facial expressions of emotions and have linked specific emotions to the movement of specific facial muscles. Each basic emotion is associated with a distinctive facial expression. Sensory feedback from the expression contributes to the emotional feeling. Example: Smiling if you want to feel happy. Facial expressions have a large effect on self- reported anger and happiness which then affects your mood. Ekman has found that these expressions of emotion are universal and recognizable across widely divergent cultures. Mood disorders Depression, chronic stress, bipolar disorder, etc. are considered mood disorders. It has been suggested that such disorders result from chemical imbalances in the brain's neurotransmitters, however some research challenges this hypothesis.  Social mood  The idea of social mood as a \\"collectively shared state of mind\\" (Nofsinger 2005; Olson 2006) is attributed to Robert Prechter and his socionomics. The notion is used primarily in the field of economics (investments). In sociology, philosophy, and psychology, crowd behavior is the formation of a common mood directed toward an object of attention.Mood in collective behavior (psychology): Crowds, Britannica Online See also *Affect (psychology) *Affect measures * Dysthymia * Hypomania * Mood swing Notes References  Ekman, P., Levenson, R.

The massacre occurred September 7‚Äì11, 1857 at Mountain Meadows in southern Utah, and was perpetrated by Mormon settlers belonging to the Utah Territorial Militia (officially called the Nauvoo Legion), together with some Southern Paiute Native Americans. The wagon train, mostly families from Arkansas, was bound for California on a route that passed through the Utah Territory, during a time of conflict later known as the Utah War. After arriving in Salt Lake City, the Baker‚ÄìFancher party made their way south along the Mormon Road, eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows. While the emigrants were camped at the meadow, nearby militia leaders, including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, made plans to attack the wagon train. The leaders of the militia, wanting to give the impression of tribal hostilities, persuaded some Southern Paiutes to join with a larger party of militiamen disguised as Native Americans in an attack. During the militia's first assault on the wagon train, the emigrants fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result, militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants. By this time, the emigrants were running low on water and provisions, and allowed some members of the militia‚Äîwho approached under a white flag‚Äîto enter their camp. The militia members assured the emigrants they were protected, and after handing over their weapons, the emigrants were escorted from their hasty fortification. After walking a distance from the camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the emigrants. The perpetrators killed all the adults and older children in the group, sparing only seventeen young children under the age of seven. Following the massacre, the perpetrators hastily buried the victims, ultimately leaving the bodies vulnerable to wild animals and the climate. Local families took in the surviving children, and many of the victims' possessions were auctioned off. Investigations, after interruption by the American Civil War, resulted in nine indictments during 1874. Of the men indicted, only John D. Lee was tried in a court of law. After two trials in the Utah Territory, Lee was convicted by a jury, sentenced to death, and executed by Utah firing squad on March 23, 1877. Today, historians attribute the massacre to a combination of factors, including war hysteria about a possible invasion of Mormon territory and Mormon teachings against outsiders, which were part of the Mormon Reformation period. Scholars debate whether senior Mormon leadership, including Brigham Young, directly instigated the massacre or if responsibility lay only with the local leaders in southern Utah. History=Baker‚ÄìFancher party= In early 1857, several groups of emigrants from the northwestern Arkansas region started their trek to California, joining up on the way to form a group known as the Baker‚ÄìFancher party. The groups were mostly from Marion, Crawford, Carroll, and Johnson counties in Arkansas, and had assembled into a wagon train at Beller's Stand, south of Harrison, to emigrate to southern California. This group was initially referred to as both the Baker train and the Perkins train, but after being joined by other Arkansas trains and making its way west, was soon called the Baker‚ÄìFancher train (or party). It was named for \\"Colonel\\" Alexander Fancher who, having already made the journey to California twice before, had become its main leader.; . By contemporary standards the Baker-Fancher party was prosperous, carefully organized, and well-equipped for the journey.; . They were joined along the way by families and individuals from other states, including Missouri.; . This group was relatively wealthy, and planned to restock its supplies in Salt Lake City, as did most wagon trains at the time. The party reached Salt Lake City with about 120 members. =Interactions with Mormon settlers= At the time of the Fanchers' arrival, the Utah Territory was organized as a theocratic democracy under the lead of Brigham Young, who had established colonies along the California Trail and Old Spanish Trail. President James Buchanan had recently issued an order to send troops to Utah. Rumors spread in the territory about the motives for the federal troop movement. Young issued various orders, urging the local population to prepare for the arrival of the troops. Eventually Young issued a declaration of martial law. The Baker‚ÄìFancher party were refused stocks in Salt Lake City and chose to leave there and take the Old Spanish Trail, which passed through southern Utah. In August 1857, the Mormon apostle George A. Smith, of Parowan, traveled throughout southern Utah, instructing the settlers to stockpile grain. While on his return trip to Salt Lake City, Smith camped near the Baker-Fancher party on August 25 at Corn Creek, (near present-day Kanosh) north of Parowan. They had traveled the south from Salt Lake City, and Jacob Hamblin suggested that the wagon train continue on the trail and rest their cattle at Mountain Meadows, which had good pasture and was adjacent to his homestead. Christopher Kit Fancher (survivor of the Mountain Meadows massacre) While most witnesses said that the Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about misdeeds. Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted in the deaths of 18 head of cattle and two or three people who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth. =Conspiracy and siege= The Baker-Fancher party left Corn Creek and continued the to Mountain Meadows, passing Parowan and Cedar City, southern Utah communities led respectively by Stake Presidents William H. Dame and Isaac C. Haight. Haight and Dame were, in addition, the senior regional military leaders of the Mormon militia. As the Baker-Fancher party approached, several meetings were held in Cedar City and nearby Parowan by the local Latter Day Saint (LDS) leaders pondering how to implement Young's declaration of martial law. In the afternoon of Sunday, September 6, Haight held his weekly Stake High Council meeting after church services, and brought up the issue of what to do with the emigrants.. The plan for a Native American massacre was discussed, but not all the Council members agreed it was the right approach. The Council resolved to take no action until Haight sent a rider, James Haslam, out the next day to carry an express to Salt Lake City (a six-day round trip on horseback) for Brigham Young's advice, as Utah did not yet have a telegraph system. Following the Council, Isaac C. Haight decided to send a messenger south to John D. Lee. What Haight told Lee remains a mystery, but considering the timing it may have had something to do with Council's decision to wait for advice from Brigham Young. The somewhat dispirited Baker- Fancher party found water and fresh grazing for its livestock after reaching grassy, mountain-ringed Mountain Meadows, a widely known stopover on the old Spanish Trail, in early September. They anticipated several days of rest and recuperation there before the next would take them out of Utah. But, on September 7, the party was attacked by Mormon militiamen dressed as Native Americans and some Native American Paiutes. The Baker-Fancher party defended itself by encircling and lowering their wagons, wheels chained together, along with digging shallow trenches and throwing dirt both below and into the wagons, which made a strong barrier. Seven emigrants were killed during the opening attack and were buried somewhere within the wagon encirclement. Sixteen more were wounded.Brigham Young: American Moses, Leonard J. Arrington, University of Illinois Press, (1986), p. 257 The attack continued for five days, during which the besieged families had little or no access to fresh water or game food and their ammunition was depleted. Meanwhile, organization among the local Mormon leadership reportedly broke down. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had probably discovered who their attackers really were. This resulted in an order to kill all the emigrants, with the exception of small children. =Killings and aftermath of the massacre= On Friday, September 11, 1857, two militiamen approached the Baker-Fancher party wagons with a white flag and were soon followed by Indian Agent and militia officer John D. Lee. Lee told the battle-weary emigrants that he had negotiated a truce with the Paiutes, whereby they could be escorted safely the back to Cedar City under Mormon protection in exchange for turning all of their livestock and supplies over to the Native Americans. Accepting this, the emigrants were led out of their fortification. The adult men were separated from the women and children. The men were paired with a militia escort. When a signal was given, the militiamen turned and shot the male members of the Baker-Fancher party standing by their side. The women and children were then ambushed and killed by more militia that were hiding in nearby bushes and ravines. Members of the militia were sworn to secrecy. A plan was set to blame the massacre on the Native Americans. The militia did not kill some small children who were deemed too young to relate the story. These children were taken in by local Mormon families. Seventeen of the children were later reclaimed by the U.S. Army and returned to relatives in Arkansas. Leonard J. Arrington, founder of the Mormon History Association, reports that Brigham Young received the rider, James Haslam, at his office on the same day. When he learned what was contemplated by the militia leaders in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter stating the Baker-Fancher party were not to be meddled with, and should be allowed to go in peace (although he acknowledged the Native Americans would likely \\"do as they pleased\\").Brigham Young to Isaac C. Haight, September. 10, 1857, Letterpress Copybook 3:827‚Äì28, Brigham Young Office Files, LDS Church Archives. Young's letter arrived two days too late, on September 13, 1857. Some of the property of the dead was reportedly taken by the Native Americans involved, while large amounts of their valuables and cattle were taken by the Mormons in Southern Utah, including John D. Lee. Some of the cattle were taken to Salt Lake City and sold or traded. The remaining personal property of the Baker-Fancher party was taken to the tithing house at Cedar City and auctioned off to local Mormons. =Investigations and prosecutions= An early investigation was conducted by Brigham Young, who interviewed John D. Lee on September 29, 1857. In 1858, Young sent a report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs stating that the massacre was the work of Native Americans. The Utah War delayed any investigation by the U.S. federal government until 1859, when Jacob Forney, ‚Äì and U.S. Army Brevet Major James Henry Carleton conducted investigations. In Carleton's investigation, at Mountain Meadows he found women's hair tangled in sage brush and the bones of children still in their mothers' arms. Carleton later said it was \\"a sight which can never be forgotten.\\" After gathering up the skulls and bones of those who had died, Carleton's troops buried them and erected a cairn and cross. Carleton interviewed a few local Mormon settlers and Paiute Native American chiefs, and concluded that there was Mormon involvement in the massacre. He issued a report in May 1859, addressed to the U.S. Assistant Adjutant-General, setting forth his findings. Jacob Forney, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah, also conducted an investigation that included visiting the region in the summer of 1859 and retrieved many of the surviving children of massacre victims who had been housed with Mormon families, and gathered them in preparation of transporting them to their relatives in Arkansas. Forney concluded that the Paiutes did not act alone and the massacre would not have occurred without the white settlers, while Carleton's report to the U.S. Congress called the mass killings a \\"heinous crime\\", blaming both local and senior church leaders for the massacre. A federal judge brought into the territory after the Utah War, Judge John Cradlebaugh, in March 1859 convened a grand jury in Provo, concerning the massacre, but the jury declined any indictments. ‚Äì ‚Äì Nevertheless, Cradlebaugh conducted a tour of the Mountain Meadows area with a military escort. Cradlebaugh attempted to arrest John D. Lee, Isaac Haight, and John Higbee, but these men fled before they could be found. Cradlebaugh publicly charged Brigham Young as an instigator to the massacre and therefore an \\"accessory before the fact.\\" Possibly as a protective measure against the mistrusted federal court system, Mormon territorial probate court judge Elias Smith arrested Young under a territorial warrant, perhaps hoping to divert any trial of Young into a friendly Mormon territorial court. Apparently because no federal charges ensued, Young was released. The scene at Lee's execution by Utah firing squad on March 23, 1877. Lee is seated, next to his coffin. Justice At Last! ‚Äì Leslie's Monthly Magazine article of 1877. Further investigations, cut short by the American Civil War in 1861, again proceeded in 1871 when prosecutors obtained the affidavit of militia member Philip Klingensmith. Klingensmith had been a bishop and blacksmith from Cedar City; by the 1870s, however, he had left the church and moved to Nevada. Lee was arrested on November 7, 1874.\\"John D. Lee Arrested\\", Deseret News, November 18, 1874, p. 16. Dame, Philip Klingensmith and two others (Ellott Willden and George Adair, Jr.) were indicted and arrested while warrants were obtained to pursue the arrests of four others (Haight, Higbee, William C. Stewart and Samuel Jukes) who had gone into hiding. Klingensmith escaped prosecution by agreeing to testify. Brigham Young removed some participants including Haight and Lee from the LDS Church in 1870. The U.S. posted bounties of $500 ($ in present-day funds) each for the capture of Haight, Higbee and Stewart, while prosecutors chose not to pursue their cases against Dame, Willden and Adair. Lee's first trial began on July 23, 1875, in Beaver, before a jury of eight Mormons and four non-Mormons.\\"The Lee Trial\\", Deseret News, July 28, 1875, p. 5. One of Lee's defense attorneys was former territorial supreme court justice Enos D. Hoge.Orson Ferguson Whitney, Popular History of Utah (1916), p. 305. This trial led to a hung jury on August 5, 1875. Lee's second trial began September 13, 1876, before an all-Mormon jury. The prosecution called Daniel Wells, Laban Morrill, Joel White, Samuel Knight, Samuel McMurdy, Nephi Johnson, and Jacob Hamblin. Lee also stipulated, against advice of counsel, that the prosecution be allowed to re-use the depositions of Young and Smith from the previous trial. Lee called no witnesses in his defense. This time, Lee was convicted. At Lee's sentencing, as required by Utah Territory statute, he was allowed to choose the method of his own execution - being hanged, shot, or beheaded and Lee chose to be shot.\\"Territorial Dispatches: the Sentence of Lee\\", Deseret News, October 18, 1876, p. 4. Just before being executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee professed that he was a scapegoat for others involved. Brigham Young stated that Lee's fate was just, but not a sufficient blood atonement, given the enormity of the crime. Criticism and analysis of the massacre=Media coverage about the event= The cover of the August 13, 1859, issue of Harper's Weekly illustrating the killing field as described by Brevet Major Carleton \\"one too horrible and sickening for language to describe. Human skeletons, disjointed bones, ghastly skulls and the hair of women were scattered in frightful profusion over a distance of two miles.\\" \\"the remains were not buried at all until after they had been dismembered by the wolves and the flesh stripped from the bones, and then only such bones were buried as lay scattered along nearest the road\\". The first published report on the incident was made in 1859 by Carleton, who had been tasked by the U.S. Army to investigate the incident and bury the still exposed corpses at Mountain Meadows. Although the massacre was covered to some extent in the media during the 1850s, the first period of intense nationwide publicity about the massacre began around 1872, after investigators obtained Klingensmith's confession. In 1867 C.V. Waite published \\"An Authentic History Of Brigham Young\\" which described the events. In 1872, Mark Twain commented on the massacre through the lens of contemporary American public opinion in an appendix to his semi-autobiographical travel book Roughing It. In 1873, the massacre was a prominent feature of a history by T. B. H. Stenhouse, The Rocky Mountain Saints. National newspapers covered the Lee trials closely from 1874 to 1876, and his execution in 1877 was widely covered. The massacre has been treated extensively by several historical works, beginning with Lee's own Confession in 1877, expressing his opinion that George A. Smith was sent to southern Utah by Brigham Young to direct the massacre. In 1910, the massacre was the subject of a short book by Josiah F. Gibbs, who also attributed responsibility for the massacre to Young and Smith. The first detailed and comprehensive work using modern historical methods was The Mountain Meadows Massacre in 1950 by Juanita Brooks, a Mormon scholar who lived near the area in southern Utah. Brooks found no evidence of direct involvement by Brigham Young, but charged him with obstructing the investigation and provoking the attack through his rhetoric. Initially, the LDS Church denied any involvement by Mormons, and was relatively silent on the issue. In 1872, it excommunicated some of the participants for their role in the massacre. Since then, the LDS Church has condemned the massacre and acknowledged involvement by local Mormon leaders. In September 2007, the LDS Church published an article in its publications marking 150 years since the tragedy occurred. =Historical theories explaining the massacre= Historians have ascribed the massacre to a number of factors, including strident Mormon teachings in the years prior to the massacre, war hysteria, and alleged involvement of Brigham Young. Strident Mormon teachings For the decade prior to the Baker‚ÄìFancher party's arrival there, Utah Territory existed as a theodemocracy led by Brigham Young. During the mid-1850s, Young instituted a Mormon Reformation, intending to \\"lay the axe at the root of the tree of sin and iniquity\\". In January 1856, Young said \\"the government of God, as administered here\\" may to some seem \\"despotic\\" because \\"...judgment is dealt out against the transgression of the law of God.\\" In addition, during the prior decades, the religion had undergone a period of intense persecution in the American Midwest, and faithful Mormons moved west to escape persecution in midwestern towns. In particular, they were officially expelled from the state of Missouri during the 1838 Mormon War, during which prominent Mormon apostle David W. Patten was killed in battle. After Mormons moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, the religion's founder Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith were killed in 1844. Just months before the Mountain Meadows massacre, Mormons received word that yet another apostle had been killed: on Wednesday, May 13, 1857, apostle Parley P. Pratt was shot in Arkansas by Hector McLean, the estranged husband of Eleanor McLean Pratt, one of Pratt's plural wives. Parley Pratt and Eleanor entered a Celestial marriage (under the theocratic law of the Utah Territory), but Hector had refused Eleanor a divorce. \\"When she left San Francisco she left Hector, and later she was to state in a court of law that she had left him as a wife the night he drove her from their home. Whatever the legal situation, she thought of herself as an unmarried woman.\\" \\"When she left San Francisco she left Hector, and later she was to state in a court of law that she had left him as a wife the night he drove her from their home. Whatever the legal situation, she thought of herself as an unmarried woman.\\" Mormon leaders immediately proclaimed Pratt as another martyr, \\"I die a firm believer in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith ... I am dying a martyr to the faith.\\" with Brigham Young stating, \\"Nothing has happened so hard to reconcile my mind to since the death of Joseph\\" and many Mormons held the people of Arkansas responsible. \\"It was in accordance with Mormon policy to hold every Arkansan accountable for Pratt's death, just as every Missourian was hated because of the expulsion of the church from that state.\\" Mormon leaders were teaching that the Second Coming of Jesus was imminent - \\"...there are those now living upon the earth who will live to see the consummation\\" and \\"...we now bear witness that his coming is near at hand\\". Based on a somewhat ambiguous statement by Joseph Smith, some Mormons believed that Jesus would return in 1891 and that God would soon exact punishment against the United States for persecuting Mormons and martyring Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Patten and Pratt. In their Endowment ceremony, faithful early Latter-day Saints took an oath to pray that God would take vengeance against the murderers.Diary of Heber C. Kimball (December 21, 1845); (describing the oath prior to 1970 as requiring a \\"private, immediate duty to avenge the death of the Prophet and Martyr, Joseph Smith\\"); George Q. Cannon (Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, December 6, 1889, p. 205). In 1904, several witnesses said that the oath as it then existed was that participants would never cease to pray that God would avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation\\", and that they would teach this practice to their posterity \\"unto the 3rd and 4th generation\\". The oath was deleted from the ceremony in the early 20th century. As a result of this oath, several Mormon apostles and other leaders considered it their religious duty to kill the prophets' murderers if they ever came across them.Diary of Heber C. Kimball (December 21, 1845) (saying that in the temple he had \\"covenanted, and will never rest...until those men who killed Joseph & Hyrum have been wiped out of the earth\\"); George Q. Cannon (Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, December 6, 1889, p. 205) (stating that he understood that his Endowment in Nauvoo included \\"an oath against the murders of the Prophet Joseph as well as other prophets, and if he had ever met any of those who had taken a hand in that massacre he would undoubtedly have attempted to avenge the blood of the Martyrs\\"). The sermons, blessings, and private counsel by Mormon leaders just before the Mountain Meadows massacre can be understood as encouraging private individuals to execute God's judgment against the wicked.Diary of Daniel Davis, July 8, 1849, the LDS archives - as quoted in (A Mormon who listened to a sermon by Young in 1849 recorded that Young said \\"if any one was catched stealing to shoot them dead on the spot and they should not be hurt for it\\"); (stating that a man would be justified in putting a javelin through his plural wife caught in the act of adultery, but anyone intending to \\"execute judgment...has got to have clean hands and a pure heart...else they had better let the matter alone\\"); (\\"[I]f [your neighbor] needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it\\") (\\"[I]n regard to those who have persecuted this people and driven them to the mountains, I intend to meet them on their own grounds...I will tell you how it could be done, we could take the same law they have taken, viz., mobocracy, and if any miserable scoundrels come here, cut their throats. (All the people said, Amen).\\"); Quote: \\"LDS leaders publicly and privately encouraged Mormons to consider it their right to kill antagonistic outsiders, common criminals, LDS apostates, and even faithful Mormons who committed sins 'worthy of death'.\\" In Cedar City, the teachings of church leaders were particularly strident. Mormons in Cedar City were taught that members should ignore dead bodies and go about their business.See Letter from Mary L. Campbell to Andrew Jenson, January 24, 1892, LDS archives, in Moorman & Sessions, Camp Floyd and the Mormons, p. 142. Col. William H. Dame, the ranking officer in southern Utah who ordered the Mountain Meadows massacre, received a patriarchal blessing in 1854 that he would \\"be called to act at the head of a portion of thy Brethren and of the Lamanites (Native Americans) in the redemption of Zion and the avenging of the blood of the prophets upon them that dwell on the earth\\".See Patriarchal blessing of William H. Dame, February 20, 1854, in Harold W. Pease, \\"The Life and Works of William Horne Dame\\", M.A. thesis, BYU, 1971, pp. 64‚Äì66. In June 1857, Philip Klingensmith, another participant, was similarly blessed that he would participate in \\"avenging the blood of Brother Joseph\\".See Patriarchal blessing of Philip Klingensmith, Anna Jean Backus, Mountain Meadows Witness: The Life and Times of Bishop Philip Klingensmith (Spokane: Arthur H. Clark Co., 1995), pp. 118, 124; Thus, historians argue that southern Utah Mormons would have been particularly affected by an unsubstantiatedIt is uncertain whether the Missouri Wildcat group stayed with the slow-moving Baker‚ÄìFancher party after leaving Salt Lake City. See ; (referring to the \\"Missouri Wildcats\\" story as \\"Utah mythology\\". rumor that the Baker-Fancher wagon train had been joined by a group of eleven miners and plainsmen who called themselves \\"Missouri Wildcats\\", some of whom reportedly taunted, vandalized and \\"caused trouble\\" for Mormons and Native Americans along the route (by some accounts claiming that they had the gun that \\"shot the guts out of Old Joe Smith\\").Mountain Meadows Massacre in Tietoa Mormonismista Suomeksi. See PBS Episode 4 and UTLM Newsletters #88 and They were also affected by the report to Brigham Young that the Baker‚ÄìFancher party was from Arkansas where Pratt was murdered. It was rumored that Pratt's wife recognized some of the Mountain Meadows party as being in the gang that shot and stabbed Pratt. (citing \\"Argus\\", an anonymous contributor to the Corinne Daily Reporter whom Stenhouse met and vouched for). War hysteria George A. Smith Apostle who met the Baker-Fancher party before touring Parowan and neighboring settlements before the massacre The Mountain Meadows massacre was caused in part by events relating to the Utah War, an 1857 deployment toward the Utah Territory of the United States Army, whose arrival was peaceful. In the summer of 1857, however, the Mormons expected an all-out invasion of apocalyptic significance. From July to September 1857, Mormon leaders and their followers prepared for a siege that could have ended up similar to the seven-year Bleeding Kansas problem occurring at the time. Mormons were required to stockpile grain, and were enjoined against selling grain to emigrants for use as cattle feed. As far-off Mormon colonies retreated, Parowan and Cedar City became isolated and vulnerable outposts. Brigham Young sought to enlist the help of Native American tribes in fighting the \\"Americans\\", encouraging them to steal cattle from emigrant trains, and to join Mormons in fighting the approaching army. Scholars have asserted that George A. Smith's tour of southern Utah influenced the decision to attack and destroy the Fancher‚ÄìBaker emigrant train near Mountain Meadows, Utah. He met with many of the eventual participants in the massacre, including W. H. Dame, Isaac Haight, John D. Lee and Chief Jackson, leader of a band of Paiutes. He noted that the militia was organized and ready to fight, and that some of them were eager to \\"fight and take vengeance for the cruelties that had been inflicted upon us in the States.\\" Among Smith's party were a number of Paiute Native American chiefs from the Mountain Meadows area. When Smith returned to Salt Lake, Brigham Young met with these leaders on September 1, 1857, and encouraged them to fight against the Americans in the anticipated clash with the U.S. Army. They were also offered all of the livestock then on the road to California, which included that belonging to the Baker‚ÄìFancher party. The Native American chiefs were reluctant, and at least one objected they had previously been told not to steal, and declined the offer. Brigham Young Historians debate the role of Brigham Young in the massacre. Young was theocratic leader of the Utah Territory at the time of the massacre. There is a consensus among historians that Brigham Young played a role in provoking the massacre, at least unwittingly, and in concealing its evidence after the fact. However, they debate whether Young knew about the planned massacre ahead of time and whether he initially condoned it before later taking a strong public stand against it. Young's use of inflammatory and violent language in response to the Federal expedition added to the tense atmosphere at the time of the attack. Following the massacre, Young stated in public forums that God had taken vengeance on the Baker‚ÄìFancher party. It is unclear whether Young held this view because he believed that this specific group posed an actual threat to colonists or because he believed that the group was directly responsible for past crimes against Mormons. However, in Young's only known correspondence prior to the massacre, he told the Church leaders in Cedar City: According to historian MacKinnon, \\"After the [Utah] war, U.S. President James Buchanan implied that face-to-face communications with Brigham Young might have averted the conflict, and Young argued that a north-south telegraph line in Utah could have prevented the Mountain Meadows massacre.\\" MacKinnon suggests that hostilities could have been avoided if Young had traveled east to Washington D.C. to resolve governmental problems instead of taking a five-week trip north on the eve of the Utah War for church related reasons. A modern forensic assessment of a key affidavit, purportedly given by William Edwards in 1924, has complicated the debate on complicity of senior Mormon leadership in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Analysis indicates that Edwards's signature may have been traced and that the typeset belonged to a typewriter manufactured in the 1950s. The Utah State Historical Society, which maintains the document in its archives, acknowledges a possible connection to Mark Hofmann, a convicted forger and extortionist, via go- between Lyn Jacobs who provided the society with the document. Remembrances The first monument for the victims was built two years after the massacre, by Major Carleton and the U.S. Army. This monument was a simple cairn built over the gravesite of 34 victims, and was topped by a large cedar cross. The monument was found destroyed and the structure was replaced by the U.S. Army in 1864. By some reports, the monument was destroyed in 1861, when Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows. Wilford Woodruff, who later became President of the Church, claimed that upon reading the inscription on the cross, which read, \\"Vengeance is mine, thus saith the Lord. I shall repay\\", Young responded, \\"it should be vengeance is mine and I have taken a little.\\"Sally Denton (2003). American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857 (New York: Vintage Books, ) p. 210.Scott G. Kenney, ed., Wilford Woodruff's Journal, 9 vols. (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1984), 5:577. In 1932 citizens of the surrounding area constructed a memorial wall around the remnants of the monument. \\"The most enduring was a wall which still stands at the siege site. It was erected in 1932 and surrounds the 1859 cairn.\\" The 1999 burial site monument Starting in 1988, the Mountain Meadows Association, composed of descendants of both the Baker‚ÄìFancher party victims and the Mormon participants, designed a new monument in the meadows; this monument was completed in 1990 and is maintained by the Utah State Division of Parks and Recreation. In 1999 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints replaced the U.S. Army's cairn and the 1932 memorial wall with a second monument, which it now maintains. In August 1999, when the LDS Church's construction of the 1999 monument had started, the remains of at least 28 massacre victims were dug up by a backhoe. The forensic evidence showed that the remains of the males had been shot by firearms at close range and that the remains of the women and children showed evidence of blunt force trauma. In 1955, to memorialize the victims of the massacre, a monument was installed in the town square of Harrison, Arkansas. On one side of this monument is a map and short summary of the massacre, while the opposite side contains a list of the victims. In 2005 a replica of the U.S. Army's original 1859 cairn was built in Carrollton, Arkansas; it is maintained by the Mountain Meadows Monument Foundation.Flickr. J. Stephen Conn's photostream. Mountain Meadows Massacre Monument (photograph). Retrieved March 9, 2009. In 2007, the 150th anniversary of the massacre was remembered by a ceremony held in the meadows. Approximately 400 people, including many descendants of those slain at Mountain Meadows and Elder Henry B. Eyring of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles attended this ceremony.Ravitz, Jessica, LDS Church Apologizes for Mountain Meadows Massacre, Salt Lake Tribune; September 11, 2007. In 2011, the site was designated as a National Historic Landmark after joint efforts by descendants of those killed and the LDS Church. In 2014, archaeologist Everett Bassett discovered two rock piles he believes mark additional graves. The locations of the possible graves are on private land and not at any of the monument sites owned by the LDS Church. The Mountain Meadows Monument Foundation has expressed their desire that the sites are conserved and given national monument status. Other descendant groups have been more hesitant in accepting the sites as legitimate grave markers. Media detailing the massacre * Massacre at Mountain Meadows, by Ronald W. Walker, Richard E.

It is produced, for example, in synchrotrons using bending magnets, undulators and/or wigglers. If the particle is non-relativistic, the emission is called cyclotron emission. If the particles are relativistic, sometimes referred to as ultrarelativistic, the emission is called synchrotron emission.Yale Astronomy Synchrotron radiation may be achieved artificially in synchrotrons or storage rings, or naturally by fast electrons moving through magnetic fields. The radiation produced in this way has a characteristic polarization and the frequencies generated can range over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, which is also called continuum radiation. Schwarzschild black hole in a de Sitter universe. In astrophysics, synchrotron emission occurs, for instance, due to ultra-relativistic motion of a source around a black hole. When the source performs a circular geodesic around the black hole, the synchrotron radiation occurs for orbits close to the photosphere where the motion is in the ultra-relativistic regime. Synchrotron radiation from a bending magnet Synchrotron radiation from an undulator History Synchrotron radiation was named after it was discovered in Schenectady, New York from a General Electric synchrotron accelerator built in 1946 and announced in May 1947 by Frank Elder, Anatole Gurewitsch, Robert Langmuir and Herb Pollock in a letter entitled \\"Radiation from Electrons in a Synchrotron\\". Pollock recounts: Properties of synchrotron radiation # Broad Spectrum (from microwaves to hard X-rays): the users can select the wavelength required for their experiment; # High Flux: high intensity photon beam allows rapid experiments or use of weakly scattering crystals; # High Brilliance: highly collimated photon beam generated by a small divergence and small size source (spatial coherence); # High Stability: submicron source stability; # Polarization: both linear and circular; # Pulsed Time Structure: pulsed length down to tens of picoseconds allows the resolution of process on the same time scale. Emission mechanism When high-energy particles are in acceleration, including electrons forced to travel in a curved path by a magnetic field, synchrotron radiation is produced. This is similar to a radio antenna, but with the difference that, in theory, the relativistic speed will change the observed frequency due to the Doppler effect by the Lorentz factor, . Relativistic length contraction then bumps the frequency observed by another factor of , thus multiplying the GHz frequency of the resonant cavity that accelerates the electrons into the X-ray range. The radiated power is given by the relativistic Larmor formula while the force on the emitting electron is given by the Abraham‚ÄìLorentz‚ÄìDirac force. The radiation pattern can be distorted from an isotropic dipole pattern into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation. Synchrotron radiation is the brightest artificial source of X-rays. The planar acceleration geometry appears to make the radiation linearly polarized when observed in the orbital plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle to that plane. Amplitude and frequency are however focused to the polar ecliptic. Synchrotron radiation from accelerators Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance, causing undesired energy loss in particle physics contexts, or as a deliberately produced radiation source for numerous laboratory applications. Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that is typically in the GeV range. In the Large Hadron Collider, proton bunches produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate with respect to the vacuum field, propagating photoelectrons, which in turn propagate secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7√ó1010. Each proton may lose 6.7 keV per turn due to this phenomenon. Synchrotron Radiation Damping in the LHC 2005 Joachim Tuckmantel Synchrotron radiation in astronomy Messier 87's astrophysical jet, HST image. The blue light from the jet emerging from the bright AGN core, towards the lower right, is due to synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is also generated by astronomical objects, typically where relativistic electrons spiral (and hence change velocity) through magnetic fields. Two of its characteristics include non-thermal power-law spectra, and polarization.Vladimir A. Bordovitsyn, \\"Synchrotron Radiation in Astrophysics\\" (1999) Synchrotron Radiation Theory and Its Development, It is considered to be one of the most powerful tools in the study of extra-solar magnetic fields wherever relativistic charged particles are present. Most known cosmic radio sources emit synchrotron radiation. It is often used to estimate the strength of large cosmic magnetic fields as well as analyze the contents of the interstellar and intergalactic media. =History of detection= This type of radiation was first detected in a jet emitted by Messier 87 in 1956 by Geoffrey R. Burbidge, who saw it as confirmation of a prediction by Iosif S. Shklovsky in 1953. However, it had been predicted earlier (1950) by Hannes Alfv√©n and Nicolai Herlofson. Solar flares accelerate particles that emit in this way, as suggested by R. Giovanelli in 1948 and described by J.H. Piddington in 1952. T. K. Breus noted that questions of priority on the history of astrophysical synchrotron radiation are complicated, writing: Crab Nebula. The bluish glow from the central region of the nebula is due to synchrotron radiation. Supermassive black holes have been suggested for producing synchrotron radiation, by ejection of jets produced by gravitationally accelerating ions through the super contorted 'tubular' polar areas of magnetic fields. Such jets, the nearest being in Messier 87, have been confirmed by the Hubble telescope as apparently superluminal, travelling at (six times the speed of light) from our planetary frame. This phenomenon is caused because the jets are travelling very near the speed of light and at a very small angle towards the observer. Because at every point of their path the high-velocity jets are emitting light, the light they emit does not approach the observer much more quickly than the jet itself. Light emitted over hundreds of years of travel thus arrives at the observer over a much smaller time period (ten or twenty years) giving the illusion of faster than light travel, however there is no violation of special relativity. =Pulsar wind nebulae= A class of astronomical sources where synchrotron emission is important is the pulsar wind nebulae, a.k.a. plerions, of which the Crab nebula and its associated pulsar are archetypal. Pulsed emission gamma-ray radiation from the Crab has recently been observed up to ‚â•25 GeV, probably due to synchrotron emission by electrons trapped in the strong magnetic field around the pulsar. Polarization in the Crab nebula at energies from 0.1 to 1.0 MeV illustrates a typical synchrotron radiation. =Interstellar and intergalactic media= Much of what is known about the magnetic environment of the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium is derived from observations of synchrotron radiation. Cosmic ray electrons moving through the medium interact with relativistic plasma and emit synchrotron radiation which is detected on Earth. The properties of the radiation allow astronomers to make inferences about the magnetic field strength and orientation in these regions, however accurate calculations of field strength cannot be made without knowing the relativistic electron density. Formulation=Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert Field= We start with the expressions for the Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert field of a point charge of mass m and charge q: \\\\times \\\\vec{\\\\beta}}{\\\\gamma^2 R^2 \\\\, (1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}})^3} + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\times [\\\\,\\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\times (\\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\times\\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}})]}{R \\\\, (1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}})^3} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{retarded}}, }} \\\\- \\\\vec{\\\\beta}}{\\\\gamma^2 R^2 \\\\, (1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}\\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}})^3} + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\times [(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}) \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}}\\\\,]}{c\\\\,R\\\\,(1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}})^3} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{retarded}}. }} where , and , which is the unit vector between the observation point and the position of the charge at the retarded time, and is the retarded time. In equation (), and (), the first terms for B and E resulting from the particle fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the particle, and this first term is called the generalized Coulomb field or velocity field. These terms represents the particle static field effect, which is a function of the component of its motion that has zero or constant velocity, as seen by a distant observer at r. By contrast, the second terms fall off as the inverse first power of the distance from the source, and these second terms are called the acceleration field or radiation field because they represent components of field due to the charge's acceleration (changing velocity), and they represent E and B which are emitted as electromagnetic radiation from the particle to an observer at r. If we ignore the velocity field in order to find the power of emitted EM radiation only, the radial component of Poynting's vector resulting from the Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert fields can be calculated to be ] = \\\\frac{q^2}{16\\\\pi^2\\\\varepsilon_0 c} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{R^2} \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\times [(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}) \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}}]}{(1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}})^3} \\\\right^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{retarded}}. }} Note that *The spatial relationship between and determines the detailed angular power distribution. *The relativistic effect of transforming from the rest frame of the particle to the observer's frame manifests itself by the presence of the factors in the denominator of Eq. (). *For ultrarelativistic particles the latter effect dominates the whole angular distribution. The energy radiated per solid angle during a finite period of acceleration from to is &= R(t')^2 \\\\, [\\\\mathbf{S}(t') \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t')] \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}t}{\\\\mathrm{d}t'} = R(t')^2 \\\\, \\\\mathbf{S}(t') \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t') \\\\, [1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}(t') \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t')] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{q^2}{16\\\\pi^2\\\\varepsilon_0 c} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t') \\\\times \\\\\\\\{[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t') - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}(t')] \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}}(t')\\\\\\\\}^2}{[1 - \\\\vec{\\\\beta}(t') \\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot} \\\\vec{\\\\mathbf{n}}(t')]^5}. \\\\end{align} }} Integrating Eq. () over the all solid angles, we get the relativistic generalization of Larmor's formula : P = \\\\frac{q^2}{6 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0 c} \\\\gamma^6 \\\\left[ \\\\left \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\right^2 -\\\\left  \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\right^2 \\\\right]. However, this also can be derived by relativistic transformation of the 4-acceleration in Larmor's formula. =Velocity perpendicular to acceleration (v ‚üÇ a): synchrotron radiation= When the electron velocity approaches the speed of light, the emission pattern is sharply collimated forward. When the charge is in instantaneous circular motion, its acceleration is perpendicular to its velocity . Choosing a coordinate system such that instantaneously is in the direction and is in the direction, with the polar and azimuth angles and defining the direction of observation, the general formula Eq. () reduces to : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}P}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathit{\\\\Omega}} = \\\\frac{q^2}{16 \\\\pi^2 \\\\epsilon_0 c}\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}}^2}{(1 - \\\\beta \\\\cos\\\\theta)^3}\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\cos^2\\\\phi}{\\\\gamma^2(1-\\\\beta\\\\cos\\\\theta)^2}\\\\right]. In the relativistic limit (\\\\gamma\\\\gg 1), the angular distribution can be written approximately as : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}P}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathit{\\\\Omega}} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\frac{q^2}{c^3} \\\\gamma^6 \\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf v}^2}{(1 + \\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2)^3} \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\frac{4\\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2\\\\cos^2\\\\phi}{(1 + \\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2)^2} \\\\right]. The factors in the denominators tip the angular distribution forward into a narrow cone like the beam of a headlight pointing ahead of the particle. A plot of the angular distribution ( vs. ) shows a sharp peak around . If we neglect any electric force on the particle, the total power radiated (over all solid angles) from Eq. () is : P = \\\\frac{q^2}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 c} \\\\left \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\right^2 \\\\gamma^4 = \\\\frac{q^2 c}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}\\\\frac{\\\\beta^4 \\\\gamma^4}{\\\\rho ^2} = \\\\frac{q^4}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 m^4 c^5} B^2 E^2 \\\\beta^2 = \\\\frac{q^4}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 m^4 c^5} B^2 (E^2 - m^2 c^4), where is the particle's total (kinetic plus rest) energy, is the magnetic field, and is the radius of curvature of the track in the field. Note that the radiated power is proportional to , , and . In some cases the surfaces of vacuum chambers hit by synchrotron radiation have to be cooled because of the high power of the radiation. Using :B = \\\\frac{E \\\\beta}{q \\\\, r \\\\sin(\\\\alpha)}, where is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field and is the radius of the circular acceleration, the power emitted is: :P = \\\\frac{q^2}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 m^4 c^5 r^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\alpha)} E^4 \\\\beta^4 = \\\\frac{q^2}{6 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 m^4 c^5 r^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\alpha)} (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^2. Thus the power emitted scales as energy to the fourth, and decreases with the square of the radius and the fourth power of particle mass. This radiation is what limits the energy of an electron-positron circular collider. Generally, proton-proton colliders are instead limited by the maximum magnetic field; this is why, for example, the LHC has a center-of-mass energy 70 times higher than the LEP even though the proton mass is some 2000 times greater than the electron mass. =Radiation integral= The energy received by an observer (per unit solid angle at the source) is :\\\\frac{d^2 W}{d\\\\Omega } = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{d^2 P}{d \\\\Omega}dt = c \\\\varepsilon _0 \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left R \\\\vec{E}(t) \\\\right^2 dt. Using the Fourier transformation we move to the frequency space :\\\\frac{d^2 W}{d \\\\Omega } = 2c \\\\varepsilon _0 \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left R \\\\vec{E}(\\\\omega) \\\\right^2 d\\\\omega. Angular and frequency distribution of the energy received by an observer (consider only the radiation field) : \\\\frac{d^3 W}{d\\\\Omega d\\\\omega} = 2c \\\\varepsilon _0 R^2 \\\\left \\\\vec{E}(\\\\omega) \\\\right^2 = \\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 4\\\\pi^2 c} \\\\left \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\hat{n} - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right) \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\right]}{\\\\left( 1 - \\\\hat{n} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^2} e^{i\\\\omega(t - \\\\hat{n} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{r}(t )/ c)} dt \\\\right^2 Therefore, if we know the particle's motion, cross products term, and phase factor, we could calculate the radiation integral. However, calculations are generally quite lengthy (even for simple cases as for the radiation emitted by an electron in a bending magnet, which require the Airy function or the modified Bessel functions). =Example 1: bending magnet=Integrating Trajectory of the arc of circumference Trajectory of the arc of circumference is :\\\\vec{r}(t) = \\\\left( \\\\rho \\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\beta c}{\\\\rho}t, \\\\rho \\\\left( 1 - \\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\beta c}{\\\\rho}t \\\\right), 0 \\\\right). In the limit of small angles we compute :\\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right) = \\\\beta \\\\left[ -\\\\vec{\\\\varepsilon}_\\\\parallel \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta c t}{\\\\rho} \\\\right) + \\\\vec{\\\\varepsilon}_\\\\perp \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta c t}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\right] :\\\\omega \\\\left( t - \\\\frac{\\\\hat{n}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{r}(t)}{c} \\\\right) = \\\\omega \\\\left[ t - \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{c} \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta c t}{\\\\rho} \\\\right) \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\right] Substituting into the radiation integral and introducing :\\\\xi = \\\\frac{\\\\rho \\\\omega}{3c \\\\gamma^3} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\gamma^2 \\\\theta^2 \\\\right)^{3/2} where the function is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. Frequency distribution of radiated energy Angular distribution of radiated energy From Eq. (), we observe that the radiation intensity is negligible for \\\\xi\\\\gg 1. Critical frequency is defined as the frequency when and . So, :\\\\omega_\\\\text{c} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\frac{c}{\\\\rho} \\\\gamma^3, and critical angle is defined as the angle for which \\\\xi(\\\\theta_\\\\text{c}) \\\\simeq \\\\xi(0) + 1 and is approximately :\\\\theta_\\\\text{c} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}}{\\\\omega} \\\\right)^{1/3}. For frequencies much larger than the critical frequency and angles much larger than the critical angle, the synchrotron radiation emission is negligible. Integrating on all angles, we get the frequency distribution of the energy radiated. :\\\\frac{dW}{d\\\\omega} = \\\\oint \\\\frac{d^3 W}{d\\\\omega d\\\\Omega } d\\\\Omega = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 c} \\\\gamma \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}} \\\\int_{\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}}^{\\\\infty} K_{5/3}(x) dx Frequency distribution of radiated energy If we define :S(y) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{9\\\\sqrt{3}}{8\\\\pi} y \\\\int_{y}^{\\\\infty} K_{5/3}(x) dx :\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} S(y) dy = 1, where . Then : \\\\frac{dW}{d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{2q^2 \\\\gamma}{9 \\\\varepsilon_0 c} S(y) Note that \\\\frac{dW}{d\\\\omega} \\\\sim \\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 c} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega \\\\rho}{c} \\\\right)^{1/3}, if \\\\omega \\\\ll \\\\omega_\\\\text{c}, and \\\\frac{dW}{d\\\\omega} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 c} \\\\gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}} \\\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}}, if \\\\omega \\\\gg \\\\omega_\\\\text{c} The formula for spectral distribution of synchrotron radiation, given above, can be expressed in terms of a rapidly converging integral with no special functions involved (see also modified Bessel functions) by means of the relation: :\\\\int_{\\\\xi}^\\\\infty K_{5/3}(x) dx = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\, \\\\frac{9+36x^2+16x^4}{(3+4x^2) \\\\sqrt{1+x^2/3}} \\\\exp \\\\left[ - \\\\xi \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{4x^2}{3} \\\\right) \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{x^2}{3}} \\\\right] \\\\ dx Synchrotron radiation emission as a function of the beam energy Relationship between power radiated and the photon energy First, define the critical photon energy as :\\\\varepsilon_c = \\\\hbar \\\\omega_\\\\text{c} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{\\\\rho} \\\\gamma^3. Then, the relationship between radiated power and photon energy is shown in the graph on the right side. The higher the critical energy, the more photons with high energies are generated. Note that, there is no dependence on the energy at longer wavelengths. Polarization of synchrotron radiation In Eq. (), the first term K_{2/3}^2(\\\\xi) is the radiation power with polarization in the orbit plane, and the second term \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2 \\\\theta^2}{1+\\\\gamma^2 \\\\theta^2}K_{1/3}^2(\\\\xi) is the polarization orthogonal to the orbit plane. In the orbit plane \\\\theta=0, the polarization is purely horizontal. Integrating on all frequencies, we get the angular distribution of the energy radiated : \\\\frac{d^2 W}{d\\\\Omega} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{d^3W}{d\\\\omega d\\\\Omega } d\\\\omega = \\\\frac{7 q^2 \\\\gamma^5}{64\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\rho}\\\\frac{1}{(1 + \\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2)^{5/2}} \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\frac{5}{7} \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2}{1 + \\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2} \\\\right] Integrating on all the angles, we find that seven times as much energy is radiated with parallel polarization as with perpendicular polarization. The radiation from a relativistically moving charge is very strongly, but not completely, polarized in the plane of motion. =Example 2: undulator=Solution of equation of motion and undulator equation An undulator consists of a periodic array of magnets, so that they provide a sinusoidal magnetic field. :\\\\vec{B} = \\\\left( 0, B_0 \\\\sin(k_\\\\text{u} z),0 \\\\right) undulator Solution of equation of motion: :\\\\vec{r}(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{u} K}{2\\\\pi\\\\gamma}\\\\sin \\\\omega_\\\\text{u}t \\\\cdot \\\\hat{x} \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\bar{\\\\beta_z} ct + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{u} K^2}{16\\\\pi\\\\gamma^2}\\\\cos(2\\\\omega_\\\\text{u} t) \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\hat{z} where :K = \\\\frac{q B_0 \\\\lambda_\\\\text{u}}{2\\\\pi mc}, and :\\\\bar{\\\\beta_z} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\gamma^2} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{K^2}{2} \\\\right), and the parameter K is called the undulator parameter. Constructive interference of the beam in the undulator Condition for the constructive interference of radiation emitted at different poles is :d = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{u}}{\\\\bar{\\\\beta}} - \\\\lambda_\\\\text{u} \\\\cos\\\\theta = n\\\\lambda Expanding \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\approx 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\theta^2}{2} and neglecting the terms O(\\\\theta^2) in the resulting equation, one obtains :\\\\lambda_n = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{u}}{2\\\\gamma^2 n} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 + \\\\frac{K^2}{2} + \\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2}{\\\\bar{\\\\beta}} \\\\right) For \\\\bar{\\\\beta} \\\\rightarrow 1, one finally gets :\\\\lambda_n = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{u}}{2\\\\gamma^2 n} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{K^2}{2} + \\\\gamma^2 \\\\theta^2 \\\\right) This equation is called the undulator equation. Radiation from the undulator Radiation integral is : \\\\frac{d^3W}{d\\\\Omega d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 4\\\\pi^2 c} \\\\left \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\hat{n} - \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right) \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\right]}{\\\\left( 1 - \\\\hat{n} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^2} e^{i\\\\omega(t - \\\\hat{n} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{r}(t) /c)} dt \\\\right^2 Using the periodicity of the trajectory, we can split the radiation integral into a sum over N terms, where 2N is the total number of bending magnets of the undulator. : \\\\frac{d^3W}{d\\\\Omega d\\\\omega } = \\\\frac{q^2 \\\\omega^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 4\\\\pi^2 c} \\\\left \\\\int_{-\\\\lambda_u /2 \\\\bar{\\\\beta}c}^{\\\\lambda_u /2 \\\\bar{\\\\beta} c}\\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right) e^{i\\\\omega(t - \\\\hat{n} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{r}(t) /c)} dt \\\\right^2 \\\\left 1 + e^{i\\\\delta} + e^{2i\\\\delta} + \\\\cdots + e^{i(N_u-1)\\\\delta} \\\\right^2 Peak frequencies become sharp as the number N increases where \\\\bar{\\\\beta} = \\\\beta\\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{K^2}{4\\\\gamma^2} \\\\right) and \\\\delta = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi \\\\omega}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{res} (\\\\theta)}, \\\\omega_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi c}{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta)}, and \\\\lambda_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_u}{2\\\\gamma^2} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{K^2}{2}+\\\\gamma^2\\\\theta^2 \\\\right) Only odd harmonics are radiated on-axis Off-axis radiation contains many harmonics The radiation integral in an undulator can be written as : \\\\frac{d^3 W}{d\\\\Omega d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{q^2\\\\gamma^2N^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 c} L \\\\left( N\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\omega_n}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta)} \\\\right) F_n (K, \\\\theta, \\\\phi). where \\\\Delta\\\\omega_n = \\\\omega - n \\\\omega_\\\\text{res} is the frequency difference to the n-th harmonic. The sum of generates a series of sharp peaks in the frequency spectrum harmonics of fundamental wavelength :L \\\\left( N\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\omega_n}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta)} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{ \\\\sin^2 \\\\left( N\\\\pi\\\\Delta \\\\omega_n / \\\\omega_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta) \\\\right) }{N^2 \\\\left( \\\\pi\\\\Delta \\\\omega_n/\\\\omega_\\\\text{res}(\\\\theta) \\\\right)^2 }, and depends on the angles of observations and ::F_n(K,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) \\\\propto \\\\left \\\\int_{-\\\\lambda_u/2 \\\\bar{\\\\beta} c}^{\\\\lambda_u/2 \\\\bar{\\\\beta} c}\\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\hat{n} \\\\times \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\right) e^{i\\\\omega(t - \\\\hat{n}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{r}(t)/c)} dt \\\\right^2.

Nicknamed the Showplace of the Nation, it is the headquarters for the Rockettes, the precision dance company. Radio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a Metropolitan Opera House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the construction of Rockefeller Center. Radio City Music Hall was designed by Edward Durell Stone and Donald Deskey in the Art Deco style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \\"International Music Hall\\" and the Center Theatre, as part of the \\"Radio City\\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a New York City Landmark in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999. The Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the Grammy Awards, the Tony Awards, the Daytime Emmy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, and the NFL Draft. History=Planning= The construction of Rockefeller Center occurred between 1932 and 1940. on land that John D. Rockefeller Jr. leased from Columbia University. The Rockefeller Center site was originally supposed to be occupied by a new opera house for the Metropolitan Opera. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the opera to fund by itself, and it needed an endowment, and the project ultimately gained the support of John D. Rockefeller Jr. The planned opera house was canceled in December 1929 due to various issues, but Rockefeller made a deal with RCA to develop Rockefeller Center as a mass media complex with four theaters. This was later downsized to two theaters. Samuel Roxy Rothafel, a successful theater operator who was renowned for his domination of the city's movie theater industry, joined the center's advisory board in 1930. He offered to build two theaters: a large vaudeville \\"International Music Hall\\" on the northernmost block with more than 6,200 seats, and the smaller 3,500-seat \\"RKO Roxy\\" movie theater on the southernmost block. The idea for these theaters was inspired by Roxy's failed expansion of the 5,920-seat Roxy Theatre on 50th Street, one and a half blocks away. Roxy also envisioned an elevated promenade between the two theaters, but this was never published in any of the official blueprints. In September 1931, a group of NBC managers and architects went to tour Europe to find performers and look at theater designs.; ;; . However, the group did not find any significant architectural details that they could use in the Radio City theaters. In any case, Roxy's friend Peter Clark turned out to have much more innovative designs for the proposed theaters than the Europeans did. Roxy had a list of design requests for the Music Hall. First, he did not want the hall to have either a large balcony over the box seating, or rows of box seating facing each other, as implemented in opera houses. This resulted in a \\"tiered\\" balcony system where several shallow balconies were built at the back of the theater, cantilevered off the back wall. Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts, so that the sets could be changed easily. Roxy also wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful. He wished for an auditorium with an oval shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval-shaped auditoriums had better acoustic qualities. Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, orchestra pit seats, and dressing-room chairs. Despite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center. The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone and interior designer Donald Deskey in the Art Deco style. Stone used Indiana Limestone for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented fire escapes were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned Ezra Winter for the grand foyer's mural, \\"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\\". Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall. He had reportedly called Winter's painting \\"God-awful\\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better. To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall. Deskey's plan was regarded the best of 35 submissions, and he ultimately used the rococo style in his interior design. The International Music Hall later became the Radio City Music Hall. The names \\"Radio City\\" and \\"Radio City Music Hall\\" derive from one of the complex's first tenants, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), who planned a mass media complex called Radio City on the west side of Rockefeller Center. =Construction, opening, and early years= Construction on Radio City Music Hall started in December 1931, and the hall topped out in August 1932. Its construction set many records at the time, including the use of of copper wire and of brass pipe. In November 1932, Russell Markert's pr√©cision dance troupe the Roxyettes (later to be known as the Rockettes) left the Roxy Theatre and announced that they would be moving to the Music Hall. By then, Roxy was busy adding music acts in preparation for the hall's opening at the end of the year. The Music Hall opened to the public on December 27, 1932, with a lavish stage show featuring numbers including Ray Bolger, Doc Rockwell and Martha Graham. The opening was meant to be a return to high-class variety entertainment. However, the opening was not a success: the program was very long, spanning from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. of the next day, and a multitude of acts were crammed onto the world's largest stage, ensuring that individual acts were lost in the cavernous hall. As the premiere went on, audience members, including John Rockefeller Jr, waited in the lobby or simply left early. Some news reporters, tasked with writing reviews of the premiere, guessed the ending of the program because they left beforehand. Reviews ranged from furious to commiserate. The film historian Terry Ramsaye wrote that \\"if the seating capacity of the Radio City Music Hall is precisely 6,200, then just exactly 6,199 persons must have been aware at the initial performance that they were eye witnesses to [...] the unveiling of the world's best 'bust'\\". Set designer Robert Edmond Jones resigned in disappointment, and Graham was fired. Despite the negative reviews of the performances, the theater's design was very well received. One reviewer stated: \\"It has been said of the new Music Hall that it needs no performers; that its beauty and comforts alone are sufficient to gratify the greediest of playgoers.\\" On January 11, 1933, after incurring a net operating loss of $180,000, the Music Hall converted to the then-familiar format of a feature film, with a spectacular stage show that Roxy had perfected. The first film shown on the giant screen was Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea of General Yen, and the Music Hall became the premiere showcase for films from the RKO-Radio Studio, with Topaze the first RKO film to play there. The film-plus-stage- spectacle format continued at the Music Hall until April 25, 1979, with four complete performances presented every day; the final film the Music Hall presented under this format was The Promise (1979). Some of the films that premiered at Radio City Music Hall included King Kong (1933), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), Mary Poppins (1964), and The Lion King (1994). In total, over 650 movies are said to have premiered at the Music Hall. The hall was also used for other purposes; for instance, it was used to host Easter worship services starting in 1940, as well as benefit parties for Big Brothers Inc. from 1953 to at least 1959. = Decline = Through the 1960s, the Music Hall was successful regardless of the status of the city's economic, business, or entertainment sectors as a whole. It remained open even as other theaters such as the Paramount and the Roxy closed. Even so, officials had intended to close down Radio City Music Hall in 1962, in what would become one of several such unheeded announcements. By 1964, the Radio City Music Hall was projected to have 5.7 million annual visitors, who paid ticket prices of between 99 cents and $2.75 (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). The hall had evolved to show fewer adult films, instead choosing to show films for general audiences. However, the Music Hall's operating costs were almost twice as high as those of smaller performance venues. In addition, with the loosening of regulations on explicit content, the Music Hall's audience was mostly relegated to families. Radio City Music Hall was closed entirely for five days in early 1965 for its first-ever full cleaning, which included changing the curtains and painting the ceiling. Repairs were also performed on the hall's organs during the nighttime. Seen from 51st Street By the early 1970s, the proliferation of subtitled foreign movies had reduced attendance at the Music Hall. Changes in film distribution made it difficult for Radio City Music Hall to secure exclusive bookings of many films, and the Music Hall preferred to show only G-rated movies, which further limited their film choices as the decade wore on. Popular films, such as Chinatown, Blazing Saddles, and The Godfather Part II, failed the Music Hall's screening criteria. By 1972, the Music Hall had fired the performers' unions as well as six of the thirty-six Rockettes. A painting by Stuart Davis was donated to the Museum of Modern Art to reduce Radio City Music Hall's tax burden. In 1977, annual attendance reached an all-time low of 1.5 million, a 70% decrease from the 5 million visitors reported in 1968. = Bankruptcy and threat of closure = By January 1978, the Music Hall was in debt, and officials stated that it could not remain open after April. Alton Marshall, president of Rockefeller Center, announced that due to a projected loss of $3.5 million for the upcoming year Radio City Music Hall would close its doors on April 12.Plans for alternate uses for the structure included converting the theater into tennis courts, a shopping mall, an aquarium, a hotel, a theme park, or the American Stock Exchange. Upon hearing the announcement, Rosemary Novellino, Dance Captain of the Radio City Music Hall Ballet Company, formed the Showpeople's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall. The Committee consisted of an alliance between performers, the media, and political allies including New York lieutenant governor Mary Anne Krupsak. The public also made hundreds of calls to Rockefeller Center, and The New York Times described that the callers \\"jammed the switchboards\\" there. The Rockettes also protested outside New York City Hall. Following the closure announcement, the interior was made a city landmark on March 29. This designation was contested, and Rockefeller Center Inc. unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit to try to reverse the landmark designation. On April 8, four days before the planned closing date, the Empire State Development Corporation voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease the Music Hall. One month later, on May 12, Radio City Music Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Plans for a 20-story mixed-use tower above the Radio City Music Hall were announced in April 1978, with rents from the proposed tower providing the necessary funds to keep the hall open. An alternative involving transferring the hall's air rights to another building in the complex was also privately discussed. The office building plans were recommended in a draft study that was published in February 1979. The office building was ultimately not built, and Rockefeller Center Inc. instead decided to restore Radio City Music Hall to its original condition. The renovation of the Music Hall started in April 1979. In 1980, the hall reopened to the public. Regular film showings at Radio City ended, and live shows were cut back to holiday showings only. Around this time, the Music Hall started creating its own music concerts. Prior to the reopening, the Music Hall was rented to music concerts, but had never hosted a concert that it created. =Late 20th century= Marquee in January 2008 during the Christmas Spectacular After its near-closure and subsequent reopening, Radio City Music Hall diversified its selection of shows and performances. Time slots were set aside for movie screenings, but the Music Hall had mostly turned to stage shows. By January 1980, the Music Hall was hosting shows such as the stage adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and the Rockettes Spectacular. However, the theatrical shows proved to be unpopular, so in 1983, the Radio City Music Hall shifted to creating music concerts and participating in the production of films and TV shows. The parent company, Radio City Music Hall Productions (a subsidiary of Rockefeller Center Inc.), started creating or co-creating films and Broadway shows such as Legs and Brighton Beach Memoirs. In 1985, Radio City Music Hall finally recorded its first profit in three decades, with a net gain of $2.5 million that year. This was partly attributed to the addition of music concerts, which appealed toward younger viewers. The Music Hall also started hosting televised events including the Grammy Awards, the Tony Awards, the Daytime Emmy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, and the NFL Draft. A new golden curtain was installed at the main stage in January 1987. The curtain was the third one to be installed since the Music Hall's opening in 1932; it had last been replaced in 1965. Because of the Radio City Music Hall's historic status, the curtain had to be the same style, texture, and color as the previous curtains. In 1997, Radio City Music Hall was leased to the Madison Square Garden Company (then known as Cablevision). This move provided funding to keep the Rockettes and the Christmas Spectacular at the Music Hall; in addition, Cablevision would be able to renovate and manage the hall. Radio City Music Hall was closed on February 16, 1999, for a comprehensive renovation. During the closure, many components were cleaned and modernized. The curtains were replaced, seats were reupholstered, carpets were relaid, and doorknobs and light fixtures were replaced. The renovation was originally projected to cost $25 million, but later increased to $70 million due to various additional tasks that surfaced during the extensive refurbishment. The Music Hall received a $2.5 million tax break from the Empire State Development Corporation, which was meant to accommodate the expenditure of up to $66 million in renovation costs. The hall reopened with a gala concert on October 5, 1999. = Early 21st century = In 2017, the Music Hall's Rockettes faced some controversy when it was announced they would perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States. The announcement prompted calls on social media for boycotts of the Rockettes and the Music Hall. In March 2020, Radio City Music Hall announced a decision to remain open on March 12 and 13, which was controversial in light of the ban on gatherings of 500 or more in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. This decision stood in contrast to many other venues and public events in New York City, which had shut down; the city's mayor Bill de Blasio had previously stated that venues such as Radio City Music Hall could potentially be shut down for several months. Radio City Music Hall later decided to remain closed after March 13, with no set reopening date, since other venues had also closed indefinitely. This affected events like the 74th Tony Awards, originally scheduled for June 7 but was then postponed after the Music Hall's closure. Design=Exterior= Marquee seen from north, with subway entrance at left Radio City Music Hall is located on the east side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. Located in a niche under the neighboring 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the Music Hall is housed under the building's first setback on the seventh floor. Its exterior is notable for a long marquee sign that wraps around the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, as well as narrower, seven-story-high signs on the north and south ends of the marquee's Sixth Avenue side; both signs display the hall's name in neon letters. The main entrance to the Music Hall was placed at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, underneath the marquee. The entrance's location, which was enhanced by the amount of open space in front of that corner, ensured that the hall could easily be seen from the Broadway theater district a block to the west. An entrance to the New York City Subway's 47th‚Äì50th Streets‚ÄìRockefeller Center station, served by the , is located on Sixth Avenue directly adjacent to the north end of the marquee, within the same structure that houses Radio City Music Hall. Plaques The hall's exterior also has visual features signifying the building's purpose. Above the entrance, Hildreth Meiere created six small bronze plaques of musicians playing different instruments, as well as three larger metal and enamel plaques signifying dance, drama, and song; these plaques denote the theater's theme. At one point, a tennis court was located on the theater's rooftop garden. =Interior= VIP room (\\"The Roxy Suite\\") The interior contains a \\"majestic\\" grand foyer, the large and lavishly decorated main auditorium, and a series of stairs and elevators that lead to levels of mezzanines. Designed by Edward Durell Stone, the interior of the theater with its austere Art Deco lines represented a break with the traditional ornate rococo ornament associated with movie palaces at the time. Donald Deskey coordinated the interior design process, as well as designed some of the wallpaper, furniture, and other decor in the Music Hall. Deskey's geometric Art Deco designs incorporate glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather in the ornament for the theater's wall coverings, carpet, light fixtures, and furniture. All of the Music Hall's staircases were fitted with brass railings, an aspect of the Art Deco style. Deskey commissioned textile designers Marguerita Mergentime and Ruth Reeves to create carpet designs and designs for the fabrics covering the walls. Reeves designed a carpet that contained musical motifs in \\"shades of red, brown, gold, and black\\", but her design was replaced in 1999. Mergentime also produced geometric designs of nature and musicians for the walls and carpets, which still exist. Deskey also created his own carpet design consisting of \\"singing head\\" depictions, which still exists. Rene Chambellan produced six \\"playful\\" bronze plaques of vaudeville characters, which are located in the lobby just above the entrances to the theater. Henry Varnum Poor designed all of the Music Hall's ceramic fixtures, especially the lighting bases. Lobbies and grand foyer Grand Foyer The entrance to the Music Hall is at its southwestern corner, where there are adjacent ticket and advance sales lobbies. Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly coffered ceiling. Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations. The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall. To the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby. Two long, tubular chandeliers created by Edward F. Caldwell & Co. hang from the ceiling. The northern side of the grand foyer contains Ezra Winter's mural, and a grand staircase leading up to the first-mezzanine foyer runs along the northern wall next to Winter's mural. Another set of stairs below the grand staircase descends from the northern side of the foyer to the main lounge one level below. A smaller staircase to the first-mezzanine lounge runs along the southern wall, connecting to a curved extension of that level's balcony. The southern and northern sides of the grand foyer, respectively leading to 50th and 51st Streets, contain shallow vestibules with red marble walls. The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit. The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains mirrors within gold frames. Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side. Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall. The Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule. Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations. The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by Edward Trumbull, and represent wine, women, and song. Auditorium View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating The auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic Douglas Haskell describes it thus: \\"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over high and feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\\" In the hall's early years, the Federal Writer's Project noted that \\"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest proscenium arch used in a theater; and \\"finest precision dancers\\", the Rockettes. The auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators. Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see ). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters. The auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \\"northern lights\\" Haskell described. Each of the bands' edges contain a overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be coffered, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by Raymond Hood, who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written. The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves. The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system. The Great Stage, designed by Peter Clark, measures and resembles a setting sun. Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner. There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a diameter. The orchestra pit, which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \\"bandwagon\\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage. There is a complicated system of indirect cove lighting at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater. Mezzanines View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating The Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium, as well as a main lounge in the basement. Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra. Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design. A 1932 New York Times article described the reasons for such varied designs: \\"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\\" Main lounge The main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \\"permatex\\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped piers, as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes. The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see ). Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge. The landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders. The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level. The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as Witold Gordon's \\"History of Cosmetics Mural\\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks. Offstage Backstage hydraulic system The offstage area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a carpenter's studio, a scene shop, sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a green room for performers' guests, and a dormitory. The elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators. The elevator system was so advanced that the U.S. Navy incorporated identical hydraulics in constructing World War II aircraft carriers; according to Radio City lore, during the war, government agents guarded the basement to hide the U.S. Navy's technological advantage. =Art= \\"Goose Girl\\", by sculptor Robert Laurent The public areas of the Music Hall feature the work of many Depression-era artists, who were commissioned by Deskey as part of his general design scheme. The large mural in the grand foyer, \\"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\\", was painted by Ezra Winter and depicts a fable from a Native American tribe in Oregon.; ; ; The murals on the wall of the grand lounge, which depict five eras of differing theater scenes, are collectively known as the \\"Phantasmagoria of the Theater\\" by Louis Bouche. Three female nudes cast in aluminum were commissioned for the music hall, but Roxy thought that they were inappropriate for a family venue. Although the Rockefellers loved the sculptures, the only one that was displayed on opening night was \\"Goose Girl\\" by Robert Laurent, which is located on the first mezzanine and depicts a nude aluminum girl beside a slender aluminum goose. Since opening night the other two sculptures have been put on display at the Music Hall. \\"Eve\\" by Gwen Lux is displayed in the southwest corner of the grand foyer, and \\"Spirit of the Dance\\" by William Zorach is visible from the grand lounge. Each of the public restrooms have adjoining lounges that display various works of art. The third-floor women's restroom contains the Panther Mural by Henry Billings, which is accompanied by Deskey's abstract wall coverings in the women's lounge. The women's lounge on the second mezzanine houses Yasuo Kuniyoshi's oil painting of \\"larger-than-life botanical designs\\" along the entire wall, which had originally been commissioned by Georgia O'Keeffe before she suffered a nervous breakdown and left the mural incomplete. Deskey created a wall covering for the men's lounge on the second mezzanine, containing masculine icons and nicotine motifs. He also designed the first-mezzanine women's lounge, a room full of mirrors with a blue-and- white carpet and frosted low-intensity lights. Witold Gordon painted a map with caricatures and stereotypical motifs in the men's lounge on the same floor, as well as a \\"History of Cosmetics Mural\\" in the women's lounge in the basement. Stuart Davis created Men Without Women, a mural of masculine stereotypical pastimes in the basement-level men's lounge; the work was donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1975 and loaned back to the Music Hall in 1999. Finally, Edward Buk Ulreich created a \\"Wild West Mural\\" on the third- mezzanine men's lounge. Usage=Concerts= Pink Floyd played at the Music Hall on March 17, 1973. The Grateful Dead played eight shows over 9 days in October 1980, culminating on Halloween; two of the shows from this run were released as the video Grateful Dead: Dead Ahead. American new wave band Devo performed at Radio City Music Hall on October 31, 1981 during their New Traditionalists tour. In the 1980s, Liberace grossed $2.5 million from fourteen performances with a combined audience of 82,000, setting a box-office record for Radio City Music Hall at the time. Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett performed at the Music Hall as part of their Cheek to Cheek Tour on June 19‚Äì23, 2015. In addition, Britney Spears performed at the Hall for two sold- out shows as part of her Piece of Me Tour on July 23 and 24, 2018. Christina Aguilera performed there for two sold out nights as part of the Liberation tour on October 3 and 4, 2018. Mariah Carey performed to a sold-out crowd as part of her Caution World Tour on March 25, 2019. =Shows= The Radio City Christmas Spectacular is an annual Christmas stage musical produced by MSG Entertainment, which operates the Music Hall. A New York Christmas tradition since 1933, it features the women's precision dance team known as the Rockettes. The Irish dance show Riverdance made its North American debut at the Music Hall in March 1996, breaking box-office records. Radio City Music Hall also hosted the Cirque du Soleil show \\"Zarkana\\" from June 2011 to September 2012. =Television= Radio City Music Hall has been used for televised game shows such as Hollywood Squares, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!. For two weeks in November 1988, the theater hosted Wheel of Fortune, which was taking its first road trip. Saturday Night Live announcer Don Pardo announced during the two weeks. It played host to the show again in November 2003 for the nighttime show's 4,000th episode, and again in November 2007 for the nighttime show's 25th anniversary. Radio City Music Hall was also the site for Jeopardy! four-thousandth episode in May 2002, at which time the show's Million Dollar Masters invitational tournament also occurred. The Music Hall was used again in November 2006 for a 2-week Celebrity Jeopardy! event. In 1988, David Letterman hosted Late Night With David Letterman's Sixth Anniversary Special at Radio City Music Hall, and did so again for the Tenth Anniversary Special in 1992. The next year, Lyons Group (parent company of Barney & Friends at the time), taped a live stage show called Barney Live in New York City at the theater. In February 1998, Radio City Music Hall was a setting for the Sesame Street music special Elmopalooza, with Jon Stewart, David Alan Grier and others with the cast of Sesame Street and the Muppets. In October 2001, the concert Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music was simulcast live from the theater on The WB and TNT. The concert had been delayed following the September 11 attacks the month before. In 2013, it was announced that America's Got Talent would hold its live shows from the stage at Radio City Music Hall starting with the eighth season; it had previously held the live shows at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The move to have the live shows at Radio City Music Hall was because of the New York state tax credit, and the proximity of The Today Show and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. They also hosted their live shows from the Music Hall in 2014, during their ninth season. The last live show performances at the Music Hall occurred in 2015, during the 10th season. =Sports= The set for the 2010 NFL Draft at Radio City Music Hall The first sports event at Radio City Music Hall was a boxing card headlined by Roy Jones Jr. and David Telesco that took place on January 15, 2000. On April 13, 2013, Nonito Donaire faced Guillermo Rigondeaux in a boxing card held at Radio City Music Hall. In 2004, the WNBA's New York Liberty played six home games at the Music Hall while their then- regular home, Madison Square Garden, prepared to host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Liberty played their first game in front of 5,945 fans against the Detroit Shock in July 2004. Courtside seats were stage left and stage right along the baseline and the Rockettes performed at halftime. The court from Madison Square Garden was moved to Radio City Music Hall during this time. Radio City Music Hall was the site of the NFL Draft between 2006 and 2014. Prior to being held in the Music Hall, the NFL Draft had been hosted at other locations in New York City since 1965, but after the 2014 draft, the National Football League hosted the draft in a series of other cities nationwide.

Duchamp-Villon was born Pierre-Maurice-Raymond Duchamp in Damville, Eure, in the Normandy region of France, the second son of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp. Of the six Duchamp children, four would become successful artists. He was the brother of Jacques Villon (1875‚Äì1963), painter, printmaker; Marcel Duchamp (1887‚Äì1968), painter, sculptor and author; Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (1889‚Äì1963), painter. Life and art From 1894 to 1898 Raymond Duchamp- Villon lived in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris with his brother Jacques and studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Rheumatic fever forced him to abandon his studies in 1898 and it left him partially incapacitated for a time. This unforeseen event altered the course of his life as he began to pursue an interest in sculpture. He started by creating small statuettes and essentially became self-taught, achieving a high level of mastery and acumen. In 1902 and 1903, he exhibited at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts but to distinguish himself from his artist brother, he began to use the Duchamp- Villon designation on all his works. In 1905 Duchamp-Villon had his first exhibition at the Salon d'Automne and a show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen with his brother Jacques. Two years later they moved to the village of Puteaux at the outskirts of Paris where the three Duchamp brothers were part of the regular meetings of what became known as the Section d'Or, involving artists, poets and critics. Raymond's reputation was such that he was made a member of the jury of the sculpture section of the Salon d'Automne in 1907 and was later instrumental in promoting the Cubist movement.Three Duchamp brothers, left to right: Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, and Raymond Duchamp-Villon in the garden of Jacques Villon's studio in Pateaux, France, 1914, (Smithsonian Institution collections.)In 1911 he exhibited at the Galerie de l‚ÄôArt Contemporain in Paris and the following year his work was included in a show organized by the Duchamp brothers at the Salon de la Section d‚ÄôOr at the Galerie de la Bo√©tie. All three of the Duchamp brothers then showed their work at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City that helped introduce modern art to United States. Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1914, The Large Horse, bronze, 1914 (two views), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston In 1913 he took part in exhibitions at the Galerie Andr√© Groult in Paris, the Galerie S. V. U. M√°nes in Prague, and in 1914 at Der Sturm Gallery in Berlin. During World War I Raymond Duchamp-Villon served in the French army in a medical capacity, but still worked on his major cubist sculpture, The Large Horse. In late 1916, Raymond Duchamp-Villon contracted typhoid fever while stationed at the military quarters in Champagne. As a result, he was taken to the military hospital at Cannes where he died. In 1967, in Rouen, his last surviving artist brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris.

Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it migrated into the United States from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton- growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions. Description The adult insect has a long snout, is grayish color, and is usually less than 6 mm long. Lifecycle 1) Back view of adult; 2) side view of adult; 3) egg; 4) side view of larva; 5) ventral view of pupa; 6) adult, with wings spread Adult weevils overwinter in well-drained areas in or near cotton fields, and farms after diapause. They emerge and enter cotton fields from early spring through midsummer, with peak emergence in late spring, and feed on immature cotton bolls. The boll weevil lays its eggs inside buds and ripening bolls (fruits) of the cotton plants. The female can lay up to 200 eggs over a 10- to 12-day period. The oviposition leaves wounds on the exterior of the flower bud. The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days within the cotton squares (larger buds before flowering), feed for 8 to 10 days, and finally pupate. The pupal stage lasts another 5 to 7 days. The lifecycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer. Under optimal conditions, 8 to 10 generations per season may occur. Boll weevils begin to die at temperatures at or below ‚àí5 ¬∞C (23 ¬∞F). Research at the University of Missouri indicates they cannot survive more than an hour at ‚àí15 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F). The insulation offered by leaf litter, crop residues, and snow may enable the beetle to survive when air temperatures drop to these levels. Other limitations on boll weevil populations include extreme heat and drought. Its natural predators include fire ants, insects, spiders, birds, and a parasitic wasp, Catolaccus grandis. The insects sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available. Infestation Cotton boll with weevil larvae. The insect crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico in 1892 and reached southeastern Alabama in 1909. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the U.S., travelling 40 to 160 miles per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost U.S. cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.Economic impacts of the boll weevil: The boll weevil contributed to the economic woes of Southern farmers during the 1920s, a situation exacerbated by the Great Depression in the 1930s. The boll weevil appeared in Venezuela in 1949 and in Colombia in 1950. The Amazon Rainforest was thought to present a barrier to its further spread, but it was detected in Brazil in 1983, and an estimated 90% of the cotton farms in Brazil are now infested. During the 1990s, the weevil spread to Paraguay and Argentina. The International Cotton Advisory Committee has proposed a control program similar to that used in the U.S. Control During early years of the weevil's presence, growers sought relatively warm soils and early-ripening cultivars. Following World War II, the development of new pesticides such as DDT enabled U.S. farmers again to grow cotton as an economic crop. DDT was initially extremely effective, but U.S. weevil populations developed resistance by the mid-1950s. Methyl parathion, malathion, and pyrethroids were subsequently used, but environmental and resistance concerns arose as they had with DDT, and control strategies changed. While many control methods have been investigated since the boll weevil entered the United States, insecticides have always remained the main control methods. In the 1980s, entomologists at Texas A&M; University pointed to the spread of another invasive pest, the red imported fire ant, as a factor in the weevils' population decline in some areas. Other avenues of control that have been explored include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitic wasp Catolaccus grandis, the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the Chilo iridescent virus. Genetically engineered Bt cotton is not protected from the boll weevil.Bt susceptibility of insect species image:\\"Beat the boll weevil...With a little more care at every step you- not the weevils- get the crop. Get a good cotton... - NARA - 512572.jpg\\"Beat the boll weevil...\\" (U.S. Food Administration, Educational div., Advertising section, 1918-1919) image:Boll weevil eradication.jpgEradication map (USDA, 2006) Although it was possible to control the boll weevil, to do so was costly in terms of insecticide costs. The goal of many cotton entomologists was to eventually eradicate the pest from U.S. cotton. In 1978, a large-scale test was begun in eastern North Carolina and in Southampton County, Virginia, to determine the feasibility of eradication. Based on the success of this test, area-wide programs were begun in the 1980s to eradicate the insect from whole regions. These are based on cooperative effort by all growers together with the assistance of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The program has been successful in eradicating boll weevils from all cotton-growing states with the exception of Texas, and most of this state is free of boll weevils. Problems along the southern border with Mexico have delayed eradication in the extreme southern portions of this state. Follow-up programs are in place in all cotton-growing states to prevent the reintroduction of the pest. These monitoring programs rely on pheromone-baited traps for detection. The boll weevil eradication program, although slow and costly, has paid off for cotton growers in reduced pesticide costs. This program and the screwworm program of the 1950s are among the biggest and most successful insect control programs in history. The boll weevil plaque in Enterprise, Alabama Impact The Library of Congress American Memory Project contains a number of oral history materials on the boll weevil's impact. A 2009 study found \\"that as the weevil traversed the American South [in the period 1892-1932], it seriously disrupted local economies, significantly reduced the value of land (at this time still the most important asset in the American South), and triggered substantial intraregional population movements.\\" A 2020 Journal of Economic History study found that the boll weevil spread between 1892 and 1922 had a beneficial impact on educational outcomes, as children were less likely to work on cultivating cotton. A 2020 NBER paper found that the boll weevil spread contributed to fewer lynchings, less Confederate monument construction, less KKK activity, and higher non-white voter registration. The boll weevil infestation has been credited with bringing about economic diversification in the Southern US, including the expansion of peanut cropping. The citizens of Enterprise, Alabama, erected the Boll Weevil Monument in 1919, perceiving that their economy had been overly dependent on cotton, and that mixed farming and manufacturing were better alternatives. In popular culture *In their landmark self-titled debut album, The Presidents of the United States of America (band) made reference to a wide range of animals including on the track, Boll Weevil. Music critic Michael Sun wrote, \\"By the time track five, ‚ÄòBoll Weevil‚Äô, rolls around, there‚Äôs been enough cameos from birds, spiders, monkeys, fish, frogs, pigs, and beetles to fill a zoo, all referenced without agenda or coded meaning ‚Äî just fun, plain and simple.\\" *The boll weevil is the mascot for the University of Arkansas at Monticello and is listed on several \\"silliest\\" or \\"weirdest\\" mascots of all time. It was also the mascot of a short-lived minor league baseball team, the Temple Boll Weevils, which were alternatively called the \\"Cotton Bugs.\\" *\\"Boll Weevil\\" is a traditional blues song which reached #2 on the Billboard chart in 1961 in a recording by Brook Benton. *In the popular animated show Ben 10, one of the protagonist's transformations is a beetle-like insect named \\"Ball Weevil\\". * In the 3rd season episode, \\"Night of the Headless Woman\\" from the 1960s series, The Wild Wild West features boll weevils as the MacGuffin. The villains were trying to smuggle boll weevils into the country to ruin cotton production in the United States.

He is currently Deputy Chairman of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. He served as Canadian Ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2006. He served as the 27th Premier of New Brunswick from 1987 to 1997, winning every seat in the province in his first election. Early life McKenna was born in Apohaqui, New Brunswick, Canada. He was raised in the home of his grandparents, who lived adjacent to his parents because his large family could not be wholly housed in his parents' home. After completing high school in Sussex, New Brunswick, he completed a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Economics at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He began graduate studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but after working for a stint with Allan MacEachen, he took MacEachen's advice that most politicians are lawyers and enrolled in law school at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. After he obtained a law degree, he moved to Chatham, New Brunswick, and began the practice of law. He became famous and something of a folk hero, particularly among Acadians, as the defence lawyer in the high-profile murder case of famous New Brunswick boxing champion, Yvon Durelle, in what was a widely publicized case.https://www.gnb.ca/legis/publications/tradition/premiers/mckennaf-f.asp New Brunswick politics A few years later, he entered provincial politics and won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1982 election to represent Chatham, New Brunswick. He became leader of the provincial Liberals in 1985, and won one of the largest electoral victories in Canadian history in the 1987 election when his party won every seat in the legislature. McKenna's term in office was viewed mostly as a success. His key priority throughout his term was job creation and he was known to say that the \\"best social program we have is a job.\\" He encouraged small business growth and tried to entice large companies to invest in the province with tax incentives, often directly calling individual professionals to urge them to bring their talents to New Brunswick. Another of his strategies was to raise the collective self-confidence of New Brunswickers, which he believed would increase productivity. He introduced a sophisticated public relations operation which included the use of controversial video news releases. McKenna's time as premier, however, also saw some controversy. In his first move as premier, McKenna dismissed several senior public servants in an effort to gain greater control over the province's public service, which some observers perceived as a drastic step away from the integrity of the province's impartial and professional public service.Cooper, Christopher. A. (2018). Bureaucratic Identity and the Resistance of Politicization. Administration & Society, 50(1), 30‚Äì52. https://doi.org/10.1177/0095399715581046 McKenna was also criticized for increasing the number of communications personnel on the government payroll but countered this complaint by pointing out that the primary government communications agency, Communications New Brunswick, had been depoliticized. He was also criticized for creating a toll free telephone number to the premier's office which had the number 1-800-MCKENNA, the number was functional throughout North America and was used for both New Brunswick constituents and business interests that were considering moving to the province. Believing ten years was long enough for a premier to hold office, and having pledged to serve such a term when first elected, McKenna resigned in 1997 ‚Äì 10 years to the day of the 1987 election.https://www.gnb.ca/legis/publications/tradition/premiers/mckennaf-f.asp Business career After leaving office, McKenna moved to Cap-P√©l√©, New Brunswick, near Moncton, and returned to the practice of law and sat on numerous corporate boards. He also purchased with his son, James McKenna, Glenwood Kitchen Ltd. A manufacturer of high-end custom cabinetry in Shediac, New Brunswick. His membership on the Canadian advisory board of the Carlyle Group drew adverse media attention; the media ceased pursuing the issue when McKenna explained that the board was established to advise on a Canadian investment fund that the group never created and that the board had never become active. Following the announcement of his appointment as Canadian ambassador to Washington, he resigned his position as counsel at law firms including McInnes Cooper and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, as well as all positions on corporate boards including his role as interim chairman of the board of CanWest Global Communications, a post he assumed upon the death of its founder and chairman Israel Asper.https://www.nsb.com/speakers/frank- mckenna/ Ambassador McKenna was mentioned as a possible Ambassador to the US to succeed Michael Kergin after Paul Martin took power. Speculation increased after John Manley turned down Prime Minister Martin's offer. Many in the press commented on McKenna's business connections being an asset, notably as a member of the Carlyle Group and his friendship with former President George H. W. Bush. On January 5, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin's office confirmed that McKenna would be the 21st Ambassador to the United States. On January 14, the posting was formally announced and would be effective on March 1. McKenna became the Ambassador on March 8 when U.S. President George W. Bush accepted his credentials. On February 22, 2005, McKenna told reporters Canada was already a part of the U.S. National Missile Defense (NMD) (or Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)) program through an amendment to the NORAD agreement made on August 5, 2004, which granted U.S. access to NORAD's missile warning systems explicitly for use in NMD. However, Martin contradicted this two days later when he announced that Canada would not formally participate in the NMD program but focus on other items of shared defence/security interest. While Canadian defence minister Bill Graham said McKenna was simply misunderstood (as the NORAD agreement and missile defence are separate), this initial contradiction was interpreted by others as evidence of characteristic indecision by the Martin government and was seen to somewhat hamper McKenna's credibility. As Ambassador, McKenna attracted more media attention than most of his recent predecessors on both sides of the border. In the U.S., his message was one of dispelling common urban legends and misconceptions about Canada, while in Canada he urged Canadians to be more understanding of the American people and culture, particularly following what he argued is their understandable sensitivity after the September 11, 2001 attacks. McKenna generated controversy after giving a luncheon speech on September 29, 2005, to a Toronto business club. McKenna blasted the U.S. bureaucracy and Congressional system of government saying \\"the government of the United States is in large measure dysfunctional.\\" He contrasted it with Canada's government, and praised Canada's strong parliamentary party discipline as being much more \\"efficient\\" though sometimes less preferable. On January 25, 2006, McKenna offered his resignation as Ambassador, writing to Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper that he wished to be relieved of his duties, but offering to stay on until his successor is chosen. He was succeeded as ambassador by Michael Wilson on March 13, 2006. Prospective career in federal politics Since leaving politics in 1997, McKenna served for a brief time on the Security Intelligence Review Committee. He has been touted several times as a potential Atlantic Canadian minister in the cabinets of Jean Chr√©tien and Paul Martin. He expressed some interest in running in the 2004 federal election but announced he would not do so because of the lack of an available riding in the Moncton, New Brunswick, area. He did not want to push aside any incumbent Liberal member of Parliament. After resigning the premiership of New Brunswick, McKenna was identified as a potential future leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, and Prime Minister of Canada. A poll released on August 23, 2005, commissioned by the Toronto Star, showed that McKenna was the top choice of the public to succeed Prime Minister Paul Martin. Among the general public, McKenna beat former New Democratic Party Ontario Premier Bob Rae by a margin of 23 to 11 while among self-identified Liberals, McKenna beat former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada John Manley by a margin of 28 to 13. The October 2005 issue of Saturday Night magazine had pollster Darrell Bricker and Liberal strategist Warren Kinsella create odds for potential Liberal leadership candidates. They made McKenna the favourite with 7 to 2 odds beating Scott Brison (8 to 1), Martin Cauchon (10 to 1), Michael Ignatieff and John Manley (each 15 to 1) among others. On January 30, 2006, McKenna confirmed earlier reports that he was not running for the Liberal leadership to replace Paul Martin, who announced his resignation as party leader on the January 23, 2006 election night. McKenna acknowledged the strength of the Liberal brand stating: \\"You've got pretty good odds of being the prime minister if you're the leader of the Liberal party\\" - every leader of the Liberal party since Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1896 had become prime minister. However, he put an end to his involvement in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership race, explaining his decision by saying that he did not want \\"his life to become consumed by politics.\\" and that: \\"I reminded myself of my vow upon leaving office that, having escaped the trap, I wouldn‚Äôt go back for the cheese.\\" Following St√©phane Dion's resignation as federal Liberal leader after the 2008 election, McKenna was once again touted as a possibility to take the helm of the federal Liberal Party. However, on October 28, 2008, McKenna said that he would not be seeking the leadership, saying \\"Although I have been deeply moved by expressions of support for me from across the country, I have not been persuaded to change my long-standing resolve to exit public life for good,\\" and \\"My only regret is that I cannot honour the expectations of friends and supporters who have shown enormous loyalty to me.\\" Banking Frank McKenna was appointed as Deputy Chair, TD Bank Financial Group effective May 1, 2006. McKenna is responsible for helping to build long-term business relationships that support TD's growth strategy in Canada and the United States. McKenna is responsible for supporting the company in its customer acquisition strategy, particularly in the areas of wholesale and commercial banking. In addition, he is responsible for representing TD as it works to expand its North American presence as one of the continent's ten largest banks, as measured by market capitalization. Frank McKenna is referred to in the book \\"Clinton Cash\\" by Peter Schweizer. The majority of the reference is regarding the Keystone Pipeline decision-making process. Hillary Clinton serving as secretary of State in the United States, and the monetary involvement with TD Bank in Canada is described in depth. The book describes TD Bank, with Frank McKenna as vice chairman, as having \\"paid Bill more than any other financial institution for Lectures. More than Goldman Sachs, UBS, JPMorgan, or anyone on Wall Street\\". Quoting from the book, \\"TD Bank paid Bill $1.8 million for ten speeches over a roughly two-and-half-year period from late 2008 to mid-2011.\\" \\"At several of the speeches, (Bill) Clinton was introduced or interviewed by TD Bank vice chairman Frank McKenna.

They are notorious for boring into (and commonly eventually destroying) wood that is immersed in sea water, including such structures as wooden piers, docks and ships; they drill passages by means of a pair of very small shells borne at one end, with which they rasp their way through. Sometimes called \\"termites of the sea\\", they also are known as \\"Teredo worms\\" or simply Teredo, from the Greek tered≈çn, via Latin. Eventually biologists adopted the common name Teredo as the name for the best-known genus. Description Teredo navalis from Popular Science Monthly, September 1878 Removed from its burrow, the fully grown teredo ranges from several centimetres to about a metre in length, depending on the species. The body is cylindrical, slender, naked and superficially vermiform, meaning \\"worm-shaped\\". In spite of their slender, worm-like forms, shipworms possess the characteristic morphology of bivalves. The ctinidia lie mainly within the branchial siphon, through which the animal pumps the water that passes over the gills. The two siphons are very long and protrude from the posterior end of the animal. Where they leave the end of the main part of the body, the siphons pass between a pair of calcareous plates called pallets. If the animal is alarmed, it withdraws the siphons and the pallets protectively block the opening of the tunnel. The pallets are not to be confused with the two valves of the main shell, which are at the anterior end of the animal. Because they are the organs that the animal applies to boring its tunnel, they generally are located at the tunnel's end. They are borne on the slightly thickened, muscular anterior end of the cylindrical body and they are roughly triangular in shape and markedly concave on their interior surfaces. The outer surfaces are convex and in most species are deeply sculpted into sharp grinding surfaces with which the animals bore their way through the wood or similar medium in which they live and feed. The valves of shipworms are separated and the aperture of the mantle lies between them. The small \\"foot\\" (corresponding to the foot of a clam) can protrude through the aperture. The shipworm lives in waters with oceanic salinity. Accordingly, it is rare in the brackish Baltic Sea, where wooden shipwrecks are preserved for much longer than in the oceans. The range of various species has changed over time based on human activity. Many waters in developed countries that had been plagued by shipworms were cleared of them by pollution from the Industrial Revolution and the modern era; as environmental regulation led to cleaner waters, shipworms have returned. Climate change has also changed the range of species; some once found only in warmer and more salty waters like the Caribbean have established habitats in the Mediterranean. =Kuphus polythalamia= The longest marine bivalve, Kuphus polythalamia, was found from a lagoon near Mindanao island in the southeastern part of the Philippines, which belongs to the same group of mussels and clams. The existence of huge mollusks was established for centuries and studied by the scientists, based on the shells they've left behind that were the size of baseball bats. Live example seen on 19 April 2017 on the BBC's website. The bivalve animal is a rare creature that spends its life inside an elephant tusk-like hard shell made of calcium carbonate. It has a protective cap over its head which it reabsorbs to burrow into the mud for food. The case of the shipworm is not just the home of the black slimy worm. Instead, it acts as the primary source of nourishment in a non-traditional way. The animal can reach a length of 1.5 meters (5 ft.) and a diameter of 6 cm (2.3 in.). It has the ability to reabsorb the shell when it needs to grow and burrow deeper into the mud. K. polythalamia sifts mud and sediment with its gills. Most shipworms are relatively smaller and feed on rotten wood. Instead, the shipworm does not eat, they rely on a beneficial symbiotic bacteria living in its gills. The bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as energy to produce organic carbons that feed the shipworms. The process is similar to the green plants' photosynthesis to convert the carbon dioxide in the air into simple carbon compounds during photosynthesis. Scientists found that K. polythalamia cooperates with different bacteria than other shipworms which could be the reason why it evolved from consuming rotten wood to living on hydrogen sulfide in the mud. The internal organs of the shipworm have shrunk from lack of use over the course of its evolution. The scientists are planning to study the microbes found in the single gill of K. polythalamia to find a new possible antimicrobial substance. Biology When shipworms bore into submerged wood, bacteria (Teredinibacter turnerae), in a special organ called the gland of Deshayes, digest the cellulose exposed in the fine particles created by the excavation. The excavated burrow is usually lined with a calcareous tube. The valves of the shell of shipworms are small separate parts located at the anterior end of the worm, used for excavating the burrow. Taxonomy Shipworms are marine animals in the phylum Mollusca, order Bivalvia, family Teredinidae. They were included in the now obsolete order Eulamellibranchiata, in which many documents still place them. Ruth Turner of Harvard University was the leading 20th century expert on the Teredinidae; she published a detailed monograph on the family, the 1966 volume \\"A Survey and Illustrated Catalogue of the Teredinidae\\" published by the Museum of Comparative Zoology. More recently, the endosymbionts that are found in the gills have been subject to study the bioconversion of cellulose for fuel energy research. =Genera= Shipworm species comprise several genera, of which Teredo is the most commonly mentioned. The best known species is Teredo navalis. Historically, Teredo concentrations in the Caribbean Sea have been substantially higher than in most other salt water bodies. Genera within the family Teridinidae include: * Bactronophorus Tapparone-Canefri, 1877 * Bankia Gray, 1842 * Dicyathifer Iredale, 1932 * Kuphus Guettard, 1770 * Lithoredo Shipway, Distel & Rosenberg, 2019 * Lyrodus Binney, 1870 * Nausitoria Wright, 1884 * Neoteredo Bartsch, 1920 * Nototeredo Bartsch, 1923 * Psiloteredo Bartsch, 1922 * Spathoteredo Moll, 1928 * Teredo Linnaeus, 1758 * Teredora Bartsch, 1921 * Teredothyra Bartsch, 1921 * Uperotus Guettard, 1770 * Zachsia Bulatoff & Rjabtschikoff, 1933 Engineering concerns Shipworms greatly damage wooden hulls and marine piling, and have been the subject of much study to find methods to avoid their attacks. Copper sheathing was used on wooden ships in the latter 18th century and afterwards, as a method of preventing damage by \\"teredo worms\\". The first historically documented use of copper sheathing was experiments held by the British Royal Navy with HMS Alarm, which was coppered in 1761 and thoroughly inspected after a two-year cruise. In a letter from the Navy Board to the Admiralty dated 31 August 1763 it was written \\"that so long as copper plates can be kept upon the bottom, the planks will be thereby entirely secured from the effects of the worm.\\" In the Netherlands the shipworm caused a crisis in the 18th century by attacking the timber that faced the sea dikes. After that the dikes had to be faced with stones. Teredo has recently caused several minor collapses along the Hudson River waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey, due to damage to underwater pilings. Engineering inspiration Teredolites borings in a modern wharf piling. The US one cent coin in the lower left of this image is 19 mm across. In the early 19th century, the behaviour and anatomy of the shipworm inspired the engineer Marc Brunel. Based on his observations of how the shipworm's valves simultaneously enable it to tunnel through wood and protect it from being crushed by the swelling timber, Brunel designed an ingenious modular iron tunnelling framework‚Äîthe very first tunnelling shield‚Äîwhich enabled workers to tunnel successfully through the highly unstable river bed beneath the Thames. The Thames Tunnel was the first successful large tunnel ever built under a navigable river. Literature Henry David Thoreau's poem \\"Though All the Fates\\" pays homage to \\"New England's worm\\" which, in the poem, infests the hull of \\"[t]he vessel, though her masts be firm\\". In time, no matter what the ship carries or where she sails, the shipworm \\"her hulk shall bore,/[a]nd sink her in the Indian seas\\".Henry D. Thoreau, \\"Though All the Fates\\". The hull of the ship whose wreck by a whale inspired Moby Dick had been weakened by shipworms. In the Norse Saga of Erik the Red, Bjarni Herj√≥lfsson, said to be the first European to discover the Americas, had his ship drift into the Irish Ocean where it was eaten up by shipworms. He allowed half the crew to escape in a smaller boat covered in seal tar, while he stayed behind to drown with his men. Culinary delicacy In Palawan and Aklan in the Philippines, the shipworm is called tamilok and is eaten as a delicacy there. It is prepared as kinilaw‚Äîthat is, raw (cleaned) but marinated with vinegar or lime juice, chopped chili peppers and onions, a process very similar to ceviche. The taste of the flesh has been compared to a wide variety of foods, from milk to oysters. Similarly, the delicacy is harvested, sold, and eaten from those taken by local natives in the mangrove forests of West Papua, Indonesia and the central coastal peninsular regions of Thailand near Ko Phra Thong.

The concept is attributed to leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, though other theorists can also be credited for the incipient idea.Daly, H. 2007. Ecological economics: the concept of scale and its relation to allocation, distribution, and uneconomic growth. pp. 82‚Äì103 in H. Daly. Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development: Selected Essays of Herman Daly. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.Daly, H. 1999. Uneconomic growth and the built environment: in theory and in fact. In C.J. Kibert (ed.). Reshaping the Built Environment: Ecology, Ethics, and Economics. Washington DC: Island Press. Note Uneconomic growth (or uneconomic degrowth) should not be confused with economic degrowth, the reduction of the size of the economy to increase well-being and sustainability.http://events.it- sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/en/ The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured. The cost, or decline in well-being, associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of \\"the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system.\\"Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications. Washington: Island Press. In other words, \\"[u]neconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and well-being that is worth more than the items made.\\"Daly, H. 2005. Economics in a full world. Scientific American 293(3): 100‚Äì107. Types of growth The rate or type of economic growth may have important consequences for the environment (the climate and natural capital of ecologies). Concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society led some to advocate lower levels of growth, from which comes the idea of uneconomic growth, and Green parties which argue that economies are part of a global society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without damaging them. Canadian scientist David Suzuki argued in the 1990s that ecologies can only sustain typically about 1.5‚Äì3% new growth per year, and thus any requirement for greater returns from agriculture or forestry will necessarily cannibalize the natural capital of soil or forest. Some think this argument can be applied even to more developed economies. The role of technology, and Jevons paradox Mainstream economists would argue that economies are driven by new technology‚Äîfor instance, we have faster computers today than a year ago, but not necessarily physically more computers. Growth that relies entirely on exploiting increased knowledge rather than exploiting increased resource consumption may thus not qualify as uneconomic growth. In some cases, this may be true where technology enables lower amounts of input to be used in producing the same unit of product (and/or it reduces the amount or hazardousness of the waste generated per unit product produced) (e.g., the increased availability of movies through the Internet or cable television electronically may reduce the demand for physical video tapes or DVDs for films). Nonetheless, it is crucial to also recognise that innovation- or knowledge-driven growth still may not entirely resolve the problem of scale, or increasing resource consumption. For instance, there might likely be more computers due to greater demand and replacements for slower computers. The Jevons Paradox is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource.Jevons, W.S. 1865.

Yates is best known for her work on two television programmes, The Tube and The Big Breakfast. She was the girlfriend of musician Bob Geldof from 1976 to 1986 and was married to him from 1986 to 1996. She was also in a relationship with musician Michael Hutchence from the mid-1990s until Hutchence's death in 1997. Yates died of a heroin overdose in 2000. Early life Born on 24 April 1959\\"Paula Yates\\". The Telegraph (18 September 2000). Retrieved 3 October 2020. in Colwyn Bay, Wales, to English parents, Yates was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl actress and writer of erotic novels from Blackpool, who used the stage name Heller Toren. Up until December 1997, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was 19 years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional. Yates described her childhood as lonely and isolated; her mother, she claimed, was absent for much of her upbringing. She attended a village primary school, Penrhos College, and Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a house near Conwy. After the break-up of her parents' marriage in 1975, Yates lived mostly with her mother despite having a closer relationship with her father, and also had periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain. Career In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called \\"Natural Blonde\\" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside her friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof 'mockumentary' on Bananarama. In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\". After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood. Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her \\"on the bed\\" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof. Personal life Yates met Geldof in the early days of The Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,Fifi Trixibelle Geldof IMDb listing named Fifi after Geldof's aunt Fifi, and Trixibelle because Yates wanted a belle in the family. After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches Geldof on 13 March 1989, and Pixie Geldof on 17 September 1990. Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4's rock magazine programme The Tube. During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when she walked up to him and said, \\"I'm going to have that boy.\\" Yates was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years, even bringing her daughter (Fifi Geldof). Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been under way for some months before their Big Breakfast interview in October 1994. In February 1995, Yates left Geldof. Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates's daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as 'Tiger') was born on 22 July 1996. On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney, and the official verdict into his death said that he committed suicide. Yates wrote in her police statement that Hutchence was \\"frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby.\\" During their phone conversations on the morning of his suicide, he had said, \\"I don't know how I'll live without Tiger.\\" Yates also wrote that Geldof had threatened them repeatedly with, \\"Don't forget, I am above the law\\". Yates became distraught, refusing to accept the coroner's verdict of suicide and insisting that it was a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation. She eventually sought psychiatric treatment. In December 1997, a few weeks after Hutchence's death and while Yates was fighting for custody of Tiger, Yates suffered another blow when it was reported in the media that Jess Yates, who had died in April 1993, was not Yates's biological father. A paternity test proved that the talent show host Hughie Green, who had died six months before Hutchence, was her biological father. In June 1998, Geldof won full custody of the couple's three daughters after Yates attempted suicide. She met Kingsley O'Keke during her stay in treatment, but the pair broke up after a six-week romance. O'Keke later sold his story to a tabloid newspaper. Death On 17 September 2000, on Pixie's 10th birthday, Yates died at her home in Notting Hill at the age of 41 of a heroin overdose. The coroner ruled that it was not a suicide, but a result of \\"foolish and incautious\\" behaviour. Yates was discovered in the presence of her then-four-year-old daughter, Tiger. A friend disclosed during the inquest that Yates had not taken illegal drugs for nearly two years, and the coroner, Paul Knapman, concluded that though the amount Yates had taken would not have killed an addict, as \\"an unsophisticated taker of heroin\\" Yates had no tolerance to the drug. Soon after Yates's death, Geldof assumed foster custody of Tiger Lily so that she could be brought up with her three older half-sisters, Fifi, Peaches and Pixie. Her aunt, Tina Hutchence, the sister of Michael Hutchence, was denied permission by the judge to apply for Tiger Lily to live with her in California. In 2007, Geldof adopted Tiger Lily and changed her surname to Geldof. As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof. On 7 April 2014, Yates's second-oldest daughter, Peaches, also died of a heroin overdose, aged 25. One day before her death, she uploaded a picture to her Instagram of herself as a young girl and her mother under the caption \\"Me and my Mum.\\" Books Paula Yates was the author of several books, including: *Rock Stars in Their Underpants (1980) *A Tail of Two Kitties (1983) *Blondes (1983) *Sex with Paula Yates (1986) *The Fun Starts Here (1990) *The Fun Don't Stop: Loads of Rip-roaring Activities for You and Your Toddler (1991) *And the Fun Goes On: A Practical Guide to Playing and Learning with Your Pre-school Child (1991) *Village People (1993) ReferencesWorks cited  * External links *National Portrait Gallery holdings with sitter Paula Yates * Category:1959 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in London Category:Deaths by heroin overdose in England Category:People educated at Rydal Penrhos Category:People from Colwyn Bay Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English television presenters Category:English women writers Category:People educated at Ysgol Aberconwy Category:20th-century English women writers ","title":"Paula Yates"},{"id":"170829","text":"Miniature oil-filled Coilover shock components for scale cars. A shock absorber or damper is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses. It does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy (typically heat) which is then dissipated. Most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot (a damper which resists motion via viscous friction).  Description  Pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs. An automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston (see below)., Horst Bauer (ed)., Automotive Handbook 4th Edition, Robert Bosch GmbH, 1996, , page 584 One design consideration, when designing or choosing a shock absorber, is where that energy will go. In most shock absorbers, energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid. In hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic fluid heats up, while in air cylinders, the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere. In other types of shock absorbers, such as electromagnetic types, the dissipated energy can be stored and used later. In general terms, shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads. = Vehicle suspension = In a vehicle, shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling. While shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations. Shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs. Spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicle, loaded and unloaded. Some people use shocks to modify spring rates but this is not the correct use. Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down. Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance. Spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs, though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well. Ideal springs alone, however, are not shock absorbers, as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy. Vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars. In this combination, \\"shock absorber\\" refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration. Now, composite suspension system are used mainly in 2 wheelers and also leaf spring are made up of composite material in 4 wheelers. Early history In common with carriages and railway locomotives, most early motor vehicles used leaf springs. One of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping, and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension, the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was \\"impossible\\" to use them as main springs.\\"Springs - A simple study of car suspension\\", The Automotor Journal, August 10th, 1912, pp936-937 However the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs, and whether wet or dry. It also operated in both directions. Motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung Druid forks from about 1906, and similar designs later added rotary friction dampers, which damped both ways - but they were adjustable (e.g. 1924 Webb forks). These friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars. One of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded, especially for the rear springs. When heavily loaded the springs could bottom out, and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops', there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded, which were often called 'shock absorbers'. Realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency, these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period, but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat. What was called for was damping that operated on the rebound. Although C.L. Horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping, it worked in one direction only. It does not seem to have gone into production right away, whereas mechanical dampers such as the Gabriel Snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s (also the similar Stromberg Anti-Shox). These used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring, but met friction when drawn out. Gabriel Snubbers were fitted to an 11.9HP Arrol-Johnston car which broke the 6 hour Class B record at Brooklands in late 1912, and the Automotor journal noted that this snubber might have a great future for racing due to its light weight and easy fitment.\\"Some accessories to see at Olympia\\", The Automotor Journal, Nov 2nd , 1912, p1284 One of the earliest hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed by Polyrhoe Carburettors Ltd. This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers' mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction. The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, in place of the rear spring to chassis mount, so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part.\\"What a Chauffeur Expects to see at Olympia\\", The Automotor Journal, Nov 9th 1912, p1313 This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself. The first production hydraulic dampers to act on the main leaf spring movement were probably those based on an original concept by Maurice Houdaille patented in 1908 and 1909. These used a lever arm which moved hydraulically damped vanes inside the unit. The main advantage over the friction disk dampers was that it would resist sudden movement but allow slow movement, whereas the rotary friction dampers tended to stick and then offer the same resistance regardless of speed of movement. There appears to have been little progress on commercialising the lever arm shock absorbers until after World War I, after which they came into widespread use, for example as standard equipment on the 1927 Ford Model A and manufactured by Houde Engineering Corporation of Buffalo, NY. Types of vehicle shock absorbers Diagram of the main components of a twin-tube and mono-tube shock absorber Most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes. =Twin-tube=Basic twin-tube Also known as a \\"two- tube\\" shock absorber, this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes, an inner tube that is called the \\"working tube\\" or the \\"pressure tube\\", and an outer tube called the \\"reserve tube\\". At the bottom of the device on the inside is a compression valve or base valve. When the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road, hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or \\"orifices\\" in the piston and via the valve, converting the \\"shock\\" energy into heat which must then be dissipated. Twin-tube gas charged Variously known as a \\"gas cell two-tube\\" or similarly-named design, this variation represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form. Its overall structure is very similar to the twin-tube, but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube. The result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in \\"foaming\\" or \\"aeration\\", the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly. Twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations. Position sensitive damping Often abbreviated simply as \\"PSD\\", this design is another evolution of the twin-tube shock. In a PSD shock absorber, which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas, a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube. These grooves allow the piston to move relatively freely in the middle range of travel (i.e., the most common street or highway use, called by engineers the \\"comfort zone\\") and to move with significantly less freedom in response to shifts to more irregular surfaces when upward and downward movement of the piston starts to occur with greater intensity (i.e., on bumpy sections of roads‚Äî the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range on either side of the comfort zone is called the \\"control zone\\"). This advance allowed car designers to make a shock absorber tailored to specific makes and models of vehicles and to take into account a given vehicle's size and weight, its maneuverability, its horsepower, etc. in creating a correspondingly effective shock. Acceleration sensitive damping The next phase in shock absorber evolution was the development of a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from \\"bumpy\\" to \\"smooth\\" but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction. This was achieved through a change in the design of the compression valve, and has been termed \\"acceleration sensitive damping\\" or \\"ASD\\". Not only does this result in a complete disappearance of the \\"comfort vs. control\\" tradeoff, it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns. However, ASD shocks are usually only available as aftermarket changes to a vehicle and are only available from a limited number of manufacturers. Coilover Coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring. They are common on motorcycle and scooter rear suspensions, and widely used on front and rear suspensions in cars. =Mono-tube= thumbHydraulic shock absorber monotube in different operational situations: 1 ) Drive slow or adjustments open 2 ) Like \\"1\\", but extension immediately after the compression 3 ) Drive fast adjustments or closed, you can see the bubbles of depression, which can lead to the phenomenon of cavitation 4 ) Like \\"3\\", but the extension immediately after the compression Note: The volume change caused by the stem is considered. thumbleftAbsorber with remote-reservoir connected rigidly, compared to most shock absorbers. It uses a diaphragm instead of a membrane, and does not contain a control valve for expansion of the pneumatic chamber. Description: 1) Sheath and gas tank 2) Stem 3) Snap rings 4) Plate bearing spring 5) Spring 6) End cap and preload adjustment 7) Cap gas, present in versions both with or without gas valve (inverted profile) 8) Mobile diaphragm 9) Pad switch (compression) 10) Wiper 11) Oil seal assembly, and shock seal 12) Negative buffer pad or limit switch (extension) 13) Piston with sliding blades and seal The principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components. The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks. However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way‚Äî it does not have any directionality. It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do. Mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958. They were manufactured by Bilstein, patented the design and first appeared in 1954s.Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption. Because the design was patented, no other manufacturer could use it until 1971 when the patent expired. = Spool valve = Spool valve dampers are characterized by the use of hollow cylindrical sleeves with machined-in oil passages as opposed to traditional conventional flexible discs or shims. Spool valving can be applied with monotube, twin-tube, and/or position-sensitive packaging, and is compatible with electronic control. Primary among benefits cited in Multimatic‚Äôs 2010 patent filing is the elimination of performance ambiguity associated with flexible shims, resulting in mathematically predictable, repeatable, and robust pressure-flow characteristics. Theoretical approaches There are several commonly used principles behind shock absorption: * Hysteresis of structural material, for example the compression of rubber disks, stretching of rubber bands and cords, bending of steel springs, or twisting of torsion bars. Hysteresis is the tendency for otherwise elastic materials to rebound with less force than was required to deform them. Simple vehicles with no separate shock absorbers are damped, to some extent, by the hysteresis of their springs and frames. * Dry friction as used in wheel brakes, by using disks (classically made of leather) at the pivot of a lever, with friction forced by springs. Used in early automobiles such as the Ford Model T, up through some British cars of the 1940s and on the French Citroen 2CV in the 1950s. Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks, and it can be easily rebuilt with simple hand tools. A disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion. : * Solid state, tapered chain shock absorbers, using one or more tapered, axial alignment(s) of granular spheres, typically made of metals such as nitinol, in a casing. , * Fluid friction, for example the flow of fluid through a narrow orifice (hydraulics), constitutes the vast majority of automotive shock absorbers. This design first appeared on Mors racing cars in 1902.Setright, L. J. K. \\"Dampers: Smoothing Out the Bumps\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.490. One advantage of this type is, by using special internal valving, the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression (allowing a soft response to a bump) and relatively stiff to extension, controlling \\"rebound\\", which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs; similarly, a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound. Specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration, then strongly resist letting it settle, thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction. : * Compression of a gas, for example pneumatic shock absorbers, which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it. Enclosed gas is compressible, so equipment is less subject to shock damage. This concept was first applied in series production on Citro√´n cars in 1954. Today, many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen, to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use. This causes foaming which temporarily reduces the damping ability of the unit. In very heavy duty units used for racing or off- road use, there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas. In aircraft landing gear, air shock absorbers may be combined with hydraulic damping to reduce bounce. Such struts are called oleo struts (combining oil and air) . * Inertial resistance to acceleration, the Citro√´n 2CV had shock absorbers that damp wheel bounce with no external moving parts. These consisted of a spring- mounted 3.5 kg (7.75 lb) iron weight inside a vertical cylinder and are similar to, yet much smaller than versions of the tuned mass dampers used on tall buildings. * Composite hydropneumatic suspension combines many suspension elements in a single device: spring action, shock absorption, ride-height control, and self leveling suspension. This combines the advantages of gas compressibility and the ability of hydraulic machinery to apply force multiplication. * Conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control, and self leveling suspension. * In an electrorheological fluid damper, an electric field changes the viscosity of the oil. This principle allows semi-active damper applications in automotive and various industries. * Magnetic field variation: a magneto rheological damper changes its fluid characteristics through an electromagnet. * The effect of a shock absorber at high (sound) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings. Special features *Some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber. *In more expensive vehicles the valves may be remotely adjustable, offering the driver control of the ride at will while the vehicle is operated. *Additional control can be provided by dynamic valve control via computer in response to sensors, giving both a smooth ride and a firm suspension when needed, allowing ride height adjustment or even ride height control. *Ride height control is especially desirable in highway vehicles intended for occasional rough road use, as a means of improving handling and reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the vehicle when operating on improved high speed roads. Shock absorber vs struts * unlike the shock absorber, the strut has a reinforced body and stem; * strut already plays the role of shocks absorbers, so the shock absorber may well act as part of the strut, not the other way around * struts is subjected to multidirectional loads, while the shock absorber only damps vibrations and receive an impact along its axis; * the strut gives to the car greater reliability; * Strut and shock absorber have a different way of attachment. Shock absorbers are mounted through silent blocks without a swivel device and are equipped with a small diameter rod. Strut replaces the upper ball and rotator.

The series premiered on MTV on March 5, 2002, and, in its first season, was cited as the most- viewed series ever on MTV. The final episode aired on March 21, 2005. More recently, The Osbournes Want to Believe was released on August 2, 2020 on Travel Channel. Overview In addition to heavy metal music musician Ozzy Osbourne, the show features his wife and manager Sharon, and their children Jack and Kelly. The Osbournes have another daughter, Aimee, who refused to participate in the show and publicly criticized her parents for their antics on the show. In most family photos shown on the show, she is either absent or blurred. The series also followed the family as they dealt with major events such as Sharon's battle with cancer, and the aftermath of an ATV accident that nearly killed Ozzy. The theme song for the show is a cover of Ozzy's song \\"Crazy Train\\" by Lewis Lamedica, done in a jazz-swing style reminiscent of Pat Boone. Concurrent with the success of the series, Kelly Osbourne launched a brief career as a singer, while Sharon Osbourne hosted The Sharon Osbourne Show. The family also parodied their TV series during cameo appearances at awards shows, and in the film Austin Powers in Goldmember. Jack and Kelly's friend Robert made regular appearances on the show; Sharon took him in during the second season after his mother died of cancer. While a constant presence in front of the camera, few plots revolved around Robert and he had few lines. After the series ended, it was reported that the Osbournes had sent Robert back to Rhode Island to live with his father after spending a week at a psychiatric ward. The Osbournes were assumed to have adopted Robert, but Sharon Osbourne has denied this. Another person who makes recurring appearances on the show is Melinda, Sharon's executive assistant and nanny, who is also married to Ozzy's tour manager.Adams, Cameron. Ozzy Osbourne battles on. The Herald Sun. November 1, 2007. She is often seen trying to get Jack out of bed while he berates and belittles her, telling her to \\"get a real job.\\" Melinda is originally from Australia. Ozzy confirmed in an interview on BBC Radio 2 in May 2009 that he was \\"stoned during the entire filming of The Osbournes\\" and will not watch the episodes for this reason. Profanity was censored during MTV broadcasts of the series in the United States. In an interview, Ozzy stated that while he was happy that the Canadian broadcasts were uncensored, he preferred the censored version because the cursing was more noticeable due to the bleeps. The Canadian broadcasts on CTV and UK broadcasts on MTV and Channel 4 are uncensored. Some episodes were also aired uncensored to Australian audiences when shown on Network Ten. It is broadcast uncensored on MTV Australia. Staging It was long suspected by some fans that The Osbournes was staged. These suspicions were partly confirmed by Jack and Kelly, who stated in an interview that some of the antics on the show, including the visit from the dog therapist, were arranged by MTV producers.Osbourne Kids Says Some Shows Were Scripted. ABC News. Retrieved May 24, 2014. Ozzy Osbourne's publicist denied these claims. One episode (\\"Ozz Well that Ends Well\\"), in which Sharon's prized dog Minnie is supposedly killed, was revealed to be a prank in outtakes aired after the show. After filming On November 30 and December 1, 2007, items belonging to the Osbournes and featured in the show were auctioned off to the public. The two- day event listed memorabilia as well as furnishings of the home. Bidders could bid through the Auction Network. In 2009, the Osbournes reunited for the debut of their new variety show Osbournes Reloaded for the Fox network. Produced by Fremantle Media North America, the series debuted on March 31, 2009 at 9:25PM ET/PT, following American Idol. It consisted of sketches, stunts, celebrity cameos, music performances, and pretaped segments. The show was canceled after airing its first episode. On its debut, 26 Fox affiliates pre-empted or delayed the program due to its racy content, which the stations felt was more appropriate for older viewers. Since 2016, Ozzy and Jack have starred in Ozzy & Jack's World Detour, a reality-series that initially aired on History before moving to A&E; for its second season. On January 23, 2018, Jack revealed on his official Instagram page that the series had been picked up for a third season. Possible revival On October 7, 2014, Sharon Osbourne announced on Loose Women that eight new episodes would hopefully be filmed in January 2015 that would air on VH1; they would serve as a catch-up for the original series as well as a chance for Ozzy to appear on the show sober, following his admission that he was intoxicated during every recording for the series' original run. However, Sharon said in 2015 that the show's filming would not continue, and that she and VH1 had not continued their discussion about the show since they announced its revival. The new episodes that were filmed may be released in the future. In October 2015, Kelly Osbourne stated that she was open to the idea of a revival that was new and different, saying that \\"we did it on MTV and that had never been done before so if we're going to come back, we'd want to do it in a way that has never been done before either.\\" On March 5, 2018; Jack, Kelly, Sharon and Ozzy premiered their first episode of The Osbournes Podcast on their website and Apple Podcasts (later released on Spotify, Stitcher and Google Play). It is a weekly podcast, with a new episode added on Mondays. They talk about various topics including: reminiscing about The Osbournes glory days, Ozzy and Jack's World Detour, personal struggles, current events, funny stories and more. They also have guests on as well such as Melinda and Dave. DVD and album releases Only seasons one and two (released in two sets as season two and two 1/2 or 2.5) have been released on DVD. The Osbourne Family Album, a various artists compilation based on the show, was released in June 2002.  Awards and nominations  As well as achieving the highest ratings in MTV history, The Osbournes won a 2002 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program. International airings The series aired on CTV in Canada, Channel 4 in the UK and MTV UK and Ireland in Ireland and the UK, VH1 India in India, RT√â Two in Ireland, Network Ten and MTV Australia in Australia, TV2 Denmark, MTV Finland and Nelonen in Finland, MTV Latin America in Latin America, MTV Portugal in Portugal, TV2 in New Zealand, MTV Germany in Germany, MTV Ukraine in Ukraine, MTV Brasil in Brazil, MTV Italia in Italy and MTV Nederland in the Netherlands.

Supergiant stars occupy the top region of the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram with absolute visual magnitudes between about ‚àí3 and ‚àí8. The temperature range of supergiant stars spans from about 3,400 K to over 20,000 K. Definition The title supergiant, as applied to a star, does not have a single concrete definition. The term giant star was first coined by Hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. One region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types A to M and received the name giant. Subsequently, as they lacked any measurable parallax, it became apparent that some of these stars were significantly larger and more luminous than the bulk, and the term super-giant arose, quickly adopted as supergiant. =Spectral luminosity class= The four brightest stars in NGC 4755 are blue supergiant stars, with a red supergiant star at the centre. (ESO VLT) Supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra, with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity. In 1897, Antonia C. Maury had divided stars based on the widths of their spectral lines, with her class \\"c\\" identifying stars with the narrowest lines. Although it was not known at the time, these were the most luminous stars. In 1943 Morgan and Keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes, with class I referring to supergiant stars. The same system of MK luminosity classes is still used today, with refinements based on the increased resolution of modern spectra. Supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class O supergiants to highly evolved red class M supergiants. Because they are enlarged compared to main-sequence and giant stars of the same spectral type, they have lower surface gravities, and changes can be observed in their line profiles. Supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars. This is the basis of the MK luminosity system which assigns stars to luminosity classes purely from observing their spectra. In addition to the line changes due to low surface gravity and fusion products, the most luminous stars have high mass-loss rates and resulting clouds of expelled circumstellar materials which can produce emission lines, P Cygni profiles, or forbidden lines. The MK system assigns stars to luminosity classes: Ib for supergiants; Ia for luminous supergiants; and 0 (zero) or Ia+ for hypergiants. In reality there is much more of a continuum than well defined bands for these classifications, and classifications such as Iab are used for intermediate luminosity supergiants. Supergiant spectra are frequently annotated to indicate spectral peculiarities, for example B2 Iae or F5 Ipec. =Evolutionary supergiants= Supergiants can also be defined as a specific phase in the evolutionary history of certain stars. Stars with initial masses above quickly and smoothly initiate helium core fusion after they have exhausted their hydrogen, and continue fusing heavier elements after helium exhaustion until they develop an iron core, at which point the core collapses to produce a Type 2 supernova. Once these massive stars leave the main sequence, their atmospheres inflate, and they are described as supergiants. Stars initially under will never form an iron core and in evolutionary terms do not become supergiants, although they can reach luminosities thousands of times the sun's. They cannot fuse carbon and heavier elements after the helium is exhausted, so they eventually just lose their outer layers, leaving the core of a white dwarf. The phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), as stars gradually become more and more luminous class M stars. Stars of may fuse sufficient carbon on the AGB to produce an oxygen- neon core and an electron-capture supernova, but astrophysicists categorise these as super-AGB stars rather than supergiants. =Categorisation of evolved stars= There are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants. Asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars are highly evolved lower-mass red giants with luminosities that can be comparable to more massive red supergiants, but because of their low mass, being in a different stage of development (helium shell burning), and their lives ending in a different way (planetary nebula and white dwarf rather than supernova), astrophysicists prefer to keep them separate. The dividing line becomes blurred at around (or as high as in some models) where stars start to undergo limited fusion of elements heavier than helium. Specialists studying these stars often refer to them as super AGB stars, since they have many properties in common with AGB such as thermal pulsing. Others describe them as low-mass supergiants since they start to burn elements heavier than helium and can explode as supernovae. Many post-AGB stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes. For example, RV Tauri has an Ia (bright supergiant) luminosity class despite being less massive than the sun. Some AGB stars also receive a supergiant luminosity class, most notably W Virginis variables such as W Virginis itself, stars that are executing a blue loop triggered by thermal pulsing. A very small number of Mira variables and other late AGB stars have supergiant luminosity classes, for example Œ± Herculis. Classical Cepheid variables typically have supergiant luminosity classes, although only the most luminous and massive will actually go on to develop an iron core. The majority of them are intermediate mass stars fusing helium in their cores and will eventually transition to the asymptotic giant branch. Œ¥ Cephei itself is an example with a luminosity of and a mass of . Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars, hotter than most supergiants and smaller, visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures. They have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements, usually showing little or no hydrogen, which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants. Just as the AGB stars occur in almost the same region of the HR diagram as red supergiants, Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars can occur in the same region of the HR diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars. The most massive and luminous main- sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into. They have almost identical temperatures and very similar luminosities, and only the most detailed analyses can distinguish the spectral features that show they have evolved away from the narrow early O-type main- sequence to the nearby area of early O-type supergiants. Such early O-type supergiants share many features with WNLh Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars, intermediates between the two types. Luminous blue variables (LBVs) stars occur in the same region of the HR diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately. They are evolved, expanded, massive, and luminous stars, often hypergiants, but they have very specific spectral variability, which defies the assignment of a standard spectral type. LBVs observed only at a particular time or over a period of time when they are stable, may simply be designated as hot supergiants or as candidate LBVs due to their luminosity. Hypergiants are frequently treated as a different category of star from supergiants, although in all important respects they are just a more luminous category of supergiant. They are evolved, expanded, massive and luminous stars like supergiants, but at the most massive and luminous extreme, and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability. Generally only the more evolved supergiants show hypergiant properties, since their instability increases after high mass-loss and some increase in luminosity. Some B[e] stars are supergiants although other B[e] stars are clearly not. Some researchers distinguish the B[e] objects as separate from supergiants, while researchers prefer to define massive evolved B[e] stars as a subgroup of supergiants. The latter has become more common with the understanding that the B[e] phenomenon arises separately in a number of distinct types of stars, including some that are clearly just a phase in the life of supergiants. Properties The disc and atmosphere of Betelgeuse (ESO) Supergiants have masses from 8 to 12 times the Sun () upwards, and luminosities from about 1,000 to over a million times the Sun (). They vary greatly in radius, usually from 30 to 500, or even in excess of 1,000 solar radii (). They are massive enough to begin helium-core burning gently before the core becomes degenerate, without a flash and without the strong dredge-ups that lower-mass stars experience. They go on to successively ignite heavier elements, usually all the way to iron. Also because of their high masses, they are destined to explode as supernovae. The Stefan-Boltzmann law dictates that the relatively cool surfaces of red supergiants radiate much less energy per unit area than those of blue supergiants; thus, for a given luminosity, red supergiants are larger than their blue counterparts. Radiation pressure limits the largest cool supergiants to around 1,500 and the most massive hot supergiants to around a million (Mbol around ‚àí10). Stars near and occasionally beyond these limits become unstable, pulsate, and experience rapid mass loss. =Surface gravity= The supergiant luminosity class is assigned on the basis of spectral features that are largely a measure of surface gravity, although such stars are also affected by other properties such as microturbulence. Supergiants typically have surface gravities of around log(g) 2.0 cgs and lower, although bright giants (luminosity class II) have statistically very similar surface gravities to normal Ib supergiants. Cool luminous supergiants have lower surface gravities, with the most luminous (and unstable) stars having log(g) around zero. Hotter supergiants, even the most luminous, have surface gravities around one, due to their higher masses and smaller radii. =Temperature= There are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-M class stars at around 3,400 K to the hottest O class stars over 40,000 K. Supergiants are generally not found cooler than mid-M class. This is expected theoretically since they would be catastrophically unstable; however, there are potential exceptions among extreme stars such as VX Sagittarii. Although supergiants exist in every class from O to M, the majority are spectral type B, more than at all other spectral classes combined. A much smaller grouping consists of very low-luminosity G-type supergiants, intermediate mass stars burning helium in their cores before reaching the asymptotic giant branch. A distinct grouping is made up of high-luminosity supergiants at early B (B0-2) and very late O (O9.5), more common even than main sequence stars of those spectral types. The relative numbers of blue, yellow, and red supergiants is an indicator of the speed of stellar evolution and is used as a powerful test of models of the evolution of massive stars. =Luminosity= The supergiants lie more or less on a horizontal band occupying the entire upper portion of the HR diagram, but there are some variations at different spectral types. These variations are due partly to different methods for assigning luminosity classes at different spectral types, and partly to actual physical differences in the stars. The bolometric luminosity of a star reflects its total output of electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths. For very hot and very cool stars, the bolometric luminosity is dramatically higher than the visual luminosity, sometimes several magnitudes or a factor of five or more. This bolometric correction is approximately one magnitude for mid B, late K, and early M stars, increasing to three magnitudes (a factor of 15) for O and mid M stars. All supergiants are larger and more luminous than main sequence stars of the same temperature. This means that hot supergiants lie on a relatively narrow band above bright main sequence stars. A B0 main sequence star has an absolute magnitude of about ‚àí5, meaning that all B0 supergiants are significantly brighter than absolute magnitude ‚àí5\\\\. Bolometric luminosities for even the faintest blue supergiants are tens of thousands of times the sun (). The brightest can be and are often unstable such as Œ± Cygni variables and luminous blue variables. The very hottest supergiants with early O spectral types occur in an extremely narrow range of luminosities above the highly luminous early O main sequence and giant stars. They are not classified separately into normal (Ib) and luminous (Ia) supergiants, although they commonly have other spectral type modifiers such as \\"f\\" for nitrogen and helium emission (e.g. O2 If for HD 93129A). Yellow supergiants can be considerably fainter than absolute magnitude ‚àí5, with some examples around ‚àí2 (e.g. 14 Persei). With bolometric corrections around zero, they may only be a few hundred times the luminosity of the sun. These are not massive stars, though; instead, they are stars of intermediate mass that have particularly low surface gravities, often due to instability such as Cepheid pulsations. These intermediate mass stars' being classified as supergiants during a relatively long-lasting phase of their evolution account for the large number of low luminosity yellow supergiants. The most luminous yellow stars, the yellow hypergiants, are amongst the visually brightest stars, with absolute magnitudes around ‚àí9, although still less than . There is a strong upper limit to the luminosity of red supergiants at around . Stars that would be brighter than this shed their outer layers so rapidly that they remain hot supergiants after they leave the main sequence. The majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant (Ia) M class stars. The least luminous stars classified as red supergiants are some of the brightest AGB and post-AGB stars, highly expanded and unstable low mass stars such as the RV Tauri variables. The majority of AGB stars are given giant or bright giant luminosity classes, but particularly unstable stars such as W Virginis variables may be given a supergiant classification (e.g. W Virginis itself). The faintest red supergiants are around absolute magnitude ‚àí3\\\\. =Variability= RS Puppis is a supergiant and Classical Cepheid variable. While most supergiants such as Alpha Cygni variables, semiregular variables, and irregular variables show some degree of photometric variability, certain types of variables amongst the supergiants are well defined. The instability strip crosses the region of supergiants, and specifically many yellow supergiants are Classical Cepheid variables. The same region of instability extends to include the even more luminous yellow hypergiants, an extremely rare and short-lived class of luminous supergiant. Many R Coronae Borealis variables, although not all, are yellow supergiants, but this variability is due to their unusual chemical composition rather than a physical instability. Further types of variable stars such as RV Tauri variables and PV Telescopii variables are often described as supergiants. RV Tau stars are frequently assigned spectral types with a supergiant luminosity class on account of their low surface gravity, and they are amongst the most luminous of the AGB and post-AGB stars, having masses similar to the sun; likewise, the even rarer PV Tel variables are often classified as supergiants, but have lower luminosities than supergiants and peculiar B[e] spectra extremely deficient in hydrogen. Possibly they are also post-AGB objects or \\"born-again\\" AGB stars. The LBVs are variable with multiple semi-regular periods and less predictable eruptions and giant outbursts. They are usually supergiants or hypergiants, occasionally with Wolf-Rayet spectra‚Äîextremely luminous, massive, evolved stars with expanded outer layers, but they are so distinctive and unusual that they are often treated as a separate category without being referred to as supergiants or given a supergiant spectral type. Often their spectral type will be given just as \\"LBV\\" because they have peculiar and highly variable spectral features, with temperatures varying from about 8,000 K in outburst up to 20,000 K or more when \\"quiescent.\\" =Chemical abundances= The abundance of various elements at the surface of supergiants is different from less luminous stars. Supergiants are evolved stars and may have undergone convection of fusion products to the surface. Cool supergiants show enhanced helium and nitrogen at the surface due to convection of these fusion products to the surface during the main sequence of very massive stars, to dredge-ups during shell burning, and to the loss of the outer layers of the star. Helium is formed in the core and shell by fusion of hydrogen and nitrogen which accumulates relative to carbon and oxygen during CNO cycle fusion. At the same time, carbon and oxygen abundances are reduced. Red supergiants can be distinguished from luminous but less massive AGB stars by unusual chemicals at the surface, enhancement of carbon from deep third dredge-ups, as well as carbon-13, lithium and s-process elements. Late-phase AGB stars can become highly oxygen-enriched, producing OH masers. Hotter supergiants show differing levels of nitrogen enrichment. This may be due to different levels of mixing on the main sequence due to rotation or because some blue supergiants are newly evolved from the main sequence while others have previously been through a red supergiant phase. Post-red supergiant stars have a generally higher level of nitrogen relative to carbon due to convection of CNO-processed material to the surface and the complete loss of the outer layers. Surface enhancement of helium is also stronger in post-red supergiants, representing more than a third of the atmosphere. Evolution O type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the B type blue-white stars become supergiants. Due to their extreme masses, they have short lifespans, between 30 million years and a few hundred thousand years. They are mainly observed in young galactic structures such as open clusters, the arms of spiral galaxies, and in irregular galaxies. They are less abundant in spiral galaxy bulges and are rarely observed in elliptical galaxies, or globular clusters, which are composed mainly of old stars. Supergiants develop when massive main-sequence stars run out of hydrogen in their cores, at which point they start to expand, just like lower-mass stars. Unlike lower-mass stars, however, they begin to fuse helium in the core smoothly and not long after exhausting their hydrogen. This means that they do not increase their luminosity as dramatically as lower-mass stars, and they progress nearly horizontally across the HR diagram to become red supergiants. Also unlike lower-mass stars, red supergiants are massive enough to fuse elements heavier than helium, so they do not puff off their atmospheres as planetary nebulae after a period of hydrogen and helium shell burning; instead, they continue to burn heavier elements in their cores until they collapse. They cannot lose enough mass to form a white dwarf, so they will leave behind a neutron star or black hole remnant, usually after a core collapse supernova explosion. Stars more massive than about cannot expand into a red supergiant. Because they burn too quickly and lose their outer layers too quickly, they reach the blue supergiant stage, or perhaps yellow hypergiant, before returning to become hotter stars. The most massive stars, above about , hardly move at all from their position as O main-sequence stars. These convect so efficiently that they mix hydrogen from the surface right down to the core. They continue to fuse hydrogen until it is almost entirely depleted throughout the star, then rapidly evolve through a series of stages of similarly hot and luminous stars: supergiants, slash stars, WNh-, WN-, and possibly WC- or WO-type stars. They are expected to explode as supernovae, but it is not clear how far they evolve before this happens. The existence of these supergiants still burning hydrogen in their cores may necessitate a slightly more complex definition of supergiant: a massive star with increased size and luminosity due to fusion products building up, but still with some hydrogen remaining. The first stars in the universe are thought to have been considerably brighter and more massive than the stars in the modern universe. Part of the theorized population III of stars, their existence is necessary to explain observations of elements other than hydrogen and helium in quasars. Possibly larger and more luminous than any supergiant known today, their structure was quite different, with reduced convection and less mass loss. Their very short lives are likely to have ended in violent photodisintegration or pair instability supernovae. Supernova progenitors Most type II supernova progenitors are thought to be red supergiants, while the less common type Ib/c supernovae are produced by hotter Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars that have completely lost more of their hydrogen atmosphere. Almost by definition, supergiants are destined to end their lives violently. Stars large enough to start fusing elements heavier than helium do not seem to have any way to lose enough mass to avoid catastrophic core collapse, although some may collapse, almost without trace, into their own central black holes. The simple \\"onion\\" models showing red supergiants inevitably developing to an iron core and then exploding have been shown, however, to be too simplistic. The progenitor for the unusual type II Supernova 1987A was a blue supergiant, thought to have already passed through the red supergiant phase of its life, and this is now known to be far from an exceptional situation. Much research is now focused on how blue supergiants can explode as a supernova and when red supergiants can survive to become hotter supergiants again. Well known examples Supergiants are rare and short-lived stars, but their high luminosity means that there are many naked- eye examples, including some of the brightest stars in the sky. Rigel, the brightest star in the constellation Orion is a typical blue-white supergiant; Deneb is the brightest star in Cygnus, a white supergiant; Delta Cephei is the famous prototype Cepheid variable, a yellow supergiant; and Betelgeuse, Antares and UY Scuti are red supergiants. Œº Cephei is one of the reddest stars visible to the naked eye and one of the largest in the galaxy. Rho Cassiopeiae, a variable, yellow hypergiant, is one of the most luminous naked- eye stars.

Sam Raimi co-wrote the script and served as second unit director. The film stars Tim Robbins as a na√Øve but ambitious business school graduate who is installed as president of a manufacturing company, Jennifer Jason Leigh as a newspaper reporter, and Paul Newman as a company director who hires the graduate as part of a stock scam. The script was finished in 1985, but production did not start until 1991, when Joel Silver acquired the script for Silver Pictures. Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to distribute the film, with further financing from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films. Filming at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina lasted from November 1992 to March 1993. The New York City scale model set was designed by Michael J. McAlister and Mark Stetson, with further effects provided by The Computer Film Company. Upon its release in March 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy received mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office, but has since gained a cult following. Plot In December 1958, Norville Barnes, a business college graduate from Muncie, Indiana, arrives in New York City, looking for a job. He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries, a large corporation. Soon thereafter, the company's founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits suicide during a business meeting by jumping out of a top-floor window. Afterwards, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the company's board of directors, knowing that Hudsucker Industries' bylaws call for Hudsucker's stock shares to be sold to the public, suggests a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring a clearly incompetent president to run the business. In the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a \\"Blue Letter\\" to Mussburger; the letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville takes the opportunity to engage with Mussburger, pitching an invention of his (indicated with no other explanation than a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, \\"you know: for kids.\\"). Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus newspaper, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She obtains a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from his alma mater in Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows \\"just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker\\". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe it. The other executives at Hudsucker Industries decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and further depress the company's stock. However, the invention is the hula hoop, which initially fails in obscurity but then becomes an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital. On New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz, whom Mussburger had convinced that Norville had stolen the flexi-straw idea after re-hiring him to his elevator job. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. Suddenly, while Norville plummets, Moses stops the building's giant clock which freezes time. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him to read the Blue Letter (still in Norville's uniform pocket) that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger: it contains Hudsucker's instructions to transfer his shares to his immediate successor as president, rather than to the public. This would have been Mussburger, but, unaware of this, he proceeded with his scheme to elect Norville. Inside the building's giant clock, Moses fights Aloysius, defeating him. Norville falls safely to the ground. He and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, it is Mussburger who attempts suicide and is sent to the asylum while Norville develops a new invention ‚Äî \\"for kids\\" ‚Äî an enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that will ultimately turn out to be a frisbee.

Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981,Muir, p. 77 and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985),Warren, pp. 101‚Äì102 and post-production on Blood Simple (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire, Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms.Levin, pp. 103‚Äì118 Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention of commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said \\"It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say 'They're really fun - let's do one'; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them.'\\" Raimi describes the script as \\"big-business comedy. It's a return to the very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties.\\" So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them. One film critic described the numerous influences: \\"From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero trapped in a Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not in a world that seems to have been created by Fritz Lang ‚Äì the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927).\\" An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: \\"Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them ‚Äì and we're not.\\" The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma. The first image the Coens and Raimi conceived was of Norville Barnes about to jump from the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him.Bergan, pp. 148‚Äì162 The inclusion of the hula hoop came as a result of a plot device. Joel remembers, \\"We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success.\\" Ethan said, \\"The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate.\\" Joel: \\"What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback.\\" It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project \\"takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes.\\"Woods, pp. 125‚Äì135 Despite having finished the script in 1985, Joel explained, \\"We couldn't make Hudsucker back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script was too expensive and we had just completed Blood Simple, which was an independent film.\\"Woods, pp. 9‚Äì10, 122‚Äì124 After completing Barton Fink (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film. The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite. Producer Joel Silver, a fan of the Coens' previous films, acquired the script for his production company, Silver Pictures, and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures. Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control. =Production= This was the first time the Coen brothers chose big stars to act in their movie. Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins. Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer, before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast.Mottram, pp. 93‚Äì113 Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink; her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur. When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, \\"Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names,\\" remembered Joel. \\"A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life.\\" However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts. Once Newman and Robbins signed on, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films agreed to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures. The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina beginning on November 30, 1992. Raimi served as second unit director, shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker's suicide. Production designer Dennis Gassner was influenced by fascist architecture, particularly the work of Albert Speer, as well as Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985), Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement.Robson, pp. 139‚Äì142 Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages. Gassner noted \\"You see, we wanted things to be big.\\" He said that the huge 1950's-inspired table up in the boardroom was so long, it had to be built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage. The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel. Principal photography ended on March 18, 1993. In addition, numerous sequences were filmed in downtown Chicago, particularly in the Merchandise Mart building for the entrance and lobby to Hudsucker Industries and the Hilton Chicago Christmas ballroom. The presses in the News & Observer building in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina appeared in the movie. =Visual effects= The visual effects supervisor was Michael J. McAlister (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Willow) with Mark Stetson (Superman Returns, Peter Pan) as miniatures supervisor. Peter Chesney, mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films, created a pair of 16-foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning, who portrayed Waring Hudsucker. \\"I made a complicated steel armature with a lot of electric motors to time everything so he can fold up his wings, unfold them and flap them about. Then we covered them with real duck and turkey feathers,\\" says Chesney. \\"We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion.\\" The buildings in the background (designed by McAlister and Stetson) were 1:24 scale models, shot separately and merged in post- production. To lengthen the sequence, the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories, not 45. Despite the New York City setting, additional skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois provided inspiration for the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. \\"We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood,\\" Gassner continued, \\"a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor.\\" First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950s New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of 1950s New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew members to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. ‚ÄòMarrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, in the case of the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, ‚Äòthat was state- of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers.‚Äô says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional. The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences. To create the two suicide falls, the miniature New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along the heights of the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots would be more effective with a wide-angle lens. \\"The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, we liked the shots more and more.\\" However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one- sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera. The skyscraper models created for The Hudsucker Proxy were re-used for The Shadow, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, and Godzilla.Cinefex Magazine, issues 63 (Sept 1995), 71 (Sept 1997), and 74 (July 1998). =Inspirations= It is thought that the inspiration for the scene in which CEO Waring Hudsucker jumps to his death from the company's building was inspired by the real life suicide of Eli Black, former chairman of United Brands, in 1975. Soundtrack The score to The Hudsucker Proxy was written by Carter Burwell, the fifth of his collaborations with the Coen Brothers. \\"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\\" from the ballet Spartacus by Khachaturian is the basis of the main theme and additional music from the ballet runs under the Hula-Hoop sequence. The popular music of the time is also reflected in the character of Vic Tenetta (played by Peter Gallagher), modeled after Dean Martin, who sings \\"Memories Are Made of This.\\" Additional inspiration comes from Aram Khachaturian's Gayane suite. A section from the ballet is used by Burwell for the scene in which Norville and Amy meet for the first time. The composer's \\"Dance of the Young Mountaineers\\" is used when a young boy is the first to try the hula hoop, followed by \\"Sabre Dance\\" (both from Gayane). Release=Commercial reception= Warner Bros. held test screenings and audience comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held final cut privilege, refused because they were very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick-ups for the ending. Variety claimed that the pick-ups were done to try to save the film because Warner feared it was going to be a box office bomb. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: \\"First of all, they weren't reshoots. They were a little bit of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it. We've done additional shooting on every movie, so it's normal.\\" The film premiered in January 1994 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. In addition, The Hudsucker Proxy was screened at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1994. The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or, but lost to Pulp Fiction. The Hudsucker Proxy was released on March 11, 1994, and only grossed $2,816,518 in the United States. The production budget was officially set at $25 million, although, it was reported to have increased to $40 million for marketing and promotion purposes. The film was a box office bomb. =Critical response= In addition to the film under-performing at the box office, The Hudsucker Proxy opened to mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 59% of reviews from 44 critics were positive, with an average rating of 6.37/10. The consensus states, \\"Intriguingly strange and visually distinctive, The Hudsucker Proxy is ultimately almost ‚Äì but not quite ‚Äì as smart and absorbing as it needs to be.\\" Roger Ebert praised the production design, scale model work, matte paintings, cinematography, and characters. \\"But the problem with the movie is that it's all surface and no substance,\\" Ebert wrote. \\"Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire.\\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being \\"pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s. Missing in this film's performances is a sense of humanity, the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke. Hudsucker isn't the real thing at all. It's just a proxy.\\" Todd McCarthy, writing in Variety, called the film \\"one of the most inspired and technically stunning pastiches of old Hollywood pictures ever to come out of the New Hollywood. But a pastiche it remains, as nearly everything in the Coen brothers' latest and biggest film seems like a wizardly but artificial synthesis, leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be.\\" James Berardinelli gave a largely positive review. \\"The Hudsucker Proxy skewers Big Business on the same shaft that Robert Altman ran Hollywood through with The Player. From the Brazil-like scenes in the cavernous mail room to the convoluted machinations in the board room, this film is pure satire of the nastiest and most enjoyable sort. In this surreal world of 1958 can be found many of the issues confronting large corporations in the 1990s, all twisted to match the filmmakers' vision.\\" Warner Home Video released The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD on May 18, 1999. No featurettes were included. It was one of the first Blu-ray Disc titles released through the Warner Archive Collection on February 26, 2013, but it still lacked any featurettes. Two decades after the film's release, Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com praised the film for its stylistic adventurousness and expansion upon the themes and concepts of the films that inspired it. \\"Whereas the comedies of the 1930s and '40s could talk quickly and move quickly, they couldn't run at a full gallop like the Coen Brothers. Their camera soars, traveling at the speed of progress, gossip, capitalism itself. Everything races at top speed. The production design, the one thing everyone felt comfortable praising, is a marvel. Every frame doubles as a survey of early modern art, from Art Deco to Futurism.\\"The Unloved, Part 3 : \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" Tofoya, Scout. 1 February 2014. = Year-end lists = * 8th ‚Äì Stephen Hunter, The Baltimore Sun * 8th ‚Äì Sandi Davis, The Oklahoman * 9th ‚Äì Sean P.

The term is also used to refer to the equipment used in the post-production process. Telecine enables a motion picture, captured originally on film stock, to be viewed with standard video equipment, such as television sets, video cassette recorders (VCR), DVD, Blu-ray Disc or computers. Initially, this allowed television broadcasters to produce programmes using film, usually 16mm stock, but transmit them in the same format, and quality, as other forms of television production. Furthermore, telecine allows film producers, television producers and film distributors working in the film industry to release their products on video and allows producers to use video production equipment to complete their filmmaking projects. Within the film industry, it is also referred to as a TK, because TC is already used to designate timecode. Motion picture film scanners are similar to telecines. History of telecine With the advent of popular broadcast television, producers realized they needed more than live television programming. By turning to film-originated material, they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times. However, the difference in frame rates between film (generally 24 frames/s) and television (30 or 25 frames/s, interlaced) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering. Originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film, synchronized to the TV scan rate. This could then be re-played directly into a video camera for re-display.Pincus, Edward and Ascher, Steven. (1984). The Filmmaker's Handbook. Plume. p. 368-9 Non-live programming could also be filmed using the same cameras, edited mechanically as normal, and then played back for TV. As the film was run at the same speed as the television, the flickering was eliminated. Various displays, including projectors for these \\"video rate films\\", slide projectors and film cameras were often combined into a \\"film chain\\", allowing the broadcaster to cue up various forms of media and switch between them by moving a mirror or prism. Color was supported by using a multi-tube video camera, prisms, and filters to separate the original color signal and feed the red, green and blue to individual tubes. However, this still left film shot at cinema frame rates as a problem. The obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates, but this, at least in the case of NTSC, is rather obvious to the eye and ear. This problem is not difficult to fix, however; the solution being to periodically play a selected frame twice. For NTSC, the difference in frame rates can be corrected by showing every fourth frame of film twice, although this does require the sound to be handled separately to avoid \\"skipping\\" effects. A more advanced technique is to use \\"2:3 pulldown\\", discussed below, which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video, which results in a slightly smoother display. PAL uses a similar system, \\"2:2 pulldown\\". However, during the analogue broadcasting period, the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slighly faster 25 frames per second rate, to match the PAL video signal. This resulted in a fractionally higher audio soundtrack, and resulted in feature films having a slightly shorter duration, by being shown 1 frame per second faster. In recent decades, telecine has primarily been a film-to- storage process, as opposed to film-to-air. Changes since the 1950s have primarily been in terms of equipment and physical formats; the basic concept remains the same. Home movies originally on film may be transferred to video tape using this technique, and it is not uncommon to find telecined DVDs where the source was originally recorded on videotape, or shot on film and then edited on tape. Movies and TV shows that were originally shot and edited on film, or digitally, are more commonly put on DVD at their native frame rate with flags that tell the DVD player to perform pulldown on-the-fly. Frame rate differences The most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal. Every time the video (tele) part of the telecine samples the light electronically, the film (cine) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph. This is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample, but when this is not true, a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate. To avoid the synchronization issues, higher-end establishments now use a scanning system rather than just a telecine system. This allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film, providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve. Similar issues occur when using vertical synchronization to prevent screen tearing, which is a different problem encountered when frame rates mismatch. =2:2 pulldown = In countries that use the PAL or SECAM video standards, film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second. The PAL video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second, so the transfer from film to video is simple; for every film frame, one video frame is captured. :Image:2-2pulldown.svg Theatrical features originally photographed at 24 frame/s are shown at 25 frame/s. While this is usually not noticed in the picture (but may be more noticeable during action speed, especially if footage was filmed undercranked), the 4% increase in playback speed causes a slightly noticeable increase in audio pitch by about 0.707 semitones, which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter, though pitch shifting is a recent innovation and supersedes an alternative method of telecine for 25 frame/s formats. 2:2 pulldown is also used to transfer shows and films, photographed at 30 frames per second, like Friends and Oklahoma! (1955), to NTSC video, which has ~59.94Hz scanning rate. This requires playback speed to be slowed by a tenth of a percent. Although the 4% speed increase has been standard since the early days of PAL and SECAM television, recently a new technique has gained popularity, and the resulting speed and pitch of the telecined presentation are identical to that of the original film. This pulldown method is sometimes used in order to convert 24 frame/s material to 25 frame/s. Usually, this involves a film to PAL transfer without the aforementioned 4% speedup. For film at 24 frame/s, there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of PAL video. In order to accommodate this mismatch in frame rate, 24 frames of film have to be distributed over 50 PAL fields. This can be accomplished by inserting a pulldown field every 12 frames, thus effectively spreading 12 frames of film over 25 fields (or \\"12.5 frames\\") of PAL video. The method used is 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 (Euro) pulldown (see below). This method was born out of a frustration with the faster, higher pitched soundtracks that traditionally accompanied films transferred for PAL and SECAM audiences. A few motion pictures are beginning to be telecined this way. It is particularly suited for films where the soundtrack is of special importance. When a TV station in an NTSC region airs a film or show that uses a PAL printing/version, but is being broadcast in the NTSC format, sometimes they do not perform the proper PAL to NTSC pulldown conversion or it is done improperly. This causes the program to be sped-up slightly and/or sound higher-pitched, due to the faster rate of the PAL 576 lines/50Hz vs the NTSC 480 lines/~59.94Hz format. Mainframe Entertainment used a novel process for its TV shows. They are rendered at exactly 25.000 frames per second; then, for PAL/SECAM distribution, ordinary 2:2 pulldown is applied, but for NTSC distribution, 199 fields out of every 1001 are repeated. This brings the refresh rate from 25 frames to exactly 60,000/1001, or ~59.94, fields per second, with no change whatsoever in speed, duration, or audio pitch. =2:3 pulldown = In the United States and other countries where television uses the 59.94 Hz vertical scanning frequency, video is broadcast at ~29.97 frame/s. For the film's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal, a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown, also known as 3:2 pulldown, to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s. The term \\"pulldown\\" comes from the mechanical process of \\"pulling\\" (physically moving) the film downward within the film portion of the transport mechanism, to advance it from one frame to the next at a repetitive rate (nominally 24 frames/s). This is accomplished in two steps. The first step is to slow down the film motion by 1/1000 to 24,000/1001 (~23.976) frames/s. The difference in speed is imperceptible to the viewer. For a two-hour film, play time is extended by 7.2 seconds. If the total playback time must be kept exact, a single frame can be dropped every 1000 frames. The second step of the 2:3 pulldown is distributing cinema frames into video fields. At 23.976 frame/s, there are four frames of film for every five frames of 29.97 frame/s video: : \\\\frac{23.976}{29.97} = \\\\frac{4}{5} These four frames are \\"stretched\\" into five by exploiting the interlaced nature of 60 Hz video. For every frame, there are actually two incomplete images or fields, one for the odd-numbered lines of the image, and one for the even-numbered lines. There are, therefore, ten fields for every four film frames, which are called A, B, C, and D. The telecine alternately places A frame across two fields, B frame across three fields, C frame across two fields and D frame across three fields. This can be written as A-A-B-B-B- C-C-D-D-D or 2-3-2-3 or simply 2-3. The cycle repeats itself completely after four film frames have been exposed: :Image:32pulldown.svg A 3:2 pattern is identical to the one shown above except that it is shifted by one frame. For instance, a cycle that starts with film frame B yields a 3:2 pattern: B-B-B-C- C-D-D-D-A-A or 3-2-3-2 or simply 3-2. In other words, there is no difference between the 2-3 and 3-2 patterns. In fact, the \\"3-2\\" notation is misleading because according to SMPTE standards for every four-frame film sequence the first frame is scanned twice, not three times., page 430 The above method is a \\"classic\\" 2:3, which was used before frame buffers allowed for holding more than one frame. The preferred method for doing a 2:3 creates only one dirty frame in every five (i.e. 3:3:2:2 or 2:3:3:2 or 2:2:3:3); while this method has slightly more judder, it allows for easier upconversion (the dirty frame can be dropped without losing information) and a better overall compression when encoding. The 2:3:3:2 pattern is supported by the Panasonic DVX-100B video camera under the name \\"Advanced Pulldown\\". Note that just fields are displayed‚Äîno frames hence no dirty frames‚Äîin interlaced display such as on a CRT. Dirty frames may appear in other methods of displaying the interlaced video. =Other pulldown patterns= Similar techniques must be used for films shot at \\"silent speeds\\" of less than 24 frame/s, which includes home movie formats (the standard for Standard 8 mm film was 16 fps, and 18 fps for Super 8 mm film) as well as silent film (which in 35 mm format usually was 16 fps, 12 fps, or even lower). *16 frame/s (actually 15.985) to NTSC 30 frame/s (actually 29.97): pulldown should be 3:4:4:4 *16 frame/s to PAL 25: pulldown should be 3:3:3:3:3:3:3:4 (a better choice would be to run the film at 16.67 frame/s, simplifying pulldown to 3:3) *18 frame/s (actually 17.982) to NTSC 30: pulldown should be 3:3:4 *20 frame/s (actually 19.980) to NTSC 30: pulldown should be 3:3 *27.5 frame/s to NTSC 30: pulldown should be 3:2:2:2:2 *27.5 frame/s to PAL 25: pulldown should be 1:2:2:2:2 Also, other patterns have been described that refer to the progressive frame rate conversion required to display 24 frame/s video (e.g., from a DVD player) on a progressive display (e.g., LCD or plasma): *24 frame/s to 96 frame/s (4x frame repetition): pulldown is 4:4 *24 frame/s to 120 frame/s (5x frame repetition): pulldown is 5:5 *24 frame/s to 120 frame/s (3:2 pulldown followed by 2x deinterlacing): pulldown is 6:4 = Telecine judder = The \\"2:3 pulldown\\" telecine process creates a slight error in the video signal compared to the original film frames that can be seen in the above image. This is one reason why films viewed on typical NTSC home equipment may not appear as smooth as when viewed in a cinema and PAL home equipments. The phenomenon is particularly apparent during slow, steady camera movements which appear slightly jerky when telecined. This process is commonly referred to as telecine judder. Reversing the 2:3 pulldown telecine is discussed below. PAL material in which 2:3 (Euro) pulldown has been applied suffers from a similar lack of smoothness, though this effect is not usually called \\"telecine judder\\". Effectively, every 12th film frame is displayed for the duration of three PAL fields (60 milliseconds), whereas the other 11 frames are each displayed for the duration of two PAL fields (40 milliseconds). This causes a slight \\"hiccup\\" in the video about twice a second. It is increasingly being referred to as Euro pulldown as it largely affects European territories. =Reverse telecine (a.k.a. inverse telecine (IVTC), reverse pulldown)= Some DVD players, line doublers, and personal video recorders are designed to detect and remove 2:3 pulldown from telecined video sources, thereby reconstructing the original 24 frame/s film frames. Many video editing programsd such as AVIsynth also have this ability. This technique is known as \\"reverse\\" or \\"inverse\\" telecine. Benefits of reverse telecine include high- quality non-interlaced display on compatible display devices and the elimination of redundant data for compression purposes. Reverse telecine is crucial when acquiring film material into a digital non-linear editing system such as Lightworks, Sony Vegas Pro, Avid, or Final Cut Pro, since these machines produce negative cut lists which refer to specific frames in the original film material. When video from a telecine is ingested into these systems, the operator usually has available a \\"telecine trace,\\" in the form of a text file, which gives the correspondence between the video material and film original. Alternatively, the video transfer may include telecine sequence markers \\"burned in\\" to the video image along with other identifying information such as time code. It is also possible, but more difficult, to perform reverse telecine without prior knowledge of where each field of video lies in the 2:3 pulldown pattern. This is the task faced by most consumer equipment such as line doublers and personal video recorders. Ideally, only a single field needs to be identified, the rest following the pattern in lock- step. However, the 2:3 pulldown pattern does not necessarily remain consistent throughout an entire program. Edits performed on film material after it undergoes 2:3 pulldown can introduce \\"jumps\\" in the pattern if care is not taken to preserve the original frame sequence (this often happens during the editing of television shows and commercials in NTSC format). Most reverse telecine algorithms attempt to follow the 2:3 pattern using image analysis techniques, e.g. by searching for repeated fields. Algorithms that perform 2:3 pulldown removal also usually perform the task of deinterlacing. It is possible to algorithmically determine whether video contains a 2:3 pulldown pattern or not, and selectively do either reverse telecine (in the case of film-sourced video) or bob-deinterlacing (in the case of native video sources). Telecine hardware=Flying spot scanner= The parts of a flying spot scanner: (A) Cathode-ray tube (CRT); (B) film plane; (C) & (D) dichroic mirrors; (E), (F) & (G) red-, green- and blue-sensitive photomultipliers In the United Kingdom, Rank Precision Industries was experimenting with the flying-spot scanner (FSS), which inverted the cathode ray tube (CRT) concept of scanning using a television screen. The CRT emits a pixel-sized electron beam which is converted to a photon beam through the phosphors coating the envelope. This dot of light is then focused by a lens onto the film's emulsion, and finally collected by a pickup device. In 1950 the first Rank flying spot monochrome telecine was installed at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios. The advantage of the FSS is that colour analysis is done after scanning, so there can be no registration errors as can be produced by vidicon tubes where scanning is done after colour separation‚Äîit also allows simpler dichroics to be used. In a flying spot scanner (FSS) or cathode-ray tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized light beam is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected by a special type of photo-electric cell known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light \\"scans\\" across the film image from left to right to record the horizontal frame information. Vertical scanning of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in \\"real time\\", 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the \\"Mark\\" series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used. The problem with flying-spot scanners was the difference in frequencies between television field rates and film frame rates. This was solved first by the Mk. I Polygonal Prism system, which was optically synchronised to the television frame rate by the rotating prism and could be run at any frame rate. This was replaced by the Mk. II Twin Lens, and then around 1975, by the Mk. III Hopping Patch (jump scan). The Mk. III series progressed from the original \\"jump scan\\" interlace scan to the Mk. IIIB which used a progressive scan and included a digital scan converter (Digiscan) to output interlaced video. The Mk. IIIC was the most popular of the series and used a next generation Digiscan plus other improvements. The \\"Mark\\" series was then replaced by the Ursa (1989), the first in their line of telecines capable of producing digital data in 4:2:2 color space. The Ursa Gold (1993) stepped this up to 4:4:4 and then the Ursa Diamond (1997), which incorporated many third- party improvements on the Ursa system.Holben, Jay (May 1999). \\"From Film to Tape\\" American Cinematographer Magazine, pp. 108‚Äì122. Cintel's C-Reality and ITK's Millennium flying-spot scanner are able to do both HD and Data. =Line array CCD= The parts of a CCD scanner: (A) Xenon bulb; (B) film plane; (C) & (D) prisms and/or dichroic mirrors; (E), (F) & (G) red-, green- and blue- sensitive CCDs. The Robert Bosch GmbH, Fernseh Div., which later became BTS inc. Philips Digital Video Systems, Thomson's Grass Valley and now is DFT Digital Film Technology introduced the world's first CCD telecine (1979), the FDL-60. The FDL-60 designed and made in Darmstadt West Germany, was the first all solid state telecine. Rank Cintel (ADS telecine 1982) and Marconi Company (1985) both made CCD Telecines for a short time. The Marconi model B3410 telecine sold 84 units over a three-year period, and a former Marconi technician still maintains them. In a charge-coupled device Line Array CCD telecine, a \\"white\\" light is shone through the exposed film image into a prism, which separates out the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into electrical impulses which the telecine electronics modulate into a video signal which can then be recorded onto video tape or broadcast. Shadow telecine system, produced by Grass Valley (formerly Thomson, originated from Philips), installed at DR, Denmark Philips- BTS eventually evolved the FDL 60 into the FDL 90 (1989)/ Quadra (1993). In 1996 Philips, working with Kodak, introduced the Spirit DataCine (SDC 2000), which was capable of scanning the film image at HDTV resolutions and approaching 2K (1920 Luminance and 960 Chrominace RGB) √ó 1556 RGB. With the data option the Spirit DataCine can be used as a motion picture film scanner outputting 2K DPX data files as 2048 √ó 1556 RGB. In 2000 Philips introduced the Shadow Telecine (STE), a low cost version of the Spirit with no Kodak parts. The Spirit DataCine, Cintel's C-Reality and ITK's Millennium opened the door to the technology of digital intermediates, wherein telecine tools were not just used for video outputs, but could now be used for high-resolution data that would later be recorded back out to film. The DFT Digital Film Technology, formerly Grass Valley Spirit 4K/2K/HD (2004) replaced the Spirit 1 Datacine and uses both 2K and 4K line array CCDs. (Note: the SDC-2000 did not use a color prisms and/or dichroic mirrors.) DFT revealed its new scanner at the 2009 NAB Show, Scanity.DFT Scanity The Scanity uses Time Delay Integration (TDI) sensor technology for extremely fast and sensitive film scans. High speed scanning 15 frame/s @ 4K; 25 frame/s @ 2K; 44 frame/s @ 1K. =Pulsed LED/triggered three CCD camera system= With the manufacturing of new high power LEDs, came pulsed LED/triggered three CCD camera systems. Flashing the LED light source for a very short time span gives the full frame CCD camera a stop action of the film, allowing continuous film motion. With CCD video cameras that have a trigger input, the camera now can be electronically synced up to the film transport framing. There are now a number of retail and home made Pulsed LED/triggered camera systems. An array of high- power multiple red, green and blue LEDs is pulsed just as the film frame is positioned in front of the optical lens. The camera sends the single, non- interlaced image of the film frame to a digital frame store, where the electronic picture is clocked out at the selected TV frame rate for PAL or NTSC or other standard. More advanced systems replace the sprocket wheel with laser or camera based perf detection and image stabilization system. = Digital intermediate systems and virtual telecines = Telecine technology is increasingly merging with that of motion picture film scanners; high- resolution telecines, such as those mentioned above, can be regarded as film scanners that operate in real time. As digital intermediate post-production becomes more common, the need to combine the traditional telecine functions of input devices, standards converters, and colour grading systems is becoming less important as the post-production chain changes to tapeless and filmless operation. However, the parts of the workflow associated with telecines still remain, and are being pushed to the end, rather than the beginning, of the post-production chain, in the form of real-time digital grading systems and digital intermediate mastering systems, increasingly running in software on commodity computer systems. These are sometimes called virtual telecine systems. =Video cameras that produce telecined video, and \\"film look\\"= Some video cameras and consumer camcorders are able to record in progressive \\"24 frames/s\\" or \\"23.976 frames/s\\" . Such a video has cinema-like motion characteristics and is the major component of so-called \\"film look\\" or \\"movie look\\". For most \\"24 frames/s\\" cameras, the virtual 2:3 pulldown process is happening inside the camera. Although the camera is capturing a progressive frame at the CCD, just like a film camera, it is then imposing an interlacing on the image to record it to tape so that it can be played back on any standard television. Not every camera handles \\"24 frames/s\\" this way, but the majority of them do. Cameras that record 25 frames/s (PAL) or 29.97 frames/s (NTSC) do not need to employ 2:3 pulldown, because every progressive frame occupies exactly two video fields. In the video industry, this type of encoding is called Progressive Segmented Frame (PsF). PsF is conceptually identical to 2:2 pulldown, only there is no film original to transfer from. Digital television and high definition Digital television and high definition standards provide several methods for encoding film material. Fifty field/s formats such as 576i50 and 1080i50 can accommodate film content using a 4% speed-up like PAL. 59.94 field/s interlaced formats such as 480i60 and 1080i60 use the same 2:3 pulldown technique as NTSC. In 59.94 frame/s progressive formats such as 480p60 and 720p60, entire frames (rather than fields) are repeated in a 2:3 pattern, accomplishing the frame rate conversion without interlacing and its associated artifacts. Other formats such as 1080p24 can decode film material at its native rate of 24 or 23.976 frame/s. All of these coding methods are in use to some extent. In PAL countries, 25 frame/s formats remain the norm. In NTSC countries, most digital broadcasts of 24 frame/s progressive material, both standard and high definition, continue to use interlaced formats with 2:3 pulldown, even though ATSC allows native 24 and 23.976 frame/s progressive formats which offer the greatest image quality and coding efficiency, and are widely used in motion picture and high definition video production. Nowadays, most HDTV vendors sell LCD televisions in NTSC/ATSC countries capable of 120 Hz or 240 Hz refresh rates and plasma sets capable of 48, 72, or 96 Hz refresh. When combined with a 1080p24-capable source (such as most Blu-ray Disc players), some of these sets are able to display film-based content using a pulldown scheme of whole multiples of 24, thereby avoiding the problems associated with 2:3 pulldown or the 4% speed-up used in PAL countries. For example, a 1080p 120 Hz set which accepts a 1080p24 input can achieve 5:5 pulldown by simply repeating each frame five times and thus not exhibit picture artifacts associated with telecine judder. Gate weave Gate weave, known in this context as \\"telecine weave\\" or \\"telecine wobble\\", caused by the movement of the film in the telecine machine gate, is a characteristic artifact of real-time telecine scanning. Numerous techniques have been tried to minimize gate weave, using both improvements in mechanical film handling and electronic post-processing. Line-scan telecines are less vulnerable to frame-to-frame judder than machines with conventional film gates, and non-real-time machines are also less vulnerable to gate weave than real-time machines. Some gate weave is inherent in film cinematography, as it introduced by the film handling within the original film camera: modern digital image stabilization techniques can remove both this and telecine/scanner gate weave. Soft and hard telecine On DVDs, telecined material may be either hard telecined, or soft telecined. In the hard- telecined case, video is stored on the DVD at the playback framerate (29.97 frame/s for NTSC, 25 frame/s for PAL), using the telecined frames as shown above. In the soft-telecined case, the material is stored on the DVD at the film rate (24 or 23.976 frames/s) in the original progressive format, with special flags inserted into the MPEG-2 video stream that instruct the DVD player to repeat certain fields so as to accomplish the required pulldown during playback. Progressive scan DVD players additionally offer output at 480p by using these flags to duplicate frames rather than fields, or if the TV supports it, to play the disc back at the native 24p rate. NTSC DVDs are often soft telecined, although lower-quality hard-telecined DVDs exist. In the case of PAL DVDs using 2:2 pulldown, the difference between soft and hard telecine vanishes, and the two may be regarded as equal. In the case of PAL DVDs using 2:3 pulldown, either soft or hard telecining may be applied. Blu-ray offers native 24 frame/s support, allowing 5:5 cadence on most modern televisions.

Culture: An A-To-Z Guide to the '90s-Underground, Online, and Over-The-Counter, p. 73, HarperCollins Publishers 1995, Pete Prown / Harvey P. Newquist: \\"One faction came to be known as dream-pop or \\"shoegazers\\" (for their habit of looking at the ground while playing the guitars on stage). They were musicians who played trancelike, ethereal music that was composed of numerous guitars playing heavy droning chords wrapped in echo effects and phase shifters.\\", Hal Leonard 1997, is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. It is characterized by its ethereal-sounding mixture of obscured vocals, guitar distortion and effects, feedback, and overwhelming volume. The term shoegazing was coined by the British music press to describe the stage presence of a wave of neo-psychedelic groups who stood still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state with their heads down. This was because the heavy use of effects pedals meant the performers were often looking down at the readouts on their pedals during concerts. Most shoegazing artists drew from the glide guitar template set by My Bloody Valentine on their early EPs and album Isn't Anything from the late 1980s. A loose label given to the shoegazing bands and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was The Scene That Celebrates Itself. In the early 1990s, shoegazing groups were pushed aside by the American grunge movement and early Britpop acts such as Suede, forcing the relatively unknown bands to break up or reinvent their style altogether. In the 2000s, there was renewed interest in the genre among \\"Nu gaze\\" bands. The shoegaze genre has often been used interchangeably with dream pop, but shoegazing typically uses a harsher, louder and more distorted sound. A lot of dream pop artists have taken influence from shoegazing artists, and vice versa, over the years. Characteristics Shoegazing combines ethereal, swirling vocals with layers of distorted, bent, flanged guitars,Patrick Sisson, \\"Vapour Trails: Revisiting Shoegaze \\", XLR8R no. 123, December 2008 creating a wash of sound where no instrument is distinguishable from another. According to Allmusic, most bands drew from the music of My Bloody Valentine as a template for the genre. The band's co-founder Kevin Shields stated that the band's choice of pedals never included chorus, flanger or delay effects.Tom Murphy: Interview with My Bloody Valentine , Denver Westword Music, April 23, 2009 His most notable effect was reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the vibrato manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as \\"glide guitar\\". Shields used at least 30 effects pedals, most of which were distortion, graphic equalizers, and tone controls. Etymology The term originated in a concert review in Sounds for the newly formed band Moose in which singer Russell Yates read lyrics taped to the floor throughout the gig. The term was picked up by NME, who used it as a reference to the tendency of the bands' guitarists to stare at their feet‚Äîor their effects pedals‚Äîwhile playing, seemingly deep in concentration. Melody Maker preferred calling it \\"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\\", referring to the habit that the bands had of attending gigs of other shoegazing bands, often in Camden, and often playing in each other's bands. According to AllMusic: \\"The shatteringly loud, droning neo-psychedelia the band performed was dubbed shoegaze by the British press because the band members stared at the stage while they performed\\". According to some, the term was used to describe dream pop bands. Slowdive's Simon Scott found the term relevant: The term was also considered pejorative, especially by a part of the English weekly music press who considered the movement as ineffectual, and it was disliked by many of the groups it purported to describe. Lush's singer Miki Berenyi explained: \\"Shoegazing was originally a slag-off term. My partner [K.J. \\"Moose\\" McKillop], who was the guitarist in Moose, claims that it was originally leveled at his band. Apparently the journo was referring to the bank of effects pedals he had strewn across the stage that he had to keep staring at in order to operate. And then it just became a generic term for all those bands that had a big, sweeping, effects-laden sound, but all stood resolutely still on stage\\". Ride's singer Mark Gardener had another take on his group's static presentation: \\"We didn't want to use the stage as a platform for ego ... We presented ourselves as normal people, as a band who wanted their fans to think they could do that too.\\" History=Origins and precursors= My Bloody Valentine performing live in 2008 The most commonly cited precursors to shoegaze are Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine, although My Bloody Valentine's Loveless is often referred to as the greatest album the genre has produced. Each band's music bridged the styles of garage rock, 1960s psychedelia and American indie bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth. Other artists that have been identified as direct influences on shoegaze include The Velvet Underground, H√ºsker D√º, and The Cure.Exclaim! Sound of Confusion article on Shoegaze . Retrieved 22 September 2008. Siouxsie and the Banshees was also a major influence initially on Cocteau Twins. Slowdive named themselves after a Siouxsie and the Banshees song of the same name and took inspiration from the group at their beginnings. Lush, a shoegaze contemporary, were originally called \\"The Baby Machines\\", a line from a Siouxsie lyric. Other bands who have been cited as exploring proto-shoegaze sounds and textures include Spacemen 3 and The House of Love. My Bloody Valentine emerged in the wake of their 1988 breakthrough (with the \\"You Made Me Realise\\" EP and album Isn't Anything). The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock mentions that \\"A.R. Kane, the London duo ... (who dubbed their music 'dreampop') exerted a profound sonic influence on the legion of trippy shoegazer guitar bands that would emerge a few years later in the UK\\".Simon & Schuster: The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, p.49, Fireside, March 1997, Michael Azerrad's book Our Band Could Be Your Life cited an early 1990s Dinosaur Jr. tour of the United Kingdom as a key influence.Azerrad, Michael (2001). Our Band Could Be Your Life. Back Bay. pp. 366. . Whereas contemporary alternative rock movements of the time period were extremely male-dominated (Britpop, grunge), My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Lush, Cocteau Twins, and many other popular shoegaze acts had at least one prominent female musician who contributed key vocal elements and/or integral writing components to the music. Kevin Shields noted that there were as many women as men in the shoegaze community.Beautiful Noise =The Scene That Celebrates Itself= The Scene That Celebrates Itself was the social and musical scene in the early 1990s within London and the Thames Valley area. The term was coined by Melody Maker's Steve Sutherland in 1990 in a near-contemptuous gesture, focusing on how bands involved in the scene, rather than engaging in traditional rivalries, were often seen at each other's gigs, sometimes playing in each other's bands, and drinking together. Bands lumped into the 'scene' by the press included several of the bands that were branded with the shoegazing label, such as Chapterhouse, Lush, Moose and other (mainly indie) bands such as Blur (prior to the release of their single \\"Popscene\\"), Thousand Yard Stare, See See Rider and Stereolab.Review of Slowdive's Souvlaki by Jason Parkes A prime example were Moose, who often swapped members with other bands on a given night. Moose's Russell Yates and Stereolab guitarist Tim Gane would often trade places, while \\"Moose\\" McKillop often played with See See Rider. Gane and his Stereolab colleague L√¶titia Sadier even played on the 1991 session by Moose for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.\\"Peel Sessions: 16 April 1991 - Moose\\", Keeping It Peel, BBC The bands, producers and journalists of the time would gather in London and their activities would be chronicled in the gossip pages of the music papers NME and Melody Maker. The most famous club and focal point was Syndrome, which was located on Oxford Street and ran weekly on Thursday nights. The NME, in particular, embraced the scene, and the unity of the bands was probably advantageous to their careers, because when one band had a successful record, the other bands could share the publicity. The scene was extremely small and revolved around fewer than 20 individuals. The first stirrings of recognition came when indie writer Steve Lamacq referred to Ride in an NME review as \\"The House of Love with chainsaws\\". The shoegaze genre label was quite often misapplied. As key bands such as Slowdive, Chapterhouse and Ride emerged from the Thames Valley, Swervedriver found themselves labelled shoegazers on account of their own Thames Valley origins, despite their more pronounced H√ºsker D√º-meets-Stooges stylings.Lester, Paul (1992-09-12). \\"Whatever Happened to Shoegaze?\\" Melody Maker, p.6. Retrieved 12 April 2007 from Proquest Research Library. =Decline= The coining of the term \\"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\\" was in many ways the beginning of the end for the first wave of shoegazers. The bands became perceived by critics as over-privileged, self-indulgent, and middle-class. This perception was in sharp contrast with both the bands who formed the wave of newly commercialized grunge music which was making its way across the Atlantic, as well as those bands who formed the foundation of Britpop, such as Pulp, Oasis, Blur and Suede. Britpop also offered intelligible lyrics, often about the trials and tribulations of working-class life; this was a stark contrast to the \\"vocals as an instrument\\" approach of the shoegazers, which often prized the melodic contribution of vocals over their lyrical depth. Lush's final album was an abrupt shift from shoegazing to Britpop, which alienated many fans; the 1996 suicide of their drummer signaled Lush's dissolution. Following a long gap from My Bloody Valentine since Loveless, aside from their 2008 reunion tour, the band released m b v in February 2013. Shields explained their silence by noting, \\"I never could be bothered to make another record unless I was really excited by it.\\" =Post- movement directions= Slowdive eventually morphed into the country-infused Mojave 3 and the dream pop Monster Movie, while other shoegaze bands either split or moved in other directions. The use of electronic dance and ambient elements by bands such as Slowdive and Seefeel paved the way for later developments in post-rock and electronica. Several former members of shoegaze bands later moved towards post-rock and the more electronica-based trip hop. Adam Franklin of Swervedriver released lo-fi albums under the moniker Toshack Highway.Stevens, Andrew (2007-07-11). \\"Leave Them All Behind: The 3:AM Guide to ‚ÄòShoegaze‚Äô and British Indie Music in the 1990s\\" 3:AM Magazine. Retrieved 17 March 2013. While shoegaze briefly flared and then faded out in the UK, the bands of the initial wave had an immense impact on the development of regional underground and college rock scenes in the US. In particular, a Lush and Ride tour of the US in 1991 directly inspired the spawning of American shoegaze groups including Half String and Ozean.. Columnist Emma Sailor of KRUI in Iowa City opines: About DC-based Velocity Girl's 1991 single \\"My Forgotten Favorite,\\" Sailor goes on to note, \\"Could anything be more different ‚Äî and yet so similar ‚Äî to [Slowdive]? The hazy [production] and dreamy, high pitched female vocals are there, but the outlook is entirely different.\\" Other notable American shoegaze influenced bands of the early- to mid-1990s included Lilys, The Swirlies, The Veldt, and Medicine. A resurgence of the genre began in the late 1990s (particularly in the United States) and the early 2000s, that helped usher in what is now referred to as the \\"nu gaze\\" era. Also various heavy metal acts were inspired by shoegaze, which contributed to the emergence of \\"post-metal\\" and \\"metalgaze\\" styles. Particularly in the mid-2000s, French black metal acts Alcest and Amesoeurs began incorporating shoegaze elements into their sound, pioneering the blackgaze genre.

Most self-identified persuasive technology research focuses on interactive, computational technologies, including desktop computers, Internet services, video games, and mobile devices,Oinas-Kukkonen et al. 2008 but this incorporates and builds on the results, theories, and methods of experimental psychology, rhetoric,Bogost 2007 and human-computer interaction. The design of persuasive technologies can be seen as a particular case of design with intent.Lockton et al. 2010 Taxonomies'=Functional Triad= Persuasive technologies can be categorized by their functional roles. B. J. Fogg proposes the Functional Triad as a classification of three \\"basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies\\": persuasive technologies can function as tools, media, or social actors ‚Äì or as more than one at once.Fogg 1998 * As tools, technologies can increase people's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it.Fogg 2002, ch. 3 For example, an installation wizard can influence task completion ‚Äì including completing tasks not planned by users (such as installation of additional software). * As media, interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior, empathizing, or exploring causal relationships.Fogg 2002, ch. 4 For example, simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade; these use procedural rhetoric. * Technologies can also function as social actors.Reeves & Nass 1996, Turkle 1984 This \\"opens the door for computers to apply ... social influence\\".Fogg 2002, p. 90 Interactive technologies can cue social responses, e.g., through their use of language, assumption of established social roles, or physical presence. For example, computers can use embodied conversational agents as part of their interface. Or a helpful or disclosive computer can cause users to mindlessly reciprocate.Fogg 1997b, Moon 2000 Fogg notes that \\"users seem to respond to computers as social actors when computer technologies adopt animate characteristics (physical features, emotions, voice communication), play animate roles (coach, pet, assistant, opponent), or follow social rules or dynamics (greetings, apologies, turn taking).\\" =Direct interaction v. mediation= Persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role:Oinas-Kukkonen & Harjumaa 2008 do they persuade, for example, through human-computer interaction (HCI) or computer-mediated communication (CMC)? The examples already mentioned are the former, but there are many of the latter. Communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction,Licklider 1968Bailenson et al. 2004 providing shared feedback on interaction,DiMicco 2004 or restructuring communication processes.Winograd 1986 =Persuasion design= Persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content, using established psychological research theories and methods. Andrew ChakChak 2003 argues that the most persuasive web sites focus on making users feel comfortable about making decisions and helping them act on those decisions. =Persuasion by social motivators= Previous research has also utilized on social motivators like competition for persuasion. By connecting a user with other users, his/her coworkers, friends and families, a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes. Social media such as Facebook, Twitter also facilitate the development of such systems. It has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated.  Persuasive strategies  Halko and Kientz made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviours. Their search concluded that there are 8 main types of persuasive strategies, which can be grouped into the following four categories, where each category has two complementary approaches: = 1 ‚Äì Instruction style = Authoritative: Persuade the technology user through an authoritative agent. For example, a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal. Non-Authoritative: Persuade the user through a neutral agent, For example, a friend who encourages the user to meet their goals. = 2 ‚Äì Social feedback = Cooperative: Persuade the user through the notion of cooperating and teamwork. For example, allowing the user to team up with friends to complete their goals. Competitive: Persuade the user through the notion of competing. For example, users can play against friends or peers and be motivated to achieve their goal by winning the competition. = 3 ‚Äì Motivation type = Extrinsic: Persuade the user through external motivators. For example, winning trophies, as a reward for completing a task. Intrinsic: Persuade the user through internal motivators. For example, The good feeling a user would have for being healthy, or for achieving the goal. = 4 ‚Äì Reinforcement type = Negative Reinforcement: Persuade the user by removing an aversive stimulus. For example, turning a brown and dying nature scene green and healthy as the user conducts more healthy behaviors. Positive Reinforcement: Persuade the user by adding a positive stimulus. For example, adding flowers, butterflies, and other nice-looking elements to any empty nature scene, as the user conducts more healthy behaviors. More recently, Lieto and Vernero have also shown that arguments reducible to logical fallacies are a class of widely adopted persuasive techniques in both web and mobile technologies. These techniques have shown their efficacy also on large scale studies about persuasive news recommendations .  Reciprocal equality  One feature that distinguishes persuasion technology from familiar forms of persuasion is that the individual being persuaded often cannot respond in kind. This is a lack of reciprocal equality. For example, when a conversational agent persuades a user using social influence strategies, the user cannot also use similar strategies on the agent.Fogg, 2002  Health behavior change  While persuasive technologies are found in many domains, considerable recent attention has focused on behavior change in health domains. Digital health coaching is the utilization of computers as persuasive technology to augment the personal care delivered to patients, and is used in numerous medical settings.Elton 2007 Numerous scientific studies show that online health behaviour change interventions can influence users' behaviours. Moreover, the most effective interventions are modelled on health coaching, where users are asked to set goals, educated about the consequences of their behaviour, then encouraged to track their progress toward their goals. Sophisticated systems even adapt to users who relapse by helping them get back on the bandwagon.Cugelman et al. 2011 Maintaining behavior change long term is one of the challenges of behavior change interventions. For instance, as reported, for chronic illness treatment regimens non-adherence rate can be as high as 50% to 80%. Common strategies that have been shown by previous research to increase long-term adherence to treatment include extended care, skills training, social support, treatment tailoring, self-monitoring, and multicomponent stages. However, even though these strategies have been demonstrated to be effective, there are also existing barriers to implementation of such programs: limited time, resources, as well as patient factors such as embarrassment of disclosing their health habits. To make behavior change strategies more effective, researchers also have been adapting well-known and empirically-tested behavior change theories into such practice. The most prominent behavior change theories that have been implemented in various health-related behavior change research has been self-determination theory, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, transtheoretical model, and social ecological model. Each behavior change theory analyses behavior change in different ways and consider different factors to be more or less important. Research has suggested that interventions based on behavior change theories tend to yield better result than interventions that do not employ such theories. The effectiveness of them vary: social cognitive theory proposed by Bandura, which incorporates the well-known construct of self- efficacy, has been the most widely used method in behavior change interventions as well as the most effective in maintaining long-term behavior change. Even though the healthcare discipline has produced a plethora of empirical behavior change research, other scientific disciplines are also adapting such theories to induce behavior change. For instance, behavior change theories have also been used in sustainability, such as saving electricity, and lifestyle, such as helping people drinking more water. These research has shown that these theories, already effectively proven useful in healthcare, is equally powerful in other fields to promote behavior change. Interestingly, there have been some studies that showed unique insights and that behavior change is a complex chain of events: a study by Chudzynski et al. showed that reinforcement schedule has little effect on maintaining behavior change. A point made in a study by Wemyss et al. is that even though people who have maintained behavior change for short term might revert to baseline, their perception of their behavior change could be different: they still believe they maintained the behavior change even if they factually have not. Therefore, it is possible self-report measures would not always be the most effective way of evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention.  Promote sustainable lifestyles  Previous work has also shown that people are receptive to change their behaviors for sustainable lifestyles. This result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example, green travels, less waste, etc. One common technique is to facilitate people's awareness of benefits for performing eco-friendly behaviors. For example, a review of over twenty studies exploring the effects of feedback on electricity consumption in the home showed that the feedback on the electricity consumption pattern can typically result in a 5‚Äì12% saving. Besides the environmental benefits such as CO2 savings, health benefit, cost are also often used to promote eco-friendly behaviors.  Research challenges  Despite the promising results of existing persuasive technologies, there are three main challenges that remain present. = Technical challenges = Persuasive technologies developed relies on self-report or automated systems that monitor human behavior using sensors and pattern recognition algorithms. Several studies in the medical field have noted that self-report is subject to bias, recall errors and low adherence rates. The physical world and human behavior are both highly complex and ambiguous. Utilizing sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict human behavior remains a challenging problem, especially that most of the persuasive technologies require just-in-time intervention. = Difficulty in studying behavior change = In general, understanding behavioral changes require long-term studies. As multiple internal and external factors can influence these changes, such as personality type, age, income, willingness to change and more. For that, it becomes difficult to understand and measure the effect of persuasive technologies. = Ethical challenges = The question of manipulating feelings and desires through persuasive technology remains an open ethical debate. User-centered design guidelines should be developed encouraging ethically and morally responsible designs, and provide a reasonable balance between the pros and cons of persuasive technologies. In addition to encouraging ethically and morally responsible designs, Fogg believes education, such as through the journal articles he writes, is a panacea for concerns about the ethical challenges of persuasive computers. Fogg notes two fundamental distinctions regarding the importance of education in engaging with ethics and technology: \\"First, increased knowledge about persuasive computers allows people more opportunity to adopt such technologies to enhance their own lives, if they choose. Second, knowledge about persuasive computers helps people recognize when technologies are using tactics to persuade them.\\" Another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires, where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce.

He is best known as the founder of the newspaper Aftonbladet in 1830. Hierta was a leading agitator for political and social reform in Sweden during the 19th century. He is sometimes credited as the \\"father of the free press\\" in Sweden. Biography Statue of Lars Johan Hierta at Riddarhustorget in Gamla stan, Stockholm Wilhelmina Fr√∂ding Hierta (1805‚Äì1878) Hierta was born to a noble family in Uppsala, Sweden, as the son of Carl Didrik Hierta and Hedvig Johanna Schm√©er. He received his primary education at a private school and began his studies at Uppsala University in 1814, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy and a Candidate of Law in 1821. In the same year he was employed as an unpaid trainee at the central government agency Bergskollegium, where he was promoted as a law clerk in 1825. In the mid-1820s, Hierta met Wilhelmina Fr√∂ding, his future wife. Although her family rejected his initial marriage proposal, they married in 1833 and together had five daughters. At the Riksdag of the Estates of 1823, Hierta served as a secretary at the Swedish House of Lords. At the following Estates Assembly, from 1828 to 1830, he was a representative of the nobility and also served as a law clerk. In the Riksdag, Hierta aligned himself with the liberal opposition critical of the conservative rule of King Charles XIV John. Hierta started writing for Conservationsbladet in 1823. He also wrote for the papers Argus from 1824 to 1826 and, sporadically, Stockholmsposten from 1826 to 1828. He started writing as a humourist, later as a news writer and political editorialist. In 1829, Hierta started the book publishing house Hiertas bokf√∂rlag (\\"Hierta's Publishing House\\"). In 1830, Hierta founded the Aftonbladet newspaper, where he advocated for a republic (though without using the word \\"republic\\"), which is sometimes seen as the start of the Swedish republican movement. In 1839 Lars Johan Hierta founded a candle factory still active today by the name of Liljeholmens Stearinfabriks AB. Soon after 1840, Aftonbladet hired Swedish writer and feminist Wendela Hebbe (1808‚Äì1899), who became the first permanently-employed woman journalist at a Swedish newspaper. Hierta and Hebbe later had a son together. Both Hierta and Hebbe were socially active for liberal causes. At the time of his death, Hierta was one of the wealthiest persons in Sweden. After his death, his widow Wilhelmina Fr√∂ding Hierta donated 100,000 SEK to Stockholm University for the establishment of a professorship in economics, and later 400,000 SEK to the foundation Lars Hiertas minne (\\"Lars Hierta's Memory\\") whose mission was to \\"work freely and independently for human progress\\" (fritt och oberoende verka f√∂r det m√§nskliga fram√•tskridandet).

It originated in the mid 1960s as young music fans began to rebel against the emerging pretensions of rock music, and developed mainly among American musicians who came of age during the British Invasion. The genre typically incorporates melodic hooks, vocal harmonies, an energetic performance, and \\"happy\\"-sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning, longing, or despair. The term \\"power pop\\" was coined by the Who's Pete Townshend in 1967 to describe their style of music. However, the term became more widely identified with subsequent artists from the 1970s who sought to revive Beatles-style pop. The sound of the genre became more established thanks to early 1970s hits by Badfinger, the Raspberries, and Todd Rundgren. Subsequent artists occasionally drew from developments such as new wave, punk, glam rock, pub rock, college rock, and neo-psychedelia. Power pop reached its commercial peak during the rise of punk and new wave in the late 1970s, with Cheap Trick, the Knack, the Romantics, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds, and Dwight Twilley. During this time, music critics who wrote about the phenomenon popularized the term's usage. After a popular and critical backlash to the genre's biggest-ever hit, \\"My Sharona\\" (The Knack, 1979), record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups, and most of the 1970s bands broke up in the early 1980s. Over the proceeding decades, power pop continued with modest commercial success while largely remaining an object of critical derision. The 1990s saw a new wave of alternative bands that were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. Although not as successful as their predecessors, Jellyfish, the Posies, Redd Kross, Teenage Fanclub, and Material Issue were critical and cult favorites. In the mid-1990s, an offshoot genre that combined power pop harmonies with uptempo punk, dubbed \\"punk-pop\\", reached mainstream popularity. Definition and etymology=Characteristics= Power pop is a more aggressive form of pop rock that is based on catchy, melodic hooks and energetic moods. AllMusic describes the style as \\"a cross between the crunching hard rock of the Who and the sweet melodicism of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, with the ringing guitars of the Byrds thrown in for good measure\\". Virtually every artist of the genre has been a rock band consisting of white male musicians who engaged with the song forms, vocal arrangements, chord progressions, rhythm patterns, instrumentation, or overall sound associated with groups of the mid 1960s British Invasion era. An essential feature of power pop is that its \\"happy\\"-sounding arrangements are supported by a sense of \\"yearning\\", \\"longing\\", or \\"despair\\" similar to formative works such as \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" (The Beach Boys, 1966) and \\"Pictures of Lily\\" (The Who, 1967). This might be achieved with an unexpected harmonic change or lyrics that refer to \\"tonight\\", \\"tomorrow night\\", \\"Saturday night\\", and so on. Power pop was also noted for its lack of irony and its reverence to classic pop craft. Its reconfiguration of 1960s tropes, music journalist Paul Lester argued, could make it one of the first postmodern music genres. =Scope and recognition= The Who's Pete Townshend coined \\"power pop\\" in a May 1967 interview promoting their latest single \\"Pictures of Lily\\". He said: \\"Power pop is what we play‚Äîwhat the Small Faces used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of 'Fun, Fun, Fun' which I preferred.\\" Despite other bands following in the power pop continuum since then, the term was not popularized until the rise of new wave music in the late 1970s. Greg Shaw, editor of Bomp! magazine, was the most prominent in the slew of music critics that wrote about power pop (then written as \\"powerpop\\"). This mirrored similar developments with the term \\"punk rock\\" from earlier in the decade. In light of this, Theo Cateforis, author of Are We Not New Wave? (2011), wrote that \\"the recognition and formulation\\" of power pop as a genre \\"was by no means organic.\\" There is significant debate among fans over what should be classed as power pop. Shaw took credit for codifying the genre in 1978, describing it as a hybrid style of pop and punk. He later wrote that \\"much to my chagrin, the term was snapped up by legions of limp, second-rate bands hoping the majors would see them as a safe alternative to punk.\\" Music journalist John M. Borack also stated in his 2007 book Shake Some Action ‚Äì The Ultimate Guide to Power Pop that the label is often applied to varied groups and artists with \\"blissful indifference,\\" noting its use in connection with Britney Spears, Green Day, the Bay City Rollers and Def Leppard. Power pop has struggled with its critical reception and is sometimes viewed as a shallow style of music associated with teenage audiences. The perception was exacerbated by record labels in the early 1980s who used the term for marketing post-punk styles. Music critic Ken Sharp summarized that power pop is \\"the Rodney Dangerfield of rock 'n' roll. ... the direct updating of the most revered artists‚Äîthe Who, the Beach Boys, the Beatles‚Äîyet it gets no respect.\\" In 1996, singer-songwriter Tommy Keene commented that any association to the term since the 1980s is to be \\"compared to a lot of bands that didn't sell records, it's like a disease. If you're labeled that, you're history.\\" Musician Steve Albini said: \\"I cannot bring myself to use the term 'power pop.' Catchy, mock-descriptive terms are for dilettantes and journalists. I guess you could say I think this music is for pussies and should be stopped.\\" Ken Stringfellow of the Posies concurred that \\"There‚Äôs a kind of aesthetic to power pop to be light on purpose. I wanted something with more gravitas.\\"  Original waves = 1960s: Origins and precursors = Power pop originated in the late 1960s as young music fans began to rebel against the emerging pretensions of rock music. During this period, a schism developed between \\"serious\\" artists who rejected pop and \\"crassly commercial\\" pop acts who embraced their teenybopper audience. Greg Shaw credited the Who as the starting point for power pop, whereas Carl Caferelli (writing in Borack's book) said that \\"the story really begins circa 1964, with the commercial ascension of the Beatles in America.\\" Caferelli also recognized the Beatles as the embodiment of the \\"pop band\\" ideal. According to The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, British Invasion bands, particularly the Merseybeat sound first popularised by the Beatles and its \\"jangly guitars, pleasant melodies, immaculate vocal harmonies, and a general air of teenage innocence\\", were a key influence on 1970s power-pop bands such as the Raspberries, Big Star, the Knack and XTC. When Pete Townshend coined the term, he suggested that songs like \\"I Can't Explain\\" (1965) and \\"Substitute\\" (1966) were more accessible than the changing, more experimental directions other groups such as the Beatles were taking. However, the term did not become widely identified with the Who, and it would take a few years before the genre's stylistic elements coalesced into a more recognizable form. The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray said that \\"once the sound became more viable and widely imitated, it was easier to trace the roots of the genre back to rockabilly, doo-wop, girl groups, and the early records of the Beatles, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, and the Who.\\" Robert Hilburn traced the genre \\"chiefly from the way the Beatles and the Beach Boys mixed rock character and pure Top 40 instincts in such records as the latter's 'California Girls'.\\" Borack noted, \\"It's also quite easy to draw a not-so- crooked line from garage rock to power pop.\\" One of the earliest examples of the type of nostalgia that became central to power pop was the Beach Boys' 1968 single \\"Do It Again\\", a throwback to the band's early hits. Townshend himself was heavily influenced by the guitar work of Beach Boy Carl Wilson, while the Who's debut single \\"I Can't Explain\\" was indebted to the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\" (1964). Roy Shuker identified the leading American power pop acts of the time as the Byrds, Tommy James and the Shondells, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Also significant to power pop in the 1960s was the Dave Clark Five, the Creation, the Easybeats, the Move, and the Nazz. =1970s: Emergence= Todd Rundgren's work with Nazz in the 1960s and as a solo artist in the 1970s was significant to the development of the genre. In the 1970s, the rock scene fragmented into many new styles. Artists drifted away from the influence of early Beatles songs, and anyone who cited the Beatles or the Who as influences were a minority. In Paul Lester's description, \\"powerpop is really a 70s invention. It's about young musicians missing the 60s but taking its sound in new directions. ... not just an alternative to prog and the hippy troubadours, but a cousin to glam.\\" Novelist Michael Chabon believed that the genre did not truly come into its own until the emergence of \\"second generation\\" power pop acts in the early 1970s. Lester added that it was \\"essentially an American response to the British Invasion, made by Anglophiles a couple of years too young to have been in bands the first time round.\\" For many fans of power pop, according to Caferelli, the \\"bloated and sterile\\" aspect of 1970s rock was indicative of the void left by the Beatles' breakup in 1970. During the early to middle part of the decade, only a few acts continued the tradition of Beatles-style pop. Some were younger glam/glitter bands, while others were \\"'60s holdovers\\" that refused to update their sound. One of the most prominent groups in the latter category was Badfinger, the first artists signed to the Beatles' Apple Records. Although they had international top 10 chart success with \\"Come and Get It\\" (1969), \\"No Matter What\\" (1970), and \\"Day After Day\\" (1971), they were criticized in the music press as Beatles imitators. Caferelli describes them as \\"one of the earliest-- and finest purveyors\\" of power pop. Conversely, AllMusic states that while Badfinger were among the groups that established the genre's sound, the Raspberries were the only power pop band of the era to have hit singles. Noel Murray wrote that Badfinger had \\"some key songs\\" that were power pop \\"before the genre really existed\\". 1972, according to Magnets Andrew Earles, was \\"year zero\\" for power pop: Big Star and the Raspberries emerged, Todd Rundgren released Something/Anything?, the Flamin' Groovies recorded \\"Shake Some Action\\", and many garage bands stopped emulating the Rolling Stones. Chabon additionally credited the Raspberries, Badfinger, Big Star, and Rundgren's \\"Couldn't I Just Tell You\\" and \\"I Saw the Light\\" with \\"inventing\\" the genre. On a television performance from that year, Rundgren introduced \\"Couldn't I Just Tell You\\" as a part of \\"the latest musical trend, power pop.\\" Lester called the studio recording of the song a \\"masterclass in compression\\" and said that Rundgren \\"staked his claim to powerpop immortality [and] set the whole ball rolling\\". Raspberries were the only American band that had hit singles. Murray recognized the Raspberries as the most representative power pop band and described their 1972 US top 10 \\"Go All the Way\\" as \\"practically a template for everything the genre could be, from the heavy arena-rock hook to the cooing, teenybopper-friendly verses and chorus.\\" Caferelli described the follow-up \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" (1972) as \\"perhaps the definitive power pop single\\". However, like Badfinger, the Raspberries were derided as \\"Beatles clones\\". Singer Eric Carmen remembered that there \\"were a lot of people in 1972 who were not ready for any band that even remotely resembled the Beatles.\\" Raspberries dissolved in 1977 as Carmen pursued a solo career. =1970s‚Äì1980s: Commercial peak and decline= Cheap Trick playing in 1978 A recognizable movement of power pop bands following in the tradition of the Raspberries started emerging in the late 1970s, with groups such as Cheap Trick, the Jam, the Romantics, Shoes, and the Flamin' Groovies, who were seen as 1960s revivalist bands. Much of these newer bands were influenced by late 1960s AM radio, which fell in a rapid decline due to the popularity of the AOR and progressive rock FM radio format. By 1977, there was a renewed interest in the music and culture of the 1960s, with examples such as the Beatlemania musical and the growing mod revival. AABA forms and double backbeats also made their return after many years of disuse in popular music. Spurred on by the emergence of punk rock and new wave, power pop enjoyed a prolific and commercially successful period from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. Throughout the two decades, the genre existed parallel to and occasionally drew from developments such as glam rock, pub rock, punk, new wave, college rock, and neo-psychedelia. AllMusic states that these new groups were \\"swept along with the new wave because their brief, catchy songs fit into the post- punk aesthetic.\\" Most bands rejected the irreverence, cynicism, and irony that characterized new wave, believing that pop music was an art that reached its apex in the mid 1960s, sometimes referred to as the \\"poptopia\\". This in turn led many critics to dismiss power pop as derivative work. Ultimately, the groups with the best-selling records were Cheap Trick, the Knack, the Romantics, and Dwight Twilley, whereas Shoes, the Records, the Nerves, and 20/20 only drew cult followings. Writing for Time in 1978, Jay Cocks cited Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds as \\"the most accomplished purveyors of power pop\\", which he described as \\"the well-groomed stepbrother of punk rock\\". Edmunds was quoted: \\"Before the New Wave ... There was no chance for the little guy who buys a guitar and starts a band. What we're doing is kids' music, really, just four-four time and good songs.\\" Cheap Trick became the most successful act in the genre's history thanks to the band's constant touring schedule and stage theatrics. According to Andrew Earles, the group's \\"astonishing acceptance in Japan (documented on 1979's At Budokan) and hits 'Surrender' and 'I Want You To Want Me,' the Trick took power pop to an arena level and attained a degree of success that the genre had never seen, nor would ever see again.\\" The biggest chart hit by a power pop band was the Knack's debut single, \\"My Sharona\\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks in August‚ÄìSeptember 1979. However, the song's ubiquitous radio presence that summer spawned a popular and critical backlash against the band, which in turn led to a backlash against the power pop genre in general. Once the Knack failed to maintain their commercial momentum, record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups. Most bands of the 1970s milieu broke up in the early 1980s. Succeeding waves= 1980s‚Äì1990s: Alternative rock = The Posies, 2000 In the 1980s and 1990s, power pop continued as a commercially modest genre with artists such as Redd Kross and the Spongetones, The later records of XTC also became a touchstone for bands such as Jellyfish and the Apples in Stereo, while Big Star developed an avid cult following among members of later bands like R.E.M. and the Replacements who expressed esteem for the group's work. Many bands who were primarily influenced by Big Star blended power pop with the ethos and sounds of alternative rock. AllMusic cited Teenage Fanclub, Material Issue, and the Posies as \\"critical and cult favorites\\". In 1991, The Los Angeles Times Chris Willman identified Jellyfish, the Posies, and Redd Kross as the leaders of a \\"new wave of rambunctious Power Pop bands that recall the days when moptops were geniuses, songs were around three minutes long and a great hook--a catchy melodic phrase that \\"hooks\\" the listener‚Äîwas godhead.\\" Members of Jellyfish and Posies said that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. At the time, it was uncertain whether the movement could have mainstream success. Karen Glauber, editor of Hits magazine, said that \\"The popular conception is that these bands are 'retro,' or not post-modern enough because they're not grunge and because the Posies are from Seattle and don't sound like Mudhoney.\\" Velvet Crush's Ric Menck credited Nirvana with ultimately making it \\"possible for people like Matthew [Sweet] and the Posies and Material Issue and, to some extent, us to get college radio play.\\" As power pop \\"gained the attention of hip circles\\", many older bands reformed to record new material that was released on independent labels. Chicago label Numeru Uno issued a series of albums called Yellow Pills that compiled new tracks by these groups as well as contemporary bands. For the rest of decade, AllMusic writes, \\"this group of independent, grass-roots power-pop bands gained a small but dedicated cult following in the United States.\\" = 1990s‚Äì2010s: Continued interest = Power pop has had varying levels of success since the 1990s. In 1994, Green Day and Weezer popularized punk-pop, an alternative rock variant genre that fuses power pop harmonies with uptempo punk moods. According to Louder Than Wars Sam Lambeth, power pop has \\"ebbed and flowed\\" while remaining an object of critical derision. Despite this, he cites Fountains of Wayne with inspiring \\"yet another new era for the format\\" during the late 1990s, \\"one they‚Äôd perfect with the magnetic Welcome Interstate Managers (2003).\\" He writes that as of 2017, \\"you can still hear some of power pop‚Äôs core traits in bands such as Best Coast, Slotface, Diet Cig and Dude York.\\" In 1998, International Pop Overthrow (IPO)‚Äînamed after the album of the same name by Material Issue‚Äîbegan holding a yearly festival for power pop bands. Originally taking place in Los Angeles, the festival expanded to several locations over the years, including Canada and Liverpool, England (the latter event included performances at the Cavern Club). Paul Collins of the Beat and the Nerves hosted the Power Pop-A- Licious music festival in 2011 and 2013, featuring a mixture of classic and rising bands with an emphasis on power pop, punk rock, garage and roots rock. The concerts were held at Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, New Jersey and the Cake Shop in New York City. Paul Collins and his group the Beat headlined the two- day events.

He is the founder (with his wife, Jane) of Stanford University. Migrating to California from New York at the time of the Gold Rush, he became a successful merchant and wholesaler, and continued to build his business empire. He spent one two-year term as Governor of California after his election in 1861, and later eight years as a United States Senator. As president of Central Pacific Railroad, beginning in 1861, and later Southern Pacific, he had tremendous power in the region and a lasting impact on California. He is widely considered a robber baron. Biography=Early years= Stanford was born in 1824 in what was then Watervliet, New York (now the Town of Colonie). He was one of eight children of Josiah and Elizabeth Phillips Stanford. Among his siblings were New York State Senator Charles Stanford (1819‚Äì1885) and Australian businessman and spiritualist Thomas Welton Stanford (1832‚Äì1918). His immigrant ancestor, Thomas Stanford, settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in the 17th century. Later ancestors settled in the eastern Mohawk Valley of central New York about 1720. Stanford's father was a farmer of some means. Stanford was raised on family farms in the Lisha Kill and Roessleville (after 1836) areas of Watervliet. The family home in Roessleville was called Elm Grove. The Elm Grove home was razed in the 1940s. Stanford attended the common school until 1836 and was tutored at home until 1839. He attended Clinton Liberal Institute, in Clinton, New York, and studied law at Cazenovia Seminary in Cazenovia, New York, in 1841‚Äì45. In 1845, he entered the law office of Wheaton, Doolittle and Hadley in Albany. =Career and politics= After being admitted to the bar in 1848, Stanford moved with many other settlers to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he began a law practice with Wesley Pierce. His father presented him with a law library said to be the finest north of Milwaukee. In 1850, Stanford was nominated by the Whig Party as Washington County, Wisconsin district attorney. =Marriage and family= On September 30, 1850, Stanford married Jane Elizabeth Lathrop in Albany, New York. She was the daughter of Dyer Lathrop, a merchant of that city, and Jane Anne (Shields) Lathrop. The couple did not have any children for years, until their only child, a son, Leland DeWitt Stanford, was born in 1868 when his father was forty-four. =Businesses= Photo of a monument in Michigan Bluff, California In 1852, having lost his law library and other property to a fire, Stanford followed his five brothers to California during the California Gold Rush. His wife, Jane, returned temporarily to Albany and her family. He went into business with his brothers and became the keeper of a general store for miners at Michigan City, California, later the name changed to Michigan Bluff in Placer County; later he had a wholesale house. He served as a justice of the peace and helped organize the Sacramento Library Association, which later became the Sacramento Public Library. In 1855, he returned to Albany to join his wife but found the pace of Eastern life too slow after the excitement of developing California. Pacific Railroad Bond, City, and County of San Francisco, 1865 In 1856, he and Jane moved to Sacramento, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. Stanford was one of the four merchants known popularly as \\"The Big Four\\" (or among themselves as \\"the Associates\\") who were the key investors in Chief Engineer Theodore Dehone Judah's plan for the Central Pacific Railroad, which the five of them incorporated on June 28, 1861, and of which Stanford was elected president. The other three associates were Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins, and Collis P. Huntington. The Central Pacific's first locomotive, named \\"Gov. Stanford\\" in his honor, is preserved on static display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. Stanford ran unsuccessfully for governor of California in 1859. He was nominated again in 1861 and won the election. He served one term, then limited to two years. In May 1868, he joined Lloyd Tevis, Darius Ogden Mills, H.D. Bacon, Hopkins, and Crocker in forming the Pacific Union Express Company. It merged in 1870 with Wells Fargo and Company. Stanford was a director of Wells Fargo and Company from 1870 to January 1884. After a brief retirement from the board, he served again from February 1884 until his death in June 1893. Also in May 1868, he started the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company (now Pacific Life) and served as its first president from 1868 to 1876. Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870While the Central Pacific was under construction, Stanford and his associates in 1868 acquired control of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Stanford was elected president of the Southern Pacific, a post he held until 1890 (except for a brief period in 1869‚Äì70 when Tevis was acting president) when he was ousted by Collis Huntington. As head of the railroad company that built the western portion of the \\"First Transcontinental Railroad\\" from Sacramento eastward over the Sierra Nevada mountains in California to Nevada and Utah, Stanford presided at the ceremonial driving of \\"Last Spike\\" in Promontory, Utah on May 10, 1869. The grade of the CPRR met that of the Union Pacific Railroad, which had been built westward from its eastern terminus at Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska. He was even given the honor of driving the final spike. Stanford moved with his family from Sacramento to San Francisco in 1874, where he assumed presidency of the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, the steamship line to Japan and China associated with the Central Pacific. The Southern Pacific Company was organized in 1884 as a holding company for the Central Pacific-Southern Pacific system. Stanford was president of the Southern Pacific Company from 1885 until 1890 when he was forced out of that post (as well as the presidency of the Southern Pacific Railroad) by Collis Huntington. This was thought to be retaliation for Stanford's election to the United States Senate in 1885 over Huntington's friend, Aaron_A._Sargent. Stanford was elected chairman of the Southern Pacific Railroad's executive committee in 1890, and he held this post and the presidency of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death. He is widely considered a robber baron. =Other interests= He owned two wineries, the Leland Stanford Winery in Alameda County founded in 1869, and run and later inherited by his brother Josiah, and the Great Vina Ranch in Tehama County, containing what was then the largest vineyard in the world at and given to Stanford University. Muybridge's The Horse in Motion, 1878 Stanford was also interested in horses and owned the Gridley tract of in Butte County. In Santa Clara County, he founded his Palo Alto Stock Farm. He bred Standardbred horses to be raced as trotters, including his chief sire, Electioneer (sired by Hambletonian) and his winning offspring: Arion, Sunol, Palo Alto, and Chimes (out of Stanford's best known dam Beautiful Bells); and Thoroughbreds for flat racing. In 1872 Stanford commissioned the photographer Eadweard Muybridge to undertake scientific studies of the gaits of horses at a trot and gallop at the Agricultural Park race track in Sacramento. Images of the horses feet were captured there, later moving to his Palo Alto Stock Farm. He wanted to determine if the horses ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The result was the proto-film Sallie Gardner at a Gallop (1878). As the Palo Alto breeding farm was later developed into the Stanford University, the university was nicknamed \\"The Farm\\". =Residences= The Stanford residence in Palo Alto, 1888 The Stanfords retained ownership of their mansion in Sacramento, where their only son was born in 1868. Now the Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park, the house museum is also used for California state social occasions. The Stanfords' home in San Francisco's Nob Hill district was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; the site is occupied now by the Stanford Court Hotel. The Stanford residence at the Palo Alto Stock Farm became a convalescent home for children in 1919 (forerunner of the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital) and was torn down in 1965. =Politics= Stanford in 1890. Stanford was politically active and became a leading member of the Republican Party. In 1856, he met with other Whig politicians in Sacramento on April 30 to organize the California Republican Party at its first state convention. He was chosen as a delegate to the Republican Party convention which selected US presidential electors in both 1856 and 1860. Stanford was defeated in his 1857 bid for California state treasurer, and his 1859 bid for the office of governor of California. In 1860, he was named a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago but did not attend. He was elected governor in a second campaign in 1861. He was the eighth Governor of California, serving from January 1862 to December 1863, and the first Republican governor. Due to the Great Flood of 1862, the governor was said to have needed to row in a boat to his own inauguration. A large, slow-speaking man who always read from a prepared text, he impressed his listeners as being more sincere than a glib, extemporaneous speaker. During his gubernatorial tenure, he cut the state's debt in half and advocated for the conservation of forests. He also oversaw the establishment of the California's first state normal school in San Jos√©, later to become San Jos√© State University. Following Stanford's governorship, the term of office changed from two years to four years, in line with legislation passed during his time in office. Later, he served in the United States Senate from 1885 until his death in 1893. He served for four years as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, and also served on the Naval Committee. He authored several Senate bills that advanced ideas advocated by the Populists: a bill to foster the creation of worker-owned cooperatives, Special Collection 33a, Box 7, Folder 74, Stanford University Archives. PDFCongressional Record, 49 Congress, 2 Sess.: 1804‚Äì1805; 51 Congress, 1 Sess.: 2068‚Äì2069, 5169‚Äì5170, 2 Sess.: 667‚Äì668; 52 Congress, 1 Sess.: 468‚Äì479, 2684‚Äì2686. and a bill to allow the issuance of currency backed by land value instead of only the gold standard. Neither bill made it out of committee. In Washington, D.C., he had a residence on Farragut Square near the home of Baron Karl von Struve, Russian minister to the United States. =Relationship with Chinese immigrants= The gold strike in California had brought a large influx of newcomers into the territory, including Chinese immigrants. These new immigrants faced persecution. Anti-Chinese sentiment became a political issue over time. In a message to the legislature in January 1862, Governor Stanford said: Stanford was initially acclaimed for his frank statements, but later lost support when it was revealed that his Central Pacific Railroad was also importing Chinese workers to construct the railroad. =Stanford University= The Memorial Church at Stanford University is dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford. Leland Stanford, Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, 1881, Stanford museum With his wife Jane, Stanford founded Leland Stanford Junior University as a memorial for their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who died as a teenager of typhoid fever in Florence, Italy, in 1884 while on a trip to Europe. The University was established by March 9, 1885, Endowment Act of the California assembly and senate, and the Grant of Endowment from Leland and Jane Stanford signed at the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 14, 1885. The Act of the Legislature of California. The Grant of Endowment. Address of Leland Stanford to the Trustees. Minutes of the First Meeting of Board of Trustees. The Stanfords donated approximately United States dollar 40 million (equivalent to $ today) to develop the university, which held its opening exercises October 1, 1891. It was intended for agricultural studies. Its first student, admitted to Encina Hall that day, was Herbert Hoover, who went on to become the 31st U.S. President. The wealth of the Stanford family during the late 19th century is estimated at about $50 million (equivalent to $ today). Worker Cooperatives Stanford had ideas of employee ownership for more than thirty years before giving them expression in his plans for Stanford University, proposals as a Senator, and in interviews with the news media. =Personal life= Leland Stanford was an active freemason from 1850 to 1855, joining the Prometheus Lodge No. 17 in Port Washington, Wisconsin. After moving west, he became a member of the Michigan City Lodge No. 47 in Michigan Bluff, California. He was also a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in California. Long suffering from locomotor ataxia, Leland Stanford died of heart failure at home in Palo Alto, California, on June 21, 1893. He was buried in the family mausoleum on the Stanford campus. Jane Stanford died in 1905 after being poisoned with strychnine. Legacy and honors *In 1862 California volunteer troops re-building a military post at the confluence of the San Pedro River and Aravaipa Creek in Arizona Territory named the post Fort Stanford after the governor. However, the post later reverted to its former name, Fort Breckenridge, and in 1866 became Camp Grant. *Central Pacific locomotives named for Stanford were: **Gov. Stanford, a 4-4-0 locomotive built in 1863 by the Norris Locomotive Works in Philadelphia and brought to San Francisco by sailing vessel. This engine is preserved at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. **El Gobernador, a 4-10-0 locomotive built in the Central Pacific shops in Sacramento in 1884. Found to be disappointing in its performance as a freight hauler, it was scrapped in July 1894. *The Stanford Memorial Church on the university campus is dedicated to him. *2008, Stanford was inducted into The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts, California Hall of Fame. A relative, Tom Stanford, accepted the honors on his behalf.

It is considered a medicinal mushroom in some forms of traditional medicine. Taxonomy and naming The fungus was first described scientifically as Agaricus edodes by Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1877. It was placed in the genus Lentinula by David Pegler in 1976. The fungus has acquired an extensive synonymy in its taxonomic history: *Agaricus edodes Berk. (1878) *Armillaria edodes (Berk.) Sacc. (1887) *Mastoleucomychelloes edodes (Berk.) Kuntze (1891) *Cortinellus edodes (Berk.) S.Ito & S.Imai (1938) *Lentinus edodes (Berk.) Singer (1941) *Collybia shiitake J.Schr√∂t.

Singer (1936) *Lentinus tonkinensis Pat. (1890) *Lentinus mellianus Lohwag (1918) The mushroom's Japanese name is composed of , for the tree Castanopsis cuspidata that provides the dead logs on which it is typically cultivated, and . The specific epithet ' is the Latin word for \\"edible\\". It is also commonly called \\"sawtooth oak mushroom\\", \\"black forest mushroom\\", \\"black mushroom\\", \\"golden oak mushroom\\", or \\"oakwood mushroom\\". Habitat and distribution Shiitake grow in groups on the decaying wood of deciduous trees, particularly shii, chestnut, oak, maple, beech, sweetgum, poplar, hornbeam, ironwood, mulberry, and chinquapin. Its natural distribution includes warm and moist climates in Southeast Asia. Cultivation history The earliest written record of shiitake cultivation is seen in the Records of Longquan County () compiled by He Zhan () in 1209 during the Han dynasty in China. The 185-word description of shiitake cultivation from that literature was later crossed-referenced many times and eventually adapted in a book by a Japanese horticulturist in 1796, the first book on shiitake cultivation in Japan. The Japanese cultivated the mushroom by cutting shii trees with axes and placing the logs by trees that were already growing shiitake or contained shiitake spores. Before 1982, the Japan Islands' variety of these mushrooms could only be grown in traditional locations using ancient methods. A 1982 report on the budding and growth of the Japanese variety revealed opportunities for commercial cultivation in the United States. Shiitake are now widely cultivated all over the world, and contribute about 25% of total yearly production of mushrooms. Commercially, shiitake mushrooms are typically grown in conditions similar to their natural environment on either artificial substrate or hardwood logs, such as oak. Culinary=Nutrition= In a reference serving, raw shiitake mushrooms provide of food energy and are 90% water, 7% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat (table for raw mushrooms). Raw shiitake mushrooms are rich sources (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B vitamins and contain moderate levels of some dietary minerals (table). When dried to about 10% water, the contents of numerous nutrients increase substantially. Like all mushrooms, shiitakes produce vitamin D2 upon exposure of their internal ergosterol to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from sunlight or broadband UVB fluorescent tubes. =Uses= Fresh and dried shiitake have many uses in East Asian cuisine. In Japan, they are served in miso soup, used as the basis for a kind of vegetarian dashi, and as an ingredient in many steamed and simmered dishes. In Chinese cuisine, they are often saut√©ed in vegetarian dishes such as Buddha's delight. One type of high- grade shiitake is called in Japanese and ' in Chinese, literally \\"winter mushroom\\". Another high-grade of mushroom is called ' () in Chinese, literally \\"flower mushroom\\", which has a flower-like cracking pattern on the mushroom's upper surface. Both of these are produced at lower temperatures. Research=Dermatitis= Rarely, consumption of raw or slightly cooked shiitake mushrooms may cause an allergic reaction called \\"shiitake dermatitis\\", including an erythematous, micro-papular, streaky pruriginous rash that occurs all over the body including face and scalp, appearing about 24 hours after consumption, possibly worsening by sun exposure and disappearing after 3 to 21 days. This effect ‚Äì presumably caused by the polysaccharide, lentinan ‚Äì is more common in East Asia, but may be growing in occurrence in Europe as shiitake consumption increases. Thorough cooking may eliminate the allergenicity. =Other uses= There is research investigating the use of shiitake mushrooms in production of organic fertilizer and compost from hardwood.

Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by weeks of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \\"100-day cough\\". A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe. The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days. Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder. Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is spread easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction. Prevention is mainly by vaccination with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age, with four doses to be given in the first two years of life. Protection from pertussis decreases over time, so additional doses of vaccine are often recommended for older children and adults. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease, antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms, but otherwise have little effect in most people. In pregnant women and children less than one year old, antibiotics are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions for the cough, other than antibiotics, is poor. About 50% of infected children less than a year old require hospitalization and nearly 0.5% (1 in 200) die. An estimated 16.3 million people worldwide were infected in 2015. Most cases occur in the developing world, and people of all ages may be affected. In 2015, pertussis resulted in 58,700 deaths ‚Äì down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Outbreaks of the disease were first described in the 16th century. The bacterium that causes the infection was discovered in 1906. The pertussis vaccine became available in the 1940s. Signs and symptoms A boy with pertussis The classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely. The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose (known as the catarrhal stage). After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, sometimes followed by a high-pitched \\"whoop\\" sound, as the person tries to inhale. About 50% of children and adults \\"whoop\\" at some point in diagnosed pertussis cases during the paroxysmal stage. This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis. Symptoms of pertussis can be variable, especially between immunized and non-immunized people. Those that are immunized can present with a more mild infection; they may only have the paroxysmal cough for a couple of weeks, and it may lack the \\"whooping\\" characteristic. Although immunized people have a milder form of the infection, they can spread the disease to others who are not immune. =Incubation period= The time between exposure and the development of symptoms is on average 7‚Äì14 days (range 6‚Äì20 days),Heymann, David L. (ed): Pertussis; in Control of Communicable Diseases Manual. p. 457. American Public Health Association, Washington DC, 2008, rarely as long as 42 days.Pertussis (whooping cough) , New York State Department of Health, Updated: January 2012. Retrieved 8 June 2013. Cause Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is an airborne disease (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. =Spread from other animals= Uncertainties have existed of B. pertussis and whooping cough as a zoonotic disease since around 1910 but in the 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists. Today it is established that at least some primate species are highly susceptible to B. pertussis and develop clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses. The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although whooping cough is known among wild gorillas.Butynski TM et al. (eds.): Mammals of Africa vol. II: Primates, p. 51. Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2013. Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough. Mechanism After the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of B. pertussis, including filamentous hemaglutinin and pertactin, mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply. In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs. The bacteria secretes a number of toxins. Tracheal cytotoxin, a fragment of peptidoglycan, kills ciliated epithelial cells and thereby inhibits the mucociliary elevator by which mucus and debris are removed. TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis. The cough may also be caused by a yet-to-be identified \\"cough toxin\\". Pertussis toxin causes lymphocytosis by an unknown mechanism. The elevated number of white blood cells leads to pulmonary hypertension, a major cause of death by pertussis. In infants who develop encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to hypoxia. Diagnosis Gram stain of Bordetella pertussis =Based on symptoms= A physician's overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis. Single factors are much less useful. In adults with a cough of less than 8 weeks, vomiting after coughing or a \\"whoop\\" is supportive. If there are no bouts of coughing or there is a fever the diagnosis is unlikely. In children who have a cough of less than 4 weeks vomiting after coughing is somewhat supportive but not definitive. =Lab tests= Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test). The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks. Serology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the person. =Differential diagnosis= A similar, milder disease is caused by B. parapertussis. Prevention The primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms. Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants). = Vaccine = Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002. The multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccine is 71‚Äì85% effective, with greater effectiveness against more severe strains. However, despite widespread vaccination, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today \\"one of the most common vaccine- preventable diseases in Western countries\\". The 21st-century resurgences in pertussis infections is attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines. Immunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis. An effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1‚Äì9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for B. pertussis and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine. Infection induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time. A 2005 study said estimates of the duration of infection- acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could be the result of differences in levels of circulating B. pertussis, surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The study said protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4‚Äì12 years. One study suggested that the availability of vaccine exemptions increases the number of pertussis cases. Some studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing the disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all. Pertussis infection in these persons may be asymptomatic, or present as illness ranging from a mild cough to classic pertussis with persistent cough (i.e., lasting more than 7 days). Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, those who are infected may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants. Older persons are often found to have the first case in a household with multiple pertussis cases, and are often the source of infection for children.  Treatment  The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides. A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3‚Äì5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10‚Äì14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects. People with pertussis are most infectious during the first two weeks following the onset of symptoms. Effective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed. The use of over the counter cough medications is discouraged and has not been found helpful.  Prognosis  Disability-adjusted life year for pertussis per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2004. While most healthy older children and adults fully recover, infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of US infants under one year of age. First-year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as: apneas (31%), pneumonia (12%), seizures (0.6%) and encephalopathy (0.15%). This may be due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system. Epidemiology thumbupright=1.3Whooping cough deaths per million persons in 2012 Worldwide, whooping cough affects around 16 million people yearly. One estimate for 2013 stated it resulted in about 61,000 deaths ‚Äì down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Another estimated 195,000 child deaths yearly from the disease worldwide. This is despite generally high coverage with the DTP and DTaP vaccines. Pertussis is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide. About 90% of all cases occur in developing countries. Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people. Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is associated with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year. In Canada, the number of pertussis infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in Toronto.Whooping Cough ‚Äì Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis ‚Äì ‚Äì C-Health In 2009 Australia reported an average of 10,000 cases a year, and the number of cases had increased. In the U.S. pertussis in adults has increased significantly since about 2004.Kate Murphy. \\"Enduring and Painful, Pertussis Leaps Back\\" . The New York Times. 22 February 2005. In 2017, India had a reported 23,766 reported pertussis cases, making it one of the highest reported number of cases of the year. Other countries, such as Germany, had reported 16,183 cases, while Australia and China had a reported number of 12,114 and 10,390 pertussis cases. =US outbreaks= An epidemiologist tests blood samples for pertussis during a 2010 outbreak. In 2010 ten infants in California died, and health authorities declared an epidemic encompassing 9,120 cases. They found that doctors had failed to correctly diagnose the infants' condition during several visits. Statistical analysis identified significant overlap in communities with a cluster of nonmedical child exemptions and cases. The number of exemptions varied widely among communities, but tended to be highly clustered. In some schools, more than three-quarters of parents filed for vaccination exemptions. The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reasons and personal belief exacerbated the outbreak. Other factors included reduced duration of immunity following the acellular vaccine and, the fact that most vaccinated adults and older children had not received a booster shot. In April and May 2012 pertussis was declared to be at epidemic levels in Washington, with 3,308 cases. In December 2012 Vermont declared an epidemic of 522 cases. Wisconsin had the highest incidence rate, with 3,877 cases, although it did not make an official epidemic declaration. History= Discovery = B. pertussis was discovered in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale. Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea. = Vaccine = In 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine. In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis. Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.

Informally speaking, a step function is a piecewise constant function having only finitely many pieces. right- continuous. Definition and first consequences A function f\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} is called a step function if it can be written as :f(x) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=0}^n \\\\alpha_i \\\\chi_{A_i}(x), for all real numbers x where n\\\\ge 0, \\\\alpha_i are real numbers, A_i are intervals, and \\\\chi_A is the indicator function of A: :\\\\chi_A(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } x \\\\in A \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } x otin A \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} In this definition, the intervals A_i can be assumed to have the following two properties: # The intervals are pairwise disjoint: A_i \\\\cap A_j = \\\\emptyset for i eq j # The union of the intervals is the entire real line: \\\\bigcup_{i=0}^n A_i = \\\\mathbb R. Indeed, if that is not the case to start with, a different set of intervals can be picked for which these assumptions hold. For example, the step function :f = 4 \\\\chi_{[-5, 1)} + 3 \\\\chi_{(0, 6)} can be written as :f = 0\\\\chi_{(-\\\\infty, -5)} +4 \\\\chi_{[-5, 0]} +7 \\\\chi_{(0, 1)} + 3 \\\\chi_{[1, 6)}+0\\\\chi_{[6, \\\\infty)}. =Variations in the definition= Sometimes, the intervals are required to be right- openhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/StepFunction.html or allowed to be singleton http://mathonline.wikidot.com/step-functions.

Then there is only one interval, A_0=\\\\mathbb R. * The sign function \\\\sgn(x), which is ‚àí1 for negative numbers and +1 for positive numbers, and is the simplest non-constant step function. * The Heaviside function , which is 0 for negative numbers and 1 for positive numbers, is equivalent to the sign function, up to a shift and scale of range (H = (\\\\sgn + 1)/2). It is the mathematical concept behind some test signals, such as those used to determine the step response of a dynamical system. The rectangular function, the next simplest step function. * The rectangular function, the normalized boxcar function, is used to model a unit pulse. = Non-examples = * The integer part function is not a step function according to the definition of this article, since it has an infinite number of intervals. However, some authors also define step functions with an infinite number of intervals. Properties * The sum and product of two step functions is again a step function. The product of a step function with a number is also a step function. As such, the step functions form an algebra over the real numbers. * A step function takes only a finite number of values. If the intervals A_i, for i=0, 1, \\\\dots, n in the above definition of the step function are disjoint and their union is the real line, then f(x)=\\\\alpha_i for all x\\\\in A_i. * The definite integral of a step function is a piecewise linear function. * The Lebesgue integral of a step function \\\\textstyle f = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=0}^n \\\\alpha_i \\\\chi_{A_i} is \\\\textstyle \\\\int f\\\\,dx = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=0}^n \\\\alpha_i \\\\ell(A_i),\\\\, where \\\\textstyle\\\\ell(A) is the length of the interval A, and it is assumed here that all intervals A_i have finite length. In fact, this equality (viewed as a definition) can be the first step in constructing the Lebesgue integral. * A discrete random variable is sometimes defined as a random variable whose cumulative distribution function is piecewise constant. In this case, it is locally a step function (globally, it may have an infinite number of steps). Usually however, any random variable with only countably many possible values is called a discrete random variable, in this case their cumulative distribution function is not necessarily locally a step function, as infinitely many intervals can accumulate in a finite region.

The first was The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970‚Äì1977), a half-hour light-hearted situation comedy in which the character was the news director at fictional television station WJM-TV in Minneapolis. A spinoff series, entitled Lou Grant (1977‚Äì1982), was an hour- long serious dramatic series that frequently engaged in social commentary, featuring the character as city editor of the fictional Los Angeles Tribune. Although spin-offs are common on American television, Lou Grant remains one of a very few characters (played by the same actor) to have a leading role on both a popular comedy and a popular dramatic series (e.g. Trapper John McIntyre, played by two actors). Fictional biography=Pre-WJM-TV= Although the setting of The Mary Tyler Moore Show might have implied that he was a native Minnesotan, Lou Grant in fact established that he was born in the fictional town of Goshen, Michigan. He was the son of John Simpson Grant and Ellen Hammersmith Grant; his grandfather was a pharmacist. At some point in his youth and early adulthood he developed a lifelong affection for westerns, particularly those starring John Wayne. In high school, he was a tackle for his school's football team. Soon after high school, he married Edie MacKenzie (Priscilla Morrill), at an age young enough to have four grandchildren before he turned 50. After marriage he became a combatant in World War II. He served in both the Pacific and European Theatres. At one point, he was a sergeant in the Pacific-based 2nd Marine Division. During another phase of his wartime service he was injured by a grenade in France, the last remnants of which were only removed in his late 40s. He was also part of a unit that liberated an unknown town in Germany. During the war he met and befriended Walter Cronkite. He attended college (although on several occasions he stated he never had the chance to attend), likely after the war. He started his career in print journalism as a copy boy but it is unclear whether this was in Detroit, Minneapolis or San Francisco as he worked for papers in all three cities. In this period of his life, he met and worked with Charlie Hume (Mason Adams) for the first time at the San Francisco Call-Bulletin, and worked with Jack Riley (Eugene Roche). =WJM-TV= At some point in his late 30s he made the transition to broadcast journalism, and by the time of the 1966 elections he was working on a radio news show, as he explained to Mary Richards on the occasion of her producing her first news show all by herself at WJM-TV. He eventually became the head of the WJM news department. He worked in that capacity for 11 years. For most of that period, Mary Richards served as his associate producer (later producer, with Lou having the title of executive producer, and she reported to him), Ted Baxter as his news anchor and Murray Slaughter as his head writer. Of these relationships, the one with Richards was likely the closest. When he first interviewed Mary he liked her because she had spunk, even though he hated spunk. He offered her the job of associate producer, which paid less than the secretarial position for which she'd initially interviewed, but more than what he said was the going rate for full producers. She accepted, saying that she could only \\"afford\\" to be an associate producer. At the same time Mary discovered that Lou was a heavy drinker, with a penchant for hiding whole bottles of scotch in his desk drawers. Except for one abortive attempt at romance, his general attitude towards her was paternalistic. A typical display of his affection for Richards came when his nephew, Allen, tried to put the moves on Mary. Lou became infuriated and said \\"Listen you, let me remind you of something, and remember this forever. I think of this girl here as if she were my own daughter and that means she is your cousin, you get my drift?\\" Lou delivers the news to Sue Ann that her program has been cancelled. Lou's personality was outwardly that of a tough loner and a workaholic man's man. The real Lou Grant was somewhat more complicated. He was quick to anger and had a violent streak, at times threatening the barely competent Ted Baxter and once causing him physical injury. However, those who understood him best, like Mary Richards, knew he was also painfully shy, with a particular awkwardness around women. With those few people he trusted, Lou was protective and could at times confide his emotional vulnerability. Lou's marriage began to slide as he and Edie both adjusted to life after parenthood. They briefly separated for the first time almost immediately after their youngest daughter got married and left the house. Though they reconciled on this occasion, they would occasionally re- separate and seek marriage counseling over the next two years. In about 1973 he and Edie divorced, after which Edie promptly remarried. Lou, who had been consistently portrayed as a devoted husband, tentatively began to date again. He went out with a woman named Charlene (Sheree North; Janis Paige in \\"Menage- a-Lou\\" of Season 6) in particularly Season 5; Mary's best friend Rhoda Morgenstern in Season 4; Mary's next-door neighbor, Paula Kovacks (Penny Marshall) in Season 6; Mary's Aunt Flo (Eileen Heckart) in Seasons 6 and 7; and even with Mary herself in the penultimate episode. He and Sue Ann Nivens almost had a relationship as well. Though he never talked about his religious background, several comments by those around him during his time at WJM suggest he might have been Jewish: Phyllis Lindstrom was the first to suggest that he would get along well with Rhoda since, in her strained words, they were \\"both...earthy,\\" and in a later episode Sue Ann Nivens assured him he would not mind singing her \\"non-denominational\\" Christmas carols. Professionally, his career with WJM-TV ended in the final episode. Lou, along with Mary, Murray, and Sue Ann Nivens were fired due to low ratings. Lou's sometime-nemesis, the vacuous Ted Baxter‚Äîthe real cause for the ratings slide‚Äîwas retained. =Los Angeles Tribune= Grant with Mrs. Pynchon and Charlie Hume. Soon thereafter, he wrote to his former co-worker, Charlie Hume (Mason Adams), inquiring about the possibility of work; when Hume confirmed that he knew of a position for him, Grant relocated to Los Angeles, to work with him at the fictitious Los Angeles Tribune, as the paper's City Editor, returning him to newspaper work. His subordinates at that time included staff reporters Joe Rossi (Robert Walden); Billie Newman (Linda Kelsey); her predecessor, Carla Mardigian (Rebecca Balding); and photographer Dennis \\"Animal\\" Price (Daryl Anderson). His assistant city editor was Art Donovan (Jack Bannon). Charlie Hume was now his boss, who ultimately reported to publisher Margaret Jones Pynchon (Nancy Marchand). They, like those back at WJM, became his family. In the last episode of season one it is revealed that he has just turned 50, which would have meant he began serving in WWII at about the age of 14. Unofficial appearances In a 1984 episode of Saturday Night Live, Lou hired a team of mercenaries to \\"rescue\\" Mary Richards after she got stuck in the '70s in syndicated reruns. But Mary refused rescue on the grounds that she never ages and never gains weight, and that people still like her. In 1996 the character appeared on \\"Call Waiting\\", an episode of Roseanne, in a dream sequence experienced by the show's lead. Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) was Mary and Dan (John Goodman) was Lou, and the two got into a heated argument. Lou stomped out, but quickly returned and was then played by Asner. (He commented about not feeling like himself.) Asner was uncredited. In 1998, Asner appeared in a cameo role as an Associated Press editor in the miniseries More Tales of the City (based on the series of Armistead Maupin novels). Though not Lou Grant, per se, the character's demeanor was similar to that of the character. In 2004, Asner unofficially reprised the role in a series of ads promoting Twin Cities station KSTP-TV, a real television station in the same market as the fictional WJM-TV. Additionally in 2013, Asner again reprised the role for a series of promos for The Mary Tyler Moore Show airing on MeTV. Reception Asner won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Lou, with three of these awards for The Mary Tyler Moore Show and two for Lou Grant. Bravo ranked Lou 35th on their list of the 100 greatest TV characters.

Individuals can discriminate by refusing to do business with, socialize with, or share resources with people of a certain group. Governments can discriminate in a de facto fashion or explicitly in law, for example through policies of racial segregation, disparate enforcement of laws, or disproportionate allocation of resources. Some jurisdictions have anti-discrimination laws which prohibit the government or individuals from discriminating based on race (and sometimes other factors) in various circumstances. Some institutions and laws use affirmative action to attempt to overcome or compensate for the effects of racial discrimination. In some cases, this is simply enhanced recruitment of members of underrepresented groups; in other cases, there are firm racial quotas. Opponents of strong remedies like quotas characterize them as reverse discrimination, where members of a dominant or majority group are discriminated against.  Boundary problems and related forms of discrimination  Racial boundaries can involve many different factors (such as ancestry, physical appearance, national origin, language, religion, and culture), and maybe set in law by governments, or may depend on local cultural norms. Discrimination based on skin color,(measured for example on the Fitzpatrick scale) is closely related to racial discrimination, as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions, and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria. For example, the Population Registration Act, 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in South Africa, and Brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas.For Affirmative Action, Brazil Sets Up Controversial Boards To Determine Race Because of genetic variation, skin color, and other physical appearance can vary considerably even among siblings. Some children with the same parents either self-identify or are identified by others as being of different races. In some cases, the same person is identified as a different race on a birth certificate versus a death certificate. Different rules (such as hypodescent vs. hyperdescent) classify the same people differently, and for various reasons some people \\"pass\\" as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in, possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination. A given race is sometimes defined as a set of ethnicities from populations in neighboring geographic areas (such as a continent like Australia or a subcontinental region like South Asia) that are typically similar in appearance. In such cases, racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race, or ethnic discrimination (or ethnic hatred, ethnic conflict, and ethnic violence) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race. Discrimination based on caste is similar; because caste is hereditary, people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity. A person's national origin (the country in which they were born or have citizenship) is sometimes used in determining a person's ethnicity or race, but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race (and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws). Language and culture are sometimes markers of national origin and can prompt instances of discrimination based on national origin. For example, someone of a South Asian ethnicity who grew up in London, speaks British English with a London accent, and whose family has assimilated to British culture might be treated more favorably than someone of the same ethnicity who is a recent immigrant and speaks Indian English. Such a difference in treatment might still informally be described as a form of racism, or more precisely as xenophobia or anti-immigrant sentiment. In countries where migration, unification, or breakup has occurred relatively recently, the process of ethnogenesis may complicate the determination of both ethnicity and race and is related to personal identity or affiliation. Sometimes the ethnicity of immigrants in their new country is defined as their national origin, and span multiple races. For example, the 2015 Community Survey of the United States Census accepted identification as Mexican Americans of any race (for example including Native Americans from Mexico, descendants of Africans transported to New Spain as enslaved people, and descendants of Spanish colonists). In surveys taken by the Mexican government, the same people would have been described as indigenous, black, or white (with a large number of people unclassified who might be described as Mestizo). The U.S. census asks separate questions about Hispanic and Latino Americans to distinguish language from racial identity. Discrimination based on being Hispanic or Latino does occur in the United States and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Latino\\" are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the Americas. Many statistical reports apply both characteristics, for example comparing Non-Hispanic whites to other groups. When people of different races are treated differently, decisions about how to treat a particular person raise the question of which racial classification that person belongs to. For example, definitions of whiteness in the United States were used before the civil rights movement for the purpose of immigration and the ability to hold citizenship or be enslaved. If a race is defined as a set of ethnolinguistic groups, then common language origin can be used to define the boundaries of that group. The status of Finns as white was challenged on the grounds that the Finnish language is Uralic rather than Indo-European, purportedly making the Finns of the Mongoloid race. The common American notion that all people of geographically European ancestry and of light skin are \\"white\\" prevailed for Finns, and other European immigrants like Irish Americans and Italian Americans whose whiteness was challenged and who faced interpersonal if not legal discrimination. American and South African laws which divided the population into whites from Europe and blacks from sub-Saharan Africa often caused problems of interpretation when dealing with people from other areas, such as the rest of the Mediterranean Basin, Asia, North Africa, or even Native Americans, with classification as non-white usually resulting in legal discrimination. (Some Native American tribes have treaty rights which grant privileges rather than disadvantages, though these were often negotiated on unfavorable terms.) Though as an ethno-religious group they often face religious discrimination, the whiteness of all Jews was also challenged in the United States, with attempts to classify them as Asiatic (Palestine being in western Asia) or Semitic (which would also include Arabs). The actual ancestry of most Jewish people is more varied than simply ancient Hebrew tribes. As the Jewish diaspora spread across Europe and Africa over time many Jewish ethnic divisions arose, resulting in Jews who identify as white, black, and other races. The reunification of diverse populations in modern Israel has led to some problems of racial discrimination against dark-skinned Jews by light- skinned Jews. Around the world=Overall trends= A 2013 analysis of World Values Survey data by The Washington Post looked at the fraction of people in each country that indicated they would prefer not to have neighbours of the same race. It ranged from below 5% in Australia, New Zealand, and many countries in the Americas, to 51.4% in Jordan; Europe had wide variation, from below 5% in the UK, Norway, and Sweden, to 22.7% in France. More than 30 years of field experimental studies have found significant levels of discrimination against non-whites in labor, housing, and product markets in 10 different countries. = The Netherlands = A study conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2013 found significant levels of discrimination against job applicants with Arabic-sounding names. = Africa = The British colonial impact greatly affected the cultures of African society but the differences in the countries like Nigeria remain as close to tradition compared to countries like South Africa. American racism also plays a part that escalates racism in Nigeria but American racism ideas influencing African Cultures. The racism that was developed by the influence of colonization and American influenced there to create levels of power based on racism. Racism in African cultures is connected to the opportunities received in life, virus susceptibility, and tribal traditions. For example, in the north, an indirect policy of rule settled a new way of life between the colonizing government and the Fulani- Hausa ruling class. Because of this the North falls behind the South and West on education development which causes racial malignity.  Liberia  The constitution of Liberia renders non-Blacks ineligible for citizenship. = United States = With regard to employment, multiple audit studies have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the United States' labor market, with magnitudes of employers' preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50% to 240%. Other such studies have found significant evidence of discrimination in car sales, home insurance applications, provision of medical care, and hailing taxis. There is some debate regarding the method used to signal race in these studies. Employment Racial discrimination in the workplace falls into two basic categories: *Disparate Treatment: An employer's policies discriminate based upon any immutable racial characteristic, such as skin, eye or hair color, and certain facial features; *Disparate Impact: Although an employer may not intend to discriminate based on racial characteristics, its policies nonetheless have an adverse effect based upon race. Discrimination may occur at any point in the employment process, including pre-employment inquiries, hiring practices, compensation, work assignments and conditions, privileges granted to employees, promotion, employee discipline and termination. Researchers Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, at the University of Chicago and MIT found in a 2004 study, that there was widespread racial discrimination in the workplace. In their study, candidates perceived as having \\"white-sounding names\\" were 50% more likely than those whose names were merely perceived as \\"sounding black\\" to receive callbacks for interviews. The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the United States' long history of discrimination (e.g., Jim Crow laws, etc.) Devah Pager, a sociologist at Princeton University, sent matched pairs of applicants to apply for jobs in Milwaukee and New York City, finding that black applicants received callbacks or job offers at half the rate of equally qualified whites.\\"Discrimination in a Low Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment,\\" 2009, American Sociological Review, by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski\\"The Mark of a Criminal Record,\\" 2003, American Journal of Sociology, by Devah Pager Another recent audit by UCLA sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high-quality state higher education institutions. This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst. A 2001 study of workplace evaluation in a large U.S. company showed that black supervisors rate white subordinates lower than average and vice versa. Perry and Pickett‚Äôs (2016, as cited in Heberle et al., 2020) research concluded that unemployment rates are higher for Black and Latinx folks than White folks. Housing Multiple experimental audit studies conducted in the United States have found that blacks and Hispanics experience discrimination in about one in five and one in four housing searches, respectively. A 2014 study also found evidence of racial discrimination in an American rental apartment market. Researchers found in contrast to White families, families of color were led to obtain housing in poor, low-quality communities due to discrimination during the home-buying process. Effects on health Studies have shown an association between reported racial discrimination and adverse physical and mental health outcomes. This evidence has come from multiple countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. = Racism in healthcare system = Racial bias exists in the medical field affecting the way patients are treated and the way they are diagnosed. There are instances where patients‚Äô words are not taken seriously, an example would be the recent case with Serena Williams. After the birth of her daughter via C-section, the tennis player began to feel pain and shortness of breath. It took her several times to convince the nurse they actually took her self-said symptoms seriously. Had she not been persistent and demanded a CT scan, which showed a clot resulting in blood thinning, Williams might have not been alive. This is just one of hundreds of cases where systemic racism can affect women of color in pregnancy complications. One of the factors that lead to higher mortality rates amongst black mothers is the poorly conditioned hospitals and lack of standard healthcare facilities. Along with having deliveries done in underdeveloped areas, the situation becomes complicated when the pain dealt by patients are not taken seriously by healthcare providers. Pain heard from patients of color are underestimated by doctors compared to pain told by patients who are white leading them to misdiagnose. Many say that the education level of people affect whether or not they admit to healthcare facilities, leaning to the argument that people of color purposefully avoid hospitals compared to white counterparts however, this is not the case. Even Serena Williams, a well-known athlete, was not taken seriously when she described her pain. It is true that the experiences of patients in hospital settings influence whether or not they return to healthcare facilities. Black people are less likely to admit to hospitals however those that are admitted have longer stays than white people The longer hospitalization of black patients does not improve care conditions, it makes it worse, especially when treated poorly by faculty. Not a lot of minorities are admitted into hospitals and those that are receive poor conditioned treatment and care. This discrimination results in misdiagnosis and medical mistakes that lead to high death rates. Although the Medicaid program was passed to ensure African Americans and other minorities received the healthcare treatment they deserved and to limit discrimination in hospital facilities, there still seems to be an underlying cause for the low number of black patients admitted to hospitals, like not receiving the proper dosage of medication. Infant mortality rates and life expectancies of minorities are much lower than that of white people in the United States. Illnesses like cancer and heart diseases are more prevalent in minorities, which is one of the factors for the high mortality rate in the group. however are not treated accordingly. Although programs like Medicaid exists to support minorities, there still seems to be a large number of people who are not insured. This financial drawback discourages people in the group to go to hospitals and doctors offices. Financial and cultural influences can impact the way patients are treated by their healthcare providers. When doctors have a bias on a patient, it can lead to the formation of stereotypes, impacting the way they view their patient's data and diagnosis, affecting the treatment plan they implement.  Welfare of Children  The topic of racial discrimination appears in discussion concerning children and adolescents. Amongst the number of theories evaluating how children come to understand social identities, research presumes that social and cognitive developmental changes influence children‚Äôs perspectives regarding their own racial/ethnic identities and children develop a greater understanding of how their race/ethnicity can be perceived by the greater society. A study led by Benner et al. (2018) analyzes a combination of previous studies indicating an existing relationship between racial discrimination and well-being, more specifically, in regards to mental health, behaviors, and academic performance of adolescents ranging from early adolescence (10-13) to late adolescence (17 and older). While it includes Asian, African descent, and Latino populations, this study also speculates the variances amongst the racial groups and other differences contributed by intersectionality. To investigate these relationships, the researchers examined data containing reports of racial discrimination from children, which served as a significant tool to further explore these ideas. In addition they analyzed the relationship between racial discrimination and aspects of well-being (e.g., self-esteem, substance abuse, student engagement) by organizing these components into broader categories of youth development: mental health, behavioral conditions and academic success. Subsequently, the results show a relationship between racial discrimination and negative outcomes relating to youth wellness across all three categories. Moreover, while examining differences among racial groups, children of Asian and Latino descent were found to be most at risk for mental health development, and Latino children, for academic success. Although the studies‚Äô results correlate reported racial discrimination with outcomes to well-being, this does not conclude that one or more racial groups experience greater discrimination than other racial groups. Other factors may have contributed to the relationships‚Äô findings. For example, evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of African descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination, or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination. Also, researchers speculate the meaningful ways intersectionality can play a role in variances of discrimination. Ultimately, they conclude that further studies to examine racial discrimination are necessary to provide a more comprehensive approach in determining effective support systems for children.  Critical Consciousness in Youth and Racial Discrimination  When a person is conscious of their privilege, mindful of oppression and discrimination, and when they address and counteract these injustices, they are expressing critical consciousness. Additionally, critical consciousness can grow in individuals as a result of inequalities they may face such as racial discrimination. The researchers, Heberle, Rapa, and Farago (2020), conducted a systematic review of research literature on the concept critical consciousness. The study focused on 67 qualitative and quantitative studies regarding the effects of critical consciousness in youth since 1998. For example, one of the studies included in the report by Ngo (2017), studied an extracurricular program that analyzed the racial discrimination faced by Hmong adolescents and the exploration of critical consciousness participation in theater. The non-scholastic theater program encouraged this group of students to explore their identities through the injustices they faced and to fight against the oppression and racial discrimination they experienced. Critical consciousness can be used as a tool to fight against racial discrimination. Heberle et al. (2020) argued that a decrease in racial discrimination can happen when White youth are aware of differences in groups and injustices due to their critical consciousness. They might change their thinking by fostering antiracist beliefs and having awareness of their own White privilege. Reverse discrimination Reverse discrimination is a term for allegations that the member of a dominant or majority group has suffered discrimination for the benefit of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. = United States = In the United States, courts have upheld race- conscious policies when they are used to promote a diverse work or educational environment. Some critics have described those policies as discriminating against white people. In response to arguments that such policies (e.g. affirmative action) constitute discrimination against whites, sociologists note that the purpose of these policies is to level the playing field to counteract discrimination. Perceptions A 2016 poll found that 38% of US citizens thought that Whites faced a lot of discrimination. Among Democrats, 29% thought there was some discrimination against Whites in the United States, while 49% of Republicans thought the same. Similarly, another poll conducted earlier in the year found that 41% of US citizens believed there was \\"widespread\\" discrimination against whites. There is evidence that some people are motivated to believe they are the victims of reverse discrimination because the belief bolsters their self-esteem. Law In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits all racial discrimination based on race. Although some courts have taken the position that a white person must meet a heightened standard of proof to prove a reverse-discrimination claim, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) applies the same standard to all claims of racial discrimination without regard to the victim's race.

In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g., Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office (e.g., Malaysia). The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation \\"r.\\" (for Latin ') after a sovereign's name, such as the following: :George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India (r. 1936-1952) Regnal periods Notable reigns have included the following. * Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India reigned from 1837 to 1901. * King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy reigned from 1900 to 1946. * King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand reigned from 1946 to 2016. * Queen Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth realms reigns from 1952 to present. * Pope John XXIII reigned from 1958 to 1963. * Emperor Akihito of Japan reigned from 1989 to 2019. End of reign A reign can be ended in three ways: * death * abdication * abolition of monarchy =Abdication= * Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, King of Lombardy-Venetia (r. 1835-1848) was abdicated due to his disabilities (feeble-mindedness and epilepsy). His successor, Emperor Franz Josef (r. 1848-1916) reigned for 68 years. * King Edward VIII reigned from January to December 1936 before he abdicated the throne. After his abdication he became known as the Duke of Windsor. No other monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707‚Äì1800), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or any Dominion or Commonwealth realm has ever abdicated, though forced abdications did occur on rare occasions in the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland prior to their merger in 1707. * Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands reigned from 1890 to 1948, before abdicating in favor of her daughter, Queen Juliana who then reigned until 1980 when she abdicated in favor of her daughter, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Beatrix followed suit and abdicated in 2013 in favor of her son and heir apparent, King Willem-Alexander. =Abolition of monarchy= * King Louis XVI of France reigned from the 1770s until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 and his execution the following year. * Xuantong Emperor of China abdicated in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution, marking the end of the Chinese monarchy. * King Humbert II of Italy reigned for only a few weeks in 1946 before the abolition of the Italian Monarchy. * King Constantine II of Greece reigned from 1964 until the abolition of the Greek monarchy in 1973. * Tsar Nicholas II of Russia reigned from 1894 until 1917 when he was forced to abdicate and the Russian Empire was overthrown during the Russian Revolution. * Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia reigned for over 40 years (1930-1974) until the Derg forced him to abdicate and abolished the 3,000 year old monarchy, making him not only the 225th Emperor of Ethiopia but the final as well. * Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran reigned for more than 37 years (1941‚Äì1979) until he fled during the Iranian Revolution, which superseded the 2,500 years of monarchy with an Islamic republic system of government. The Shah died the following year and is buried in Cairo.

She is known for her best-selling novels featuring medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, of which the first was inspired by a series of sensational murders in Richmond, Virginia, where most of the stories are set. The plots are notable for their emphasis on forensic science, which has influenced later TV treatments of police work. Cornwell has also initiated new research into the Jack the Ripper killings, incriminating the popular British artist Walter Sickert. Her books have sold more than 100 million copies. Early life A descendant of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, Cornwell was born on June 9, 1956 in Miami, Florida, second of three children, to Marilyn (n√©e Zenner) and Sam Daniels. Her father was one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, \\"He was on his deathbed. We knew it was the last time we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad 'How's work?'\\" In 1961, Marilyn left with three children in tow and moved to Montreat, North Carolina. Ruth Bell Graham, wife of the evangelist Billy Graham took the wayward family in and arranged for Cornwell and her brothers, Jim and John, to be raised by Lenore and Manfred Saunders, who had recently returned from Africa. Marilyn Daniels, suffering from severe depression, was hospitalized. Cornwell turned to Ruth Bell Graham as an authority figure, and it was she who noticed that Cornwell's talent lay in writing and encouraged her literary efforts. A bright student, a capable cartoonist, and a talented athlete on the tennis court, Cornwell attended King College in Bristol, Tennessee briefly before transferring to Davidson College on a tennis scholarship (which she later rejected), from where she graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in English. Career In 1979, Cornwell began working as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer, initially editing TV listings, then moving to features, and finally becoming a reporter covering crime. In 1980, she received the North Carolina Press Association's Investigative Reporting Award for a series on prostitution. She continued at the newspaper until 1981, when she moved to Richmond, Virginia with her first husband, Charles Cornwell (married in 1980), who enrolled at the Union Theological Seminary. The same year she began working on the biography of Ruth Bell Graham, A Time for Remembering: The Ruth Bell Graham Story (renamed Ruth, A Portrait: The Story of Ruth Bell Graham in subsequent editions), which was published in 1983. The biography gained a Gold Medallion Book Award from the Evangelic Christian Publishers Association in 1985. It also, however, was a major blow to her friendship with Graham ‚Äì they weren't on speaking terms for 8 years following the book's publication. Cornwell began work on her first novel in 1984, about a male detective named Joe Constable and met Dr. Marcella Farinelli Fierro, a medical examiner in Richmond, and subsequent inspiration for the character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In 1985, she took a job at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, Postmortem, based on real-life stranglings in Richmond in the summer of 1987. The novel won her various awards including the British John Creasey Award, the French Prix du Roman d'Adventure and the American Edgar Award. =Scarpetta series= The Scarpetta novels include a great deal of detail on forensic science. The initial resolution to the mystery is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim's corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners. The novels generally climax with action scenes in which Scarpetta and her associates confront, or are confronted by, the killer or killers, usually concluding with the death of the killer. The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular TV series on forensics, both fictional, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and documentaries, such as Cold Case Files. Other significant themes in the Scarpetta novels include health, individual safety and security, food, family, and the emerging sexual self-discovery of Scarpetta's niece. Often, conflicts and secret manipulations by Scarpetta's colleagues and staff are involved in the story-line and make the murder cases more complex. Although scenes from the novels take place in a variety of locations around the United States and (less commonly) internationally, they center around the city of Richmond, Virginia. There are two remarkable style shifts in the Scarpetta novels. Starting from The Last Precinct (2000), the style changes from past tense to present tense. Starting from Blow Fly (2003), the style changes from a first person to a third person, omniscient, narrator. Events are even narrated from the viewpoint of the murderers. Before Blow Fly the events are seen through Scarpetta's eyes only, and other points of view only appear in letters that Scarpetta reads. Cornwell shifted back to a first- person perspective in the Scarpetta novel Port Mortuary (2010). =Andy Brazil/Judy Hammer series= In addition to the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three pseudo-police fictions, known as the Trooper Andy Brazil/Superintendent Judy Hammer series, which are set in North Carolina, Virginia, and off the mid-Atlantic coast. Besides the older-woman/younger-man premise, the books include discomforting themes of scatology and sepsis. =Jack the Ripper= Cornwell has been involved in a continuing, self- financed search for evidence to support her theory that painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She wrote Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper‚ÄîCase Closed, which was published in 2002 to much controversy, especially within the British art world and among Ripperologists. Cornwell denied being obsessed with Jack the Ripper in full-page ads in two British newspapers and has said the case was \\"far from closed\\". In 2001, Cornwell was criticized for allegedly destroying one of Sickert's paintings in pursuit of the Ripper's identity. She believed the well-known painter to be responsible for the string of murders and had purchased over thirty of his paintings and argued that they closely resembled the Ripper crime scenes. Cornwell also claimed a breakthrough: a letter written by someone purporting to be the killer, had the same watermark as some of Sickert's writing paper. Ripper experts noted, however, that there were hundreds of letters from different authors falsely claiming to be the killer, and the watermark in question was on a brand of stationery that was widely available. = TV appearance = She made a brief appearance on the police procedural drama Criminal Minds in the episode \\"True Genius\\" as herself. Legal issues=Leslie Sachs case= Leslie Sachs, author of The Virginia Ghost Murders (1998), claimed there were similarities between his novel and Cornwell's The Last Precinct. In 2000, he sent letters to Cornwell's publisher, started a web page, and placed stickers on copies of his novel alleging that Cornwell was committing plagiarism. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Cornwell a preliminary injunction against Sachs, opining that his claims were likely to be found baseless.Cyberlaw update - Chapter 10: Privacy Rights and Security Issues Pearson Higher Education In 2007, during her libel suit against Sachs, Cornwell testified that Sachs had accused her in online postings of being a \\"Jew hater\\" and \\"neo-Nazi\\" who bribed judges, conspired to have him killed, and was under investigation by U.S. authorities.Dan Glaister, Crime writer Patricia Cornwell takes 'cyberstalker' to court, The Guardian, May 24, 2007.David Mehegan, Crime novelist tries to ward off Internet attacker, Boston Globe, June 7, 2007. The court permanently enjoined Sachs from making defamatory accusations against Cornwell and awarded Cornwell $37,780 in damages to cover the costs of defending herself against Sachs' internet attacks.Matthew Heller, Defaulted Defamer Ordered to Pay Crime Author $35K , Courthouse News Service, December 24, 2007. =Anchin, Block & Anchin= In 2004, Cornwell assigned management of her financial matters to New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin, managed by principal Evan Snapper. Agreeing to pay the firm a base rate of $40,000/month, her lawyer later claimed that Cornwell had hired Snapper to insulate herself from her money due to her ongoing mental health issues, and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company. Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net worth of her and her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc., despite having above $10 million in earnings per year during the previous four years, was a little under $13 million, the equivalent of only one year's net income. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit, Snapper pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance regulations. The court case opened in January 2013, with Cornwell suing the firm for a combined sum of $100M. On February 19, a Boston jury awarded Cornwell 50.9 million (¬£33.4 million). Personal life=Relationships= On June 14, 1980, shortly after graduating from Davidson College in North Carolina, she married one of her English professors, Charles L. Cornwell, who was 17 years her senior. Professor Cornwell later left his tenured professorship to become a preacher. In 1989, the couple separated, with Patricia retaining her married name after the divorce. In 2006, Cornwell married Staci Ann Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University. However, she did not disclose news of her marriage until 2007. Cornwell later stated that turning 50 had made her see the importance of speaking out for equal rights and spoke of how Billie Jean King had helped her come to terms with talking about her sexuality publicly. She lives with Gruber in Massachusetts.\\"Crime pays quite well for Patricia Cornwell\\" USA Today 3 December 2008\\"Patricia Cornwell: 'Finally, I feel rooted somewhere'\\" November 26, 2007 Since childhood, Cornwell has been friends with the family of evangelist Billy Graham and his wife Ruth Bell, often serving as the family's unofficial spokesperson to the media. She also wrote an authorized biography of Ruth Bell Graham. Cornwell was previously a personal friend of former President George H. W. Bush, whom she referred to as \\"Big George\\", spending a number of weeks at the family's summer retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine. =Health problems= Cornwell has in the past suffered from anorexia nervosa and depression, which began in her late teens. She spoke openly about her struggle with bipolar disorder, but in 2015 said that she was misdiagnosed. On January 10, 1993, Cornwell crashed her Mercedes-Benz while under the influence of alcohol. She was convicted of drunk driving and sentenced to 28 days in a treatment center. =Political views= Since 1998, Cornwell has donated at least $130,000 to the Republican Party, and has made additional individual contributions to Republican U.S. Senate candidates, including George Allen, John Warner, and Orrin Hatch. She has occasionally supported specific Democratic candidates as well, including Hillary Clinton, Nicola Tsongas, Charles Robb, and Mark Warner. Cornwell has spoken negatively of the presidency of George W. Bush, saying, \\"I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. I thought he was going to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on.\\" =Charity= Cornwell has made several notable charitable donations, including funding the Virginia Institute for Forensic Science and Medicine, funding scholarships to the University of Tennessee's National Forensics Academy and Davidson College's Creative Writing Program (the result of which is the Patricia Cornwell Creative Writing Scholarship, awarded to one or two incoming freshmen), and donating her collection of Walter Sickert paintings to Harvard University. As a member of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital's National Council, she is an advocate for psychiatric research. She has also made million-dollar donations to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the Crime Scene Academy and to the Harvard Art Museum. She donated funds to the Richmond City Police Dept. and neighboring Henrico County Police Dept. to purchase bullet-proof vests for the police dogs. Cornwell is also a major contributor at the Five Star level to the Veterans Village of San Diego, with lifetime giving of more than $250,000.

In 1858, Bagehot married Elizabeth (Eliza) Wilson (1832‚Äì1921), whose father, James Wilson, was the founder and owner of The Economist; the couple were happily married until Bagehot's untimely death at age 51, but had no children. A collection of their love-letters was published in 1933. =Journalism= In 1855, Bagehot founded the National Review with his friend Richard Holt Hutton.Walter Bagehot by St. Norman John-Stevas The British Council/National Book League/Longmans, Greene & Co. London. (1963) In 1861, he became editor-in-chief of The Economist. In the 17 years he served as its editor, Bagehot expanded The Economist's reporting on politics and increased its influence among policymakers. =Works= Title page of the first edition of Bagehot's The English Constitution, 1867.. In 1867, Bagehot wrote The English Constitution, a book that explores the nature of the constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically its Parliament and monarchy. It appeared at the same time that Parliament enacted the Reform Act of 1867, requiring Bagehot to write an extended introduction to the second edition which appeared in 1872. Bagehot also wrote Physics and Politics (1872), in which he examines how civilisations sustain themselves, arguing that in their earliest phase civilisations are very much in opposition to the values of modern liberalism, insofar as they are sustained by conformism and military success, but once they are secured it is possible for them to mature into systems which allow for greater diversity and freedom. His viewpoint was based on a distinction between the qualities of an ‚Äúaccomplished man‚Äù and those of a ‚Äúrude man‚Äù, which he considered the result of iterative inheritances by which the ‚Äúnervous organisation‚Äù of the individual became increasingly refined through the generations. He regarded this distinction as a moral achievement whereby through the actions of the will, this ‚Äúaccomplished‚Äú elite was able to morally differentiate themselves from ‚Äúrude men‚Äú by a ‚Äúhereditary drill‚Äú. He equally applied such reasoning to develop a form of pseudoscientific racism, whereby those of mixed race lacked any ‚Äúinherited creed‚Äù or ‚Äúfixed traditional sentiments‚Äù upon which, he considered, human nature depended. He attempted to provide empirical support for his views by citing John Lubbock and Edward Tylor, although neither of them accepted such arguments for hereditary difference in their writings on human evolution. Tylor in particular rejected Bagehot's view of the centrality of physical heredity and that the modern ‚Äúsavage‚Äú mind was ‚Äútattooed over with monstrous images‚Äù by which base instincts had been preserved in crevices, as opposed to the accomplished European man, for whom such instincts had been smoothed away through inherited will to exercise reason.

The Financial Times (London, England), Tuesday, June 12, 1984; p. 17; edition 29,344. His observations on finance are often cited by central bankers, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis which began in 2007. Of particular importance is \\"Bagehot's Dictum\\" that in times of financial crisis central banks should lend freely to solvent depository institutions, yet only against sound collateral and at interest rates high enough to dissuade those borrowers that are not genuinely in need.Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, Bank of England, \\"The Repertoire of Official Sector Interventions in the Financial System: Last Resort Lending, Market-Making, and Capital\\" , Bank of Japan 2009 International Conference, 27‚Äì28 May 2009, p. 5 =Legacy= Lombard Street, 1873. Bagehot never fully recovered from a bout of pneumonia he suffered in 1867, and he died in 1877 from complications of what was said to be a cold.Roger Kimball, \\"The Greatest Victorian\\", The New Criterion October 1998. Collections of Bagehot's literary, political, and economic essays were published after his death. Their subjects ranged from Shakespeare and Disraeli to the price of silver.

Named for Captain George Vancouver, the fort was located on the northern bank of the Columbia River in present-day Vancouver, Washington. The fort was a major center of the regional fur trading. Every year trade goods and supplies from London arrived either via ships sailing to the Pacific Ocean or overland from Hudson Bay via the York Factory Express. Supplies and trade goods were exchanged with a plethora of Indigenous cultures for fur pelts. Furs from Fort Vancouver were often shipped to the Chinese port of Guangzhou where they were traded for Chinese manufactured goods for sale in the United Kingdom. At its pinnacle, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Today, a full-scale replica of the fort, with internal buildings, has been constructed and is open to the public as Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. Background During the War of 1812, the Pacific Northwest was a distant region of the conflict. Two rival fur trading outfits, the Canadian North West Company (NWC) and the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC), had until then both operated in the region peaceably. Funded largely by John Jacob Astor, the PFC operated without many opportunities for military defense by the United States Navy. News of the war and of a coming British warship put the American company into a difficult position. In October 1813, management met at Fort Astoria and agreed to liquidate its assets to the NWC. HMS Racoon arrived the following month and in honor of George III of the United Kingdom, Fort Astoria was renamed to Fort George. In negotiations with American Albert Gallatin throughout 1818, British plenipotentiary Frederick John Robinson was offered a proposition for a partition that would have, as Gallatin stated, \\"all the waters emptying in the sound called the Gulf of Georgia.\\" Frederick Merk has argued the definition used by the negotiators of the Gulf of Georgia included the entirety of the Puget Sound, in addition to the Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca. This would have given the United Kingdom the most favorable location for ports north of Alta California and south of Russian America. Robinson didn't agree to the proposal and subsequent talks didn't focus on establishing a permanent border west of the Rocky Mountains. The Treaty of 1818 made the resources of the vast region were to be \\"free and open\\" to citizens from either nation. The treaty wasn't made to combine American and British interests against other colonial powers in the region. Rather, the document states that the joint occupancy of the Pacific Northwest was intended to \\"prevent disputes\\" between the two nations from arising. In the ensuing years, the North West Company would continue to expand its operations in the Pacific Northwest. Skirmishes with its major competitor, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), had already flared into the Pemmican War. The end of the conflict in 1821 saw the NWC mandated by the British Government to merge into the HBC. =Later negotiations= Throughout 1825 and 1826, British officials would continue to offer Americans partition plans for the Pacific Coast of North America. These largely originated in part from correspondence with the NWC and later HBC. The border would continue to extend west on the 49th parallel to the Rocky Mountains, where the Columbia (and some times the Snake River) would be used as the border until it reached the Pacific Ocean. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs George Canning has been appraised by later historians most supportive British Foreign minister in securing a border along the Columbia. United States Secretary of State Henry Clay had given instructions to the American plenipotentiaries to offer a partition of the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean. The difference in the two considered plans were too much to solve, making the diplomats put off a formal colonial division once more. Establishment Hudson's Bay Company Flag In the early 1820s a general reorganization of all NWC properties, now entirely under HBC management, was overseen directly by Sir George Simpson. The newly established Columbia District needed a more suitable headquarters than Fort George at the mouth of the Columbia. Simpson was instrumental in the establishment of Fort Vancouver. Using the HBC position that any settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute would confirm the border placement along the Columbia; Simpson selected a location situated opposite from the mouth of the Willamette River. This expanse was an open and fertile prairie that was outside the flood plain and had easy access to the Columbia. The modern reconstruction, showing the outer palisade and the single corner tower Fort=Description= An employee of the HBC, wrote a general description of Fort Vancouver and its structural composition as it was in 1843: > The fort is in the shape of a parallelogram, about 250 yards long, by 150 > broad; enclose by a sort of wooden wall, made of pickets, or large beams > firmly fixed in the ground, and closely fitted together, twenty feet high, > and strong secured on the inside by buttressess. At each angle there is a > bastion, mounting two twelve pounders, and in the centre there some eighteen > pounders; ... these cannon have become useless. The area within is divided > into two courts, around which are arranged about forty neat, strong wooden > buildings, one story high, designed for various purposes... The fort was substantial. The palisades that protected it were long, wide and about high. Inside, there were 24 buildings, including housing, warehouses, a school, a library, a pharmacy, a chapel, a blacksmith, plus a large manufacturing facility. The Chief Factor's residence in the center of Fort Vancouver was two stories tall. Inside was a dining hall where company clerks, traders, physicians, and others of the gentleman class would dine with the supervising Chief Factor. In general, the entirety of the Chief Factor's House and its meals were typically barred for general laborers and fur trappers. After dinner the majority of these gentlemen would relocate to the \\"Bachelor's Hall\\" to \\"amuse themselves as they please, either in smoking, reading, or telling and listening to stories of their own and others' curious adventures.\\" As Dunn recalled; > The smoking room ... presents the appearance of an armory and a museum. All > sorts of weapons, and dresses, and curiosities of civilized and savage life, > and of the various implements for the prosecution of the [fur] trade, may be > seen there. Outside the ramparts there was additional housing, as well as fields, gardens, fruit orchards, a shipyard, a distillery, a tannery, a sawmill, and a dairy. By 1843, situated roughly 600 yards outside Fort Vancouver were about sixty wooden houses. This small settlement was inhabited by fur trappers, machinists and other laborers of the fort. There they resided with their Indigenous or M√©tis wives and families. The dwellings were organized into orderly rows. The settlement was commonly referred to as Kanaka Village because of the many Hawaiians in company employ who lived there. In fact, it's been suggested that the Fort had the \\"largest single group of Hawaiians ever to congregate outside their home islands.\\" =Fur trade operations= With high demand from Europe for fur-based textiles in the early 19th Century, the Hudson's Bay Company was forced to expand its fur trade operations across North America to the Pacific Northwest. Prior to the establishment of Fort Vancouver, the Hudson's Bay Company's largest westward fort was Fort William in present-day Ontario, which the company gained through its merger with the North West Company. From its establishment, Fort Vancouver was the regional headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trade operations in the Columbia District. The territory it oversaw stretched from the Rocky Mountains in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and from Sitka in the north to San Francisco in the south. Fur trappers would bring pelts collected during the winter to the fort to be traded in exchange for company credit. The credit, issued by the company clerks, could be used to purchase goods in the fort's trade shops. Furs from throughout the Columbia District were brought to Fort Vancouver from smaller Hudson's Bay Company outposts either overland, or by water via the Columbia River. Once they were sorted and inventoried by the Company's clerks, the furs were hung out to dry in the fur storehouse, a large two-story post-on-sill building located within the walls of the fort. After the furs had been processed, they were mixed, weighed into bundles, and packed with tobacco leaves as an insecticide. The 270-pound bundle of furs would be placed in a large press and wrapped in elk or bear hide to create overseas fur bales. The large 270-pound bales were then placed on boats on the Columbia River for shipment to London via the Hudson's Bay Company trade routes. The furs would then be auctioned off to textile manufacturers in London. A large demand came from hatters who produced popular beaver felted hats. =Personnel= For most of its existence, Fort Vancouver was the largest non-indigenous settlement in the Pacific Northwest. The population of the fort and the environs was mostly French-Canadians, M√©tis and Kanaka Hawaiians; there were also English, Scots, Irish, and a variety of Indigenous peoples including Iroquois and Cree. The common language spoken at the fort was Canadian French, while company records and official journals were kept in English. However, trading and relations with the surrounding community were done in Chinook Jargon, a pidgin of Chinook, Nootka, Chehalis, English, French, Hawaiian and other elements. A survey of the total personnel at Fort Vancouver in 1846 reveals a culturally and materially diverse populace. Notably, the number of employees from the Hebrides, the Orkney and Shetland Islands was 57 men. This is exactly the same number as the combined number of workers from England and mainland Scotland. The number of men hired from Upper Canada, Lower Canada and Rupert's Land was in total 91. These men came from English, French-Canadian, M√©tis, Iroquois, Cree and other cultural backgrounds. Most notable however, was that Kanaka Hawaiians totaled 154 that year, or 43% of the total fort population. Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin was its first manager, a position he held for nearly 22 years, from 1824 to 1845. McLoughlin applied the laws of Upper Canada to British subjects, kept peace with the natives and sought to maintain law and order with American settlers as well. McLoughlin was later hailed as the Father of Oregon for allowing Americans to settle south of the Columbia River. Against the Company's wishes, he provided substantial aid and assistance to westbound American settlers in the territory. He left the company in 1846 to found Oregon City in the Willamette Valley. James Douglas spent nineteen years in Fort Vancouver; serving as a clerk until 1834 when he was promoted to the rank of Chief Trader. From October 1838 to November 1839, while McLoughlin was on furlough in Europe, Chief Trader Douglas was in charge. In November 1839 Douglas was promoted to the rank of Chief Factor. Douglas took on several temporary assignments elsewhere, to set up HBC's trading post at Yerba Buena (San Francisco) California in 1841, and to establish Fort Victoria in 1843, but from 1839 to 1845 there were normally two Chief Factors based at Fort Vancouver, with McLoughlin in charge and Douglas as his subordinate. =Agricultural production= At its inception, Governor George Simpson wanted the fort to be self-sufficient as food was costly to ship. Fort staff typically maintained one year's extra supplies in the fort warehouses to avoid the disastrous consequences of shipwrecks and other calamities. Fort Vancouver eventually began to produce a surplus of food, some of which was used to provision other HBC posts in the Columbia Department. The area around the fort was commonly known as \\"La Jolie Prairie\\" (the pretty prairie) or \\"Belle Vue Point\\" (beautiful vista). In time, Fort Vancouver would diversify its economic activities beyond fur trading and begin exporting agricultural foodstuffs from HBC farms, along with salmon, lumber, and other products. It developed markets for these exports in Russian America, the Kingdom of Hawaii, and Mexican California. The HBC opened agencies in Sitka, Honolulu, and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) to facilitate such trade. Map of the Pacific Northwest \\"jointly occupied\\" by the US and Britain. The influence of Fort Vancouver and its secondary stations extended from Russian America to Mexican ruled Alta California. Route of the HBC York Factory Express, 1820s to 1840s. Modern political boundaries shown. Express Fort Vancouver was supplied in part through the overland York Factory Express. It originated from a route used by the NWC between Fort George to Fort William on Lake Superior. Each spring two brigades were sent, one from Fort Vancouver and the other from York Factory. A typical brigade consisted of about forty to seventy five men. These men carried supplies, furs and correspondence by boat, horseback and in backpacks for various HBC posts and personnel along the route. Furs stored at the York Factory would in turn be sold at London in an annual fur sale. Indians along the way were often paid in trade goods to help them portage around falls and unnavigable rapids. Americans The Hudson's Bay Company, which controlled the fur trade in much of what Americans styled the Oregon Country, had previously discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. By 1838, however, American settlers were coming across the Rocky Mountains and their numbers increased each subsequent year. Many left from St. Louis, Missouri and followed a fairly straight, but difficult, route called the Oregon Trail. For many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies before starting their homestead. During the Great Migration of 1843 an estimated 700 to 1,000 American settlers arrived via the Oregon Trail. British response The signing of the RAC-HBC Agreement with the Russian-American Company pushed the HBC into creating an agricultural subsidiary, the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company in 1840. Herds of sheep and cattle were purchased in Alta California and raised at Fort Nisqually. Agricultural products were sown and grown in abundance at Fort Cowlitz and exported with foodstuffs produced at Fort Vancouver to Russian America. Recruitment from retired HBC laborers residing in the Willamette Valley as agriculturalists, through the use of priests Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers, utterly failed to convince any farmer to leave for vicinity of the Cowlitz farms. While additional plans called for recruitment in Scotland, these too came to nothing. The only successful source of early colonists for the PSAC would come from the Red River colony. In November 1839 Sir George Simpson instructed Duncan Finlayson to begin promoting the PSAC to colonists. James Sinclair was later appointed by Finlayson to guide the settler families that signed the PSAC agreement to Fort Vancouver. They left Fort Garry (modern Winnipeg) in June 1841 with 121 people that consisted of 23 families. When they arrived at Fort Vancouver, they then numbered 21 families of 116 people. Fourteen of them were relocated to Fort Nisqually, while the remaining seven families were sent to Fort Cowlitz. Oregon Treaty Signed in 1846, the Oregon Treaty set the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border at the 49th parallel north, putting Fort Vancouver within American territory. Although the treaty ensured that the HBC could continue to operate and had free access to navigate the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and the Columbia River, company operations were effectively stifled by the treaty and became unprofitable and were soon closed down. Cots in the Douglas Quarters inside the Chief Factor's house Fort Vancouver in 1859 Restoration Because of its significance in United States history a plan was put together to preserve the location. Fort Vancouver was declared a U.S. National Monument on June 19, 1948, and redesignated as Fort Vancouver National Historic Site on June 30, 1961. This was taken a step further in 1996 when a 366-acre (1.48 km2) area around the fort, including Kanaka Village, the Columbia Barracks and the bank of the river, was established as the Vancouver National Historic Reserve maintained by the National Park Service. It is possible to tour the fort. Notable buildings of the restored Fort Vancouver include a bake house, where Hardtack baking techniques are shown, a Blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop and its collection of carpentry tools, and the kitchen, where daily meals were prepared.

The bacterial genus Bordetella is named after him. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity. Education and early life Bordet was born at Soignies, Belgium. He graduated as Doctor of Medicine from the Free University of Brussels in 1892 and began his work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1894, in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, who had just discovered phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells, an expression of cellular immunity. Career In 1895 Bordet made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific antibody is significantly enhanced in vivo by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as complement). Four years later, in 1899, he described a similar destructive process involving complement, \\"hemolysis\\", in which foreign red blood cells are ruptured or \\"lysed\\" following exposure to immune serum. In 1900, he left Paris to found the Pasteur Institute in Brussels but continued to work extensively on the mechanisms involved in the action of complement. These studies became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for syphilis (specifically, the development of the Wassermann test by August von Wassermann). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases. With Octave Gengou, he isolated Bordetella pertussis in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of whooping cough. He became Professor of Bacteriology at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in 1907. Jules Bordet's grave in Ixelles Cemetery Awards and honours In March 1916, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society and in 1930, delivered their Croonian Lecture. In this lecture, Bordet also concluded that bacteriophages, the bacteria-killing \\"invisible viruses\\" discovered by Felix d'Herelle did not exist and that bacteria destroyed themselves using a process of autolysis. This theory collapsed in 1941 with the publication by Ruska of the first electron microscope pictures of bacteriophages.Hausler, Thomas (2007) Viruses Vs.

The recorded production sound track is later combined with other elements, i.e. effects, music, narration, foley or re-recorded dialog by automatic dialogue replacement (ADR). Often, when taping on video, the sound recordist may record (single system) audio directly onto the camera rather than use a separate medium (double system), although a separate copy is often made, as it both provides an extra copy which may have more tracks and also may include other sound captured without the camera. The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound including the hiring of a boom operator and utility sound technician, planning the technical setup involving sound including both sound equipment and ancillary devices involved in syncing and time offsets, anticipating and discussing sound-related problems with the rest of the crew, and ordering and preparing the sound equipment to be used on the set.

It is named for Eugene Wigner and Bernard d'Espagnat who (as pointed out by Bell) both employed it in their popularizations of quantum mechanics. Given a set S with three subsets, J, K, and L, the following holds: * each member of S which is a member of J, but not of L :: is either a member of J, but neither of K, nor of L, :: or else is a member of J and of K, but not of L; * each member of J which is neither a member of K, nor of L, is therefore a member of J, but not of K; and * each member of J, which is a member of K, but not of L, is therefore a member of K, but not of L. The number of members of J which are not members of L is consequently less than, or at most equal to, the sum of the number of members of J which are not members of K, and the number of members of K which are not members of L; n(incl J) (excl L) ‚â§ n(incl J) (excl K) \\\\+ n(incl K) (excl L). If the ratios N of these numbers to the number n(incl S) of all members of set S can be evaluated, e.g. N(incl J) (excl L) = n(incl J) (excl L) / n(incl S), then the Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequality is obtained as: N(incl J) (excl L) ‚â§ N(incl J) (excl K) \\\\+ N(incl K) (excl L). Considering this particular form in which the Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequality is thereby expressed, and noting that the various non-negative ratios N satisfy # N(incl J) (incl K) \\\\+ N(incl J) (excl K) \\\\+ N(excl J) (incl K) \\\\+ N(excl J) (excl K) = 1, # N(incl J) (incl L) \\\\+ N(incl J) (excl L) \\\\+ N(excl J) (incl L) \\\\+ N(excl J) (excl L) = 1, and # N(incl K) (incl L) \\\\+ N(incl K) (excl L) \\\\+ N(excl K) (incl L) \\\\+ N(excl K) (excl L) = 1, it is probably worth mentioning that certain non-negative ratios are readily encountered, which are appropriately labelled by similarly related indices, and which do satisfy equations corresponding to 1., 2. and 3., but which nevertheless don't satisfy the Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequality. For instance: if three observers, A, B, and C, had each detected signals in one of two distinct own channels (e.g. as (hit A) vs. (miss A), (hit B) vs. (miss B), and (hit C) vs. (miss C), respectively), over several (at least pairwise defined) trials, then non- negative ratios N may be evaluated, appropriately labelled, and found to satisfy # N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(hit A) (miss B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B) = 1, # N(hit A) (hit C) \\\\+ N(hit A) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss C) = 1, and # N(hit B) (hit C) \\\\+ N(hit B) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss B) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss B) (miss C) = 1. However, if the pairwise orientation angles between these three observers are determined (following the inverse of a quantum-mechanical interpretation of Malus's law) from the measured ratios as : orientation angle( A, B ) = 1/2 arccos( N(hit A) (hit B) ‚Äì N(hit A) (miss B) ‚Äì N(miss A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B) ), : orientation angle( A, C ) = 1/2 arccos( N(hit A) (hit C) ‚Äì N(hit A) (miss C) ‚Äì N(miss A) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss C) ), : orientation angle( B, C ) = 1/2 arccos( N(hit B) (hit C) ‚Äì N(hit B) (miss C) ‚Äì N(miss B) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss B) (miss C) ), and if A's, B's, and C's channels are considered having been properly set up only if the constraints orientation angle( A, B ) = orientation angle( B, C ) = orientation angle( A, C )/2 < œÄ/4 had been found satisfied (as one may well require, to any accuracy; where the accuracy depends on the number of trials from which the orientation angle values were obtained), then necessarily (given sufficient accuracy) (cos( orientation angle( A, C ) ))¬≤ = : (N(hit A) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss C)) = (2 (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)) ‚Äì 1)2 > 0. Since 1 ‚â• (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)), therefore 1 ‚â• 2 (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)) ‚Äì 1, (2 (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)) ‚Äì 1) ‚â• (2 (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)) ‚Äì 1)2, (2 (N(hit A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss B)) ‚Äì 1) ‚â•(N(hit A) (hit C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (miss C)), (1 ‚Äì 2 (N(hit A) (miss B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit B))) ‚â• (1 ‚Äì (N(hit A) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit C))), (N(hit A) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit C)) ‚â• 2 (N(hit A) (miss B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit B)), (N(hit A) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit C)) ‚â• ::: (N(hit A) (miss B) \\\\+ N(miss A) (hit B)) + (N(hit B) (miss C) \\\\+ N(miss B) (hit C)), which is in (formal) contradiction to the Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequalities N(hit A) (miss C) ‚â§ N(hit A) (miss B) \\\\+ N(hit B) (miss C), or N(miss A) (hit C) ‚â§ N(miss A) (hit B) \\\\+ N(miss B) (hit C), or both. Accordingly, the ratios N obtained by A, B, and C, with the particular constraints on their setup in terms of values of orientation angles, cannot have been derived all at once, in one and the same set of trials together; otherwise they'd necessarily satisfy the Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequalities. Instead, they had to be derived in three distinct sets of trials, separately and pairwise by A and B, by A and C, and by B and C, respectively. The failure of certain measurements (such as the non-negative ratios in the example) to be obtained at once, together from one and the same set of trials, and thus their failure to satisfy Wigner‚Äìd'Espagnat inequalities, has been characterized as constituting disproof of Einstein's notion of local realism. Similar interdependencies between two particular measurements and the corresponding operators are the uncertainty relations as first expressed by Heisenberg for the interdependence between measurements of distance and of momentum, and as generalized by Edward Condon, Howard Percy Robertson, and Erwin Schr√∂dinger.

Chr√©tien's works, including Erec and Enide, Lancelot, Perceval and Yvain, represent some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in Yvain, has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Life Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes or at least intimately connected with it. Between 1160 and 1172 he served (perhaps as herald-at-arms, as Gaston Paris speculated) at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of King Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who married Count Henry I of Champagne in 1164. Later, he served the court of Philippe d'Alsace, Count of Flanders. Works Chr√©tien's works include five major poems in rhyming eight-syllable couplets. Four of these are complete: Erec and Enide (c. 1170); Clig√®s (c. 1176); Yvain, the Knight of the Lion; and Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, the latter two written simultaneously between 1177 and 1181. Yvain is generally considered Chr√©tien's most masterful work. Chr√©tien's final romance was Perceval, the Story of the Grail, written between 1181 and 1190, but left unfinished, though some scholars have disputed this. It is dedicated to Philip, Count of Flanders, to whom Chr√©tien may have been attached in his last years. He finished only 9,000 lines of the work, but four successors of varying talents added 54,000 additional lines in what are known as the Four Continuations.Grigsby, John L. (1991). \\"Continuations of Perceval\\". In Norris J. Lacy, The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, pp. 99‚Äì100. New York: Garland. . Similarly, the last thousand lines of Lancelot were written by Godefroi de Leigni, apparently by arrangement with Chr√©tien.Chr√©tien de Troyes, D.D.R. Owen (translator) (1988) Arthurian Romances, Tuttle Publishing, reprinted by Everyman's Library. In the case of Perceval, one continuer says the poet's death prevented him from completing the work; in the case of Lancelot, no reason is given. This has not stopped speculation that Chr√©tien did not approve of Lancelots adulterous subject (in which case he seems unlikely to have invented Lancelot). There are also several lesser works, not all of which can be securely ascribed to Chr√©tien. Philomela is the only one of his four poems based on Ovid's Metamorphoses that has survived. Two short- lyric chansons on the subject of love are also very likely his, but the attribution of the pious romance Guillaume d'Angleterre to him is now widely doubted. It has also been suggested that Chr√©tien might be the author of two short verse romances titled Le Chevalier √† l'√©p√©e and La Mule sans frein, but this theory has not found much support. Chr√©tien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to Clig√®s, where he also mentions his work about King Mark and Iseult. The latter is presumably related to the legend of Tristan and Iseult, though Tristan is not named. Chr√©tien's take on Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Clig√®s, Chr√©tien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive. Chr√©tien's works are written in vernacular Old French, although it is marked by traits of the regional Champenois dialect (which is still fairly similar to the \\"standard\\" French of Paris). Sources and influence The immediate and specific sources for his romances are uncertain, as Chr√©tien speaks in the vaguest way of the materials he used. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who play an important role in Chr√©tien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of B√©roul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. For his Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the influence of the story is clearly tied to the story of Saint Galgano (Galgano Guidotti) who died in 1180‚Äì1181 and was canonized in 1185: a knight struck by god's vision, planted his sword in the ground that immediately solidified (kept in Abbey San Galgano). However, Chr√©tien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chr√©tien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chr√©tien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chr√©tien's day.Cohen, Esther. The Crossroads of Justice: Law and Culture in Late Medieval France. Boston: Brill Publishing, 1992, 27 William Wistar Comfort praised de Troyes' \\"significance as a literary artist and as the founder of a precious literary tradition [which] distinguishes him from all other poets of the Latin races between the close of the Empire and the arrival of Dante.\\" Chr√©tien's writing was very popular, as evidenced by the high number of surviving copies of his romances and their many adaptations into other languages. Three of Middle High German literature's finest examples, Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and Hartmann von Aue's Erec and Iwein, were based on Perceval, Erec, and Yvain; the Three Welsh Romances associated with the Mabinogion (Peredur, son of Efrawg, Geraint and Enid, and Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain) are derived from the same trio. Especially in the case of Peredur, however, the connection between the Welsh romances and their source is probably not direct and has never been satisfactorily delineated. Chr√©tien also has the distinction of being the first writer to mention the Holy GrailLoomis 1991. (Perceval), Camelot (Lancelot), and the love affair between Queen Guinevere and Lancelot (Lancelot), subjects of household recognition even today. There is a specific Classical influence in Chr√©tien's romances, the likes of which (the Iliad, the Aeneid, the Metamorphoses) were \\"translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s\\".Uitti, Chr√©tien de Troyes Revisited Foster Guyer argues that specifically Yvain, the Knight of the Lion contains definite Ovidian influence: \\"Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year. Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid's Epistles he said: 'If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly back to you at will/Many and many a time I would come'.\\" Chr√©tien has been termed \\"the inventor of the modern novel\\". Karl Uitti argues: \\"With [Chr√©tien's work] a new era opens in the history of European story telling‚Ä¶ this poem reinvents the genre we call narrative romance; in some important respects it also initiates the vernacular novel.\\" A \\"story\\" could be anything from a single battle scene, to a prologue, to a minimally cohesive tale with little to no chronological layout. Uitti argues that Yvain is Chr√©tien's \\"most carefully contrived romance‚Ä¶ It has a beginning, a middle, and an end: we are in no doubt that Yvain's story is over.\\" This very method of having three definite parts, including the build in the middle leading to the climax of the story, is in large part why Chr√©tien is seen to be a writer of novels five centuries before novels, as we know them, existed.

It is also designated '. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about . Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body.

Satirical Cartoon, 1738, British Museum Robert Jenkins (1730s-40s in Llanelli, Wales ‚Äì fl.) was a Welsh master mariner, famous as the protagonist of the \\"Jenkins's ear\\" incident, which became a contributory cause of the War of Jenkins' Ear between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Spain in 1739. Returning home from a trading voyage in the West Indies in command of the brig HMS Rebecca in April 1731, Jenkins' ship was stopped and boarded by the Spanish guarda-costa or privateer La Isabela on suspicion of smuggling. According to some accounts, her commander, Juan de Le√≥n Fandi√±o, had Jenkins bound to a mast, then sliced off his left ear with his sword and allegedly told him to say to his King \\"the same will happen to him (the king) if caught doing the same\\". Another account, in the Pennsylvania Gazette for 7 October 1731, attributes the assault to the Spanish lieutenant Dorce, who \\"took hold of his left Ear, and with his Cutlass slit it down; and then another of the Spaniards took hold of it and tore it off, but gave him the Piece of his Ear again, bidding him carry it to his Majesty King George\\". On arriving in Britain on 11 June, Jenkins addressed his grievances to the king, and gave a deposition which was passed to the Duke of Newcastle in his capacity as Secretary of State for the Southern Department (as such responsible for the American colonies). In his deposition of 18 June 1731, Jenkins stated that the Spanish captain, \\"took hold of his left Ear and with his Cutlass slit it down, and then another of the Spaniards took hold of it and tore it off, but gave him the Piece of his Ear again.\\"Haga, Andrea K.

Leitch's \\"Greene\\" is possibly a typo, likely Duke of Newcastle's correspondence is to Benjamin Keene, Britain's ambassador in Madrid. This report was then forwarded to the Commander-in-chief in the West Indies, who then complained of Jenkins' treatment to the Governor of Havana. At the time the incident received little attention, but it was reported in The Gentleman's Magazine in June 1731:The Gentleman's Magazine, June 1731, Ship News this Month, Vol. 1, page 265; accessed 13 May 2010.Dictionary of National Biography, Jenkins, Robert, (London: 1930) Vol. X, p. 743; citing Gent. Mag. i. 265. There is no evidence corroborating the oft-repeated story that in spring 1738 Jenkins told his story with dramatic details before a committee of the House of Commons, producing his severed ear (pickled in a jar.) In any case, as a result from the petitions from West India merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted (257 \\"For\\" and 209 \\"Against\\") on 28 March to ask the King to seek redress from Spain.The Gentleman's Magazine, \\"Tuesday, 28 March\\", Vol. 8, March 1738, page 162; accessed 13 May 2010. By summer of 1739, all diplomatic efforts having been exhausted, King George II agreed, on 10 July, to direct the Admiralty Board to initiate maritime reprisals against Spain. The Gentleman's Magazine reported that on 20 July 1739 Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a squadron of warships departed Britain for the West Indies, and that on 21 July, \\"Notice was given by the Lords of the Admiralty, that in pursuance of his Majesty's Commission under the Great Seal, Letters of Marque or General Reprisals against the Ships, Goods and Subjects of the King of Spain, were ready to be issued.\\" However, the formal declaration of war against Spain was withheld until Saturday 23 October 1739 [O.S.].A Very Oddly Named WarThe Gentleman's Magazine, \\"Historical Chronicle: Saturday 23 October\\" Vol. 9, October 1739, page 551: accessed 13 May 2010. Jenkins was subsequently given the command of a ship in the British East India Company's service. In 1741 he was sent from Britain to Saint Helena to investigate charges of corruption brought against the acting governor, and from May 1741 until March 1742 he administered the affairs of the island. Thereafter he resumed his career at sea. He is said to have preserved his own vessel and three others under his care during an engagement with a pirate vessel. As for Juan de Le√≥n Fandi√±o, he was taken with his snow the San Juan Bautista (10 carriage guns, four of them 6 pounders, and 10 swivels) consisting of 80 crew, described as \\"Indians, negroes and mulattoes\\" by Captain (Sir) Thomas Frankland, of HMS Rose (20), on 4 June 1742. Frankland also recaptured three prizes taken by Fandi√±o. At the time The London Gazette wrote \\"Captain Frankland has sent him to England, and he is now in Custody at Portsmouth\\". After 19 months in captivity, Fandi√±o and his son were released by virtue of an agreement to exchange prisoners signed in Paris. They arrived in San Sebasti√°n on 19 January 1744 and proceeded to C√°diz with the object of returning to Havana. Fact versus fiction The confrontational nature of British politics in 1738 led many who were opposed to launching a naval war against Spain to doubt the truthfulness of Jenkins' story. No serious research was undertaken until the late 1880s when John Knox Laughton, the founder of the Navy Records Society, uncovered contemporary letters from Jamaica in September and October 1731 which substantiated Jenkin's account of his losing an ear to a Spanish Guarda Costa on 9 April 1731 (Old Style; 20 April New Style). Writing from on board at Port Royal, Jamaica on 12 October 1731 [O.S.] to the Admiralty in London, Rear-Admiral Charles Stewart confided, \\"I was a little surprised to hear of the usage Captain Jenkins met with off the Havana.\\" Earlier, on 12 September 1731, Rear-Admiral Stewart had written to the Governor of Havana to complain of the \\"violence and villainies\\" of a Guarda Costa commander named Fandino who, \\"about the 20th April last [N.S.] sailed out of your harbor in one of those Guarda Costas, and met a ship of this island bound for Britain; and after using the captain in a most barbarous inhuman manner, taking all his money, cutting off one of his ears, plundering him of those necessaries which were to carry the ship safe home...\\".\\"Jenkins's Ear\\", by John Knox Laughton, English Historical Review, 1889 vol. 4, pp. 741‚Äì749: accessed on 11 May 2010. Contained within the Admiralty records files with the 1731 correspondence from Jamaica was a List of British Merchant ships taken or plundered by the Spaniards compiled in 1737, listing 52 ships, among them, Rebecca, Robert Jenkins, Jamaica to London, boarded and plundered near the Havana, 9 April 1731.\\"Jenkins's Ear\\", by John Knox Laughton, English Historical Review], 1889 vol. 4, page 747; citing Home Office Records, Admiralty, No. 69 and 70.The Gentleman's Magazine, \\"Historical Chronicle: List of British Merchant Ships taken or plundered by the Spaniards since May 1728\\" Vol. 8, March 1738, pp. 163‚Äì64; accessed 13 May 2010. Shortly after Professor Laughton published his \\"Jenkins's Ear\\" research in the English Historical Review, a Royal Navy colleague wrote, on 26 October 1889, to inform the historian: \\"I have a curious book connected with the subject, published in London in 1739, entitled England's Triumph: or a complete History of the many signals victories gained by the Royal Navy & Merchant Ships of Great Britain, for the term of 40 years past over the insulting & haught Spaniards by Captain Charles Jenkins, who has too severely felt the effects of Spanish tyranny. On page 64 is an illustration representing A Spanish Guarda Costa boarding Capt. Jenkin's ship & cutting off his Ear.\\" The 1889 correspondent noted that the 1739 author was named Charles Jenkins, while Laughton's research had proved the real mariner was named Robert Jenkins.Publications of the Navy Records Society, Vol. 143 Letters and Papers of Professor Sir John Knox Laughton, 1830‚Äì1915, edited by Andrew Lambert (London: 2002) (pp.340) ; citation pp. 63‚Äì64, letter of Captain Charles Firth to Laughton. However, when Laughton subsequently examined the 1739 publication, he found it held little detail about Jenkins himself, and, in writing Robert Jenkins's entry for the Dictionary of National Biography he dismissed it as, \\"a catch-penny chapbook, in which no reference is made to Jenkins's case, except in a worthless frontispiece\\".

His work was especially popular in the 1980s, though his career seemed to get a second wind in the late 1990s. Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You was Durang's watershed play as it brought him to national prominence when it won him -- at the age of 32 -- the Obie Award for Best Playwright (1980). His play, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike won the Tony Award for Best Play in 2013. The production was directed by Nicholas Martin, and featured Sigourney Weaver, David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen, Billy Magnussen, Shalita Grant and Genevieve Angelson. He is co-director of the Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at Juilliard. Life Durang was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the son of Patricia Elizabeth, a secretary, and architect Francis Ferdinand Durang, Jr. He grew up in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. He attended Catholic schools as a child, including the Our Lady of Peace School in New Providence and Delbarton School in Morristown. He received a B.A. in English from Harvard and an M.F.A. in playwriting from Yale School of Drama. He lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with his husband, actor and playwright John Augustine; they have been together since 1986. They were legally married in 2014. Work His work often deals critically with issues of child abuse, Roman Catholic dogma, culture, and homosexuality. While Durang's use of parody and his criticism of many social institutions might appear overly cynical at times, he states: > ...when I say everyone is crazy that means it's a very bad day where the > amount of crazy people in the world has spread out to the entire universe > and it doesn't seem possible to cope with anything... I think we're all > neurotic. And I do think relationships are certainly difficult. Nonetheless, > those lines in the play do get a laugh, so there's something. It‚Äôs not as > despairing as it sounds, but I don't not believe it. His plays have been performed nationwide, including on Broadway and Off- Broadway. His works include those in the bibliography as well as a collection of one-act parodies meant to be performed in one evening entitled Durang/Durang that includes \\"Mrs. Sorken\\", \\"For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls\\" (a parody of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams), \\"A Stye of the Eye\\", \\"Nina in the Morning\\", \\"Wanda's Visit\\", and \\"Business Lunch at the Russian Tea Room\\". Together with Marsha Norman, Durang directed The Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at the Julliard School from 1984 to 2016, teaching playwrights Joshua Harmon and Noah Haidle, as well as Pulitzer-Prize winning David Lindsay-Abaire, who succeeded Durang as co-director. Durang has performed as an actor for both stage and screen. He first came to prominence in his Off-Broadway satirical review Das Lusitania Songspiel, which he performed with friend and fellow Yale alum Sigourney Weaver. Later he co- starred in one of his own plays as Matt in The Marriage of Bette and Boo, as well as Man in the original production of Laughing Wild. He is currently working on a new play, Turning Off The Morning News , being produced at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, NJ. =In film= Durang has denounced the Robert Altman 1987 film adaptation of Beyond Therapy, calling it \\"horrific.\\" He accused Altman of totally rewriting the script \\"so that all psychology is thrown out the window, and the characters dash around acting crazy but with literally no behavioral logic underneath.\\" Durang has appeared as an actor in the 1987 comedy The Secret of My Success, 1988's Mr. North, 1989's Penn & Teller Get Killed, 1992's HouseSitter and 1994's The Cowboy Way. He has also written a number of unproduced screenplays, including The Nun Who Shot Liberty Valance, The House of Husbands (which he co-authored with Wendy Wasserstein), and The Adventures of Lola. =On television= Wanda's Visit, one of the six one-acts in Durang/Durang was originally written for the PBS series Trying Times. Durang played the part of The Waiter in that production. Durang appeared as himself on the October 11, 1986 episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by his longtime friend Sigourney Weaver. In the episode, Durang and Weaver parodied the works of Bertolt Brecht.

Keane, first performed in 1965. It tells the story of the hardened Irish farmer \\"Bull\\" McCabe and his love for the land he rents. The play debuted at Dublin's Olympia Theatre in 1965, with Ray McAnally as \\"The Bull\\" and Eamon Keane as \\"The Bird\\" O'Donnell. The play was published in 1966 by Mercier Press. A new version with some changes was produced in 1987. A film adaptation was released in 1990, directed by Jim Sheridan with Richard Harris in the lead role. John B. Keane based the story on the 1959 murder of Moss Moore, a bachelor farmer living in Reamore, County Kerry. Dan Foley, a neighbour with whom Moore had a long-running dispute, was suspected of the murder, but the charges were denied by Foley's family.Fuil agus D√∫ch, Broadcast on TG4, 22 Mar 2007 at 10 p.m. GMT. Plot The Field is set in a small country village in southwest Ireland. Rugged individualist Bull McCabe has spent five hard years of labour cultivating a small plot of rented land, nurturing it from barren rock into a fertile field. When the owner of the field decides to auction it, he believes that he has a claim to the land. The McCabes intimidate most of the townspeople out of bidding in the auction, to the chagrin of auctioneer Mick Flanagan, but Galwayman William Dee arrives from England, where he has lived for many years, with a plan to cover the field with concrete and extract gravel from the adjacent river. An encounter between William and the McCabes ends in William's death and a cover-up. Characters * Thady \\"The Bull\\" McCabe - The play's main character and anti- hero, Bull is as strong as a cow - and just as powerful.

He won ten Obie Awards for writing and directing, the most won by any writer or director. He wrote 58 plays as well as several books of short stories, essays, and memoirs. Shepard received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play Buried Child and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pilot Chuck Yeager in the 1983 film The Right Stuff. He received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award as a master American dramatist in 2009. New York magazine described Shepard as \\"the greatest American playwright of his generation.\\" Shepard's plays are known for their bleak, poetic, surrealist elements, black comedy, and rootless characters living on the outskirts of American society. His style evolved from the absurdism of his early off-off-Broadway work to the realism of later plays like Buried Child and Curse of the Starving Class. Early life Shepard was born on November 5, 1943, in Fort Sheridan, Illinois. He was named Samuel Shepard Rogers III after his father, Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr., but was called Steve Rogers. Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr. (1917‚Äì1984)Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr., Sam Shepard's father was a teacher and farmer who served in the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber pilot during World War II. Shepard characterized his father as \\"a drinking man, a dedicated alcoholic\\". His mother, Jane Elaine (n√©e Schook; 1917‚Äì1994),Jane Elaine (Schook) Rogers (1917 - 1994), Sam Shepard's mother was a teacher and a native of Chicago. Shepard worked on a ranch as a teenager. After graduating from Duarte High School in Duarte, California, in 1961, he briefly studied animal husbandry at nearby Mt. San Antonio College. While at college, Shepard became enamored of Samuel Beckett, jazz, and abstract expressionism. He dropped out to join a touring repertory group, the Bishop's Company. Career=Writing= Shepard at age 21 Shepard moved to New York City in 1963 and found work as a busboy at the Village Gate nightclub. The following year, the Village Gate's head waiter, Ralph Cook, founded the experimental stage company Theater Genesis, housed at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery in the East Village. Two of Shepard's earliest one-act plays, \\"The Rock Garden\\" and \\"Cowboys\\", debuted at Theater Genesis in October 1964. It was around this time that Steve Rogers adopted the professional name Sam Shepard. In 1965, Shepard's one-act plays Dog and The Rocking Chair were produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. These were the first of many productions of Shepard's work at La MaMa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In 1967, Tom O'Horgan directed Shepard's Melodrama Play alongside Leonard Melfi's Times Square and Rochelle Owens' Futz at La MaMa. In 1969, Jeff Bleckner directed Shepard's science fiction play The Unseen Hand at La MaMa. The Unseen Hand would later influence Richard O'Brien's musical The Rocky Horror Show. Bleckner then directed The Unseen Hand alongside Forensic and the Navigators at the nearby Astor Place Theater in 1970. Shepard's play Shaved Splits was directed at La MaMa in 1970 by Bill Hart. Seth Allen directed Melodrama Play at La MaMa the following year. In 1981, Tony Barsha directed The Unseen Hand at La MaMa. The production then transferred to the Provincetown Playhouse and ran for over 100 performances. Syracuse Stage co- produced The Tooth of Crime at La MaMa in 1983. Also in 1983, the Overtone Theatre and New Writers at the Westside co-produced Shepard's plays Superstitions and The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill on the Eve of Killing His Wife at La MaMa. John Densmore performed in his own play Skins and Shepard and Joseph Chaikin's play Tongues, directed as a double bill by Tony Abatemarco, at La MaMa in 1984. Nicholas Swyrydenko directed a production of Geography of a Horse Dreamer at La MaMa in 1985. Several of Shepard's early plays, including Red Cross (1966) and La Turista (1967), were directed by Jacques Levy. A patron of the Chelsea Hotel scene, he also contributed to Kenneth Tynan's Oh! Calcutta! (1969) and drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with the psychedelic folk band The Holy Modal Rounders, appearing on their albums Indian War Whoop (1967) and The Moray Eels Eat The Holy Modal Rounders (1968). After winning six Obie Awards between 1966 and 1968, Shepard emerged as a screenwriter with Robert Frank's Me and My Brother (1968) and Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point (1970). Cowboy Mouth, a collaboration with his then-lover Patti Smith, was staged at The American Place Theatre in April 1971, providing early exposure for Smith, who became a well-known musician. The story and characters in Cowboy Mouth were loosely inspired by Shepard and Smith's relationship. After opening night, he abandoned the production and fled to New England without a word to anyone involved. Shortly thereafter, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to London. While in London, he immersed himself in the study of G. I. Gurdjieff's Fourth Way, a recurring preoccupation for much of his life. Returning to the United States in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, California, where he raised a young colt named Drum and rode double with his young son on an appaloosa named Cody. Shepard continued to write plays and served for a semester as Regents' Professor of Drama at the University of California, Davis. Shepard accompanied Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975 as the screenwriter for Renaldo and Clara that emerged from the tour. However, because much of the film was improvised, Shepard's work was seldom used. His diary of the tour, Rolling Thunder Logbook, was published in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute song \\"Brownsville Girl\\", included on Dylan's 1986 Knocked Out Loaded album and on later compilations. In 1975, Shepard was named playwright-in-residence at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, where he created many of his notable works, including his Family Trilogy. One of the plays in the trilogy, Buried Child (1978), won the Pulitzer Prize, and was nominated for five Tony Awards. This marked a major turning point in his career, heralding some of his best-known work, including True West (1980), Fool for Love (1983), and A Lie of the Mind (1985). A comic tale of reunion, in which a young man drops in on his grandfather's Illinois farmstead only to be greeted with indifference by his relations, Buried Child saw Shepard stake a claim to the psychological terrain of classic American theater. True West and Fool for Love were subsequently nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Some critics have expanded the trilogy to a quintet, including Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind. Shepard won a record-setting 10 Obie Awards for writing and directing between 1966 and 1984. In 2010, A Lie of the Mind was revived in New York at the same time as Shepard's new play Ages of the Moon opened there. Reflecting on the two plays, Shepard said that the older play felt \\"awkward\\", adding, \\"All of the characters are in a fractured place, broken into pieces, and the pieces don't really fit together,\\" while the newer play \\"is like a Porsche. It's sleek, it does exactly what you want it to do, and it can speed up but also shows off great brakes.\\" The revival and the new play also coincided with the publication of Shepard's collection Day out of Days: Stories. The book includes \\"short stories, poems and narrative sketches... that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks [Shepard] carried with him over the years.\\" =Acting= Shepard began his film acting career when cast in a major role as the doomed land baron in Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven (1978), opposite Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. This led to other important film roles, including that of Cal, Ellen Burstyn's character's love interest in Resurrection (1980), and, most notably, Shepard's portrayal of Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff (1983). The latter performance earned Shepard an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. By 1986, Fool for Love was adapted by Robert Altman with Shepard in the lead role; A Lie of the Mind was being performed Off-Broadway with an all-star cast (including Harvey Keitel and Geraldine Page); and Shepard was working steadily as a film actor. Together, these achievements put him on the cover of Newsweek. Over the years, Shepard taught extensively on playwriting and other aspects of theater. He gave classes and seminars at various theater workshops, festivals, and universities. Shepard was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986, and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 2000, Shepard demonstrated his gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging The Late Henry Moss as a benefit for the theatre, in San Francisco. The cast included Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, and Cheech Marin. The limited, three-month run was sold out. In 2001, Shepard played General William F. Garrison in the film Black Hawk Down. Although he was cast in a supporting role, Shepard enjoyed renewed interest in his talent for screen acting. Shepard performed Spalding Gray's final monologue, Life Interrupted, for the audiobook version, released in 2006. In 2007, Shepard contributed banjo to Patti Smith's cover of Nirvana's song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on her album Twelve. Although many artists had an influence on Shepard's work, one of the most significant was Joseph Chaikin, a veteran of The Living Theatre and founder of The Open Theater. The two worked together on various projects, and Shepard has stated that Chaikin was a valuable mentor. In 2011, Shepard starred in the film Blackthorn. His final film appearance is Never Here, which premiered in June 2017 but had been filmed in the fall of 2014. Shepard also appeared in the television series Bloodline between 2014‚Äì2017. =Directing= At the beginning of his career, Shepard did not direct his own plays. His early plays had a number of different directors, but were most frequently directed by Ralph Cook, the founder of Theatre Genesis. Later, while living at the Flying Y Ranch, Shepard formed a successful playwright-director relationship with Robert Woodruff, who directed the premiere of Buried Child (1982), among other plays. During the 1970s, Shepard decided that his vision for his plays required him to direct them himself. He directed many of his own plays from that point on. With only a few exceptions, he did not direct plays by other playwrights. He also directed two films, but reportedly did not see film directing as a major interest. Personal life When Shepard first arrived in New York City, he roomed with Charlie Mingus, Jr., a friend from high school and the son of jazz musician Charles Mingus. He then lived with actress Joyce Aaron. From 1969 to 1984, he was married to actress O-Lan Jones, with whom he had one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard (born 1970). From 1970 to 1971, Shepard was involved in an extramarital affair with musician Patti Smith, who remained unaware of Shepard's identity as a multiple Obie Award-winning playwright until it was divulged to her by Jackie Curtis. According to Smith, \\"Me and his wife still even liked each other. I mean, it wasn't like committing adultery in the suburbs or something.\\" Joni Mitchell wrote two songs about her affairs with Shepard during Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour of 1975. On Coyote she recounts Shepard's seduction of Mitchell at a period while he was both married and having an extramarital affair with the tour manager Christine O‚ÄôDell with the lines ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a woman at home, another woman down the hall, but he seems to want me anyway.‚Äù David Yaffe, Reckless Daughter - A Portrait of Joni Mitchell, p204, 2019, Sarah Crichton Books Shepard met Academy Award-winning actress Jessica Lange on the set of the 1982 film Frances, in which they were both acting. He moved in with her in 1983, and they were together for 27 years; they separated in 2009. They had two children, Hannah Jane Shepard (born 1986) and Samuel Walker Shepard (born 1987). In 2003, Shepard's elder son, Jesse, wrote a book of short stories, and Shepard appeared with him at a reading at City Lights Bookstore. In 2014 and 2015, Shepard dated actress Mia Kirshner.Sam Shepard and girlfriend Mia Kirshner shopping in Soho rexfeatures.com, 23 November 2014Sam Shepard with girlfriend Mia Kirshner out and about, New York rexfeatures.com, 30 March 2015 Despite having a longstanding aversion to flying, Shepard allowed Chuck Yeager to take him up in a jet plane in 1982, in preparation to play the pilot in the film The Right Stuff. Shepard cited his fear of flying as a source for a character in his 1966 play Icarus's Mother. He went through an airliner crash in the film Voyager, and apparently vowed never to fly again after a turbulent trip on an airliner returning from Mexico in the 1960s. In the early morning hours of January 3, 2009, Shepard was arrested and charged with speeding and drunk driving in Normal, Illinois. He pleaded guilty to both charges on February 11, 2009, and was sentenced to 24 months probation, alcohol education classes, and 100 hours of community service. On May 25, 2015, Shepard was arrested again, this time in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for aggravated drunk driving. Those charges were later dismissed as having no likelihood of success at trial. His 50-year friendship with Johnny Dark, stepfather to O-Lan Jones, was the subject of the 2013 documentary Shepard & Dark by Treva Wurmfeld. A collection of Shepard and Dark's correspondence, Two Prospectors, was also published that year. Death Shepard died on July 27, 2017, at his home in Kentucky, aged 73, from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. psychological thriller film starring Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen. It was adapted by James R. Webb from the 1957 novel The Executioners by John D. MacDonald. It was directed by J. Lee Thompson and released on April 12, 1962. The film concerns an attorney whose family is stalked by a criminal he helped to send to jail. Cape Fear was remade in 1991 by Martin Scorsese. Peck, Mitchum, and Martin Balsam all appeared in the remake. Plot In Southeast Georgia in 1962, after spending eight years in prison for rape, Max Cady is released. He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden, a lawyer whom he holds personally responsible for his conviction because Sam interrupted his attack and testified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden's family. He kills the Bowden family dog, though Sam cannot prove Cady did it. A friend of Bowden, Police Chief Mark Dutton, attempts to intervene on Bowden's behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime. Bowden hires private detective Charlie Sievers. Cady brutally rapes a young woman, Diane Taylor, when he brings her home, but neither the private eye nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. Bowden hires three men to beat up Cady and coerce him to leave town, but the plan backfires when Cady gets the better of all three. Cady's lawyer vows to have Bowden disbarred. Afraid for his wife Peggy and 14-year-old daughter Nancy, Bowden takes them to their houseboat in the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. In an attempt to trick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to Atlanta. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and he plans on killing Cady to end the battle. On a dark night, Bowden and local deputy Kersek hide in the swamp nearby, but Cady realizes that Kersek is there and drowns him, leaving no evidence of a struggle. Eluding Bowden and setting the houseboat adrift down current, Cady first attacks Mrs. Bowden on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her rescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack Nancy. Bowden realizes what has happened, and also swims ashore. The two men engage in a final fight on the riverbank. Bowden manages to reach his gun, which he had dropped, and shoots Cady, wounding and disabling him. Cady tells Bowden, \\"Finish the job,\\" but Bowden decides to do the thing that Cady earlier told him would be unbearableput him in prison for the rest of his life, to \\"count the years, the months, the hours.\\" In the morning light, the Bowden family are together on a boat, traveling with police back to port. Cast * Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden * Robert Mitchum as Max Cady * Polly Bergen as Peggy Bowden * Lori Martin as Nancy Bowden * Martin Balsam as Mark Dutton * Jack Kruschen as Dave Grafton * Telly Savalas as Charlie Sievers * Barrie Chase as Diane Taylor In addition, Edward Platt, the future \\"Chief\\" on the television series Get Smart, and November 1958 Playboy Playmate centerfold Joan Staley make brief appearances as a judge and a waitress, respectively. Development Gregory Peck had his own production company, Melville Productions, in partnership with Sy Bartlett, which had made The Big Country and Pork Chop Hill. They purchased the rights to John D. MacDonald's novel The Executioners. They planned to make it after The Guns of Navarone. Peck was impressed by J. Lee Thompson's work on that film and hired him for Cape Fear.PECK'S FILM FIRM PLANS 3 PROJECTS: Star and Sy Bartlett List 2 Comedies and Drama -- 'Apartment' Here Today By HOWARD THOMPSON. New York Times 15 June 1960: 50. Peck said his goal was to make \\"first class professional entertainment intelligently done.\\"Peck Wants to Make Film Classic: PECK FILM Hyams, Joe. Los Angeles Times 15 Apr 1961: A6. =Casting= Rod Steiger wanted to play Max Cady, but he backed off when he heard Mitchum was considering the role.

Lee Thompson Manchester University Press, 2000 Thompson wanted Hayley Mills, who he had cast in Tiger Bay, to play the daughter, but Mills was working on a Disney movie. Polly Bergen signed in December 1960. It was her first film in eight years.GABLE'S LAST FILM SLATED HERE FEB.1: 'Misfits' Is Due at Capitol -- 3 Other Premieres Set -- Hudson, Doris Day Cited By HOWARD THOMPSON. New York Times 31 Dec 1960: 10. Filming Thompson had always envisioned the film in black and white prior to production. As an Alfred Hitchcock fan, he wanted to have Hitchcockian elements in the film, such as unusual lighting angles, an eerie musical score, closeups, and subtle hints rather than graphic depictions of the violence Cady has in mind for the family. The outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Savannah, Georgia; Stockton, California; and the Universal Studios backlot at Universal City, California. The indoor scenes were done at Universal Studios Soundstage. Mitchum had a real-life aversion to Savannah, where as a teenager, he had been charged with vagrancy and put on a chain gang. This resulted in a number of the outdoor scenes being shot at Ladd's Marina in Stockton, including the culminating conflict on the houseboat at the end of the movie. This scene where Mitchum attacks Polly Bergen's character on the houseboat was almost completely improvised. Before the scene was filmed, Thompson suddenly told a crew member: \\"Bring me a dish of eggs!\\" Mitchum's rubbing the eggs on Bergen was not scripted and Bergen's reactions were real. She also suffered back injuries from being knocked around so much. She felt the impact of the \\"attack\\" for days. While filming the scene, Mitchum cut open his hand, leading Bergen to recall: \\"his hand was covered in blood, my back was covered in blood. We just kept going, caught up in the scene. They came over and physically stopped us.\\" In the source novel The Executioners, by John D. MacDonald, Cady was a soldier court-martialed and convicted on then Lieutenant Bowden's testimony for the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl. The censors stepped in, banned the use of the word \\"rape\\", and stated that depicting Cady as a soldier reflected adversely on U.S. military personnel. =Music= Bernard Herrmann, as often in his scores, uses a reduced version of the symphony orchestra. Here, other than a 46-piece string section (slightly larger than usual for film scores), he adds four flutes (doubling on two piccolos, two alto flutes in G, and two bass flutes in C) and eight French horns. No use is made of further wind instruments or percussion.Bill Wrobel: Cape Fear, score rundown analysis In his 2002 book A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann, Stephen C. Smith writes: > \\"Yet Herrmann was perfect for Cape Fear ... Herrmann's score reinforces Cape > Fear's savagery.

It was later re-released on VHS, as well as DVD, on September 18, 2001. The film was released onto Blu-ray on January 8, 2013. It contains production photos and a \\"making-of\\" featurette. Reaction=Critical response= Upon its release, the film received positive but cautious feedback from critics due to the film's content. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of 19 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.8 out of 10. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the \\"tough, tight script\\", as well as the film's \\"steady and starkly sinister style.\\" He went on to conclude his review by saying, \\"this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret.\\" The entertainment-trade magazine Variety reviewed the film as \\"competent and visually polished\\", while commenting on Mitchum's performance as a \\"menacing omnipresence.\\" =Legacy= Although it makes no acknowledgement of Cape Fear, the episode \\"The Force of Evil\\" from the 1977 NBC television series Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected uses virtually the same plot, merely introducing an additional supernatural element to the released prisoner.John Kenneth Muir's Reflections on Cult Movies and Classic TV: CULT TV FLASHBACK # 54: Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected (1977)Muir, John Kenneth, Terror Television: American Series 1970-1999, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc., 2001. .

The film and its remake serve as the basis for the 1993 The Simpsons episode \\"Cape Feare\\" in which Sideshow Bob, recently released from prison, stalks the Simpson family in an attempt to kill Bart. In April 2007, Newsweek selected Cady as one of the 10 best villains in cinema history. Specifically, the scene where Cady attacks Sam's family was ranked number 36 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments in 2004. A consumer poll on the Internet Movie Database rates Cape Fear as the 65th-best trial film, although the trial scenes are merely incidental to the plot.\\"Best trial movies\\" at Internet Movie Database.

Slick Rick rose to prominence with Doug E. Fresh & the Get Fresh Crew in the mid-1980s. Their songs \\"The Show\\" and \\"La Di Da Di\\" are considered early hip hop classics. \\"La Di Da Di\\" is one of the most sampled songs in history. In 1986, Slick Rick became the third artist signed to Def Jam Records. He has released four albums: The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988), The Ruler's Back (1991), Behind Bars (1994) and The Art of Storytelling (1999). His music has been sampled and interpolated over 1,000 times, in dozens of songs by artists, including Eminem, Beyonc√©, Mariah Carey, the Beastie Boys, TLC, Nas, Miley Cyrus, Kanye West, Black Star, The Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, MC Ren, Montell Jordan and Color Me Badd. In the process, Slick Rick has become one of the most-sampled hip-hop artists ever. Many of these songs based on Slick Rick samples went on to become hit singles. Slick Rick has been a VH-1 Hip Hop Honors honoree, and About.com ranked him 12 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time, while The Source ranked him No. 15 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.\\"The Source's Top 50 Lyricists Of All Time ,\\" Thisis50.com, July 7, 2012. He has acted and cameo-ed in 10 movies and videos. Early life Walters was born in the southwest London district of Mitcham to Jamaican parents. He was blinded in the right eye by broken glass as an infant. In 1976, he and his family migrated to the United States, settling in the Baychester area of the Bronx.David Gonzalez, \\"At 50, a Hip-Hop Pioneer Still Has Stories to Tell,\\" The New York Times, February 8, 2015. At Fiorello H. Laguardia High School of Music & Art, where he majored in visual art, Rick met Dana Dane. The pair became close friends and formed the Kangol Crew, performing in school contests, parks, and small local clubs. At a 1984 talent showcase he entered, Rick met Doug E. Fresh. Impressed by Rick's talent, Doug made him a member of his Get Fresh Crew (which also included DJs Chill Will and Barry Bee). Doug's beatbox and Rick's fresh flow turned \\"The Show\\"/\\"La Di Da Di\\" into international anthems that turned rap music on its head and became the launching pad for \\"Hip Hop's greatest storyteller.\\"  Career =Initial fame= His career began in 1985; Walters first gained success in the rap industry after joining Doug E. Fresh's Get Fresh Crew, using the stage name MC Ricky D. He was featured on the single \\"The Show\\" and its even more popular B-side, \\"La Di Da Di\\", which featured Walters' rapping over Doug E. Fresh's beatbox. Both tracks gained some mainstream attention, they appeared on Top of the Pops and Soul Train with the Get Fresh Crew. Reflecting on the double-sided gem in Rolling Stone magazine, Roots drummer and Tonight Show bandleader Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson said, \\"Point blank: Slick Rick's voice was the most beautiful thing to happen to hip-hop culture [...] Rick is full of punchlines, wit, melody, cool cadence, confidence and style. He is the blueprint.\\" In 1986, Slick Rick joined Russell Simmons' Rush Artist Management and became the third artist signed to Def Jam Records, the leading rap/hip-hop label at the time. Collaborating with his friend, DJ Vance Wright, Walters produced his solo debut, The Great Adventures of Slick Rick, which came out in 1988 on Def Jam. The album was very successful, reaching the No. 1 spot on Billboards R&B;/Hip-Hop chart. It also featured three charting singles: \\"Children's Story\\", \\"Hey Young World\\", and \\"Teenage Love\\". The release is known for its storytelling and vocal characterizations. \\"With the combination of Rick's Dick Van Dyke-on-dope accent and his unique narrative style, the record was an instant classic,\\" wrote critic Matt Weiner. \\"Each of Rick's songs was an amusing, enthralling story that lasted from the first groove to the last.\\" =Incarceration and subsequent albums= In 1989, Walters' mother, Veronica, hired his first cousin, Mark Plummer, as his bodyguard. By 1990, Plummer had become a liability, having tried numerous times to extort money from the artist. Plummer was fired and, unsatisfied with his severance package, tried to rob Walters on numerous occasions and also threatened to kill the rapper and his mother. When Walters found bullet holes in his front door, he bought guns for protection. On July 3, 1990, Walters spotted Plummer in his neighborhood, and fired at least four shots. One bullet hit Plummer; another caught a passerby in the foot. Neither suffered life-threatening injuries. He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder and other charges, including assault, use of a firearm, and criminal possession of a weapon. The rapper called it an act of self-defense. He spent five years in prison, two for the then-second-degree attempted-murder charges he received for the shooting, and three for his struggle with the Immigration and Naturalization Services over his residency in the U.S. He was released from prison in 1997.Sewell Chan, \\"Governor Pardons Hip-Hop Pioneer,\\" The New York Times, May 23, 2008. After being bailed out by Russell Simmons, Walters recorded his second album, The Ruler's Back, released in 1991. Despite peaking at No. 29 on the Billboard 100, the album received mixed reviews and wasn't as commercially successful as his debut. In the documentary film, The Show, Russell Simmons interviewed Walters while he was imprisoned on Rikers Island. Walters' third studio album (the fourth for Def Jam) Behind Bars was released in 1994, while he was still incarcerated. It was met with lukewarm sales and reviews. Behind Bars peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and No. 51 on the Billboard 200. Slick Rick, New York City, 1997 Walters remained with the Def Jam label, and on May 25, 1999, released a fourth album, The Art of Storytelling. Generally considered the authentic follow-up to his 1988 debut, The Art of Storytelling was an artistically successful comeback-album that paired him with prolific MCs like Nas, OutKast, Raekwon, and Snoop Dogg. The Los Angeles Times announced it as the \\"triumphant return of rap's premier yarn-spinner,\\" calling the song \\"2 Way Street\\" \\"a much-needed alternative to rap's misogynistic slant.\\" It charted higher than any of Slick Rick's prior releases: No. 8 on the Billboard 200; No. 1 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After performing on a Caribbean cruise ship in June 2001, Walters was arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as he re-entered the United States through Florida. He was promptly told that he was being deported under a law allowing deportation of foreigners convicted of felonies. Rick was continuously refused bail, but after 17 months in prison he was released on November 7, 2003. In October 2006, the Department of Homeland Security began a new attempt to deport Walters back to the United Kingdom, moving the case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit based in New York to the more conservative Eleventh Circuit. The court is based in Atlanta, Georgia but the trial was expected to proceed in Florida, where immigration agents originally arrested Walters. On May 23, 2008, New York Governor David Paterson granted Slick Rick a full and unconditional pardon on the attempted murder charges. The governor was pleased with his behavior since the attempted murders. Slick Rick has volunteered his time to mentor kids about violence. =Later career and life= Walters married his wife Mandy Aragones in April 1997, four years after the couple met at a Manhattan nightclub. The performer has two children, Ricky Martin Lloyd Santiago and Lateisha Walters, from a previous relationship. He and his wife have donated about a dozen items from his collection to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Slick Rick and the Soul Rebels Brass Band collaborated on June 21, 2012 in Washington, D.C. at the historic Howard Theatre which re-opened in April 2012. In 2014, Rick participated in Will.i.am's \\"Trans4M\\" concert, which raised more than $2.4 million for the music producer's i.am.angel Foundation. In addition, Rick recently was a Mixx Cares Humanitarian Award recipient. On April 15, 2016, Rick was granted U.S. citizenship, remarking, \\"I am so proud of this moment‚Äîand so honored to finally become an American citizen.\\" He will also retain his UK citizenship. On November 2, 2018, Rick released the single \\"Snakes Of The World Today\\". In 2020, Rick features on Westside Gunn's album Who Made the Sunshine. Honors On October 6, 2008, Rick was honored on the VH1 Hip Hop Honors show. Rapping style Slick Rick's style is commended by music critics. Music journalist Peter Shapiro wrote, \\" 'Children's Story' was important because of its narrative structure and Rick's understanding of how crucial little sonic details‚Äîsuch as his use of a female voice and his yawning rap‚Äîwere to hip hop style.\\"Shapiro, Peter. The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, 2005, p.336. He is largely known for his story raps, such as \\"Children's Story\\" and \\"La Di Da Di\\". Shapiro writes that he \\"largely introduced the art of narrative into hip hop... none of the spinners of picaresque rhymes who followed did it with the same grace or humor.\\"Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 337. AllMusic states that he has the \\"reputation as hip hop's greatest storyteller.\\" In the book Check the Technique, Slick Rick says, \\"I was never the type to say freestyle raps, I usually tell a story, and to do that well I've always had to work things out beforehand.\\"Coleman, Brian. Check The Technique: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 319. Kool Moe Dee comments, \\"Slick Rick raised the lost art of hip hop storytelling to a level never seen again.\\"Kool Moe Dee. There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2003, p.63.

How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 39. and Peter Shapiro says that \\"he was funnier than Rudy Ray Moore or Redd Foxx.\\" Slick Rick uses very clear enunciation and retains some English pronunciations, which led Shapiro to say that he raps in the \\"Queen's English\\". O.C. states: \\"The Great Adventures of Slick Rick is one of the greatest albums ever... the stuff he was just saying on there, it was so clear.. the [clear] syllable dude was Slick Rick for me\\".Edwards, Paul, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 244. He is also renowned for his unique \\"smooth, British-tinged flow\\" which contains distinct structures. In the book How to Rap, it is noted that on the song \\"I Own America\\", he \\"puts a rest on almost every other 1-beat so that each set of two lines begins with a rest.\\"Edwards, Paul, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 129.

There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2003, p.64.

He was the first practicing Latter-day Saint to be tenured in Religion at a non- Mormon institution (Lycoming College). Robinson and Craig Blomberg, an Evangelical New Testament scholar at the Denver Seminary, co-authored an important book on LDS/Evangelical relations entitled How Wide the Divide? (1997), which in turn led to an ongoing series of friendly and objective exchanges between LDS and traditional Christian scholars. Robinson died June 17, 2018.http://www.bergmortuary.com/obituaries/Stephen-Robinson-5/#!/Obituary  Controversy  In LDS circles, Robinson is generally considered to be orthodox and to have a reliable grasp of LDS doctrine. He came to the center of a conflict between the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) and Salt Lake City publisher Signature Books, through his critical review of the writing of Dan Vogel, by describing it as being patterned after the teachings of Korihor, an atheist orator in the Book of Mormon (). According to Daniel C. Peterson, then editor of the FARMS Review, FARMS tried to quiet down the counter-attack by Signature Books by emphasizing that Robinson's review was directed at the methodology of the writings and not the beliefs or character of the authors reviewed. ‚Äî Peterson's description of the controversy Bibliography ;Books   * ;Other writings  References External links  * Category:1947 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American historians of religion Category:American male non- fiction writers Category:American Latter Day Saint writers Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Brigham Young University faculty Category:Duke Divinity School alumni Category:Historians of the Latter Day Saint movement Category:Lycoming College faculty Category:Mormon apologists Category:Latter Day Saints from Utah Category:Latter Day Saints from North Carolina Category:Latter Day Saints from Pennsylvania Category:Latter Day Saint biblical scholars ","title":"Stephen E. Robinson"},{"id":"171045","text":"Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success in middle age. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor. His films have grossed over $14.4 billion worldwide, making Downey the sixth- highest-grossing box office star of all-time. At the age of five, he made his acting debut in Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less Than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award; however in the wake of two drug charges, one in late 2000 and one in early 2001, he was fired and his character terminated. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program shortly after and has maintained his sobriety since 2003. Initially, bond completion companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective. He subsequently went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); for the latter he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark / Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel (2011). Early life and family Downey was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., is an actor and filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (n√©e Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films. Downey's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one-quarter Irish descent, while Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss ancestry.Stated on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr., PBS, April 22, 2012 Robert's original family name was Elias which was changed by his father to enlist in the Army. Downey and his older sister Allyson grew up in Greenwich Village. As a child, Downey was \\"surrounded by drugs.\\" His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father later said he regretted. Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: \\"When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how.\\" Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and \\"making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs.\\" During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Western Greaser's Palace (1972). At the age of 10, he was living in England and studied classical ballet as part of a larger curriculum. He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School, and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time. Downey and Kiefer Sutherland, who shared the screen in the 1988 drama 1969, were roommates for three years when he first moved to Hollywood to pursue his career in acting. Career=1983‚Äì1995: Beginnings and critical acclaim= Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical American Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live, but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced. Rolling Stone magazine named Downey the worst SNL cast member in its entire run, stating that the \\"Downey Fail sums up everything that makes SNL great.\\" That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's character's sidekick in Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes's Weird Science. He was considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes's film Pretty in Pink (1986), but his first lead role was with Molly Ringwald in The Pick-up Artist (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack. In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero. His performance, described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as \\"desperately moving\\", was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him \\"the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future\\" since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an \\"exaggeration of the character\\" in real life. Zero drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline, and Whoopi Goldberg. In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to help him imitate Chaplin's posture, and a way of carrying himself. The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. In 1993, he appeared in the films Heart and Souls with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and Short Cuts with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled The Last Party (1993). He starred in the 1994 films, Only You with Marisa Tomei, and Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson. He then subsequently appeared in Restoration (1995), Richard III (1995), Two Girls and a Guy (1997), as Special Agent John Royce in U.S. Marshals (1998), and in Black and White (1999). =1996‚Äì2001: Career troubles= Downey at the premiere of Air America, 1990 From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested numerous times on charges related to drugs including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana and went through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: \\"It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal.\\" He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, due to the fact that his father, also an addict previously, had been giving them to him. In April 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he trespassed into a neighbor's home while under the influence of a controlled substance, and fell asleep in one of the beds. He received three years of probation and was ordered to undergo compulsory drug testing. In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests, and had to spend six months in the Los Angeles County jail. After Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested once more. Despite Downey's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, assembling the same team of lawyers that successfully defended O.J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California. At the time of the 1999 arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release. He had also been hired to provide the voice of the devil on the NBC animated television series God, the Devil and Bob, but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals. After spending nearly a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Downey, on condition of posting a $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (spawned from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release. A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart's title character. His performance was praised and the following year he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a mini-series or television film. He also appeared as a writer and singer on Vonda Shepard's Ally McBeal: For Once in My Life album, and he sang with Sting a duet of \\"Every Breath You Take\\" in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claimed that his performance on the series was overrated and said, \\"It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again.\\" In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson. Before the end of his first season on Ally McBeal, over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California was searched by the police, who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium. Despite the fact that, if convicted, he would have faced a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes. In April 2001, while he was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefooted in Culver City. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and fired Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration prompted Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and received three years of probation, benefiting from California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail. The book Conversations with Woody Allen reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005, but was unable to do so, because he could not get insurance on them, stating, \\"We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on Celebrity] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent.\\" In a December 18, 2000 article for People magazine entitled \\"Bad to Worse\\", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski, that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder \\"a few years ago\\" and added that his bipolar disorder was \\"the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy\\". In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth, claimed she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that \\"no one had done a complete [psychiatric] evaluation [on him] ... I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'\\" In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey stated that he wanted to address \\"this whole thing about the bipolar\\" after receiving a phone call from \\"the Bipolar Association\\" asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, \\"'No! Dr. Malibusian said [I said I was bipolar] ... ', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'\\" Downey flatly denied being \\"depressed or manic\\" and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because \\"the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober.\\" =2001‚Äì2007: Career comeback= Downey at the 2007 San Diego Comic- Con International promoting Iron Man After five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that \\"when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot.\\", second segment, November 22, 2004. Retrieved March 16, 2013. He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, \\"I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what's hard is to decide to do it.\\" Downey got his first post-rehabilitation acting job in August 2001, lip- syncing in the video for Elton John's single \\"I Want Love\\". Video director Sam Taylor-Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed and \\"The way he underplays it is fantastic\\". Downey was able to return to the big screen after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective (directed by his Back to School co-star Keith Gordon). Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40% of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since. Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin, also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black. After Gothika, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, Good Night, and Good Luck, Richard Linklater's dystopian, rotoscoped A Scanner Darkly (in which Downey plays the role of a drug addict), and Steven Shainberg's fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, Fur, where Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus's professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel. Downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Disney's poorly received The Shaggy Dog. On November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio.As listed in the credits on the CD version of The Futurist. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated. In 2006, Downey returned to television when he did voice acting on Family Guy in the episode \\"The Fat Guy Strangler\\". Downey had previously telephoned the show's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son Indio is a fan of the show. The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt, Lois Griffin's long lost, mentally disturbed brother, for Downey. Downey signed on with publishers HarperCollins to write a memoir, which in 2006, was already being billed as a \\"candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career\\". In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers, and canceled the book without further comment. In 2007, Downey appeared in David Fincher's mystery thriller Zodiac, which was based on a true story. He played the role of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery, who was reporting the Zodiac Killer case. =2008‚Äìpresent: Iron Man, blockbuster films and further success= Downey promoting Iron Man in Mexico City in 2008 With all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a \\"blockbuster\\" film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of The Time 100, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office: In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron Man, with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating: \\"Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'.\\" Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of the Caribbean series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it. For the role Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he \\"had the power to forge iron\\". Iron Man was globally released between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide and receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight of the film. By October 2008, Downey had agreed to appear as Iron Man in two Iron Man sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as The Avengers, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series The Avengers. He first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, as a part of Marvel Studios' depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the movies. After Iron Man, Downey appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the Stiller-directed Tropic Thunder. The three actors play a Hollywood archetype‚Äîwith Downey playing self-absorbed multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus‚Äîas they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era film called Tropic Thunder. Lazarus undergoes a \\"controversial skin pigmentation procedure\\" in order to take on the role of African-American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which required Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey's portrayal of the character could become controversial: When asked by Harry Smith on CBS's The Early Show who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, \\"Sadly, my sorry-ass self.\\" Released in the United States on August 13, 2008, Tropic Thunder received good reviews with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively. It earned US$26 million in its North American opening weekend and retained the number one position for its first three weekends of release. The film grossed $180 million in theaters before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lazarus. Downey with Rachel McAdams at the 2009 San Diego Comic- Con International Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey finished in mid-2008, The Soloist. The film was delayed from a November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio's tight end-of-year release schedule. Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate. Downey picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year for his role in Tropic Thunder. The first role Downey accepted after Iron Man was the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. Warner Bros. released it on December 25, 2009. The film set several box office records in the United States for a Christmas Day release, beating the previous record-holder, 2008's Marley & Me, by nearly $10M, and finished second to Avatar in a record-setting Christmas weekend box office. Sherlock Holmes ended up being the 8th highest-grossing film of 2009. When Downey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for his role as Sherlock Holmes, he noted in his acceptance speech that he had prepared no remarks because \\"Susan Downey (his wife and Sherlock Holmes producer) told me that Matt Damon (nominated for his role in The Informant!) was going to win so don't bother preparing a speech\\". Waxwork of Downey (as Sherlock Holmes) on display at Madame Tussauds London Downey returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, which released in May 2010.

In 2012, Downey reprised the role of Tony Stark in The Avengers. The film received positive reviews and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time both in the United States and worldwide. His film, the David Dobkin-directed dramedy The Judge, a project co-produced by his production company Team Downey, was the opening film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014.

In 2020, he starred in Dolittle, playing the titular character, depicted in the film as a 19th-century English physician who can speak to animals. This was the second film from Team Downey.

I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since.\\" However, when asked about the quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated, \\"I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat.\\" Downey serves on the board of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition. In 2016, Downey appeared in an anti-Trump commercial with other celebrities encouraging people to register to vote in the 2016 election. In January 2020, during the promotions of his film Dolittle, Downey announced that he had made the decision to adopt a vegan diet, in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that \\"I'm a one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus\\" and believes he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously announced his opening of The Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around the world using advanced technology.

It stars Robert Downey Jr. as a 17th-century medical student exploited by King Charles II. The film, which is based on the novel of the same title by Rose Tremain, was filmed in Wales and won the Academy Awards for art direction and costume design. Plot A young doctor, Robert Merivel, enters the service of King Charles II of England after having saved the King's favorite spaniel. Merivel finds himself enjoying a life of debauched pleasure and popularity at court, until the King informs him that he has arranged for Merivel to wed Celia, the King's favorite mistress. The purpose of the arranged marriage is to fool another of the King's mistresses. Merivel is given an estate named Bidnold in Suffolk, and Celia is installed in a house in Kew where the king can visit her secretly. Merivel lives a life of debauchery there, but also finds pleasure in restoring the house to its former beauty with the support of Will Gates, the man who runs the estate. However, things become complicated when Merivel breaks the King's cardinal rule by falling in love with Celia. Elias Finn, a painter commissioned by the King to paint a portrait of Celia, tricks Merivel into revealing his romantic feelings for Celia, who does not return Merivel's affections. After finding out about Merivel's romantic feelings toward Celia, the King banishes him from court back to his life as a physician. Merivel rejoins his old friend, John Pearce, who has opened a Quaker sanitarium. There, Merivel meets Katherine, a troubled young woman whose husband walked out on her after their daughter drowned in the river. Merivel and Katherine become lovers. Pearce falls fatally ill with consumption, and while Merivel is tending to his dying friend, they discover that Katherine is pregnant with Merivel's child. After the death of Pearce, Merivel and Katherine leave. The pair returns to London just as the Great Plague has hit. Katherine gives birth to a daughter, Margaret, via Caesarean section, but dies in the process as there is no way to ward off infection once the body has been cut open. In her dying moments, Merivel promises Katherine that he will care for Margaret, and that he loves Katherine. As the plague continues to kill the people of London, Merivel feels compelled to do what he can as a physician. He leaves Margaret with a wet nurse who promises to care for her in his absence, and goes out into the city, separating the sick from the well, who have all been quarantined together, and does what he can to ease the suffering of the dying. When someone asks for Merivel's name, he says he is John Pearce, as a tribute to his friend. Under this misnomer and in disguise, Merivel is once again summoned to the palace. The King fears that Celia has contracted the plague. Merivel soon assures him that she does not have the plague, but rather has a treatable fever and is with child. With this, Merivel realizes the life he has now is more rewarding and fulfilling than the life and loves at the court he left behind. Suddenly, the court is notified that the city is ablaze, and Merivel races back to the city to retrieve his infant daughter from the flames. He is unable to find her, and falling through burning wood, Merivel lands in a small row boat, unconscious, and is floated by the river current away from the city. When he awakens, he is being cared for by Will Gates back at Bidnold. As Merivel recovers from his fall, he cannot recover from his failure to protect his young daughter from harm, when suddenly the King arrives at the house with his entourage. He informs Merivel that he has discovered the doctor's true identity, and that he was impressed with the man Merivel had become. With that, the King steps aside to reveal a nurse holding Margaret safely in her arms. For his courage and good work done in treating the victims of the plague, the King once again gives Bidnold to Merivel, stating that this time it will never be taken away. The film ends with Merivel returning to London, to set up a new hospital with help from the King.

The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Restoration spins an engaging period yarn out of its bestselling source material, brought to life through the efforts of an eclectic ensemble cast led by Robert Downey Jr.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Travers, in a favorable review for Rolling Stone, praised the film for its timely AIDS parable and described Ryan as miscast in the role of the troubled Katherine.Travers, Peter. \\"Movies: Restoration: Directed by Michael Hoffman\\" Rolling Stone 726 (25 January 1996) p. 67 In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Restoration crams in more research and period detail than it can comfortably digest, but its story is not overwhelmed by such overkill\\".Maslin, Janet. \\"The King's Vet, Beard and Cuckolder\\" New York Times (29 Dec 1995) C3 Rose Tremain, author of the novel on which the film was based, said of the film that it had a beautiful texture to it. She was however disappointed with the film's storytelling, and said the story has no logic and so does not move the audience. The disappointment led her to take up scriptwriting herself.

In the United States, the category is built on the folk-acoustic tradition, although this role has transmuted through different eras of popular music. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano. In the early 21st century, digital production tools such as GarageBand began to be used by singer-songwriters to compose their music.  Definition and usage  \\"Singer- songwriter\\" is used to define popular music artists who write and perform their own material, which is often self-accompanied generally on acoustic guitar or piano. Such an artist performs the roles of composer, lyricist, vocalist, sometimes instrumentalist, and often self-manager. According to AllMusic, singer-songwriters' lyrics are often personal but veiled by elaborate metaphors and vague imagery, and their creative concern is to place emphasis on the song rather than their performance of it. Most records by such artists have a similarly straightforward and spare sound that placed emphasis on the song itself. The term has also been used to describe songwriters in the rock, folk, country, and pop music genres including Henry Russell, Aristide Bruant, Hank Williams, and Buddy Holly. It came into popular usage in the 1960s onwards to describe songwriters who followed particular stylistic and thematic conventions, particularly lyrical introspection, confessional songwriting, mild musical arrangements, and an understated performing style. According to writer Larry David Smith, because it merged the roles of composer, writer, and singer, the popularity of the singer-songwriter reintroduced the Medieval troubadour tradition of \\"songs with public personalities\\" after the Tin Pan Alley era in American popular music. Song topics of singer-songwriters from the American folk music revival include political protest, as in the case of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. According to the Journal of Popular Music Studies, from the folk revival and onward into its permeance in pop music, the role of a singer-songwriter has involved several dimensions of creative identity:  History  Hank Williams, 1951 The concept of a singer-songwriter can be traced to ancient bardic oral tradition, which has existed in various forms throughout the world. Poems would be performed as chant or song, sometimes accompanied by a harp or other similar instrument. After the invention of printing, songs would be written and performed by ballad sellers. Usually these would be versions of existing tunes and lyrics, which were constantly evolving. This developed into the singer- songwriting traditions of folk culture. Traveling performers existed throughout Europe. Thus, the folklorist Anatole Le Braz gives a detailed account of one ballad singer, Yann Ar Minouz, who wrote and performed songs traveling through Brittany in the late nineteenth century and selling printed versions.Anatole Le Braz, \\"The Pardon of the Singers\\", The Land of Pardons, London, Methuen, 1926, pp. 45‚Äì104. In large towns it was possible to make a living performing in public venues, and with the invention of phonographic recording, early singer-songwriters like Th√©odore Botrel, George M. Cohan and Hank Williams became celebrities; radio further added to their public recognition and appeal. During the period from the 1940s through the 1960s, sparked by the American folk music revival, young performers inspired by traditional folk music and groups like the Almanac Singers and the Weavers began writing and performing their own original material and creating their own musical arrangements.Cohen, Ronald D. Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival & American Society, 1940‚Äì1970. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2002. In the early 21st century, the digital audio workstation GarageBand has been utilized by many aspiring singer-songwriters to compose and record music. Singer-songwriters who have composed music professionally with GarageBand include Erykah Badu (for her 2008 album New Amerykah Part One) and Bilal (for his 2010 album Airtight's Revenge).  Traditions in different countries= North America, United Kingdom, and Ireland = Paul Simon in concert The term \\"singer-songwriter\\" in North America can be traced back to singers who developed works in the blues and folk music style. Early to mid-20th century American singer-songwriters include Lead Belly, Jimmie Rodgers, Blind Lemon Jefferson,Dicaire, David.

These proto-singer- songwriters were less concerned than today's singer-songwriters with the unadulterated originality of their music and lyrics, and would lift parts from other songs and play covers without hesitation. The tradition of writing topical songs (songs regarding specific issues of the day, such as Lead Belly's \\"Jim Crow Blues\\" or Guthrie's \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\") was established by this group of musicians. Singers like Seeger and Guthrie would attend rallies for labor unions, and so wrote many songs concerning the life of the working classes, and social protest; as did other folksingers like Josh White, Cisco Houston, Malvina Reynolds, Earl Robinson, Ewan MacColl, John Jacob Niles, and Doc Watson, while blues singers like Johnson and Hopkins wrote songs about their personal life experiences. This focus on social issues has greatly influenced the singer-songwriter genre. Additionally in the 1930s through the 1950s several jazz and blues singer-songwriters emerged like Hoagy Carmichael, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Harry Gibson, and Nina Simone, as well as in the rock n' roll genre from which emerged influential singer- songwriters Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, Ritchie Valens, and Paul Anka. In the country music field, singer-songwriters like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, Billy Edd Wheeler, and others emerged from the 1940s through the 1960s, often writing compelling songs about love relationships and other subjects. The first popular recognition of the singer- songwriter in English-speaking North America and the United Kingdom occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s when a series of blues, folk and country- influenced musicians rose to prominence and popularity. These singer- songwriters included Bob Dylan, Neil Young, John Lennon, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen, and Joni Mitchell. Artists who had been primarily songwriters, notably Carole King, Townes Van Zandt, and Neil Diamond, also began releasing work as performers. In contrast to the storytelling approach of most prior country and folk music, these performers typically wrote songs from a highly personal (often first-person), introspective point of view. The adjectives \\"confessional\\" and \\"sensitive\\" were often used (sometimes derisively) to describe singer-songwriter style. James Taylor in the early 1970s In the rock band era, members were not technically singer-songwriters as solo acts. However, many were singer- songwriters who created songs with other band members. Examples include Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, Elton John (with Bernie Taupin), Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Robbie Robertson, Ian Anderson, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, and Peter Frampton; Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Country Joe McDonald, Barry Melton. Many others like Eric Clapton found success as singer-songwriters in their later careers. The scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival, pioneered by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger had grown to a major movement in the early 1960s, popularized by Joan Baez and her prot√©g√©e, Bob Dylan, who had started reaching a mainstream audience with his hit, Blowin' in the Wind\\" (1963) bringing \\"protest songs\\" to a wider audience.J. E. Perone, Music of the Counterculture Era American History Through Music (Westwood, CT: Greenwood, 2004), , p. 37. There were hints of cross-pollination, but rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with different audiences. An early attempt at fusing elements of folk and rock was highlighted in the Animals \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" (1964), a folk song, recorded with rock and roll instrumentation.Dave Marsh, The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made, NAL, 1989. Entry #91. By the mid-1960s Bob Dylan took the lead in merging folk and rock, and in July 1965, released \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", with a revolutionary rock sound, steeped in tawdry urban imagery, followed by an electric performance later that month at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter. Often writing from an urban point of view, with poetry punctuated by rock rhythms and electric power, Dylan's fusing of folk and rock freed up emerging singer-songwriters to use elements of both traditions to tell their stories. In the mid- to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art/music scene. The release of The Velvet Underground & Nico in 1967, featuring singer- songwriter Lou Reed and German singer and collaborator Nico was described as the \\"most prophetic rock album ever made\\" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In the late '60s a New Wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, and Janis Joplin. These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in Newsweek, July 1969, \\"The Girls: Letting Go: 'What is common to them ‚Äì to Joni Mitchell and Lotti Golden, to Laura Nyro, Melanie, and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry.\\"JoniMitchell.com Library: THE GIRLS‚ÄîLETTING GO: Newsweek, 14 July 1969JoniMitchell.com Library: THE GIRLS‚ÄîLETTING GO: Newsweek, 14 July 1969, Original Article pdf In The Guardian, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter‚Äîthey sang about politics, love affairs, the urban landscape, drugs, disappointment, and the life and loneliness of the itinerant performer. Lotti Golden, in her Atlantic debut album Motor-Cycle, chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late 1960s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the contemporary female singer-songwriter that has informed generations of women singer-songwriters into the 21st century, with poet Warsan Shire as the muse for Beyonc√©'s 2016, Lemonade. Lotti Golden performing, Nashville, Tennessee, in the confessional tradition, 1971 By the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the original wave of singer-songwriters had largely been absorbed into a more general pop or soft rock format, but some new artists in the singer-songwriter tradition (including Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, Chris Isaak, Victoria Williams, John Mellencamp and Warren Zevon) continued to emerge, and in other cases rock and even punk rock artists such as Peter Case, Paul Collins and Paul Westerberg transitioned to careers as solo singer-songwriters. Kate Bush remained distinctive throughout with her idiosyncratic style. In the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with Suzanne Vega whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Nanci Griffith, k.d. lang, Shania Twain, Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Colvin, Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Joan Osborne, Indigo Girls, and Tori Amos, who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market. In the early 1990s, female artists also began to emerge in new styles, including Courtney Love and PJ Harvey. Later in the mid-1990s, the term was revived again with the success of Canada's Alanis Morissette and her breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill. Also in the 1980s and 1990s, artists such as Bono, the Edge, Dave Matthews, Jeff Buckley, Richard Barone, Duncan Sheik and Elliott Smith borrowed from the singer-songwriter tradition to create new acoustic-based rock styles. In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as Norah Jones, Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, David Bazan, South San Gabriel, Iron & Wine, David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, Meg Hutchinson, Darden Smith, Josh Rouse, Steve Millar, Jolie Holland, Patrick Duff, Richard Buckner, Jewel, Jack Savoretti, Richard Shindell, John Gorka, and Antje Duvekot. Some started to branch out in new genres such as Kurt Cobain, Noel Gallagher, T Bone Burnett, Eddie Vedder, and Pete Yorn. Others used drugs as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of Holy Sons took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an indie label. Recording on the professional-grade systems became affordable for individuals in the late 1990s. This created opportunities for people to independently record and sell their music. Such artists are known as \\"indies\\" because they release their records on independent, often self-owned record labels, or no label at all. Additionally the Internet has provided a means for indies to get their music heard by a wider audience. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  David Crosby, (of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash) is one of the singer-songwriters who crossed over into mainstream rock, seen here in 1976 backstage of the Frost Amphitheater, Stanford University.

Taylor Swift, a 10-time Grammy-winning contemporary singer-songwriter (pictured in 2012) } = Chanson, the French tradition = French \\"chanson\\" comes from an old tradition, since the Middle Ages. It is driven by the rhythms of the French language and has a generally higher standard of lyrics than in the English- speaking world. It can be distinguished from the rest of French \\"pop\\" music or soft rock format that began to spread in France during the 1960s until today, under the cultural influence of Anglo-American rock music and the rock band era. The first modern French singer-songwriter was Charles Trenet, who began his solo career in 1938. He was the first to use jazz rhythms in chanson. He would remain an isolated act until the creative blooming of a new generation during the post-World War II era (mid-1940s and 1950s), where such artists as L√©o Ferr√©, Georges Brassens, F√©lix Leclerc (from Quebec), Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel (from Belgium), Henri Salvador (from French Guiana), Charles Aznavour, and Barbara appeared, with contrasted and rich imagination. Most of them are recognized as great masters by younger generations of French artists, especially Ferr√© (for the richness of his lyrics, his melodic genius, his critical density on social issues and his body of work's profoundness) and Gainsbourg (for the bright and tasteful adaptation of pop or rock music with French language-driven rhythms). During the 1960s and 1970s, the most prominent singer-songwriters included Claude Nougaro, Jean Ferrat, Boby Lapointe, Michel Polnareff, Nino Ferrer, Christophe, Albert Marc≈ìur, Bernard Lavilliers, Fr√©d√©rik Mey and Jacques Higelin, amongst others. = Cantautori, the Italian tradition = Lucio Battisti Cantautori (Italian plural; the singular is cantautore) is the Italian expression corresponding to singer- songwriters in English. The word is a portmanteau of cantante (singer) and autore (writer). The first internationally renowned cantautore was Domenico Modugno with his song \\"Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)\\", a huge best seller in 1958; other early cantautori, who begun their career in the late 50s, are Gino Paoli, Luigi Tenco, Umberto Bindi, Giorgio Gaber and Enzo Jannacci. Fabrizio De Andr√©, Lucio Battisti and Francesco Guccini began their career in the 60s, while Edoardo Bennato, Lucio Dalla, Francesco De Gregori, Franco Battiato, Rino Gaetano, Ivano Fossati, Antonello Venditti, Claudio Baglioni, Pino Daniele, Roberto Vecchioni, Angelo Branduardi and Eugenio Finardi all appeared in the 70s. Their songs are still popular today, often telling stories of marginalized (De Andr√©, Guccini, Dalla) and rebellious people (Finardi, De Gregori, Venditti), or having a political background (Venditti, Guccini). Branduardi was instead much more influenced by Medieval and Baroque musical styles, while his lyrics are usually inspired by ancient fables. Battiato started as a progressive rock and cultivated music artist in the 1970s, shifting to an original blend of pop, electronic, new wave, and world music in the 1980s. The Neapolitan cantautore Pino Daniele has often fused genres as diverse as R&B;, fusion, blues, pop, jazz, and tarantella to produce a sound uniquely his own, with lyrics variously in Italian, Neapolitan, or English. Similarly Paolo Conte was often tagged as a cantautore, but was more into the jazz tradition. In the 1980s Vasco Rossi was renowned for his blend of blues- tinged rock music mixed with Italian melodies. He was nicknamed the \\"only Italian rock star\\" (l'unica rock n'roll-star italiana) by his fans. With a mixture between international sounds and Italian lyrics, in the 2000s Bugo become the \\"fantautore\\", a neologism conied for him. Despite not having achieved great fame, he is considered the pioneer of the renewal of Italian songwriting, far from the politicized of the 70s. In the last 25 years the genre has been mainly represented by Samuele Bersani, Caparezza, and the so- called 2nd Roman school of cantautori (Max Gazz√®, Niccol√≤ Fabi, Daniele Silvestri). The word has been borrowed into other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan cantautor, French chantauteur, Maltese kantawtur, Romanian cantautor, and Slovenian kantavtor. = Iberian-Latin American traditions = Beginning in the 1960s and following the Italian cantautori style of the 1950s (like the one of Domenico Modugno), many Latin American countries developed singer-songwriter traditions that adopted elements from various popular styles. The first such tradition was the mid-1960s invention of nueva canci√≥n, which took hold in Andean countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia. Caetano Veloso At around the same time, the Brazilian popular style bossa nova was evolving into a politically charged singer-songwriter tradition called Tropicalismo. Two performers, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso became two of the most famous people in all of Brazil through their work in Tropicalismo. After World War II it was developed in Italy a very prolific singer-songwriter (in Italian cantautore) tradition, initially connected with the French school of the chansonniers, and lately developed very heterogeneously. Although the term cantautore normally implies consistent sociopolitical content in lyrics, noteworthy performers in a more inclusive singer-songwriter categorization are: Domenico Modugno, Luigi Tenco, Gino Paoli, Sergio Endrigo, Fabrizio De Andr√©, Francesco De Gregori, Antonello Venditti, Roberto Vecchioni, Ivano Fossati, Lucio Dalla, Francesco Guccini and Franco Battiato. In neighbouring Malta, the main singer-songwriters are Walter Micallef, Manwel Mifsud and Vince Fabri. They all perform in Maltese. Spain and Portugal have also had singer-songwriter traditions, which are sometimes said to have drawn on Latin elements. Catalonia is known for the Nova Can√ß√≥ tradition ‚Äì exemplified by Joan Manuel Serrat and Lluis Llach; the Portuguese folk/protest singer and songwriter Jos√© Afonso helped lead a revival of Portuguese folk culture, including a modernized, more socially aware form of fado called nova can√ß√£o. Following Portugal's Carnation Revolution of 1974, nova can√ß√£o became more politicized and was known as canto livre. Another important Spain singer-songwriters are Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Jos√© Luis Perales and Luis Eduardo Aute. In the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s, socially and politically aware singer-songwriters like Silvio Rodr√≠guez and Pablo Milan√©s emerged in Cuba, birthing a genre known as nueva trova. Trova as a genre has had broad influence across Latin America. In Mexico, for example, canci√≥n yucateca on the Yucat√°n Peninsula and trova serrana in the Sierra Ju√°rez, Oaxaca are both regional adaptations of trova. Today, Guatemalan Ricardo Arjona qualifies as Latin America's most commercially successful singer-songwriter. Although sociopolitical engagement is uneven in his oeuvre, some see Arjona's more engaged works as placing him in the tradition of the Italian cantautori. In the mid-1970s, a singer-songwriter tradition called canto popular emerged in Uruguay. With the influence of Tropicalismo, Traditional Samba and Bossa Nova, MPB (M√∫sica popular brasileira), or Brazilian Popular Music, became highly singer-songwriter based. For years solo artists would dominate Brazilian popular music with romantic cynicism alla Jobim or subliminal anti-government messages alla Chico Buarque. After the end of the military dictatorship in Brazil, Brazilian music became less politically and socially conscious. The censored Raul Seixas or the humorous spiritualist Jorge Ben were slowly obscured by funk carioca, ax√© music and Brazilian disco. In recent years, however, a new stock of socially conscious Brazilian singer-songwriters is beginning to break the almost strictly dance- music momentum that has reigned since the 1980s (see the 'Brazilian folk/folk- rock sub-article in Brazilian Music). = Soviet Union and Russia = Soviet and Russian bard Bulat Okudzhava Since the 1960s, those singers who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment have been known as \\"bards\\". The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs are thought to be written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students' song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a Russian guitar, rarely if ever would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Though, bards using piano or accordion are also known. Those who became popular held modest concerts. The first nationwide-famous bards (starting their career in the 1950s) are traditionally referred to as the First Five: Mikhail Ancharov, Alexander Gorodnitsky, Novella Matveyeva, Bulat Okudzhava, Yuri Vizbor. In the 1960s, they were joined by Vladimir Vysotsky, Victor Berkovsky, Yuliy Kim, and many others. In the course of the 1970s, the shift to the classical 6-string guitar took place, and now, a Russian guitar is a rare bird with the bards. In the same period, the movement of KSP (Kluby Samodeyatelnoy Pesni ‚Äì amateur song fan clubs) emerged, providing the bards with highly educated audience, and up to the end of the 1980s being their key promotion engine. Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, partly given the political nature of many songs, partly due to their vague status in the strictly organised state- supported show business establishment of the USSR. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around as folk lore, from mouth to mouth, or via the copying of amateur recordings (sometimes referred as magnitizdat) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of political nature. Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in the fact that it is sung along with a simple guitar melody as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that this form of poetry focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry often takes the form of narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. On the other hand, in the USSR the chief bard supporter was the state Union of Composers, and the main bard hater was the state Union of Writers. A far more obvious difference was the commerce-free nature of the genre: songs were written to be sung and not to be sold. The similar genre dominated by singers-songwriters is known as sung poetry in other Post-Soviet countries. = Bulgaria = Singer- songwriters are popular in Bulgaria under the name \\"bards\\", or \\"poets with guitars\\". Their tradition is a mixture of traditional folk motifs, city folklore from the early 20th century, and modern influences. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the Communist regime in the country started to tolerate the Bulgarian \\"bards\\", promoting the so-called \\"political songs\\", performed usually by one-man bands. A national festival tradition was established, under the title \\"Alen Mak\\" (Red Poppy), a symbol with strong Communist meaning in Bulgaria. At the same time, there were some prominent underground figures which were against the official Communist Party line, such as Angel \\"Jendema\\" Angelov, Yavor \\"Yavkata\\" Rilov, and Velizar \\"Valdes\\" Vankov. After the collapse of Communism in 1989, the singer-songwriters' tradition was re- established. Currently, the Bulgarian \\"bards\\" enjoy several festivals (local and international) per year, namely the PoKi Festival (Poets with Guitars, Poetic Strings) in the town of Harmanli, the Bardfest in Lovech, the Sofia Evenings of Singer-Songwriters, and others. Major figures in the Bulgarian tradition are Dimitar Taralezhkov, Angel \\"Jendema\\" Angelov, Yavor \\"Yavkata\\" Rilov, Velizar \\"Valdes\\" Vankov, Dimitar Dobrev, Andro Stubel, Branimir \\"Bunny\\" Stoykov, Dorothea Tabakova, Mihail Belchev, Assen Maslarski, Grisha Trifonov, Plamen Stavrev, Vladimir Levkov, Margarita Drumeva, Maria Batchvarova, Plamen Sivov, and Krasimir Parvanov. = Romania = Despite the communist isolation, the tradition of the singer-songwriter in Romania flourished beginning with the end of the 1960s and it was put in the context of folk music, with its three main styles in Romania: ethno folk, American-style folk and lyrical (cult) folk. The framework for many of these initiatives came under the form of Cenaclul FlacƒÉra, a series of mass cultural events with an inevitable ideological touch. Still, with the merit of supporting great opening initiatives: the appropriation of Western artists like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and others from the Woodstock generation, the public performance of gospel- like music, the opening to big international issues (pop culture, accountability of the leadership, tension surging during the Cold War-with surprisingly neutral positions etc.). Overall, the Romanian folk, in general, could be marked as an underground cultural movement, somewhere between non- aligned and protest music. = Liedermacher, the German tradition = Reinhard Mey Rooted in the European B√§nkelsang (\\"bench-singing\\") and Moritat traditions while also taking immediate inspiration from the French chanson scene and the American folk music revival, the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a whole generation of German-language singer-songwriters called Liedermacher (\\"songmakers\\"), among them Hannes Wader, Franz Josef Degenhardt, Reinhard Mey and Konstantin Wecker from West Germany, Wolf Biermann from East Germany as well as Ludwig Hirsch and Georg Danzer from Austria. With regards to content and style, the Liedermacher spectrum ranges from political balladeering to rather observational storytelling and love songs. The lyrics often deal with topics such as social injustice, militarism, consumerism, environmental issues or the repercussions of the German Nazi past, often expressing technoskepticism and anti-establishment views.Huff, Hartmut: Liedermacher, (1980), Munich: Heyne; Henke, Matthias: Die gro√üen Chansonniers und Liedermacher (1987), D√ºsseldorf: Econ. = Sweden = In the mid-1960s, Sweden witnessed the renaissance of the \\"trubadur\\", the Swedish version of the singer-songwriter. Cornelis Vreeswijk and Fred √Ökerstr√∂m were particularly influential in their efforts to blend the heritage of the \\"visa\\" (a specific way to render simple stanzaic poems or songs, given distinction by artists such as Carl Michael Bellman and Evert Taube) with modern approaches to balladeering.Alf Bj√∂rnberg, Thomas Bossius, eds., Made in Sweden: Studies in Popular Music, (2016), New York: Routledge, pp. 53‚Äì4. = Netherlands = Ede Staal (Warffum) (1941‚Äì1986), was a Dutch singer-songwriter from the Northern province of Groningen who sang mainly in the Groninger dialect of Dutch.

They blended rock, jazz and classical music and were keyboardist Keith Emerson's first commercially successful band. The group was formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After replacing Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's stage performances featured Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of the instrument, such as playing rhythms while switching the reverb on and off while the spring unit was crashing about. Their compositions included radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs. The band achieved commercial success with an instrumental rearrangement of Leonard Bernstein's \\"America\\", following which O'List left the group. The remaining members carried on as a trio, releasing several albums, before Emerson decided to leave the band in early 1970 in order to form Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The group briefly reformed in 2002 for a series of concerts. History=Early career= The Nice evolved from Gary Farr and the T-Bones, which keyboardist Keith Emerson and bassist Keith \\"Lee\\" Jackson were both members of before the band dissolved in early 1967. Emerson then briefly played with the VIPs, who toured the Star- Club in Hamburg, and his playing style became influenced by the organist Don Shinn, including standing up to play the instrument and rocking it on stage. Meanwhile, P. P. Arnold, a performer who reached a higher level of popularity in the UK than her native US, was unhappy with her backing band, the Blue Jays, and wanted a replacement. Her driver suggested Emerson would be able to put together such a group. Emerson agreed, but only on the condition the band could perform on their own as a warm-up act. Since it effectively meant getting two bands for the price of one, manager Andrew Loog Oldham readily agreed. Emerson recruited Jackson, drummer Ian Hague and ex-The Attack guitarist David O'List, the latter by recommendation from journalist Chris Welch. The name came from Arnold saying, \\"Here comes the Naz\\", which the group misheard as \\"the Nice\\". The band played its first gig in May 1967, and had its first major break at the 7th National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor on 13 August. Oldham had managed to secure a separate set for the group in a side tent away from also accompanying Arnold on the main stage, where they gained attention. The next week, Welch wrote in the Melody Maker that \\"it was the first time I had seen a group actually in the act of winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances\\". When Arnold went back to her family in the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own. Hague was not interested in the \\"progressive\\" direction the group wanted to go in, so he was replaced by former Mark Leeman Five and Habits drummer Brian Davison. Now a band in their own right, the Nice expanded their gear, recruiting roadies Bazz Ward and Lemmy, the latter of whom provided Emerson with a Hitler Youth ceremonial dagger to stick into the keys on his Hammond organ. They spent the end of 1967 on a package tour with Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Move and Amen Corner. Pink Floyd's then leader, Syd Barrett, missed several gigs and O'List had to stand in for him. The group's first album was recorded throughout the autumn of 1967, and in October of that year they recorded their first session for John Peel's radio show Top Gear. The album included classical and jazz influences including extracts from Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Sinfonietta and a rearrangement of Dave Brubeck's \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\" renamed as \\"Rondo\\", changing the time signature from the original 9/8 to 4/4 in the process. The group clashed with producer Oldham in the studio over the length of the track, but eventually won the argument; the full eight- minute piece was included on the album. After the album was released, the group realised that Oldham had a conflict of interest as manager and record company owner, so they recruited sports journalist Tony Stratton-Smith to take over management duties. For their second single, the Nice created an arrangement of Leonard Bernstein's \\"America\\" which Emerson described as the first ever instrumental protest song. The track used the main theme of the Bernstein piece (from West Side Story) but also included fragments of Dvo≈ô√°k's New World Symphony. The single concludes with Arnold's three-year-old son speaking the lines \\"America is pregnant with promise and anticipation, but is murdered by the hand of the inevitable.\\" The new arrangement was released under the title \\"America (Second Amendment)\\" as a pointed reference to the US Bill of Rights provision for the right to bear arms. In July 1968, Immediate Records publicised the single with a controversial poster picturing the group members with small boys on their knees, with superimposed images of the faces of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. on the children's heads. A spokesman for the band said: \\"Several record stores have refused to stock our current single .... the Nice feel if the posters are issued in United States they will do considerable harm\\". During the tour that followed the release of their second album in July, the group spawned controversy when Emerson burned an American flag onstage during a performance of \\"America\\" at a charity event, Come Back Africa in London's Royal Albert Hall. The group were subsequently banned from ever playing the venue again. By summer 1968, the group had become concerned about O'List's reliability and matters came to a head following a gig in Croydon's Fairfield Hall in September. According to Ward, O'List had an altercation with him in mid- performance. Emerson subsequently called a band meeting with Jackson and Davison and stated flatly that O'List should be sacked. They agreed, and immediately after their performance at The Ritz, Bournemouth in October, he was fired by Stratton-Smith with the rest of the band present. O'List, however, claims that he left the band voluntarily because he was upset at Stratton-Smith's decision to make Emerson the front man, saying: \\"I left the band and waited for Keith to get in contact... I should have gone straight to Keith, but I didn't.\\" =Reduction to a three-piece= The title suite of the Five Bridges album was inspired by five bridges that span the River Tyne between Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. The Nice briefly considered looking for a replacement, with Steve Howe trying out at an audition. Howe got on well with the rest of the band, but a week later had second thoughts and decided not to join. Emerson tried to learn guitar so he could cover some of O'List's old parts, but gave up after one gig. The band's second LP Ars Longa Vita Brevis featured an arrangement of the Intermezzo from the Karelia Suite by Jean Sibelius, which the band's friend Roy Harper had recommended they cover, and the album's second side was a suite which included an arrangement of a movement from J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3\\\\. The group used an orchestra for the first time on some parts of the suite. The band were on the bill at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival and briefly toured Ireland with Yes and Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band which, by all accounts, was fraught with logistical problems. The third album, titled Nice in the UK and Everything As Nice As Mother Makes It in the US, featured one side recorded live on their American tour and one side of studio material. As with previous albums, it included arrangements of classical material, in this case the Third Movement of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony (Pathetique), and rearrangements of Bob Dylan's \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and Tim Hardin's \\"Hang on to a Dream\\". In 1969, the band found time to contribute to other projects. Emerson performed as a session player for Rod Stewart and the Faces, while the whole group provided instrumental backing for the track \\"Hell's Angels\\" on Harper's 1970 album Flat Baroque and Berserk. Mid-year, tour promoter Michael Emmerson asked the Nice to write some music for the Newcastle upon Tyne Arts Festival. The result was the Five Bridges suite. The group premi√®red the piece on 10 October 1969 at Newcastle City Hall. A complete version with an orchestra was performed at the Fairfield Hall, Croydon on 17 October, which was recorded for the album of the same name. The title refers to the city's five bridges spanning the River Tyne, and Jackson's lyrics refer to his Newcastle childhood and the St James' Park football ground. By late 1969, Emerson thought the Nice had progressed as far as it could musically, and was particularly dissatisfied with Jackson's limited vocal style. He asked Jack Bruce and Yes' Chris Squire about forming a new band, but both turned Emerson down. While on tour in the US with King Crimson, Emerson held a meeting with Stratton-Smith and declared \\"the Nice had outlived its usefulness\\". By the end of the year, Emerson and Crimson's Greg Lake had decided to form a band together. The group carried on touring into 1970, but sometime early in the year, Emerson told Jackson that he would be leaving the band. Matters were not helped by Immediate Records filing for bankruptcy; the band later said they received no royalties from the label while an active group. In February 1970, the group collaborated with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra led by Zubin Mehta. This was broadcast in the following month as part of the \\"Switched-On Symphony\\" program. Following standard television procedure of the day, the Nice's contribution (a version of \\"America\\") was recorded ahead of time and the band mimed for the cameras. By March, the group had confirmed they would split, and a report on the band's decision was printed in Melody Maker. The group played their last British concert on 22 March at the Fairfield Hall, Croydon, and after a short German tour the band broke up, playing their last gig on 30 March at the Berlin Sportpalast. =Post-Nice and reunion= Lee Jackson performing at the 2002 reunion of the Nice. Emerson and Lake recruited Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster and formed Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP). In 1971, the posthumous Nice album Elegy was released. It included different versions of previously released tracks, two being studio versions and two live from the 1969 US tour. Emerson had no involvement with compiling the album, which was done by Jackson, Davison and Charisma Records. The album reached No. 5 in the UK. Jackson formed Jackson Heights which released five albums between 1970 and 1973. Emerson supported the band and became a fan. Davison formed \\"Every Which Way\\" which released an album in 1970. Both Jackson and Davison formed Refugee with keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1974, but Moraz left the group after one album to replace Rick Wakeman in Yes. After over three decades of inactivity, the Nice reformed in 2002 for a series of concerts. A three-CD set Vivacitas was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. Dave Kilminster guested on guitar at the concerts. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Musical style Hammond L-100 organ similar to the one used by Keith Emerson with the Nice. The Nice were primarily a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which he used to hold down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis. The group's early sound was geared more towards psychedelic rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O'List's departure, Emerson's control over the band's direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson's redefining of the role of keyboard instruments in rock set the Nice apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification and Leslie speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate for the lack of a guitarist. Jackson never considered himself a great singer, partly because the group chose poor keys for his vocal range, but his bass playing, with heavy use of a plectrum, was a distinctive part of the band's overall sound. He was influenced by Bob Dylan, whose songs were often covered at the time; the Nice interpreted several of them, typically reducing them to three or four verses and featuring a long improvised middle section, such as \\"She Belongs to Me\\". Legacy The Nice were one of the pioneering progressive rock bands and their fusion of styles strongly influenced the movement into the 1970s. Their commercial success on Charisma Records was key to establishing the label, which went on to include several other progressive acts, including Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator. Genesis were fans of the Nice and \\"The Knife\\" from their album Trespass was directly inspired by the band. Though the Nice were not the first to combine a rock band and orchestra, they did inspire similar attempts by other groups, such as Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother. The group have often been compared to ELP, but there were important differences between them. Emerson's showmanship was more important in the Nice, and he mostly used just a Hammond organ live as opposed to a wider range of keyboards, including the Moog synthesizer, in ELP. John Peel, an early champion of the Nice, called ELP \\"a waste of talent and electricity\\".

It predated Internet Relay Chat and other online chat systems. The program that made the network possible was called \\"Relay\\" and was developed by Jeff Kell of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1985 using the REXX programming language. This system drew its name from \\"relay race\\" which shares a comparable behavior, where messages travel hop-by-hop along the network of Relay servers until they reached their destination. Messages sent within the United States would take a few seconds to reach their destinations, but communication times varied in other countries or internationally. If one or more network links were down, BITNET would store and forward the messages when the network links recovered, minutes or even hours later.  Background  Before BITNET Relay was implemented, any form of communication over BITNET required identifying the remote user and host. Relay ran on a special ID using several BITNET hosts. To use it, a message was sent to a user ID called RELAY. The Relay program running on that user ID would then provide multi-user chat functions, primarily in the form of \\"channels\\" (chat rooms). The message could contain either a command for Relay (preceded by the popular \\"/\\" slash character command prefix, still in use today), or a message at the remote host (typically a mainframe computer). Computers connected to BITNET were generally located at universities and government agencies, due to limited access to computer network bandwidth. It was not uncommon for a university's entire network connection to run over a single leased telephone line or even a 4800 baud dial-up connection. Thus using scarce computing and network resources for \\"frivolous\\" purposes, such as chat, was often discouraged.  Popularity  One of the reasons Relay gained acceptance was that its system of peer servers decreased the network bandwidth consumed by group chat, due to no longer having to send multiple copies of the same message individually to each server. Because of this efficiency and the limited bandwidth at the time, users were often not allowed to use or develop alternate chat systems. Experimental chats like Galaxy Network and VM/Shell were asked to shut down before they achieved noteworthy success. Bitnet Relay gained popularity in the late 1980s when Valdis Kletnieks at Virginia Tech created a Pascal version that consumed far less CPU time, and again in the early 1990s when Smart Relay improved handling of message delivery. Though Jeff Kell himself had made observations about the possible demise of BITNET Relay, only TCP/IP and the Internet brought about the end of BITNET and Relay. Jarkko Oikarinen, the creator of Internet Relay Chat, says that he was inspired by BITNET Relay  Usage  The following is an example of a session: /SIGNUP robert harper * Thank you for signing up, robert harper. * Now use the /SIGNON command to * establish a nickname and to logon Relay. /SIGN ON rob Welcome to the Inter Chat Relay Network, Rob.

The film stars Angela Bassett as Tina Turner and Laurence Fishburne as Ike Turner. The screenplay was adapted by Kate Lanier from the book I, Tina co-written by Turner with Kurt Loder. Both Ike and Tina assigned rights to Lanier for their lives to be dramatized in the film. The film's soundtrack featured the hit song \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\", which went to number one in seven countries. In the United States, the film grossed almost $40 million and around $20 million in rentals. In the United Kingdom, it grossed nearly ¬£10 million. Plot Born and raised in Nutbush, Tennessee, Anna Mae Bullock grows up in an unhappy family with her parents leaving and abandoning her at a young age. Following her grandmother's death, Anna Mae relocates to St. Louis, reuniting with her mother and close sister Alline. Anna Mae pursues a chance to be a professional singer, after seeing charismatic bandleader Ike Turner perform one night. Later, she wins her spot in Turner's band after singing onstage, and he begins mentoring her. In time, an unexpected romance develops between the two, after she moves into Ike's home. Shortly afterwards, they marry and begin having musical success together as Ike & Tina Turner. The marriage quickly turns violent when Ike starts physically dominating Tina, leaving her no chance to escape. In public, Tina rises from local St. Louis phenomenon into an R&B; superstar, with Ike growing increasingly jealous of the attention given to her. Ike turns to drugs as his behavior worsens while Tina seeks to find solace in her chaotic life. Her friend turns her on to Buddhism, eventually convincing her that reciting the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo will help \\"change her life.\\" Tina grows increasingly confident afterwards and, in a final fight with Ike, finally musters the courage to defend herself; eventually leaving Ike after they arrive at a hotel. Winning the right to retain her stage name after their divorce, Tina continues working to pay bills. Tina gets a break after meeting Roger Davies, who eventually helps her realize her dreams of rock stardom. Despite Ike's attempts to win her back, Tina eventually prevails and finds solo success, accomplishing her dreams without Ike. Cast * Angela Bassett as Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock ** Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly as young Anna Mae * Cora Lee Day as Grandma Georgiana * Khandi Alexander as Darlene * Laurence Fishburne as Ike Turner * Jenifer Lewis as Zelma Bullock, Tina's mother * Phyllis Yvonne Stickney as Alline Bullock * Penny Johnson Jerald as Lorraine Taylor * Vanessa Bell Calloway as Jackie * Chi McBride as Fross * Sherman Augustus as Reggie * Terrence Riggins as Spider * Bo Kane as Dance Show Host * Terrence Evans as Bus Driver * Rob LaBelle as Phil Spector * James Reyne as Roger Davies * Richard T.

Saleem as teenage Ike Turner Jr. Production Angela Bassett, nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Tina Turner Halle Berry, Robin Givens, Pam Grier, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Vanessa L. Williams were all considered for the role of Tina Turner. Whitney Houston was actually offered the role, but had to decline due to imminent maternity. Jenifer Lewis also originally auditioned to play Tina Turner but was cast instead as Tina's mother despite being only a year older than Bassett. Angela Bassett auditioned for the role in October 1992 and was chosen only a month before production began in December. During that time she had to learn not only how to talk like Turner but to dance and move like her. She would have been willing to try to do the singing as well, but not in the time we had, she said. I did think about it for a second, though. Instead, she lip syncs to soundtracks recorded by Tina Turner and Fishburne. Bassett worked with Tina Turner, but only a little bit. Turner helped most with the re-creations of her famed dance routines. Bassett was injured while filming the first spousal abuse sequence. She fell off the back of a high-rise sofa, put her hands out to reduce the impact, and suffered a hairline fracture of her right hand. She only tried the stunt fall once, and footage leading up to the mishap appears in the film. Actress Vanessa Bell Calloway, who plays the fictional character Jackie, was leery of voicing the Buddhist chant because of her strong Christian faith. Director Brian Gibson allowed her to form the words with her lips silently during filming and added the words with a voice double in post-production. All the Ike & Tina Turner songs used in the film were newly re-recorded versions by Tina Turner. On \\"Proud Mary\\" and \\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\\", Laurence Fishburne sings Ike Turner's parts. For Tina Turner's solo recordings, the original masters were used, including the Phil Spector-produced \\"River Deep - Mountain High.\\" Laurence Fishburne was offered the role of Ike Turner five times and turned it down each time. \\"It was pretty one-sided,\\" said Fishburne, who turned down the project based on the script he first read. Ike, Fishburne added, was \\"obviously the villain of the piece, but there was no explanation as to why he behaved the way he behaved - why she was with him for 16 to 20 years, what made her stay.\\" The writers made some changes and though Ike is still shown as a pretty despicable sort, the film offers at least some insight into him - most notably a scene in which Ike recalls watching, at age 6, his father's death from wounds suffered in a fight over a woman. The changes helped persuade Fishburne to do the role, but he says that Bassett's casting as Tina \\"was the deciding factor.\\" Fishburne did not have Ike Turner around as a role model as much as he would have liked. He met him once during production of the film. \\"He was not particularly welcome on this project,\\" Fishburne says. The actor's only meeting was a brief introduction when Ike showed up at the Turners' former home in View Park during a location shoot. Ike signed some autographs and showed Fishburne his walk. \\"It was nice to meet him,\\" says Fishburne. \\"Regardless of his actions, he was so much a part of Tina's life. The movie is about him just as much as her. It's unfortunate that he wasn't welcomed, that both of them weren't around more.\\" Director Brian Gibson had no contact with Ike. \\"I never spoke to him,\\" says Gibson. \\"I was not allowed to. Disney felt that it would not be a good idea.\\" Screenwriter Kate Lanier omitted much of the brutality Tina Turner said she endured in her book. Her character was also sanitized, most notably her relationship with saxophonist Raymond Hill and the birth of their son was excluded from the film. Lanier admitted that Tina Turner was not happy with certain aspects of the film because some parts were fictionalized. Tina Turner tried to talk to the Disney filmmakers about the script. In 1993, she told Vanity Fair that they saw \\"a deep need\\" to make a film about \\"a woman who was a victim to a con man. How weak! How shallow! How dare you think that was what I was? I was in control every minute there. I was there because I wanted to be, because I had promised.\\" She added, \\"O.K. so if I was a victim, fine. Maybe I was a victim for a short while. But give me credit for thinking the whole time I was there. See, I do have pride.\\" Inaccuracies Though most of the scenes from the film were somehow depicted from Tina Turner's autobiography I, Tina, some other elements were \\"fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\\" * Ike did not sing or play guitar on the record \\"Rocket 88\\" as depicted in the film. Ike wrote the song and played piano on the record. His saxophonist Jackie Brenston was the vocalist. The record was released under the alias Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats who were actually Ike's band the Kings of Rhythm. * The song Anna Mae first performs onstage with Ike, \\"You Know I Love You\\", was actually a slower B.B. King blues ballad where King is lamenting over a broken relationship; Ike Turner is credited as a piano player on King's record. Tina recorded a song with the title of King's song with similar lyrics she composed with a blues rock composition. Despite this, the record is still credited as written by King on the soundtrack. * The first recording Anna Mae records, titled \\"Tina's Wish\\", in the soundtrack, was actually a 1973 track titled \\"Make Me Over\\" recorded and co-written by Tina on the album, Nutbush City Limits. Her first recording is a 1958 Ike Turner song called \\"Boxtop\\", a calypso-ish rock number featuring Carlson Oliver singing with her and Ike who sings bass-baritone on the track. * A theater marquee announces a 1960 show starring \\"Otis Redding, Martha and the Vandellas, Ike and Tina Turner.\\" In reality, Martha and the Vandellas were known as The Del-Phis until 1961. Otis Redding didn't become a solo act until 1962. * In the film, Anna Mae learns of her name change to Tina Turner after the song is played on a radio in the hospital where a groggy Anna had given birth. In reality, however, Tina saw a vinyl copy of the song that showcased the name \\"Ike & Tina Turner.\\" * In real life, Ike didn't call her Anna Mae, he called her Ann. Even after she received the stage name Tina Turner, family and friends called her Ann. * The film insinuates that Tina's firstborn Craig is Ike's biological child. In reality, Craig Turner (1958‚Äì2018) was Tina's son with Ike's saxophonist Raymond Hill. Ike later adopted Craig. Tina gave birth to her son Ronnie, fathered by Ike in 1960. * The film depicts the couple getting married after Ike and his entourage sneak Tina out of the hospital. In reality, Tina wrote in her book I, Tina that Ike was not present for the birth of their son. Tina checked herself out of the hospital after she gave birth when discovered the woman Ike hired to substitute as \\"Tina Turner\\" while she recuperated was a prostitute using that name to get clients. Tina got into a fight with the woman and she fired her. The next day Tina performed a show. Ike wrote in his book Takin' Back My Name that he was unaware the woman was a prostitute, and he was out of town to attend a court hearing in St. Louis when Tina gave birth in Los Angeles. They married in 1962, two years after the birth of their son. * Lorraine, the mother of Ike's two sons Ike Jr and Michael did not drop them off at his home with Tina as depicted in the film. In reality, Ike went to St. Louis and brought his sons to Los Angeles after Lorraine informed him she was going to leave them there. Tina also brought her son Craig to live with them. * A reenactment clip of an interview with Ike & Tina was featured in 1964, rather than 1971 where the real-life Turners were interviewed backstage at Caesar's Palace in a similar posture: with Tina talking throughout and Ike keeping silent with his back to Tina, smoking a cigarette. * In a scene dated 1968, Ike and Tina open for The Rolling Stones, performing \\"Proud Mary.\\" In reality, Ike and Tina didn't perform \\"Proud Mary\\" until after it was released by Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1969. The Rolling Stones didn't have any concerts in 1968; Ike and Tina opened for them in 1966 and 1969. * The characters Jackie and Frost did not exist in real life. Jackie represents an amalgamation of Ikettes and associates of Tina. * The infamous \\"eat the cake Anna Mae\\" scene was an exaggerated reenactment of a real-life incident that occurred during the early years of the Revue where Tina recalled a waitress giving her a pound cake while Tina was sitting in Ike's Cadillac. Though Tina said she didn't order it, Ike insisted she did and ordered her to \\"eat all of it.\\" * The scene where Ike rapes Tina during the recording of \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" was also exaggerated from what Tina stated in her book that sometimes after Ike would hit her, he then would have sex with her. Tina alleged that after Ike first hit her, he ordered her to bed, to which she later stated was \\"like rape.\\" Ike maintained that he never raped Tina. Also, \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" was recorded at the Turners' Bolic Sound recording studio, not at their home as depicted in the film. * The film depicts Tina's suicide attempt in 1974 when it actually occurred six years prior in 1968. * Ike did not tell Tina \\"if you don't make it, I'll kill you\\" as depicted in the ambulance scene. Tina said in her book that after her suicide attempt she joked with a friend that she was so afraid of Ike, he probably threatened her which is why she survived. Tina was unconscious so she didn't know what he actually said. Ike said in his book that he scolded Tina as his way of motivating her to fight for her life. * During the time Tina is planning her comeback in the early 1980s, a reenactment of an interview features Tina rehearsing her song \\"I Might Have Been Queen.\\" The song would be recorded for her comeback album, Private Dancer. * The incident in the Ritz Theatre where Ike fails to scare Tina with his pistol was also exaggerated from when Tina claimed that Ike tried to send people to threaten to kill her and her associates after she left him. Ike did not threaten Tina in person with a gun as depicted. * Before performing \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" at the Ritz in 1983, the emcee announces that it was her \\"first appearance\\" though she first performed there in 1981. Her 1983 performance there occurred before the recording of \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" and led to Capitol Records signing a contract with her. Reception=Critical response= The film received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating of 96% based on 53 reviews. The site's consensus is : \\"With a fascinating real-life story and powerhouse performances from Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, What's Love Got to Do with It is a can't miss biopic.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F. Janet Maslin of The New York Times, wrote: \\"The brilliant, mercurial portrayal of Ike Turner by Laurence Fishburne, formerly known as Larry, is what elevates ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs Love Got to Do With It‚Äô beyond the realm of run-of-the-mill biography.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave it 4 out of 4, calling it: \\"A powerful, joyful, raw, energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers Ike and Tina Turner.\\" Ike Turner said that the film and Tina Turner's book are \\"filled with lies.\\" In his autobiography Takin' Back My Name, he said that the film damaged his reputation because of the negative portrayal of himself. At Turner's funeral, Phil Spector slammed the film (and Tina's book) as a \\"piece of trash\\" which \\"demonized and vilified Ike.\\" Tina Turner stated she wished the film had more truth to it and she was not proud that the film had her being portrayed as a \\"victim.\\" In 2018, Turner revealed to Oprah Winfrey that she only recently watched the film. She said, \\"I watched a little bit of it, but I didn't finish it because that was not how things went. Oprah, I didn't realize they would change the details so much.\\" =Accolades= Bassett won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture.

It tells the true story of George III of Great Britain's deteriorating mental health, and his equally declining relationship with his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, particularly focusing on the period around the Regency Crisis of 1788-89\\\\. Modern medicine has suggested that the King's symptoms were the result of acute intermittent porphyria, although this theory has been vigorously challenged, most notably by a research project based at St George's, University of London, which concluded that George III did actually suffer from mental illness after all.What Was The Truth About The Madness Of George III? The Madness of King George won the BAFTA Awards in 1995 for Outstanding British Film and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Nigel Hawthorne, who was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The movie won the Oscar for Best Art Direction; and was also nominated for Oscars for Best Supporting Actress for Mirren, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Helen Mirren also won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and Hytner was nominated for the Palme d'Or. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted The Madness of King George the 42nd greatest British film of all time. Plot The film depicts the ordeal of King George III whose bout of madness in 1788 touched off the Regency Crisis of 1788, triggering a power struggle between factions of Parliament under the Tory Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and the reform-minded Leader of the Opposition Charles James Fox. At first, the King's habits appear mildly eccentric, and are purposely ignored for reasons of state. The King is seen as being highly concerned with the wellbeing and productivity of Great Britain, and continually exhibits an encyclopedic knowledge of the families of even the most obscure royal appointments. In fact, the King is growing more unsettled, largely over the loss of America. The King's eldest son George, Prince of Wales, aggravates the situation, knowing that he would be named regent in the event the King was found incapacitated. George chafes under his father's repeated criticism, but also hopes for regency to allow him greater freedom to marry his Catholic mistress Mrs. Fitzherbert. George also knows that he has the moral support of Fox, who is eager to put across an agenda unlikely to pass under the current administration, including abolition of the slave trade and friendlier relations with America. Knowing that the King's behaviour is exacerbated in public, the Prince arranges for a concert playing the music of Handel. The King reacts as expected, interrupting the musicians, acting inappropriately towards Lady Pembroke, Lady of the Bedchamber, and finally assaulting his son. The King's madness is treated using the relatively primitive medical practices of the time, which include blistering and purges, led on particularly by the Prince of Wales' personal physician, Dr. Warren. Eventually, Lady Pembroke recommends Dr. Francis Willis, an ex-minister who attempts to cure the insane through new procedures, and who begins his restoration of the King's mental state by enforcing a strict regimen of strapping the King into a waistcoat and restraining him whenever he shows signs of his insanity or otherwise resists recovery. Meanwhile, the Whig opposition led by Fox confronts Pitt's increasingly unpopular Tory government with a bill that would give the Prince powers of regency. Meanwhile, Baron Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, discovers that the Prince was secretly and illegally married to his Catholic mistress. Thurlow pays the minister to keep his mouth shut, and himself tears out a record of the marriage from church rolls. The King soon shows signs of recovery, becoming less eccentric and arrives in Parliament in time to thwart passage of the Regency bill. Restored, the King asserts control over his family, forcing the Prince to \\"put away\\" his mistress. With the crisis averted, those who had been closest to the King are summarily dismissed from service, including Dr. Willis. During conversations with Pitt, the King appears more at ease and in control of himself. He is less antagonized by America, but also shows signs that his insanity remains. A final message states that the King likely suffered from porphyria, noting that it is an incurable chronic condition and is hereditary. Cast * Nigel Hawthorne as King George III * Helen Mirren as Queen Charlotte * Ian Holm as Francis Willis * Amanda Donohoe as Lady Pembroke, Lady of the Bedchamber * Rupert Graves as Colonel Greville * Geoffrey Palmer as Doctor Warren * Rupert Everett as George, Prince of Wales * Jim Carter as Charles James Fox, Leader of the Opposition * Julian Rhind-Tutt as Frederick, the Duke of York * Julian Wadham as William Pitt the Younger, Prime Minister * Anthony Calf as Lord Charles FitzRoy * Adrian Scarborough as Fortnum * John Wood as Lord Chancellor Lord Thurlow * Jeremy Child as Black Rod * Struan Rodger as Henry Dundas * Barry Stanton as Sheridan * Janine Duvitski as Margaret Nicholson * Caroline Harker as Mrs. Fitzherbert * Roger Hammond as Baker * Cyril Shaps as Pepys * Selina Cadell as Mrs. Cordwell * Alan Bennett as a backbench MP whose speech is interrupted by everyone running out to see the King * Nicholas Selby as Speaker Production Alan Bennett insisted that director Nicholas Hytner and actor Nigel Hawthorne do the film version, after having done the play. =Title change= In adapting the play to film, the director Nicholas Hytner changed the name from The Madness of George III to The Madness of King George for American audiences, to clarify George III's royalty. A popular explanation developed that the change was made because there was a worry that American audiences would think it was a sequel and not go to see it, assuming they had missed \\"I\\" and \\"II\\". An interview revealed: \\"That's not totally untrue,\\" said Hytner, laughing. \\"But there was also the factor that it was felt necessary to get the word King into the title.\\" =Filming locations= Principal photography took place from 11 July to 9 September 1994. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios and on location at: * Arundel Castle, Arundel, West Sussex * Divinity School, Oxford * Broughton Castle, Banbury, Oxfordshire * Eton College, Eton, Berkshire * Royal Naval College, Greenwich * St. Paul's Cathedral, London * Syon House, Brentford, Middlesex * Thame Park, Oxfordshire * Wilton House, Wilton, Wiltshire Reception=Box office= The Madness of King George debuted strongly at the box office. The film grossed $15,238,689 from 464 North American venues. =Critical response= The film received largely positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 93% \\"Certified Fresh\\" score based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.83/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Thanks largely to stellar all-around performances from a talented cast, The Madness of King George is a funny, entertaining, and immensely likable adaptation of the eponymous stage production.\\" Reviewing the film for Variety, Emanuel Levy praised the film highly, writing: \\"Under Hytner's guidance, the cast, composed of some of the best actors in British cinema, rises to the occasion... Boasting a rich period look, almost every shot is filled with handsome, emotionally charged composition.\\"Review: 'The Madness of King George'. Retrieved on 8 October 2016 from https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/the-madness-of-king- george-2-1200439660/. John Simon of The National Review wrote, \\"The Madness of King George III has survived the transfer from stage to screen, and emerges equally enjoyable on film.\\" Simon praised all the leading actors and most of the supporting cast with the exception of Jim Carter's portrayal of Fox, which he said lacked charisma.

(; September 8, 1837 ‚Äì February 17, 1913), better known by his pen name Joaquin Miller (), was an American poet, author, and frontiersman. He is nicknamed the \\"Poet of the Sierras\\" after the Sierra Nevada, about which he wrote in his Songs of the Sierras (1871). Life=Early years and family= Joaquin Miller's parents were Hulings Miller and Margaret (n√©e Witt), who married January 3, 1836, in Union County, Indiana. Their second son, Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, was born in 1837 near Union County, Indiana. Frost, 11 For unknown reasons, Miller later claimed his birth date was November 10, 1841.Marberry, 1‚Äì3 He said he was born in Millersville, Indiana, a town he claimed was founded by his father, while on a wagon heading west.Hapke, Laura. Girls Who Went Wrong: Prostitutes in American Fiction, 1885-1917. Popular Press, 1989: 21. After leaving Union County, Miller's father then moved the family to Grant County, Indiana to a location near the Mississinewa River and near the Miami Indian Reservation.

Besides adopting the pen name \\"Joaquin\\", he later changed his middle name from Hiner to Heine to evoke the German poet Heinrich Heine. While Miller was a young boy, probably between 1850 and 1852, his family moved to Oregon and settled in the Willamette Valley, establishing a farm in what would become Lane County. As a young man, he moved to northern California during the California Gold Rush years, and had a variety of adventures, including spending a year living in a Native American village, and being wounded in a battle with Native Americans. A number of his popular works, Life Amongst the Modocs, An Elk Hunt, and The Battle of Castle Crags, draw on these experiences. He was wounded in the cheek and neck with an arrow during this latter battle, recuperating at the Gold Rush-era mining town of Portuguese Flat. =Wanderings and early writings= He accompanied William Walker on the latter's 1855 filibustering expedition to Nicaragua. In the spring of 1857, Miller took part in an expedition against the Pit River Tribe after they killed a white man on Pit River.Peterson, 37 Years later, he claimed that he had sided with the Native Americans and was run out of town for it.Marberry, 23 He was widely rumored to have married an Indian woman, possibly a Wintu princess who nursed him back to health after he was wounded by Modocs, and to have fathered with her a daughter named Cali-Shasta, or \\"Lily of the Shasta.\\" Although Miller soon left the area to pursue other adventures, in the 1870s he sought out Cali-Shasta, then in her teens, and took her to San Francisco to be educated by his friend Ina Coolbrith. Contemporaries believed that Miller's \\"Indian wife\\" was the woman later kidnapped by Modocs and held in captivity for some years until rescued by a man named Jim Brock (whom she married), but when \\"Amanda Brock\\" died in 1909, Miller denied news reports describing his supposed romance with her. He credited her with saving his life, but said she had always been a platonic friend. Spending a short time in the mining camps of northern Idaho, Miller found his way to Canyon City, Oregon by 1864 where he was elected the third Judge of Grant County. His old cabin in Canyon City is still standing. Miller's exploits included a variety of occupations: mining-camp cook (who came down with scurvy from only eating what he cooked), lawyer and a judge, newspaper writer, Pony Express rider, and horse thief. On July 10, 1859, Miller was caught stealing a horse gelding valued at $80, a saddle worth $15, and other items.Peterson, 40 He was jailed briefly in Shasta County for the crime, and various accounts give other incidents of his repeating this crime in California and Oregon. Miller earned an estimated $3,000 working as a Pony Express rider, and used the money to move to Oregon. With the help of his friend, Senator Joseph Lane, he became editor of the Democratic Register in Eugene,Marberry, 44 a role he held from March 15 to September 20, 1862.Peterson, 50 Though no copies survive, it was known as sympathetic to the Confederacy until it was forced to shut downMarberry, 45 because of its treasonable character. That year, Miller married Theresa Dyer on September 12, 1862, in her home four days after meeting herFrost, 36 in Port Orford, Oregon. He had corresponded with her after exchanging poems with her for critique and chasing away a competing suitor.Marberry, 45‚Äì46 She published poetry under the pen name Minnie Myrtle. The couple had three children: Maud, George, and Henry, although Miller would later claim the baby Henry was not his own. In 1868, Miller paid for the publication of 500 copies of his first book of poetry, Specimens.Marberry, 55 It was unnoticed and Miller gave away more copies than he sold. Few have survived.Frost, 55 The author's despair and disappointment was reflected in his second book, Joaquin et al., the next year.Lewis, Nathaniel. Unsettling the Literary West: Authenticity and Authorship. University of Nebraska Press, 2003: 98. Dyer filed for divorce on April 4, 1870, claiming they had a third child, Henry Mark, the year before and that Miller was \\"wholly\\" neglectful.Frost, 44 The court declared them divorced on April 19 and Dyer was granted custody of the baby while the two older children were left in the care of her mother. Miller was ordered to pay $200 per year in child support.Frost, 46 Miller believed the divorce prevented him from being nominated for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court.Peterson, 58 He never denied her charges that he was neglectful of her and their children and was rarely home.Marberry, 58‚Äì59 He also may have had an affair with actress Adah Isaacs Menken shortly into the marriage.Marberry, 47‚Äì48 =Travels= Joaquin Miller, 1903 Miller had sent a copy of Joaquin, et al. to Bret Harte, who offered advice that he avoid \\"faults of excess\\" and encouragingly wrote, \\"you on your way to become a poet.\\"Nissen, Axel. Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper. University of Mississippi Press, 2000: 93‚Äì94. The next summer, July 1870, Miller traveled to San Francisco with borrowed money and there befriended Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith. Stoddard was the first to meet him at the dock and, as he recalled, Miller's first words to him were, \\"Well, let us go and talk with the poets.\\"Marberry, 64 Miller went to England, where he was celebrated as a frontier oddity. There, in May 1871, Miller published Songs of the Sierras, the book which finalized his nickname as the \\"Poet of the Sierras\\".Marberry, 93‚Äì94 It was well received by the British press and members of the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood, particularly Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. While in England, he was one of the few Americans invited into the Savage Club along with Julian Hawthorne, son of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The younger Hawthorne referred to Miller as \\"a licensed libertine\\" but admitted to finding him \\"charming, amiable, and harmless\\".Marberry, 85‚Äì86 Rather abruptly, Miller left England in September 1871 and landed in New York. At the encouragement of family, he made his way to Easton, Pennsylvania to visit his dying brother before returning to Oregon; his father died shortly thereafter. Miller eventually settled in California, where he grew fruit and published his poems and other works. In 1877, Miller adapted his First Fam'lies of the Sierras into a play, The Danites, or, the Heart of the Sierras. It opened on August 22 in New York with McKee Rankin as the main character.Marberry, 158‚Äì159 The anti-Mormon play, which featured Danites hunting the daughter of one of the murderers of Joseph Smith, became one of the most commercially successful in a series of anti-Mormon dramas at the time. The Spirit of the Times, however, attributed its success to curious audience members expecting a disastrous failure and instead discovering a good show: \\"The play proved to possess more than ordinary merit, and if it is not a great work, it is decidedly not a very bad one.\\"Jones, Megan Sanborn. Performing American Identity in Anti-Mormon Melodrama. Taylor & Francis, 2009: 103. The Danites was extended from a run of only a few days to one of seven straight weeks before moving to another theatre and, ultimately, was performed to such a degree that it rivaled the popularity of Uncle Tom's Cabin.Marberry, 159‚Äì160 It was published in book form later in 1877.Peterson, 179 Miller later admitted that he regretted the anti-Mormon tone.Marberry, 160 Miller married for a third time on September 8, 1879 to Abigail Leland, in New York City. =Later years and death= Miller circa 1905 In 1886, Miller published The Destruction of Gotham, a book which was one of the earliest to depict a prostitute as a heroine. That year, he moved to Oakland, California, and built a home for himself he called \\"The Hights\\" . He remained there until his death in 1913. Japanese poet Yone Noguchi came to The Hights in 1894 and spent the next four years there as an unpaid laborer in exchange for room and board. While living there, he published his first book, Seen or Unseen; or, Monologues of a Homeless Snail (1897). Though he referred to Miller as \\"the most natural man\\", Noguchi reflected on those years as his most difficult in the United States and later fictionalized his experience in The American Diary of a Japanese Girl.Wyatt, David. Five Fires: Race, Catastrophe, and the Shaping of California. Oxford University Press, 1999: 188. In 1897, Miller traveled to the Yukon as a newspaper correspondent.Marberry, 237 He saw Alaska for the first time on July 30.Frost, 110 His dispatches, many of which were written before reaching Alaska, incorrectly implied an easy and inexpensive trip. Miller himself nearly froze to death; two toes were lost to frostbite.Marberry, 238‚Äì242 Miller died on February 17, 1913, surrounded by friends and family. His last words were recorded as \\"Take me away; take me away!\\" The poet had asked to be cremated by friends in the funeral pyre he built at The Hights with no religious ceremony and without being embalmed. His wishes were mostly ignored and the funeral on February 19 drew thousands of curious onlookers.Marberry, 280‚Äì281 The preacher who spoke referred to Miller as \\"the last of America's great poets.\\"Frost, 112 On May 23, members of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco and the Press Club returned to Miller's funeral pyre to burn the urn which contained his ashes, allowing them to scatter. He had left no will and his estate ‚Äî estimated at $100,000 ‚Äî was divided between his wife, Abigail and daughter, Juanita.Marberry, 282‚Äì283 Critical response and reputation Miller in later years Joaquin Miller Cabin in Washington, D.C.'s Rock Creek Park In his time, Miller was known for his dishonesty and womanizing. His friend and contemporary Ambrose Bierce said of him, \\"In impugning Mr. Miller's veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be sorry to be understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than he really has. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood.\\" Miller was championed, although not enthusiastically, by Bret Harte and Ambrose Bierce. Bierce, who once called Miller \\"the greatest-hearted man I ever knew\\" also is quoted as saying that he was \\"the greatest liar this country ever produced. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth.\\" Miller's response was, \\"I always wondered why God made Bierce.\\" Called the \\"Poet of the Sierras\\" and the \\"Byron of the Rockies\\", he may have been more of a celebrity in England than in his native U.S. Much of his reputation, however, came not from his poetry but from the image he created for himself by capitalizing on the stereotypical image of Western frontiersmen.Lewis, Nathaniel. Unsettling the Literary West: Authenticity and Authorship. University of Nebraska Press, 2003: 78. As poet Bayard Taylor bitterly noted in 1876, British audiences \\"place the simulated savagery of Joaquin Miller beside the pure and serene muse of Longfellow.\\"Loving, Jerome. Mark Twain: The Adventures of Samuel L. Clemens. University of California Press, 2010: 234. Critics made much of Miller's poor spelling and rhymes; he once rhymed \\"Goethe\\" and \\"teeth\\". Henry Cuyler Bunner satirized the error in a poem titled \\"Shake, Mulleary, and Go-ethe\\".Untermeyer, Louis. Modern American Poetry. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1921: 64. Miller himself once admitted, \\"I'm damned if I could tell the difference between a hexameter and a pentameter to save my scalp.\\"Marberry, 90 The Westminster Review referred to Miller's poetry as \\"Whitman without the coarseness\\".Peterson, 66 For a time, Miller's poem \\"Columbus\\" was one of the most widely known American poems, memorized and recited by legions of schoolchildren. Miller is remembered today, among other reasons, for lines from his poem in honor of \\"Burns and Byron\\": :In men whom men condemn as ill ::I find so much of goodness still. :In men whom men pronounce divine ::I find so much of sin and blot :I do not dare to draw a line ::Between the two, where God has not. Legacy A historical marker for his birthplace was unveiled October 10, 1915, on U.S. 27 north of Liberty in Union County, Indiana. Joaquin Miller Cabin is located in Washington, DC. The Hights, the Oakland home Miller built at the end of his life, was purchased by the city of Oakland in 1919, and is known as the Joaquin Miller House, located in Joaquin Miller Park. It is a designated California Historical Landmark. He planted the surrounding trees and he personally built, on the eminence to the north, his own funeral pyre and monuments dedicated to Moses, General John C. Fr√©mont, and the poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Several schools in California are named for him, including Miller Middle School in San Jose, Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Oakland, and Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Burbank. In 1965, the actor Sean McClory was cast as Miller, with June Lockhart in the role of Ina Coolbrith, in the episode \\"Magic Locket\\" of the syndicated western series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Ronald W. Reagan. In the story line, Coolbrith develops a tenuous friendship with the teen-aged \\"Dorita Duncan\\" (Kathy Garver), later known as the dancer Isadora Duncan. Actor George Paulsin portrayed a youthful Joaquin Miller in the Death Valley Days episode \\"Early Candle Lighten\\", hosted by Dale Robertson. The episode, which aired April 24, 1970, marked Paulsin's first screen appearance and the last of the series' 452 episodes. In the story line, a cook at a gold camp in the Arizona Territory faces hanging for stealing nuggets from the miners. His assistant, \\"Nat Miller\\", played by Paulsin, thinks he can save his life by bringing the cook's sister from Tucson. It was at this gold camp that Miller perfected his penchant for western poetry. In the 1978 British miniseries Lillie, actor Bruce Boa as Miller startles guests when Lillie Langtry arrives at a ball by scattering rose petals in her path. {{cite weburl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077042/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt List of works Life Amongst the Modocs (1873) *Specimens (1868) *Joaquin et al.

Cort, and Michael Nolin, and written by Patrick Sheane Duncan. The film stars Richard Dreyfuss in the title role of Glenn Holland, a high-school music teacher who aspires to write his own composition while struggling with a lack of quality time with his wife and profoundly deaf son. The cast also includes Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, and Jay Thomas. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. Richard Dreyfuss received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor. Plot In Portland, Oregon in 1964, 30-year-old Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a talented musician and composer who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a professional musical performer. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris (Glenne Headley), and to enable him to compose a piece of orchestral music, Holland accepts a teaching position at John F. Kennedy High School. Unfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a marginalized figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in Kennedy High's administration, including the Vice-Principal Gene Wolters (William H. Macy), resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. Principal Ellen Jacobs (Olympia Dukakis) continuously reminds him that teaching is about much more than just giving knowledge, but also about giving an outlet for the knowledge to be useful. Eventually Holland finds success using rock and roll as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students. Although Jacobs and Wolters initially challenge this curriculum move, Mr. Holland bluntly defends himself, claiming he will use any genre of music to teach appreciation, which satisfies them. Football coach, and Army veteran Bill Meister (Jay Thomas) is desperate to improve the failing grade of Louis Russ, a student of his enough to where he can retain his wrestling eligibility. Civilian Holland on the other hand has been saddled with the additional duties of coordinating the marching band. In trade, Meister gets the band competition-ready and after a number of aggravating attempts, Holland equally succeeds in getting Louis to play the bass drum, thereby raising his grade and maintaining his sports eligibility. Louis goes on to make the state- wrestling finals three years running. As Holland's duties at school increase, his lack of quality time with Iris becomes problematic when their infant son Coltrane \\"Cole\\" is found to be 90% deaf. Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child. Iris willingly learns American Sign Language to communicate with her son, but Holland resists. This causes further estrangement within his family. In 1972, Holland learns that Louis Russ was killed in Vietnam. At the time, he is battling Statler, a gifted but overconfident and lazy student. To teach him a lesson in humility, Holland forces Statler to accompany him to Lou Russ's military funeral, which improves both Stadler's attitude as well as his performance. Principal Jacobs soon retires from her duties as principal, and Wolters takes over as principal of John F. Kennedy high. As the years progress, Holland grows closer to his students at Kennedy High but more distant from his own son. He addresses a series of challenges created by people who are either hesitant or hostile towards the concept of musical excellence within the walls of the average American high school and inspires a number of students as a result, but never has private time for himself or his family. In 1980, while organizing a George Gershwin revue for the senior class play, he inspires leading lady Rowena Morgan to pursue a career in singing, inspiring her go to NYC to do so when the play is over. She invites Mr. Holland to join her, but despite the temptation, Holland cannot bring himself to leave his family, but he does see her off, and arranges for a former bandmate of his to take her in. Soon afterwards, Holland has a confrontation with his son, after assuming his son wouldn't understand the tragedy of John Lennon's recent murder. Holland then finally realizes he needs to make some compromises for the sake of their relationship. He organizes a concert with visual lighting effects for Cole and his fellow hearing-impaired students to enjoy, and sings and signs John Lennon's 'Beautiful Boy' dedicating it to Cole. Holland's continuing duties as teacher and father repeatedly delay the completion of his own orchestral composition. Eventually, he reaches an age when it is too late to have a realistic chance of finding financial backing, or ever having it performed live. At the conclusion of the 1994‚Äì1995 academic year, the adversaries of the Kennedy High music program win a decisive institutional victory. Wolters faces budget cuts from the board of education. He responds by eliminating music, art, and drama from the school curriculum leading to Holland's early retirement. He realizes that his career in music is likely over, thinking that his former students have mostly forgotten him and is dejected at his failure ever to have his composition, which he views as his life's work, performed. On his final day as a teacher, the 60-year-old Holland enters the school auditorium to see that hundreds of his former students have secretly returned to the school to celebrate his career upon hearing of his retirement. Holland's orchestral piece, never before heard in public, has been put before the musicians by his wife and son, who's now a teacher himself. One of his most musically challenged students, Gertrude Lang, now the Governor of Oregon, takes the podium and explains to Holland that the symphony he wrote is not his only legacy: it also includes the people he has inspired and taught, all of the people he has helped to make a better person. Lang then sits among the musicians, drawn from Holland's students over the decades, with her clarinet, but not before asking Holland to step up on stage and serve as their conductor for the premiere performance of Mr. Holland's Opus (\\"An American Symphony\\"). A proud Iris and Cole look on, appreciating the affection and respect that Holland receives. Cast * Richard Dreyfuss as Glenn Holland, a composer who becomes a music teacher at John F.

Vajna. The film was written by Stone, Christopher Wilkinson, and Stephen J. Rievele, with significant contributions from \\"project consultants\\" Christopher Scheer and Robert Scheer. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins. The film portrays Nixon as a complex and, in many respects, admirable, though deeply flawed, person. Nixon begins with a disclaimer that the film is \\"an attempt to understand the truth [...] based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete historical record.\\" The cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, Annabeth Gish, Marley Shelton, Powers Boothe, J. T. Walsh, E. G. Marshall, James Woods, Paul Sorvino, Bob Hoskins, Larry Hagman, Ed Harris and David Hyde Pierce, plus archival appearances from political figures such as President Bill Clinton in TV footage from the Nixon funeral service. Though the film was a box office bomb, it received positive reviews from critics, with Hopkins' performance receiving particular praise. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Supporting Actress (Joan Allen), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Original Screenplay. This was Stone's second of three films about the American presidency, made four years after JFK, about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and followed 13 years later by W., about George W. Bush. Plot In 1972, the White House Plumbers break into The Watergate and are subsequently arrested. Eighteen months later in December 1973, Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig (Powers Boothe), brings Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) audio tapes for Nixon to listen to. The two men discuss the Watergate scandal and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon uses profanity when discussing John Dean, James McCord and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he hasn't been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier. Nixon starts the taping system, which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972, about one week after the break-in, during a meeting with H. R. Haldeman (James Woods), John Ehrlichman (J. T. Walsh) and Dean (David Hyde Pierce). Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the \\"smoking gun\\" tape to Haldeman. The film covers most aspects of Nixon's life and political career and implies that Nixon and his wife abused alcohol and prescription medications. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of phlebitis and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis, are also shown, and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues. The film also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the John F. Kennedy assassination through references to the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in Kennedy's assassination and, eventually, Watergate. The film ends with Nixon's resignation and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, Army One.

The character may be a reference to Nixon's meetings with Clint Murchison, Sr., although he also illuminates Nixon's relationships with Howard Hughes, H. L. Hunt and other entrepreneurs. *Tony Lo Bianco as Johnny Roselli *George Plimpton as the President's lawyer Production=Origins= Eric Hamburg, former speechwriter and staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, got the idea of a film about Nixon after having dinner with Oliver Stone. Originally, Oliver Stone had been developing two projects -- the musical Evita and a movie about Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. When they both did not get made, Stone turned his attention to a biopic about Richard Nixon. The former President's death on April 22, 1994, was also a key factor in Stone's decision to make a Nixon film. He pitched the film to Warner Bros., but, according to the director, they saw it, \\"as a bunch of unattractive older white men sitting around in suits, with a lot of dialogue and not enough action\\". In 1993, Hamburg mentioned the idea of a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment on November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as \\"the Beast\\", which Wilkinson describes as \\"a headless monster that lurches through postwar history,\\" a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, and helped Nixon's rise to power and his fall from it as well. Stone said in an interview that Nixon realizes that \\"the Beast\\" \\"is more powerful than he is. We can't get into it that much, but we hint at it so many times -- the military-industrial complex, the forces of money\\". In another interview, the director elaborates, It was this concept that convinced Stone to make Nixon and he told Hamburg to hire Rivele and Wilkinson. Stone commissioned the first draft of the film's screenplay in the fall of 1993. Rivele and Wilkinson delivered the first draft of their script on June 17, 1994, the anniversary of the Watergate scandal. Stone loved the script but felt that the third act and the ending needed more work. They wrote another draft and delivered it on August 9, the 20th anniversary of Nixon's resignation. =Pre-production= Stone immersed himself in research with the help of Hamburg. With Hamburg and actors Hopkins and James Woods, Stone flew to Washington, D.C. and interviewed the surviving members of Nixon's inner circle: lawyer Leonard Garment and Attorney General Elliot Richardson. He also interviewed Robert McNamara, a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired Alexander Butterfield, a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant to make sure that the Oval Office was realistically depicted, former deputy White House counsel John Sears, and John Dean, who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film. Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact John Ehrlichman because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed. Hopkins watched a lot of documentary footage on Nixon. At night, he would go to sleep with the Nixon footage playing, letting it seep into his subconscious. Hopkins said, \\"It's taking in all this information and if you're relaxed enough, it begins to take you over.\\" Stone originally had a three-picture deal with Regency Enterprises which included JFK, Heaven and Earth, and Natural Born Killers. After the success of Killers, Arnon Milchan, head of Regency, signed Stone for three more motion pictures. Stone could make any film up to a budget of $42.5 million. When Stone told Milchan that he wanted to make Nixon, Milchan, who was not keen on the idea, told the director that he would only give him $35 million, thinking that this would cause Stone to abandon the project. Stone took the project to Hungarian financier Andrew G. Vajna who had co-financing deal with Disney. Vajna's company, Cinergi Pictures, were willing to finance the $38 million film. This angered Milchan who claimed that Nixon was his film because of his three- picture deal with Stone and he threatened to sue. He withdrew after Stone paid him an undisclosed amount. Stone was finalizing the film's budget a week before shooting was to begin. He made a deal with Cinergi and Disney's Hollywood Pictures in order to supply the $43 million budget. To cut costs, Stone leased the White House sets from Rob Reiner's film The American President. =Casting= The studio did not like Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson -- two of Stone's original choices. The director also considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, \\"The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon.\\" When the actor met the director he got the impression that Stone was \\"one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away.\\" What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and \\"impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film when he talks about his mother and father. That affected me.\\" Hopkins wore a hair piece and false teeth \\"to hint at a physical resemblance to Nixon\\". When Beatty was thinking about doing the film, he insisted on doing a reading of the script with an actress and Joan Allen was flown in from New York City. Afterwards, Beatty told Stone that he had found his Pat Nixon. =Principal photography= The film began shooting on May 1, 1995 but there was a week of pre-shooting at the end of April to film scenes that would be used as part of a mock documentary about Nixon's career. Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, \\"There were moments when I wanted to get out, when I wanted to just do a nice Knots Landing or something.\\" Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims he told Hopkins that he thought \\"there was room for improvement\\" and that he would be willing to help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was \\"doing the whole thing wrong\\" and that he was an \\"expert\\" who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, \\"I'd always tell him how great he was in Psycho. I'd call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins.\\" In Spring of 1994, Time magazine reported that an early draft of the screenplay linked Nixon to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The facts contained in the script were based on research from various sources, including documents, transcripts and hours of footage from the Nixon White House. Dean said about the film's accuracy: \\"In the larger picture, it reflected accurately what happened.\\" Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, \\"The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, it was based on research and interpretation.\\" John Taylor, head of the Nixon Presidential Library, leaked a copy of the script to Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, who threatened to sue the production. In response, Stone cut out all scenes with Helms from the theatrical print and claimed that he did for \\"artistic reasons\\" only to reinstate this footage on the home video release. During the post-production phase, Stone had his editors in three different rooms with the scenes from the film revolving from one room to another, \\"depending on how successful they were\\". If one editor wasn't successful with a scene then it went to another. Stone said that it was \\"the most intense post- I've ever done, even more intense than JFK\\" because they were screening the film three times a week, making changes in 48‚Äì72 hours, rescreening the film and then making another 48 hours of changes. =Music= The score was composed by John Williams, who previously worked with Stone on Born on the Fourth of July and JFK. Reception=Box office= In its opening weekend, Nixon grossed a total of $2.2 million in 514 theaters. The film grossed a total of $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, far below its $44 million budget. =Critical reaction= Two days before the film was released in theaters, the Richard Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda, California issued a statement on behalf of the Nixon family, calling parts of the film \\"reprehensible\\" and that it was designed to \\"defame and degrade President and Mrs. Nixon's memories in the mind of the American public\\". This statement was based on a published copy of the script. The statement also criticized Stone's depiction of Nixon's private life, that of his childhood, and his part in planning the assassination of Fidel Castro. Stone responded that his \\"purpose in making the film, Nixon was neither malicious nor defamatory\\", and was an attempt to gain \\"a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon -- the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world\\". Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Nixon's daughters saying that Stone had \\"committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history\\". Stone does not see his film as the definitive statement on Nixon but as \\"a basis to start reading, to start investigating on your own\\". Some critics took Stone to task for portraying Nixon as an alcoholic, though Stone says that was based on information from books by Stephen Ambrose, Fawn Brodie, and Tom Wicker. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for how it took \\"on the resonance of classic tragedy. Tragedy requires the fall of a hero, and one of the achievements of Nixon is to show that greatness was within his reach.\\" Ebert also placed the film on his list of the top ten films of the year. Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised Anthony Hopkins' performance and \\"his character's embattled outlook and stiff, hunched body language with amazing skill\\". Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, felt that \\"the problem here isn't accuracy. It's absurdity. Hopkins' exaggerated portrayal of Nixon is the linchpin of a film that in its conception and presentation consistently veers into camp\\". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, also had a problem with Hopkins' portrayal: \\"Hopkins, though, is a failure. He finds neither the timbre of Nixon's plummy baritone, with its wonderfully false attempts at intimacy, nor the stature of a career climber who, with raw hands, scaled the mountain and was still not high or big enough.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"It's gripping psychodrama ‚Äî just don't confuse Nixon with history.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 74% approval rating, based reviews from 61 critics, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Much like its subject's time in office, Nixon might have ended sooner -- but what remains is an engrossing, well-acted look at the rise and fall of a fascinating political figure.\\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nixon/ Metacritic gave the film a score of 66 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Accolades= It was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Allen), Best Music, Original Dramatic Score and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Entertainment Weekly ranked Nixon #40 on their \\"50 Best Biopics Ever\\" list and one of the 25 \\"Powerful Political Thrillers\\". Home media The theatrical cut of the film was released on DVD on June 15, 1999.https://www.joblo.com/blu-rays- dvds/release-dates/?month=June&year;=1999 A director's cut was released on DVD as part of an Oliver Stone boxset in 2001, running 212 mins and including 28 minutes of previously deleted scenes restored. Much of the added time consists of two scenes: one in which Nixon meets with Central Intelligence Agency director Richard Helms (played by Sam Waterston) and another on Tricia Nixon's wedding day, where J. Edgar Hoover persuades Nixon to install the taping system in the Oval Office. The Director's Cut was released individually on DVD in 2002.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113987/alternateversions The Director's Cut was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (branded as Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment) on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 19, 2008 with the first anamorphic widescreen version of the film in North America.

A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life. A mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools. The latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia, \\"groupthink\\", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes. In cognitive psychology, a mindset represents the cognitive processes activated in response to a given task (French, 2016).  History (Academic)  It would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s (Gollwitzer 1990, 2012). These studies are identified as foundational to and precursory for the study of cognition (Gollwitzer 1990, 2012). The attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated. In addition to the field of cognitive psychology, the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields (e.g., positive psychology). A characteristic of this area of study, in all its various manifestations, is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy (e.g. French, 2016). In politics A well- known example is the \\"Cold War mindset\\" prevalent in both the U.S. and USSR, which included absolute trust in two-player game theory, in the integrity of command chain, in control of nuclear materials, and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war. Although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country, the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the Cold War mindset a matter of some controversy. Most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group's own mindset. According to these commentators, power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity cannot hold power indefinitely, as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events. For example, the variations in mindset between Democratic Party and Republican Party Presidents in the U.S. may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the Kremlin with its more static bureaucracy. Modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In combination, these threats represent \\"a revolution in military affairs\\" and require very rapid adaptation to new threats and circumstances. In this context, the cost of not implementing adaptive mindsets cannot be afforded. In system thinking Building on Magoroh Maruyama's concept of Mindscape,Maruyama, M. (1980). Mindscapes and Science Theories, Current Anthropology, Vol. 21, No. 5. (Oct., 1980), pp. 589-608Maruyama, M. (1988). Dynamics among Business Practice, Aesthetics, Science, Politics and Religion. Cultural Dynamics 1988; 1; 309-335 Mindset Theory includes cultural and social orientation type values: Hierarchical Individualism (HI), Egalitarian Individualism (EI), Hierarchical Collectivism (HC), Egalitarian Collectivism (EC), Hierarchic Synergism (HS), Egalitarian Synergism (ES), Hierarchical Populism (HP), and Egalitarian Populism (EP).Yolles, M.I, Fink, G., 2014, Personality, pathology and mindsets: part 1-3. Vol. 43 n.(1) Collective Naturally, the question regarding the embodiment of a collective mindset comes to mind. Erikson's (1974) analysis of group-identities and what he calls a life-plan seems relevant here. He recounts the example of American Indians, who were meant to undergo a reeducation process meant to imbue a modern \\"life-plan\\" that aimed for a house and a richness expressed by a filled bank account. Erikson writes that the Indians' collective historic identity as buffalo hunters was oriented around such fundamentally different reasons/goals that even communication about the divergent \\"life plans\\" was itself difficult. There is a double relation between the institution embodying for example an entrepreneurial mindset and its entrepreneurial performance. Firstly, an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole, but maybe even more importantly, it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu, allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities. In short, philosophical stance codified in the mind, hence as mindset, lead to a climate that in turn causes values that lead to practice. Collective mindsets in this sense are described in such works as Hutchin's \\"Cognition in the wild\\" (1995), who analyzes a whole team of naval navigators as the cognitive unit or as computational system, or Senges' Knowledge entrepreneurship in universities (2007). There are also parallels to the emerging field of \\"collective intelligence\\" (e.g. (Zara, 2004)) and exploiting the \\"Wisdom of the crowds\\" (Surowiecki, 2005) of stakeholders. Zara notes that since collective reflection is more explicit, discursive, and conversational, it therefore needs a good ¬øgestell?‚Äîespecially when it comes to information and communication technology. Most historians use the concept of mentality or mindset to denote very slowly changing mental dispositions active over longer periods of time, but occasionally there have been efforts to also apply it to much more rapidly changing historical situations such as the French revolution (Michel Vovelle) or the short period of Allied occupation of Germany after World War II (Hentschel 2007). Specific theories= Types and theories = As previously alluded to, there is a great deal of variation within the study of mindsets. This variation includes how to define, measure, and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified. Even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset, substantial variations exist (French, 2016). Nevertheless, any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous, varied, and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy. = Mindset Agency Theory = Mindset Theory, as based on the cultural values defined by Sagiv and Schwarts, explains the nature, functions, and variables that make up the characteristics of personality. The mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by Sagive and Schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of Mindset Agency Theory. mindset space table of mindsets  Mindscape Theory  Similar to the MBTI, the mindscapes of Maruyama seek to measure individuals on a scale of characteristics and placed into four categories of personalities that make up the population of the world. Each contain differing views toward information, perception, logic, and ethics. Hierarchical Bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection. Independent Princes view the world as random, individualistic, and chaotic with a natural decay that is inevitable. Social Reformers view the world as a balance that can be maintained by symbiosis between everything. Generative Revolutionaries view the world as potential for growth through interaction and symbiosis; change is encouraged.  Sagiv- Schwarts Cultural Values  Sagiv and Schwarts explained that there were three bi-polar dimensions to culture based on values. These dimensions contain opposites in the realms of cognitive, figurative, and operative values. Cognitive: Embeddedness or Autonomy. Figurative: Mastery or Harmony. Operative: Hierarchy or Egalitarian. =Fixed and Growth Mindset = According to Carol Dweck, individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of \\"where ability comes from\\". Dweck states that there are two categories (growth mindset versus fixed mindset) that can group individuals based on their behaviour, specifically their reaction to failure. Those with a \\"fixed mindset\\" believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities, while those with a \\"growth mindset\\" believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study. In particular, an individual's mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges, such as the transition into junior high school from elementary school or losing your job. According to Dweck, individuals with a \\"growth\\" mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks. Dweck argues that the growth mindset \\"will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life\\". In a 2012 interview, Dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets:  Classroom Implications  A large part of Dweck's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education, and how these mindsets affect a student's performance in the classroom. In order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset, a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking. One of the ways educators can do this is by creating a growth-mindset culture in their classroom that provides the right kind of praise and encouragement. According to Dweck (2010), ‚Äúpraising students for the process they have engaged in--the effort they applied, the strategies they used, the choices they made, the persistence they displayed, and so on--yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù when they succeed.‚Äù As such, it is important for educators to carefully craft and design meaningful learning activities for their students to engage in the classroom. According to Dweck 2010, ‚Äúthe teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting, while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain.‚Äù Students who are engaged in more challenging learning activities, have more opportunities to make mistakes and struggle, allowing the teacher to interject with some new strategies to try while praising students for the work they have done so far. A second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset. Possible activities include establishing personal goals, writing letters, or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at. In a recent study by Hussein (2018), the effects of reflective journal writing on students‚Äô growth mindset was examined. It was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge, promoting growth mindset, and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing. The way educators evaluate their students‚Äô work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom. More specifically, Dweck (2010) identifies the word ‚Äúyet‚Äù as a valuable tool to assess students learning. If an educator hears students saying they are not good at something or can't do something, it is important for the teacher to interject with the words ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù to reinforce the idea that ability and motivation are fluid. Overall, it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks, praising of the process, and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment, is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners.  Reshaping Mindsets in Students and Educators  While elements of our personality ‚Äì such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks ‚Äì can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset, we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions.Aldhous, P. (2008). Free your mind and watch it grow. New Scientist, 199(2670), 44-45. In multiple studies, Dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through \\"praising the process through which success was achieved\\",Cimpian, A., Aree, H.C., Markman, E.M., Dweck, C.S. (2007). Subtle linguistic cues affect children‚Äôs motivation. Association for Psychological Science, 18(4), 314-316. \\"having [college aged students] read compelling scientific articles that support one view or the other\\", or teaching junior high school students \\"that every time they try hard and learn something new, their brain forms new connections that, over time, make them smarter\\".Dweck, C.S. (2007). The perils and promises of praise. Early Intervention at Every Age, 65(2), 34-39. These studies all demonstrate how framing and discussing students' work and effort play a considerable role in the type of mindset students develop and students' conceptions of their own ability. While a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset, less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students. Hattie (2012) states, ‚Äúdiffering mindsets, or assumptions, that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations, teaching practices, and how students perceive their own mindset.‚Äù In a recent study by Patrick & Joshi (2019), the way teachers explain growth and fixed mindsets was explored. Using 150 semi-structured interviews, two major findings were revealed. The first finding was that teachers‚Äô prior beliefs about learning and learners influenced how they engaged with these mindsets. Secondly, it was found that many teachers tended to oversimplify the concepts of a growth and fixed mindset into positive and negative traits. This suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms. A study conducted by Seaton (2018), looked specifically at the impact of teacher training aimed at influencing their mindsets and the effect on their resulting practice. The teachers in this study underwent six different training sessions. It was found that the training sessions had an impact on teachers‚Äô mindsets & this change was sustained three months after the training as well. The results of this study suggest that adults‚Äô mindsets are malleable and can shift if the right supports are in place. This study reinforces the bond between a teacher's own beliefs and how they can strongly influence the mindset of his/her students; therefore, further highlighting the need for proper teacher training in order for mindset initiatives within schools to be fully successful.  Fixed and Growth Mindsets in Males vs. Females  Carol Dweck and Jo Boaler have done extensive research on the topics of fixed and growth mindset. However, studies on mindset depict results that show that there is a disparity in the fixed and growth mindsets of females and males. In Boaler's Ability and Mathematics: the Mindset Revolution that is Reshaping Education, she notes that fixed mindset beliefs lead to inequalities in education and are a main reason for low achievement and participation amongst minorities and female students. Boaler's research shows that many women feel as though they are not smart enough nor capable enough to continue in certain subjects, such as STEM areas of academia. Boaler uses Carol Dweck's research showing that \\"gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students\\" (Boaler, 2013). In addition, there have been tests administered by L.S. Blackwell to see if the fixed mindset of women can be changed to a growth mindset (Boaler, 2013). This is the mindset in which Boaler and Dweck believe people can gain knowledge. Boaler said, \\"The key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections, and that students control this process. The growth mindset intervention halted the students‚Äô decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement\\" (Boaler, 2013). Educational systems focusing on creating a growth mindset environment allows for girls to feel like their intelligence is moldable rather than constant.  Implications for At Risk Students  Dweck's research and theory of growth and fixed mindsets has been useful in intervention strategies with at risk students, dispelling negative stereotypes in education held by teachers and students, understanding the impacts of self- theories on resilience, and understanding how process praise can foster a growth mindset and positively impact students' motivation levels.Veronikas, S., Shaughnessy, M.F. (2004). A reflective conversation with Carol Dweck. Gifted Education International, 19(1), 27-33. In particular, a study by Rhew, Piro, Goolkasian & Cosentino (2018), suggested that a growth mindset intervention can increase the motivation levels of adolescent special education participants. In another study, it was suggested that substance use has adverse effects on adolescent reasoning. Developing a growth mindset in these adolescents was shown to reduce this adverse effect. These studies further illustrate how educators can use intervention strategies, targeting a growth mindset, by allowing students to see that their behaviour can be changed with effort.  Criticism  In recent years, there has been criticism leveraged at \\"growth mindset\\" as a concept, and the related research that has been carried out. See the page on Carol Dweck, under the header criticism.  Benefit Mindset  In 2015, Ashley Buchanan proposed a complementary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset called the benefit mindset. The benefit mindset describes society's everyday leaders who promote well-being on both an individual and a collective level. That is, people who discover their strengths to make valuable contributions to causes that are greater than the self. They question why they do what they do, positioning their actions within a purposeful context. Buchanan argues \\"creating cultures of contribution and everyday leadership could be one of the best points of leverage we have for simultaneously bringing out the best in people, organisations and the planet.\\" = Wellbeing Mindset = In 2020, J√ºrgen Nagler defined a wellbeing mindset as \\"the whole of attitudes, beliefs, and values of a person or group of people that foster wellbeing. Wellbeing relate to a person, group of people, the whole of humanity, other sentient beings such as animals, and/or planet Earth.\\" Building on several years of primary research and the work of Carol Dweck, Ash Buchanan, Otto Scharmer, Donna Meadows and Amartya Sen, Nagler connects mindset theory with human development. He argues that mindsets guide people's thinking and behavior and play a key role in people's life experiences, development journey, and wellbeing. = Global Mindset = Originating from the study of organizational leadership and coinciding with the growth of multinational corporations in the 1980s, organizations observed that the effectiveness of their executives did not necessarily translate cross-culturally. Global mindset emerged as an explanation (Javidan & Walker, 2013). Essentially, leaders in cross-cultural contexts were hypothesized to need an additional skill, ability, or proficiency (i.e. a global mindset) that enabled effectiveness regardless of the culture or context (Perlmutter, 1969; Rhinesmith, 1992). One of the defining characteristics of the study of global mindset is the variety in which scholars conceptualize and operationalize the construct; and yet; scholars typically agree that global mindset and its development increases global effectiveness for both individuals and organizations (French & Chang, 2016). =Abundance and scarcity= Those with abundance mindset believe that there are enough resources for everyone, while those with the scarcity mindset believe that there is a limited number of resources and that one's gain must entail another's loss, leading to competition for resources. =Productive and defensive= According to Chris Argyris (2004), there are two dominant mindsets in organizations: the productive mindset and the defensive mindset. The productive mindset seeks out valid knowledge that is testable. The productive reasoning mindset creates informed choices and makes reasoning transparent. The defensive mindset, on the other hand, is self-protective and self-deceptive. When this mindset is active, people or organizations only seek out information that will protect them. Truth can be shut out when it is seen as threatening. The defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether (Argyris, 2004).

It is a mixture of music influenced by music of the United Kingdom, West African, Irish, Latin American, and mainland European cultures among others. The country's most internationally renowned genres are jazz, blues, country, bluegrass, rock, rock and roll, R&B;, pop, hip hop, soul, funk, gospel, disco, house, techno, ragtime, doo wop, folk music, americana, boogaloo, tejano, reggaeton, and salsa. American music is heard around the world. Since the beginning of the 20th century, some forms of American popular music have gained a near-global audience.Provine, Rob with Okon Hwang and Andy Kershaw. \\"Our Life Is Precisely a Song\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2, p. 167. Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought their own musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot. Much of modern popular music has roots in the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others. Many American cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. With musical centers such as Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Memphis, Houston, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, San Juan, Nashville, Austin, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, and smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Asheville, North Carolina, Oakland, Honolulu, the Research Triangle, Boulder, Colorado, Madison, Wisconsin, Tupelo, Mississippi, and Burlington, Vermont have all have produced and contributed to the many distinctive styles of music from the country. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples of diversity in American music. Characteristics Raymond Carlos Nakai is an American Indian of Navajo/Ute heritage. His Earth Spirit and Canyon Trilogy albums are the only Native American albums to be certified gold and platinum, respectively, by the RIAA. The music of the United States can be characterized by the use of syncopation and asymmetrical rhythms, long, irregular melodies, which are said to \\"reflect the wide open geography of (the American landscape)\\" and the \\"sense of personal freedom characteristic of American life\\".Ferris, p. 11. Some distinct aspects of American music, like the call-and-response format, are derived from African techniques and instruments. Throughout the later part of American history, and into modern times, the relationship between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music. Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles. Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War \\"the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first 'American' sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country.\\" The Civil War, and the period following it, saw a general flowering of American art, literature and music. Amateur musical ensembles of this era can be seen as the birth of American popular music. Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining \\"the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique, eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression. If it was vocal music, the words would be in English, despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language. In a way, it was part of the entire awakening of America that happened after the Civil War, a time in which American painters, writers, and 'serious' composers addressed specifically American themes.\\"Rolling Stone, p. 18. During this period the roots of blues, gospel, jazz, and country music took shape; in the 20th century, these became the core of American popular music, which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip hop music. =Social identity= The entrance of the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live Alison Krauss is the most awarded singer and the most awarded female artist in Grammy history. Music intertwines with aspects of American social and cultural identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race is perhaps the most potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled with European styles and instruments in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs.Radano, Ronald with Michael Daley, \\"Race, Ethnicity and Nationhood\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and has long been perceived as a form of white music.Wolfe, Charles K. with Jacqueline Cogdell DjeDje, \\"Two Views of Music, Race, Ethnicity and Nationhood\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Economic and social classes separates American music through the creation and consumption of music, such as the upper-class patronage of symphony-goers, and the generally poor performers of rural and ethnic folk musics. Musical divisions based on class are not absolute, however, and are sometimes as much perceived as actual;McLucas, Anne Dhu, Jon Dueck, and Regula Burckhardt Qureshi, pp. 42‚Äì54. popular American country music, for example, is a commercial genre designed to \\"appeal to a working-class identity, whether or not its listeners are actually working class\\". cited in McLucas, Anne Dhu, Jon Dueck and Regula Burckhardt Qureshi, pp. 42‚Äì54. Country music is also intertwined with geographic identity, and is specifically rural in origin and function; other genres, like R&B; and hip hop, are perceived as inherently urban.Smith, Gordon E., \\"Place\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, pp. 142‚Äì152. For much of American history, music-making has been a \\"feminized activity\\".Cook, Susan C, \\"Gender and Sexuality\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, p. 88. In the 19th century, amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle- and upper-class women. Women were also a major part of early popular music performance, though recorded traditions quickly become more dominated by men. Most male-dominated genres of popular music include female performers as well, often in a niche appealing primarily to women; these include gangsta rap and heavy metal.Cook, Susan C, \\"Gender and Sexuality\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, p. 88‚Äì89. Diversity The United States is home to a wide array of regional styles and scenes. The United States is often said to be a cultural melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music can be traced back to specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music.Cowdery, James R. with Anne Lederman, \\"Blurring the Boundaries of Social and Musical Identities\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, pp. 322‚Äì333. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French- African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music. The process of transplanting music between cultures is not without criticism. The folk revival of the mid-20th century, for example, appropriated the musics of various rural peoples, in part to promote certain political causes, which has caused some to question whether the process caused the \\"commercial commodification of other peoples' songs ... and the inevitable dilution of mean\\" in the appropriated musics. The use of African American musical techniques, images, and conceits in popular music largely by and for white Americans has been widespread since at least the mid-19th century songs of Stephen Foster and the rise of minstrel shows. The American music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of African American music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle-class Americans. This process has been related to the rise of stars as varied as Benny Goodman, Eminem, and Elvis Presley, as well as popular styles like blue-eyed soul and rockabilly. Folk music Elvis Presley was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as \\"the King of Rock and Roll\\", or simply, \\"the King\\". Folk music in the US is varied across the country's numerous ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles and instruments were brought to the Americas. By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, Klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music. The Native Americans played the first folk music in what is now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near universal among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers.Ferris, p. 18‚Äì20. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.Means, Andrew. \\"Hey-Ya, Weya Ha-Ya-Ya!\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2, p. 594. The Thirteen Colonies of the original United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major.Nettl, p. 201. Anglo- American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers.Nettl, p. 201‚Äì202. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models.Hall, p. 21‚Äì22. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as the music of the Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.Crawford, p. 77‚Äì91. The ancestors of today's African American population were brought to the United States as slaves, working primarily in the plantations of the South. They were from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and they brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complexly rhythmic music,Nettl, p. 171. as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents.Ewen, p. 53. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans \\"retain continuity with their past through music\\". The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, field hollersFerris, p. 50. and, following Christianization, hymns. In the 19th century, a Great Awakening of religious fervor gripped people across the country, especially in the South. Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called Negro spirituals. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs, and field hollers, that blues, jazz, and gospel developed. =Blues and spirituals= Spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations.Garofalo, p. 19. In the mid to late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. In imitation of this group, gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, from whence came the popular style of gospel music. Blues is a combination of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts.Garofalo, p. 44. It developed in the rural South in the first decade of the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.Rolling Stone, p. 20. =Other immigrant communities= Dean Martin The United States is a melting pot consisting of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music. Some nationalities have produced local scenes in regions of the country where they have clustered, like Cape Verdean music in New England,M√°ximo, Susana and David Peterson. \\"Music of Sweet Sorrow\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 1, p. 454‚Äì455. Armenian music in California,Hagopian, Harold. \\"The Sorrowful Sound\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 1, p. 337. and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City.Kochan, Alexis and Julian Kytasty. \\"The Bandura Played On\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 1, p. 308. The Creoles are a community with varied non-Anglo ancestry, mostly descendant of people who lived in Louisiana before its purchase by the U.S. The Cajuns are a group of Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada.Broughton, Simon and Jeff Kaliss, \\"Music Is the Glue\\", in the Rough Guide to World Music, p. 552‚Äì567. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana, being a major port, has acted as a melting pot for people from all over the Caribbean basin. The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun music and Creole music. Spain and subsequently Mexico controlled much of what is now the western United States until the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century.Burr, Ramiro. \\"Accordion Enchilada\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2, p. 604. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico. Classical music Classical music was brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European classical music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on what is known as the common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music.Struble, p. xiv‚Äìxv. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music. =Early classical music= Aaron Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as \\"the Dean of American Composers\\" During the colonial era, there were two distinct fields of what is now considered classical music. One was associated with amateur composers and pedagogues, whose style was originally drawn from simple hymns and gained sophistication over time. The other colonial tradition was that of the mid-Atlantic cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore, which produced a number of prominent composers who worked almost entirely within the European model; these composers were mostly English in origin, and worked specifically in the style of prominent English composers of the day.Struble, p. 4‚Äì5. Capitol Records headquarters building Classical music was brought to the United States during the colonial era. Many American composers of this period worked exclusively with European models, while others, such as William Billings, Supply Belcher, and Justin Morgan, also known as the First New England School, developed a style almost entirely independent of European models.Struble, p. 2. Of these composers, Billings is the most well-remembered; he was also influential \\"as the founder of the American church choir, as the first musician to use a pitch pipe, and as the first to introduce a violoncello into church service\\".Ewen, p. 7. Many of these composers were amateur singers who developed new forms of sacred music suitable for performance by amateurs, and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary European standards.Crawford, p. 17. These composers' styles were untouched by \\"the influence of their sophisticated European contemporaries\\", using modal or pentatonic scales or melodies and eschewing the European rules of harmony.Ferris, p. 66. In the early 19th century, America produced diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style and was the first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.Struble, p. 28‚Äì39. Louis Moreau Gottschalk is perhaps the best- remembered American composer of the 19th century, said by music historian Richard Crawford to be known for \\"bringing indigenous or folk, themes and rhythms into music for the concert hall\\". Gottschalk's music reflected the cultural mix of his home city, New Orleans, Louisiana, which was home to a variety of Latin, Caribbean, African American, Cajun, and Creole music. He was well acknowledged as a talented pianist in his lifetime, and was also a known composer who remains admired though little performed.Crawford, p. 331‚Äì350. =20th century= Philip Glass in Florence, 1993 The New York classical music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were strongly influenced by jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American classical music more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, he turned to the ballet and then serial music.Struble, p. 122. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954. Many of the later 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, John Adams, and Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich discovered a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions.Struble, The History of American Classical Music. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.Unterberger, p. 1‚Äì65. Popular music The United States has produced many popular musicians and composers in the modern world. Beginning with the birth of recorded music, American performers have continued to lead the field of popular music, which out of \\"all the contributions made by Americans to world culture... has been taken to heart by the entire world\\".Ewen, p. 3. Most histories of popular music start with American ragtime or Tin Pan Alley; others, however, trace popular music to the Renaissance and through broadsheets, ballads, and other popular traditions.Clarke, p. 1‚Äì19. Other authors typically look at popular sheet music, tracing American popular music to spirituals, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and the patriotic songs of the Civil War. =Early popular song= 19th-century song composer Stephen Foster The patriotic lay songs of the American Revolution constituted the first kind of mainstream popular music. These included \\"The Liberty Tree\\" by Thomas Paine. Cheaply printed as broadsheets, early patriotic songs spread across the colonies and were performed at home and at public meetings.Ewen, p. 9. Fife songs were especially celebrated, and were performed on fields of battle during the American Revolution. The longest lasting of these fife songs is \\"Yankee Doodle\\", still well known today. The melody dates back to 1755 and was sung by both American and British troops.Ewen, p. 11. Patriotic songs were based mostly on English melodies, with new lyrics added to denounce British colonialism; others, however, used tunes from Ireland, Scotland or elsewhere, or did not utilize a familiar melody. The song \\"Hail, Columbia\\" was a major workEwen, p. 17. that remained an unofficial national anthem until the adoption of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Much of this early American music still survives in Sacred Harp. Although relatively unknown outside of Shaker Communities, Simple Gifts was written in 1848 by Elder Joseph Brackett and the tune has since become internationally famous. During the Civil War, when soldiers from across the country commingled, the multifarious strands of American music began to cross-fertilize each other, a process that was aided by the burgeoning railroad industry and other technological developments that made travel and communication easier. Army units included individuals from across the country, and they rapidly traded tunes, instruments and techniques. The war was an impetus for the creation of distinctly American songs that became and remained wildly popular.Struble, p. xvii. The most popular songs of the Civil War era included \\"Dixie\\", written by Daniel Decatur Emmett. The song, originally titled \\"Dixie's Land\\", was made for the closing of a minstrel show; it spread to New Orleans first, where it was published and became \\"one of the great song successes of the pre-Civil War period\\".Ewen, p. 21. In addition to popular patriotic songs, the Civil War era also produced a great body of brass band pieces.Library of Congress: Band Music from the Civil War Era. Sheet music for \\"Dixie\\" Following the Civil War, minstrel shows became the first distinctively American form of music expression. The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in blackface. Minstrel shows used African American elements in musical performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism.Clarke, p. 21. The minstrel show was invented by Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels.Clarke, p. 23. Minstrel shows produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After minstrel shows' popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular. The composer John Philip Sousa is closely associated with the most popular trend in American popular music just before the start of the 20th century. Formerly the bandmaster of the United States Marine Band, Sousa wrote military marches like \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" that reflected his \\"nostalgia for [his] home and country\\", giving the melody a \\"stirring virile character\\".Ewen, p. 29. In the early 20th century, American musical theater was a major source for popular songs, many of which influenced blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.Crawford, p. 664‚Äì688. =Blues and gospel= Philip Paul Bliss The blues is a genre of African American folk music that is the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs.Garofalo, p. 36. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music. Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like Thomas A. Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.Kempton, p. 9‚Äì18. Blues singer Bessie Smith Ragtime was originally a piano style, featuring syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms. It is primarily a form of dance music utilizing the walking bass, and is generally composed in sonata form. Ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the African American cakewalk dance, mixed with styles ranging from European marchesSchuller, Gunther, p. 24, cited in Garofalo, p. 26. and popular songs to jigs and other dances played by large African American bands in northern cities during the end of the 19th century. The most famous ragtime performer and composer was Scott Joplin, known for works such as \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\".Garofalo, p. 26. Blues became a part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record companies launched the field of race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta blues musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont blues musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm & blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson.Werner. The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, as well as in the 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country blues musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas. =Jazz= Jelly Roll Morton was an early Jazz pioneer Jazz is a kind of music characterized by swung and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Though originally a kind of dance music, jazz has been a major part of popular music, and has also become a major element of Western classical music. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.Ferris, p. 228, 233. Early jazz was closely related to ragtime, with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation. The earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues, including bent and blue notes and instrumental \\"growls\\" and smears otherwise not used on European instruments. Jazz's roots come from the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, populated by Cajuns and black Creoles, who combined the French-Canadian culture of the Cajuns with their own styles of music in the 19th century. Large Creole bands that played for funerals and parades became a major basis for early jazz, which spread from New Orleans to Chicago and other northern urban centers. Trumpeter Louis Armstrong Though jazz had long since achieved some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who became one of the first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley. Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance. Jazz influenced many performers of all the major styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such a major part of American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th-century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as Miles Davis. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres, beginning with bebop. Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody, and use of the flatted fifth. Bebop was developed in the early and mid-1940s, later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz. Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City.Clarke. =Country music= Johnny Cash in 1969 was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Country music is primarily a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics.Malone, p. 77. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country, then known as hillbilly music. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country.Sawyers, p. 112. The earliest country instrumentation revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added.Barraclough, Nick and Kurt Wolff. \\"High an' Lonesome\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2, p. 537. String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century.Garofalo, p. 45. Neotraditional singer Randy Travis The roots of commercial country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family.Collins, p. 11. Popular success was very limited, though a small demand spurred some commercial recording. After World War II, there was increased interest in specialty styles like country music, producing a few major pop stars.Gillett, p. 9, cited in Garofalo, p. 74. The most influential country musician of the era was Hank Williams, a bluesy country singer from Alabama. He remains renowned as one of country music's greatest songwriters and performers, viewed as a \\"folk poet\\" with a \\"honky-tonk swagger\\" and \\"working-class sympathies\\".Garofalo, p. 75. Throughout the decade the roughness of honky-tonk gradually eroded as the Nashville sound grew more pop-oriented. Producers like Chet Atkins created the Nashville sound by stripping the hillbilly elements of the instrumentation and using smooth instrumentation and advanced production techniques. Eventually, most records from Nashville were in this style, which began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By the early part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become perceived as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash.Garofalo, p. 140. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music.Collins. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky- tonk-style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best- selling performers in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.Garofalo. =Soul, R&B; and Pop= James Brown was critical in the transition of rhythm and blues to soul music and pioneering funk music. R&B;, an abbreviation for rhythm and blues, is a style that arose in the 1930s and 1940s. Early R&B; consisted of large rhythm units \\"smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections\\".Baraka, p. 168, cited in Garofalo, p. 76. R&B; was not extensively recorded and promoted because record companies felt that it was not suited for most audiences, especially middle-class whites, because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms.Garofalo, p. 76, 78. Bandleaders like Louis Jordan innovated the sound of early R&B;, using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation. By the end of the 1940s, he had had several hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like Wynonie Harris and John Lee Hooker. Many of the most popular R&B; songs were not performed in the rollicking style of Jordan and his contemporaries; instead they were performed by white musicians like Pat Boone in a more palatable mainstream style, which turned into pop hits.Rolling Stone, p. 99‚Äì100. By the end of the 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues rock and country-influenced R&B; performers like Chuck Berry gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners.Rolling Stone, p. 101‚Äì102. Motown Records became highly successful during the early and mid-1960s for producing music of black American roots that defied racial segregation in the music industry and consumer market. Music journalist Jerry Wexler (who coined the phrase \\"rhythm and blues\\") once said of Motown: \\"[They] did something that you would have to say on paper is impossible. They took black music and beamed it directly to the white American teenager.\\" Berry Gordy founded Motown in 1959 in Detroit, Michigan. It was one of few R&B; record labels that sought to transcend the R&B; market (which was definitively black in the American mindset) and specialize in crossover music. The company emerged as the leading producer (or \\"assembly line,\\" a reference to its motor- town origins) of black popular music by the early 1960s and marketed its products as \\"The Motown Sound\\" or \\"The Sound of Young America\\"‚Äîwhich combined elements of soul, funk, disco and R&B.;Flory, p. 1-6. Notable Motown acts include the Four Tops, the Temptations, the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Jackson 5. Visual representation was central to Motown's rise; they placed greater emphasis on visual media than other record labels. Many people's first exposure to Motown was by television and film. Motown artists' image of successful black Americans who held themselves with grace and aplomb broadcast a distinct form of middle-class blackness to audiences, which was particularly appealing to whites.Flory, p. 135-137. Frequently called the \\"King of Pop,\\" 311x311px Soul music is a combination of rhythm and blues and gospel which began in the late 1950s in the United States. It is characterized by its use of gospel-music devices, with a greater emphasis on vocalists and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul. Charles' Modern Sounds (1962) records featured a fusion of soul and country music, country soul, and crossed racial barriers in music at the time.Guide Profile: Ray Charles. About.com.

According to AllMusic, James Brown was critical, through \\"the gospel- impassioned fury of his vocals and the complex polyrhythms of his beats\\", in \\"two revolutions in black American music. He was one of the figures most responsible for turning R&B; into soul and he was, most would agree, the figure most responsible for turning soul music into the funk of the late '60s and early '70s.\\" Pure soul was popularized by Otis Redding and the other artists of Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee.

The social and political ferment of the 1960s inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release albums with hard-hitting social commentary, while another variety became more dance-oriented music, evolving into funk. Despite his previous affinity with politically and socially-charged lyrical themes, Gaye helped popularize sexual and romance-themed music and funk,Edmonds (2001), pp. 15‚Äì18. while his 70s recordings, including Let's Get It On (1973) and I Want You (1976) helped develop the quiet storm sound and format.Weisbard (1995), pp. 202‚Äì205.

During the mid-1970s, highly slick and commercial bands such as Philly soul group The O'Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success. By the end of the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, had been disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called R&B;, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R&B.; According to the RIAA, Mariah Carey is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. With the release of \\"Touch My Body\\" (2008), Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. The first contemporary R&B; stars arose in the 1980s, with the dance-pop star Michael Jackson, funk-influenced singer Prince, and a wave of female vocalists like Tina Turner and Whitney Houston. Michael Jackson and Prince have been described as the most influential figures in contemporary R&B; and popular music because of their eclectic use of elements from a variety of genres. Prince was largely responsible for creating the Minneapolis sound: \\"a blend of horns, guitars, and electronic synthesizers supported by a steady, bouncing rhythm.\\" Jackson's work focused on smooth balladry or disco- influenced dance music; as an artist, he \\"pulled dance music out of the disco doldrums with his 1979 adult solo debut, Off the Wall, merged R&B; with rock on Thriller, and introduced stylized steps such as the robot and moonwalk over the course of his career.\\" Jackson is often recognized as the \\"King of Pop\\" for his achievements. Ariana Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously By 1983, the concept of popular music crossover became inextricably associated with Michael Jackson. Thriller saw unprecedented success, selling over 10 million copies in the United States alone. By 1984, the album captured over 140 gold and platinum awards and was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling record of all-time, a title it still holds today. MTV's broadcast of \\"Billie Jean\\" was the first for any black artist, thereby breaking the \\"color barrier\\" of pop music on the small screen. Thriller remains the only music video recognized by the National Film Registry. Janet Jackson collaborated with former Prince associates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her third studio album Control (1986); the album's second single \\"Nasty\\" has been described as the origin of the new jack swing sound, a genre innovated by Teddy Riley. Riley's work on Keith Sweat's Make It Last Forever (1987), Guy's Guy (1988), and Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel (1998) made new jack swing a staple of contemporary R&B; into the mid-1990s. New jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music, often featuring rapped verses and drum machines. The crossover appeal of early contemporary R&B; artists in mainstream popular music, including works by Prince, Michael and Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Anita Baker, and The Pointer Sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry, as their success \\"was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.\\" The use of melisma, a gospel tradition adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey would become a cornerstone of contemporary R&B; singers beginning in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R&B; later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R&B; with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill.About.com: R&B; ‚Äì Neo- Soul: What Is Neo-Soul?.

Dylan subsequently ventured into folk rock after being inspired by the British Invasion, particularly The Animals' hit recording of the folk song \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\". Rock and roll developed out of country, blues, and R&B.; Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, and are the subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques.Palmer, p. 48; cited in Garofalo, p. 95. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco.Lipsitz, p. 214; cited in Garofalo, p. 95. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, but it was the white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.Garofalo, p. 131. ZZ Top by 2014, has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. The 1960s saw several important changes in popular music, especially rock. Many of these changes took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, and The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and had a profound effect on American culture and music. These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment.Garofalo, p. 185. These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change. In the early 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, beginning with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre characterized by a distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture.Szatmary, p. 69‚Äì70. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop- friendly, and harmonic sound.Rolling Stone, p. 251. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock were associated with the rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream in the middle of the 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.Garofalo, p. 196, 218. The Eagles with five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and six number one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s.. Following the turbulent political, social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles developed in the US like punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade with a wave of singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class. Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \\"the Bad Boys from Boston\\" and \\"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\\". Punk was a form of rebellious rock that began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a reaction against the popular music of the period, especially disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and Talking Heads, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore was a form of sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.Blush, p. 12‚Äì13. The Foo Fighters have won 12 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album four times.\\"Dave Grohl interview: 'I‚Äôm going to fix my leg and then I‚Äôm going to come back'\\" . telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015. Retrieved August 5, 2016. Hardcore, punk, and garage rock were the roots of alternative rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle.Garofalo, p. 446‚Äì447. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock.Garofalo, p. 448. With the addition of a more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United StatesSzatmary, p. 285. in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide. Metallica was one of the most influential bands in heavy metal, as they bridged the gap between commercial and critical success for the genre. The band became the best-selling rock act of the 1990s. Heavy metal is characterized by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. The first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue √ñyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame near the end of the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic. By the mid-1980s heavy metal had branched in so many different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Metallica being the most commercially successful.Garofalo, p. 187. The United States was known as one of the birthplaces of death metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Deicide, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country. =Hip hop= Rihanna performing with Chris Brown in November 2008. Having sold over 250 million records, Rihanna is one of the world's best-selling music artists. Jay-Z became an internationally renowned hip hop icon in the wake of the deaths of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur in the mid-1990s. Kanye West was mentored by Jay-Z and produced for him, before attaining a similar level of success. Hip hop is a cultural movement, of which music is a part. Hip hop music for the most part is itself composed of two parts: rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and DJing and/or producing, the production of instrumentation through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism, or beatboxing, the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones.Garofalo, p. 408‚Äì409. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul, funk, and R&B; songs that the DJs played, and to keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs (when the rhythm climaxes), producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over. Eminem in 1999. He was the best-selling music artist of the 2000s in the United States. Unlike Motown which predicated its mainstream success on the class appeal of its acts that rendered racial identity irrelevant, hip hop of 1980s, particularly hip hop that crossed over to rock- and-roll, was predicated on its (implicit but emphatic) primary identification with black identity. By the beginning of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared in the latter part of the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul. Gangsta rap is a kind of hip hop, most importantly characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image.Werner, p. 290. Though the origins of gangsta rap can be traced back to the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G. and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century. The dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, largely due to the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline.Swash, Rosie (2011-06-13). Kanye v 50 Cent. The Guardian. Guardian News and Media Limited. Retrieved 2011-08-09. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip- hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists. =Other niche styles and Latin American music= Christina Aguilera album alt= Latin music in the United States The American music industry is dominated by large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering a wide variety of recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer. Among the Hispanic American musicians who were pioneers in the early stages of rock and roll were Ritchie Valens, who scored several hits, most notably \\"La Bamba\\" and Herman Santiago wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". Songs that became popular in the United States and are heard during the Holiday/Christmas season are \\"¬øD√≥nde Est√° Santa Claus?\\" is a novelty Christmas song with 12-year-old Augie R√≠os was a record hit in 1959 which featured the Mark Jeffrey Orchestra. \\"Feliz Navidad\\"(1970) by Jos√© Feliciano is another famous Latin song. alt= The single largest niche industry is based on Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially crucial part of the development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha- cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica.Morales. Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously. The clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases.Rough Guide. Latin American music has long influenced American popular music, jazz, rhythm and blues, and even country music. This includes music from Spanish, Portuguese, and (sometimes) French-speaking countries and territories of Latin America. Today, the American record industry defines Latin music as any type of release with lyrics mostly in Spanish. Mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from Latin artists and it's also become more likely that English language songs crossover to Spanish radio and vice versa. The United States played a significant role in the development of electronic dance music, specifically house and techno, which originated in Chicago and Detroit, respectively. Today Latin American music has become a term for music performed by Latinos regardless of whether it has a Latin element or not. Acts such as Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Selena Gomez, Christina Aguilera, Gloria Estefan, Demi Lovato, Mariah Carey, Becky G, Paulina Rubio, and Camila Cabello are prominent on the pop charts. Iglesias who holds the record for most #1s on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks released a bilingual album, inspired by urban acts he releases two completely different songs to Latin and pop formats at the same time. Government, politics and law Barbra Streisand has achieved success in multiple fields of entertainment. The government of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain kinds of music. Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property as soon as they are fixed in a tangible form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.Bergey, Berry, \\"Government and Politics\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Music has long affected the politics of the United States. Political parties and movements frequently use music and song to communicate their ideals and values, and to provide entertainment at political functions. The presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison was the first to greatly benefit from music, after which it became standard practice for major candidates to use songs to create public enthusiasm. In more recent decades, politicians often chose theme songs, some of which have become iconic; the song \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\", for example, has been associated with the Democratic Party since the 1932 campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Since the 1950s, however, music has declined in importance in politics, replaced by televised campaigning with little or no music. Certain forms of music became more closely associated with political protest, especially in the 1960s. Gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson became important figures in the Civil Rights Movement, while the American folk revival helped spread the counterculture of the 1960s and opposition to the Vietnam War.Cornelius, Steven, \\"Campaign Music in the United States\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Industry and economics Sinatra in 1947, at the Liederkranz Hall. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of 4.9 billion dollars in 2014, The American music industry includes a number of fields, ranging from record companies to radio stations and community orchestras. Total industry revenue is about $40 billion worldwide, and about $12 billion in the United States.The worldwide figure is from Most of the world's major record companies are based in the United States; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. Record companies may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. Record companies may be affiliated with other music media companies, which produce a product related to popular recorded music. These include television channels like MTV, magazines like Rolling Stone and radio stations. In recent years the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music; many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music.Garofalo, p. 445‚Äì446. Katy Perry has received many awards, including four Guinness World Records, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award, and been included in the Forbes list of \\"Top-Earning Women In Music\\" (2011‚Äì2016). Radio stations in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. Many radio stations in the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel, and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are tracked by the Billboard 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry's revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million. Though the major record companies dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment. Education and scholarship alt= Music is an important part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. Britney Spears is regarded as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenage artist of all time' and garnered honorific titles including the \\"Princess of Pop\\". The scholarly study of music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music can be traced back to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo- American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions.Blum, Stephen, \\"Sources, Scholarship and Historiography\\" in the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.Unterberger, Richie with Tony Seeger, \\"Filling the Map With Music\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, p. 531‚Äì535. alt= Early 20th scholarly analysis of American music tended to interpret European-derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study, with the folk, religious, and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low-class and of little artistic or social worth. American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations, and was found wanting, leading writers like the composer Arthur Farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture, in his 1915 Music in America. In 1930, John Tasker Howard's Our American Music became a standard analysis, focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States.Crawford, p. x. Since the analysis of musicologist Charles Seeger in the mid-20th century, American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry. Under this view, the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races, while still fostering constant acculturation, as elements of European, African, and indigenous musics have shifted between fields. Gilbert Chase's America's Music, from the Pilgrims to the Present, was the first major work to examine the music of the entire United States, and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall. Chase's analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment. Until the 1960s and 1970s, however, most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music, limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music, especially European-derived classical and operatic styles, and sometimes African American jazz. More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history. Prominent recent studies of American music include Charles Hamm's Music in the New World from 1983, and Richard Crawford's America's Musical Life from 2001.Crawford, p. x‚Äìxi. Holidays and festivals Music is an important part of several American holidays, especially playing a major part in the wintertime celebration of Christmas. Music of the holiday includes both religious songs like \\"O Holy Night\\" and secular songs like \\"Jingle Bells\\". Patriotic songs like the national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", are a major part of Independence Day celebrations. Music also plays a role at many regional holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, most famously Mardi Gras, a music and dance parade and festival in New Orleans, Louisiana. The United States is home to numerous music festivals, which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal. Some music festivals are strictly local in scope, including few or no performers with a national reputation, and are generally operated by local promoters. The large recording companies operate their own music festivals, such as Lollapalooza and Ozzfest, which draw huge crowds.

Childers/G. Hentzi eds., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 110 is the regular work of scientists theorizing, observing, and experimenting within a settled paradigm or explanatory framework.Childers, p. 84 Regarding science as puzzle-solving,T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) p. 35-42 Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad theory, without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory. The route to normal science Kuhn stressed that historically, the route to normal science could be a difficult one. Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would- be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by Pliny the Elder or Francis Bacon,Kuhn, p. 10-22 while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories. Arguably at least the social sciences remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.A. Rosenberg, Philosophy of Science (2005) p. 149 Normal science at work Kuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the 'normal' scientist, as they engaged with the threefold tasks of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.Kuhn, p. 25-8 Paradigms are central to Kuhn's conception of normal science.Kuhn, p. 23 Scientists derive rules from paradigms, which also guide research by providing a framework for action that encompasses all the values, techniques, and theories shared by the members of a scientific community.Kuhn, p. 42 Paradigms gain recognition from more successfully solving acute problems than their competitors. Normal science aims to improve the match between a paradigm's predictions and the facts of interest to a paradigm.Kuhn, p. 24 It does not aim to discover new phenomena. According to Kuhn, normal science encompasses three classes of scientific problems.Kuhn, p. 34 The first class of scientific problems is the determination of significant fact, such as the position and magnitude of stars in different galaxies. When astronomers use special telescopes to verify Copernican predictions, they engage the second class: the matching of facts with theory. Improving the value of the gravitational constant is an example of articulating a theory, which is the third class of scientific problems. The breakdown of consensus The normal scientist presumes that all values, techniques, and theories falling within the expectations of the prevailing paradigm are accurate.Kuhn, p. 97 Anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved within the prevailing paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge during what Kuhn deems a crisis of normal science.Kuhn, p. 145 If the paradigm is unsalvageable, it will be subjected to a paradigm shift.Kuhn, p. 52-78 Kuhn lays out the progression of normal science that culminates in scientific discovery at the time of a paradigm shift: first, one must become aware of an anomaly in nature that the prevailing paradigm cannot explain. Then, one must conduct an extended exploration of this anomaly. The crisis only ends when one discards the old paradigm and successfully maps the original anomaly onto a new paradigm. The scientific community embraces a new set of expectations and theories that govern the work of normal science.Kuhn, p. 53 Kuhn calls such discoveries scientific revolutions.Kuhn, p. 90 Successive paradigms replace each other and are necessarily incompatible with each other.Kuhn, p. 92 In this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound research, whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively.Kuhn, p. 181 Kuhn's framework restricts the permissibility of paradigm falsification to moments of scientific discovery. Criticism Kuhn's normal science is characterized by upheaval over cycles of puzzle-solving and scientific revolution, as opposed to cumulative improvement. In Kuhn's historicism, moving from one paradigm to the next completely changes the universe of scientific assumptions. Imre Lakatos has accused Kuhn of falling back on irrationalism to explain scientific progress. Lakatos relates Kuhnian scientific change to a mystical or religious conversion ungoverned by reason.I. Lakatos, Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes (1970) p. 93 With the aim of presenting scientific revolutions as rational progress, Lakatos provided an alternative framework of scientific inquiry in his paper Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes. His model of the research programme preserves cumulative progress in science where Kuhn's model of successive irreconcilable paradigms in normal science does not. Lakatos' basic unit of analysis is not a singular theory or paradigm, but rather the entire research programme that contains the relevant series of testable theories.Lakatos, p. 132 Each theory within a research programme has the same common assumptions and is supposed by a belt of more modest auxiliary hypotheses that serve to explain away potential threats to the theory's core assumptions.Lakatos, p. 133 Lakatos evaluates problem shifts, changes to auxiliary hypotheses, by their ability to produce new facts, better predictions, or additional explanations. Lakatos' conception of a scientific revolution involves the replacement of degenerative research programmes by progressive research programmes. Rival programmes persist as minority views.Lakatos, p. 163 Lakatos is also concerned that Kuhn's position may result in the controversial position of relativism, for Kuhn accepts multiple conceptions of the world under different paradigms.Lakatos, p. 178 Although the developmental process he describes in science is characterized by an increasingly detailed and refined understanding of nature, Kuhn does not conceive of science as a process of evolution towards any goal or telos.Kuhn, 170-171 He has noted his own sparing use of the word truth in his writing. Readers may be uncomfortable with Kuhn's lack of defined criteria to judge the quality of new paradigms, with respect to their success in capturing one full, objective, true account of nature. An additional consequence of Kuhn's relavitism, which poses a problem for the philosophy of science, is his blurred demarcation between science and non-science. Unlike Karl Popper's deductive method of falsification, under Kuhn, scientific discoveries that do not fit the established paradigm do not immediately falsify the paradigm. They are treated as anomalies within the paradigm that warrant further research, until a scientific revolution refutes the entire paradigm. See alsoReferencesFurther reading W. O.

Though distinct in origin from the Cajun music of Louisiana, the two forms influenced each other, forming a complex of genres native to Louisiana. Origin of term The origin of the word \\"zydeco\\" is uncertain. One theory is that it derives from the French phrase Les haricots ne sont pas sal√©s, which, when spoken in the Louisiana Creole French, sounds as . This literally translates as \\"the snap beans aren't salty\\" but idiomatically as \\"times are hard\\"\\"Zydeco Music 101\\". Accessed 16 April 2018. signifying the speaker's fatigue or lack of energy.Lolordo, Ann (31 January 1993). \\"An Evening In a Cajun Dance Hall: A Letter from Baton Rouge\\". The Baltimore Sun'. Accessed 16 April 2018. The earliest recorded use of the term may have been the country and western musical group called Zydeco Skillet Lickers who recorded the song \\"It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo\\" in 1929.Jacobson, Daniel. American Music in the 20th Century: III. Other Prominent Types of American Roots Music in the Early 1900s: Cajun Music. Western Michigan University, date unknown. p. 11. \\"Music in the United States Before the Great Depression\\". Accessed 16 April 2018. Initially, several different spellings of the word existed, including \\"zarico\\" and \\"zodico\\" (in some dialects of French, r has the same pronunciation used by certain dialects of American English for specific instances of d). In 1960, musicologist Robert \\"Mack\\" McCormick wrote liner notes for a compilation album, A Treasury of Field Recordings, and used the spelling \\"zydeco\\". The word was used in reviews, and McCormick began publicizing it around Houston as a standard spelling. Its use was also accepted by musician Clifton Chenier - who had previously recorded \\"Zodico Stomp\\" in 1955 - in his recording \\"Zydeco Sont Pas Sal√©s\\", after which Chenier himself claimed credit for devising the word. In an alternative theory the term derives from the Atakapa people, whose enslaved women were well known for forming marital unions with male African slaves in the early 1700s. The Atakapa word for \\"dance\\" is \\"shi\\" (rhymes with \\"sky\\") and their word for \\"the youths\\" is \\"ishol\\". In 1528 Spanish people, the first Europeans to contact the Atakapa, translated \\"shi ishol\\" as \\"zy ikol\\". Four hundred years later, the mixed-blood descendants of Atakapas and Africans would still sway in synchrony to their raucous music, but with a slightly evolved name: zydeco. Another possible root word for zydeco is as a West African term for \\"musicking\\". Recent studies based on early Louisiana recordings made by Alan and John Lomax suggests that the term, as well as the tradition, may have African origins. The languages of West African tribes affected by the slave trade provide some clues as to the origins of zydeco. In at least a dozen languages from this culture-area of Africa, the phonemes \\"za,\\" \\"re,\\" and \\"go\\" are frequently associated with dancing and/or playing music\\". Musical style Usually fast tempo and dominated by the button or piano accordion and a form of a washboard known as a \\"rub-board,\\" \\"scrub- board,\\" \\"wash-board,\\" or frottoir, zydeco music was originally created at house dances, where families and friends gathered for socializing. As a result, the music integrated waltz, shuffles, two-steps, blues,zydecoFrench dance melodies with Caribbean music and blues. rock and roll, and other dance music forms of the era. Today, zydeco integrates genres such as R&B;, soul, brass band, reggae, hip hop, ska, rock, Afro-Caribbean and other styles, in addition to the traditional forms. Early history Early Creole musicians playing an accordion and a washboard in front of a store, near Opelousas, Louisiana (1938). Zydeco music originated from Creole music ‚Äî today's rubboard or frottoir (\\"rubbing the washboard\\") is a stylized version of the early washboard. The original French settlers came to Louisiana in the late 1600s, sent by the Regent of France, Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans, to help settle the Louisiana Territory. Arriving in New Orleans on seven ships, the settlers quickly moved into the bayous and swamps. There the French culture permeated those of the Irish, Spanish, Native Indian and German peoples already populating the area. For 150 years, Louisiana Creoles enjoyed an insular lifestyle, prospering, educating themselves without the government and building their invisible communities under the Code Noir. The French created the Code Noir in 1724 to establish rules for treatment of slaves, as well as restrictions and rights for gens de couleur libres, a growing class of free people of color. They had the right to own land, something few blacks in the American South had at that time. The disruption of the Louisiana Creole community began when the United States made the Louisiana Purchase and Americans started settling in the state. The new settlers typically recognized only the system of race that prevailed where they came from. When the Civil War ended and the black slaves were freed, Louisiana Creoles often assumed positions of leadership. However, segregationist Democrats in Louisiana classified Creoles with freedmen and by the end of the 19th century had disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites under rules designed to suppress black voting (though federal law said all black men had the vote from 1870). Creoles continued to press for education and advancement while negotiating the new society. Zydeco's rural beginnings and the prevailing economic conditions at its inception are reflected in the song titles, lyrics, and bluesy vocals. The music arose as a synthesis of traditional Creole music, some Cajun music influences, and African-American traditions, including R&B;, blues, jazz, and gospel. It was also often just called French music or le musique Creole known as \\"la-la.\\" Am√©d√© Ardoin, the second musician to record the Creole music of southwest Louisiana and its most influential, made his first recordings in 1929. This Creole music served as a foundation for what later became known as zydeco. Sometimes the music was performed in the Catholic Church community centers, as Creoles were mostly Catholic. Later it moved to rural dance halls and nightclubs. During World War II with the Great Migration, many French-speaking and Louisiana Creole speaking Cr√©oles from the area around Marksville and Opelousas, Louisiana left a poor and prejudiced state for better economic opportunities in Texas. Even more southern blacks migrated to California, where buildup of defense industries provided good jobs without the restrictions of the segregated South. In California blacks from Louisiana could vote and began to participate in political life. Today, there are many Cajun and zydeco festivals throughout the US. Post-war history Chenier Brothers performing at Jay's Lounge and Cockpit, Cankton, Louisiana, Mardi Gras, 1975 Zydeco music pioneer Clifton Chenier, \\"The King of Zydeco,\\" made zydeco popular on regional radio stations with his bluesy style and keyboard accordion. In the mid-1950s, Chenier's popularity brought zydeco to the fringes of the American mainstream. He signed with Specialty Records, the same label that first recorded Little Richard and Sam Cooke for wide audiences. Chenier, considered the architect of contemporary zydeco, became the music's first major star, with early hits like \\"Les Haricots Sont Pas Sal√©s\\" (\\"The Snap Beans Ain't Salty\\" -- a reference to the singer being too poor to afford salt pork to season the beans). In the mid-1980s, Rockin' Sidney brought international attention to zydeco music with his hit tune \\"My Toot Toot\\". Clifton Chenier, Rockin' Sidney and Queen Ida all garnered Grammy awards during this pivotal period, opening the door to emerging artists who would continue the traditions. Ida is the only living Grammy award winner in the genre. Rockin' Dopsie recorded with Paul Simon and also signed a major label deal during this time. John Delafose was extremely popular regionally. The music made major advances when emerging bands burst exuberantly onto the national scene, fusing new sounds and styles with the music. Boozoo Chavis, Roy Carrier, Zydeco Force, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas, the Sam Brothers, Terrance Simien, Chubby Carrier, and many others were breathing new life into the music. Zydeco superstar Buckwheat Zydeco was already well into his career, and also signed his deal with Island Records in the mid-1980s. Combined with the national popularity of Creole and Cajun food, and the feature film The Big Easy, set in New Orleans, zydeco music had a revival. New artists were cultivated and the music took a more innovative direction and enjoyed increased mainstream popularity. C. J. Chenier performing in the Ross Bandstand Young zydeco musicians such as C. J. Chenier (son of Clifton Chenier), Chubby Carrier, Geno Delafose, Terrance Simien, Nathan Williams and others began touring internationally during the 1980s. Beau Jocque was a monumental songwriter and innovator who infused zydeco with powerful beats and bass lines in the 90s, adding striking production and elements of funk, hip- hop and rap. Young performers like Chris Ardoin, Keith Frank, and Zydeco Force added further by tying the sound to the bass drum rhythm to accentuate or syncopate the backbeat even more. This style is sometimes called \\"double clutching.\\" Hundreds of zydeco bands continue the music traditions across the U.S. and in Europe, Japan, the UK and Australia. A precocious 7-year-old zydeco accordionist, Guyland Leday, was featured in an HBO documentary about music and young people. In 2007, zydeco achieved a separate category in the Grammy awards, the Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album category. But in 2011 the Grammy awards eliminated the category and folded the genre into its new Best Regional Roots Album category. More recent zydeco artists include Lil' Nate, Leon Chavis, Mo' Mojo and Kenne' Wayne. Wayne has fused zydeco with up tempo southern soul and smooth ballads to create a sound which he calls \\"zydesoul,\\" while torchbearer Andre Thierry has kept the tradition alive on the West Coast. Leading the world of traditional Zydeco today is the Dwayne Dopsie (son of Rockin' Dopsie) and his band, the Zydeco Hellraisers. They were nominated for best Regional Roots Album in the 2017 Grammy Award's. Dwayne and his band travel the globe playing 250 plus shows a year, keeping true zydeco music alive. While zydeco is a genre that has become synonymous with the cultural and musical identity of Louisiana and an important part of the musical landscape of the United States, this southern black music tradition has also now achieved much wider appreciation. Because of the migration of the French-speaking blacks and multiracial Creoles, the mixing of Cajun and Creole musicians, and the warm embrace of people from outside these cultures, there are multiple hotbeds of zydeco: Louisiana, Texas, Oregon, California, and Europe as far north as Scandinavia. There are zydeco festivals throughout America and Europe. Zydeco music is performed at festivals, schools, performing art centers and large corporate events. It is performed for presidents and celebrities, heard on cinema soundtracks and used to advertise everything from vehicles to toothpaste to antacids, pharmaceuticals and candy bars. Rolling Stone, the Los Angeles Times, Time magazine among many others have featured it. It is played on radio stations around the world and on Internet radio. Instruments A zydeco musician wearing a vest frottoir. The first zydeco vest frottoir (rubboard) was designed by Clifton Chenier, the \\"King of Zydeco,\\" in 1946 while he and his brother, Cleveland, were working at an oil refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The first zydeco rubboard made to Chenier's design was made at Chenier's request by their fellow Louisianan, Willie Landry, a master welder-fabricator, who was also working at the refinery. The zydeco rubboard, designed specifically for the genre solely as a percussion instrument, is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Other instruments common in zydeco include the old world accordion which is found in folk and roots music globally, guitar, bass guitar, drums, and occasionally horns, keyboards, and spoons.

Singers of Ra√Ø are called cheb (Arabic: ÿ¥ÿßÿ®) (or shabab, i.e. young) as opposed to sheikh (Arabic: ÿ¥ŸäÿÆ) (shaykh, i.e. old), the name given to Chaabi singers. The tradition arose in the city of Oran, primarily among the poor. Traditionally sung by men, by the end of the 20th century, female singers had become common. The lyrics of Ra√Ø have concerned social issues such as disease and the policing of European colonies that affected native populations.Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.\\" Diaspora 3:1 (1994): 3- 39. Reprinted in The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader, ed. by Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo, History=Origins= Ra√Ø is a type of Algerian popular music that arose in the 1920s in the port city of Oran and that self-consciously ran counter to accepted artistic and social mores. It appealed to young people who sought to modernize the traditional Islamic values and attitudes. Regional, secular, and religious drum patterns, melodies, and instruments were blended with Western electric instrumentation. Ra√Ø emerged as a major world-music genre in the late 1980s. In the years just following World War I, the Algerian city of Oran‚Äîknown as ‚Äúlittle Paris‚Äù‚Äîwas a melting pot of various cultures, full of nightclubs and cabarets; it was the place to go for a bawdy good time. Out of this milieu arose a group of male and female Muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates, who rejected the refined, classical poetry of traditional Algerian music. Instead, to the accompaniment of pottery drums and end-blown flutes, they sang about the adversity of urban life in a raw, gritty, sometimes vulgar, and inevitably controversial language that appealed especially to the socially and economically disadvantaged. The cheikhates further departed from tradition in that they performed not only for women but also and especially for men. The music performed was called ra√Ø. It drew its name from the Algerian Arabic word ra√Ø (‚Äúopinion‚Äù or ‚Äúadvice‚Äù), which was typically inserted‚Äîand repeated‚Äîby singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics. By the early 1940s Cheikha Rimitti el Reliziana had emerged locally as a musical and linguistic luminary in the ra√Ø tradition, and she continued to be among the music‚Äôs most prominent performers into the 21st century. In the early 20th century, Oran was divided into Jewish, French, Spanish, and Arab quarters. By independence in 1962, the Jewish quarter (known as the Derb), was home to musicians like Reinette L'Oranaise, Saoud l'Oranais and Larbi Bensari. Sidi el Houari was home to Spanish fishermen and many refugees from Spain who arrived after 1939. These two quarters had active music scenes,Morgan, pp 413‚Äì424 and the French inhabitants of the city went to the Jewish and Spanish areas to examine the music. The Arabs of Oran were known for al-andalous, a classical style of music imported from Southern Spain after 1492. Hawzi classical music was popular during this time, and female singers of the genre included Cheikha Tetma, Fadila D'zirya and Myriam Fekkai. Another common musical genre was Bedoui (\\"Bedouin\\") (or gharbi (\\"Western\\")), which originated from Bedouin chants. Bedoui consisted of Melhun poetry being sung with accompaniment from guellal drums and gaspa Flutes. Bedoui was sung by male singers, known as cheikhs, who were dressed in long, white jellabas and turbans. Lyrics came from the poetry of people such as Mestfa ben Brahim and Zenagui Bouhafs. Performers of bedoui included Cheikh Hamada, Cheikh Mohammed Senoussi, Cheikh Madani, Cheikh Hachemi Bensmir and Cheikh Khaldi. Senoussi was the first to have had recorded the music in 1906. French colonization of Algeria changed the organization of society, producing a class of poor, uneducated urban men and women. Bedoui singers mostly collaborated with the French colonizers, though one exception from such collaboration was Cheikh Hamada. The problems of survival in a life of poverty were the domain of street musicians who sang bar-songs called zendanis. A common characteristic of these songs included exclamations of the word \\"ra√Ø!\\" and variations thereof. The word \\"rai\\" implies that an opinion is being expressed. In the 1920s, the women of Oran were held to strict code of conduct. Many of those that failed became social outcasts and singers and dancers. They sang medh songs in praise of the prophet Mohammed and performed for female audiences at ceremonies such as weddings and circumcision feasts. These performers included Les Trois Filles de Baghdad, Soubira bent Menad and Kheira Essebsadija. Another group of female social outcasts were called cheikhas, who were known for their alluring dress, hedonistic lyrics, and their display of a form of music that was influenced from meddhahates and zendani singers. These cheikhas, who sang for both men and women, included people such as Cheikha Remitti el Reliziana, Cheikha Gr√©lo, Cheikha Djenia el Mostganmia, Cheikha Bachitta de Mascara, and Cheikha a; Ouachma el Tmouchentia. The 1930s saw the rise of revolutionary organizations, including organizations motivated by Marxism, which mostly despised these early roots ra√Ø singers. At the same time, Arabic classical music was gaining huge popularity across the Maghreb, especially the music of Egypt's Umm Kulthum. When first developed, ra√Ø was a hybrid blend of rural and cabaret musical genres, invented by and targeted toward distillery workers, peasants who had lost their land to European settlers, and other types of lower class citizens. The geographical location of Oran allowed for the spread of many cultural influences, allowing ra√Ø musicians to absorb an assortment of musical styles such as flamenco from Spain, gnawa music, and French cabaret, allowing them to combine with the rhythms typical of Arab nomads. In the early 1930s, social issues afflicting the Arab population in the colony, such as the disease of typhus, harassment and imprisonment by the colonial police, and poverty were prominent themes of ra√Ø lyrics. However, other main lyrical themes concerned the likes of wine, love, and the meaning and experiences of leading a marginal life. From its origins, women played a significant role in the music and performance of ra√Ø. In contrast to other Algerian music, ra√Ø incorporated dancing in addition to music, particularly in a mixed-gender environment.Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.\\" Diaspora 3:1 (1994): 3- 39. [Reprinted in The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader, ed. by Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo, 1 In the 1930s, Ra√Ø, al-andalousm, and the Egyptian classical style influenced the formation of wahrani, a musical style popularized by Blaoui Houari. Musicians like Mohammed Belarbi and Djelloul Bendaoud added these influences to other Oranian styles, as well as Western piano and accordion, resulting in a style called bedoui citadinis√©. Revolt began in the mid-1950s, and musicians which included Houari and Ahmed Saber supported the Front de Lib√©ration National. After independence in 1962, however, the Marxist government of the Houari Boum√©dienne regime, along with President Ahmed Ben Bella, did not tolerate criticism from musicians such as Saber, and suppression of Ra√Ø and Oranian culture ensued. The number of public performances by female ra√Ø singers decreased, which led to men playing an increased role in this genre of music. Meanwhile, traditional ra√Ø instruments such as the gasba (reed flute), and the derbouka (North african drums) were replaced with the violin and accordion. =Post-independence= In the 1960s, Bellamou Messaoud and Belkacem Bouteldja began their career, and they changed the ra√Ø sound, eventually gaining mainstream acceptance in Algeria by 1964. In the 1970s, recording technology began growing more advanced, and more imported genres had Algerian interest as well, especially Jamaican reggae with performers like Bob Marley. Over the following decades, ra√Ø increasingly assimilated the sounds of the diverse musical styles that surfaced in Algeria. During the 1970s, ra√Ø artists brought in influences from other countries such as Egypt, Europe, and the Americas. Trumpets, the electric guitar, synthesizers, and drum machines were specific instruments that were put into ra√Ø music. This marked the beginning of pop ra√Ø, which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of Cheb (male) or Chaba (female), meaning ‚Äúyoung,‚Äù to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style. Among the most prominent performers of the new ra√Ø were Chaba Fadela, Cheb Hamid, and Cheb Mami. However, by the time the first international ra√Ø festival was held in Algeria in 1985, Cheb Khaled had become virtually synonymous with the genre. More festivals followed in Algeria and abroad, and ra√Ø became a popular and prominent new genre in the emergent world-music market. cheb (young man) and cheba (young woman).Joan, Gross p. 7 International success of the genre had begun as early as 1976 with the rise to prominence of producer Rachid Baba Ahmed. During the 1970s, ra√Ø artists brought in influences from other countries such as Egypt, Europe, and the Americas. Trumpets, the electric guitar, synthesizers, and drum machines were specific instruments that were put into ra√Ø music. This marked the beginning of pop ra√Ø, which was performed by a later generation of chabs (young men) and chabates (young women). International success of the genre had begun as early as 1976 with the rise to prominence of producer Rachid Baba Ahmed. The added expense of producing LPs as well as the technical aspects imposed on the medium by the music led to the genre being released almost exclusively onto cassette by the early 1980s, with a great deal of music having no LP counterpart at all and a very limited exposure on CD. While this form of ra√Ø increased cassette sales, its association with mixed dancing, an obscene act according to orthodox Islamic views, led to government-backed suppression. However, this suppression was overturned due to ra√Ø's growing popularity in France, where it was strongly demanded by the Maghrebi Arab community. This popularity in France was increased as a result of the upsurge of Franco-Arab struggles against racism. This led to a following of a white audience that was sympathetic to the antiracist struggle. After the election of president Chadli Bendjedid in 1979, Ra√Ø music had a chance to rebuild because of his lessened moral and economic restraints. Shortly afterwards, Ra√Ø started to form into pop-ra√Ø, with the use of instruments such as electrical synthesizers, guitars, and drum machines.https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/gross_etal- arab_noise.pdfRa√Ø ‚Äì Rebel Music from Algeria In the 1980s, ra√Ø began its period of peak popularity. Previously, the Algerian government had opposed ra√Ø because of its sexually and culturally risqu√© topics, such as alcohol and consumerism, two subjects that were taboo to the traditional Islamic culture. The government eventually attempted to ban ra√Ø, banning the importation of blank cassettes and confiscating the passports of ra√Ø musicians. This was done to prevent ra√Ø from not only spreading throughout the country, but to prevent it from spreading internationally and from coming in or out of Algeria. Though this limited the professional sales of ra√Ø, the music increased in popularity through the illicit sale and exchange of tapes. In 1985, Algerian Colonel Snoussi joined with French minister of culture Jack Lang to convince the Algerian state to accept ra√Ø. He succeeded in getting the government to return passports to ra√Ø musicians and to allow ra√Ø to be recorded and performed in Algeria, with government sponsorship, claiming it as a part of Algerian cultural heritage. This not only allowed the Algerian government to financially gain from producing and releasing ra√Ø, but it allowed them to monitor the music and prevent the publication of \\"unclean\\" music and dance and still use it to benefit the Algerian State's image in the national world. In 1986, the first state-sanctioned ra√Ø festival was held in Algeria, and a festival was also held in Bobigny, France. In 1988, Algerian students and youth flooded the streets to protest state-sponsored violence, the high cost of staple foods, and to support the Peoples' Algerian Army.Meghelli, Samir. \\"Interview with Youcef (Intik).\\" In Tha Global Cipha: Hip Hop Culture and Consciousness, ed. by James G. Spady, H. Samy Alim, and Samir Meghelli. 656-67. Philadelphia: Black History Museum Publishers, 2006. President Chadli Bendjedid, who held power from 1979 to 1992, and his FLN cronies blamed ra√Ø for the massive uprising that left 500 civilians dead in October 1988. Most ra√Ø singers denied the allegation, including Cheb Sahraoui, who said there was no connection between ra√Ø and the October rebellion. Yet ra√Ø's reputation as protest music stuck because the demonstrators adopted Khaled's song \\"El Harba Wayn\\" (\\"To Flee, But Where?\\") to aid their protesting: > Where has youth gone? > Where are the brave ones? > The rich gorge themselves > The poor work themselves to death > The Islamic charlatans show their true face... > You can always cry or complain > Or escape... but where? In the 1990s, restrictions were placed on ra√Ø, and those who did not submit to censorship faced consequences such as exile. One exiled ra√Ø singer, Cheb Hasni, accepted an offer to return to Algeria and perform at a stadium in 1994. Hasni's fame and controversial songs led to him receiving death threats from Islamic fundamentalist extremists. On September 29, 1994, he was the first ra√Ø musician to be murdered, outside his parents' home in the Gambetta district of Oran, reportedly because he let girls kiss him on the cheek during a televised concert. His death came amid other violent actions against North African performers. A few days before his death, the Kabyle singer Loun√®s Matoub was abducted by the GIA. The following year, on February 15, 1995, Ra√Ø producer Rachid Baba-Ahmed was assassinated in Oran. The escalating tension of the Islamist anti-ra√Ø campaign caused ra√Ø musicians such as Chab Mami and Chaba Fadela to relocate from Algeria to France. Moving to France was a way to sustain the music's existence. France was where Algerians had moved during the post-colonial era in order to find work, and where musicians had a greater opportunity to oppose the government without censorship. Though ra√Ø found mainstream acceptance in Algeria, Islamic fundamentalists still protested the genre, saying that it was still too liberal and too contrasting to traditional Islamic values. The fundamentalists claimed that the musical genre still promoted sexuality, alcohol and Western consumer culture, but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and ra√Ø musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population, the youth, who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures. Despite the governmental support, a split remained between those citizens belonging to strict Islam and those patronizing the ra√Ø scene. =International success = Cheb Khaled was the first musician with international success, including his 1988 album Kutch√©, though his popularity did not extend to places such as the United States and Latin America. Other prominent performers of the 1980s included Houari Benchenet, Ra√Øna Ra√Ø, Mohamed Sahraoui, Cheb Mami, and Cheb Hamid. International success grew in the 1990s, with Cheb Khaled's 1992 album Khaled. With Khaled no longer in Algeria, musicians such as Cheb Tahar, Cheb Nasro, and Cheb Hasni began singing lover's ra√Ø, a sentimental, pop-ballad form of ra√Ø music. Later in the decade, funk, hip hop, and other influences were added to ra√Ø, especially by performers like Faudel and Rachid Taha, the latter of whom took ra√Ø music and fused it with rock. Taha did not call his creation ra√Ø music, but rather described it as a combination of folk ra√Ø and punk.Curiel, Jonathan. \\"Arab rocker Rachid Taha's music fueled by politics, punk attitude and -- what else? -- romance\\". San Francisco Chronicle. 27 June 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2013. Another mix of cultures in Arabic music of the late 1990s came through Franco-Arabic music released by musicians such as Aldo. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rise in female ra√Ø performers. According to authors Gross, McMurray, and Swedenburg in their article \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identity,\\" ra√Ø musician Chaba Zahouania was forbidden by her family to perform or even appear in public. According to Gross et al., the ra√Ø record companies have pushed female artists to become more noticed.Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.\\" Diaspora 3:1 (1994) Censorship of ra√Ø music Throughout the course of ra√Ø music's development and commercialization in Algeria, there have been many attempts to stifle the genre. From lyrical content to the album cover images, ra√Ø has been a controversial music. Religious identity and transnationalism function to define the complexities of Maghrebi identity. This complex identity is expressed through ra√Ø music and is often contested and censored in many cultural contexts. In 1962, as Algeria claimed its national independence, expression of popular culture was stifled by the conservative nature of the people. During this time of drastic restriction of female expression, many men started to become ra√Ø singers. By 1979, when president Chadli Bendjedid endorsed more liberal moral and economic standards, ra√Ø music became further associated with Algerian youth. The music remained stigmatized amongst the Salafi Islamists and the Algerian government. Termed the \\"ra√Ø generation\\", the youth found ra√Ø as a way to express sexual and cultural freedoms.Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.\\" Diaspora 3:1 (1994) An example of this free expression is through the lyrics of Cheb Hasni in his song \\"El Berraka\\". Hasni sang: \\"I had her ... because when you're drunk that's the sort of idea that runs through your head!\\"Freemuse: Algeria: Cheb Hasni‚Äîpopular rai hero assassinated Hasni challenged the fundamentalists of the country and the condemnation of non-religious art forms. Ra√Ø started to circulate on a larger scale, via tape sales, TV exposure, and radio play. However, the government attempted to \\"clean up\\" ra√Ø to adhere to conservative values. Audio engineers manipulated the recordings of ra√Ø artists in order to submit to such standards. This tactic allowed for the economy to profit from the music by gaining conservative audiences. The conservativeness not only affected the way listeners received ra√Ø music, but also the way the artists, especially female artists, presented their own music. For instance, female ra√Ø artists usually do not appear on their album covers. Such patriarchal standards pressure women to societal privacy.

Haworth projection of the chitin molecule. A close-up of the wing of a leafhopper; the wing is composed of chitin. Chitin (C8H13O5N)n ( ) is a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. This polysaccharide is a primary component of cell walls in fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae of molluscs, cephalopod beaks, and the scales of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to another polysaccharide, cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved useful for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes. Etymology The English word \\"chitin\\" comes from the French word chitine, which was derived in 1821 from the Greek word œáŒπœÑœéŒΩ (chiton), meaning covering. A similar word, \\"chiton\\", refers to a marine animal with a protective shell.  Chemistry, physical properties and biological function  Chemical configurations of the different monosaccharides (glucose and N-acetylglucosamine) and polysaccharides (chitin and cellulose) presented in Haworth projection The structure of chitin was determined by Albert Hofmann in 1929. Hofmann hydrolyzed chitin using a crude preparation of the enzyme chitinase, which he obtained from the snail Helix pomatia. Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). These units form covalent Œ≤-(1‚Üí4)-linkages (like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose). Therefore, chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced with an acetyl amine group. This allows for increased hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers, giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength. A cicada emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton. In its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most arthropods, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of composite materials, such as in sclerotin, a tanned proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects. Combined with calcium carbonate, as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate.Campbell, N. A. (1996) Biology (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings, New Work. p.69 Another difference between pure and composite forms can be seen by comparing the flexible body wall of a caterpillar (mainly chitin) to the stiff, light elytron of a beetle (containing a large proportion of sclerotin). In butterfly wing scales, chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotypic signaling and communication for mating and foraging. The elaborate chitin gyroid construction in butterfly wings creates a model of optical devices having potential for innovations in biomimicry. Scarab beetles in the genus Cyphochilus also utilize chitin to form extremely thin scales (five to fifteen micrometres thick) that diffusely reflect white light. These scales are networks of randomly ordered filaments of chitin with diameters on the scale of hundreds of nanometres, which serve to scatter light. The multiple scattering of light is thought to play a role in the unusual whiteness of the scales. In addition, some social wasps, such as Protopolybia chartergoides, orally secrete material containing predominantly chitin to reinforce the outer nest envelopes, composed of paper.Kud√¥, K. Nest materials and some chemical characteristics of nests of a New World swarm-founding polistine wasp, (Hymenoptera Vespidae). Ethology, ecology & evolution 13.4 Oct 2001: 351-360. Dipartimento di biologia animale e genetica, Universit√† di Firenze. 16 Oct 2014. Chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin; chitosan is soluble in water, while chitin is not. Nanofibrils have been made using chitin and chitosan. Health effects Chitin-producing organisms like protozoa, fungi, arthropods, and nematodes are often pathogens in other species. =Humans and other mammals= Humans and other mammals have chitinase and chitinase-like proteins that can degrade chitin; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products in a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, initiating an immune response. Chitin is sensed mostly in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract where it can activate the innate immune system through eosinophils or macrophages, as well as an adaptive immune response through T helper cells. Keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments. According to in vitro studies, chitin is sensed by receptors, such as FIBCD1, KLRB1, REG3G, Toll- like receptor 2, CLEC7A, and mannose receptors. The immune response can sometimes clear the chitin and its associated organism, but sometimes the immune response is pathological and becomes an allergy; allergy to house dust mites is thought to be driven by a response to chitin. =Plants= Plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin, namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein. The first chitin receptor was cloned in 2006. When the receptors are activated by chitin, genes related to plant defense are expressed, and jasmonate hormones are activated, which in turn activate systematic defenses. Commensal fungi have ways to interact with the host immune response that were not well understood. Some pathogens produce chitin-binding proteins that mask the chitin they shed from these receptors. Zymoseptoria tritici is an example of a fungal pathogen that has such blocking proteins; it is a major pest in wheat crops. Fossil record Chitin was probably present in the exoskeletons of Cambrian arthropods such as trilobites. The oldest preserved chitin dates to the Oligocene, about , consisting of a scorpion encased in amber.  Uses = Agriculture = Chitin is a good inducer of plant defense mechanisms for controlling diseases. It has potential for use as a soil fertilizer or conditioner to improve fertility and plant resilience that may enhance crop yields. = Industrial = Chitin is used in industry in many processes. Examples of the potential uses of chemically modified chitin in food processing include the formation of edible films and as an additive to thicken and stabilize foods and food emulsions. Processes to size and strengthen paper employ chitin and chitosan. Research How chitin interacts with the immune system of plants and animals has been an active area of research, including the identity of key receptors with which chitin interacts, whether the size of chitin particles is relevant to the kind of immune response triggered, and mechanisms by which immune systems respond. Chitin and chitosan have been explored as a vaccine adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate an immune response. Chitin and chitosan are under development as scaffolds in studies of how tissue grows and how wounds heal, and in efforts to invent better bandages, surgical thread, and materials for allotransplantation. Sutures made of chitin have been explored for many years, but , none were on the market; their lack of elasticity and problems making thread have prevented commercial development. In 2014, a method for using chitosan as a reproducible form of biodegradable plastic was introduced. Chitin nanofibers are extracted from crustacean waste and mushrooms for possible development of products in tissue engineering, medicine, and industry. In 2020, chitin was proposed for use in building structures, tools, and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with Martian regolith. In this scenario, the biopolymers in the chitin act as the binder for the regolith aggregate to form a concrete- like composite material. The authors believe that waste materials from food production (e.g. scales from fish, exoskeletons from crustaceans and insects, etc.) could be put to use as feedstock for manufacturing processes.

Lyrics may be bleak or socially aware, but also more heartfelt and less likely to use the clich√©s sometimes used by mainstream country musicians. In other respects, the musical styles of artists that fall within this genre often have little in common, ranging from traditional American folk music and bluegrass, through rockabilly and honky-tonk, to music that is indistinguishable from mainstream rock or country.C. K. Wolfe and J. E. Akenson, Country Music Annual 2001 (University Press of Kentucky, 2001), , pp. 78‚Äì80. This already broad labeling has been further confused by alternative country artists disavowing the movement, mainstream artists declaring they are part of it, and retroactive claims that past or veteran musicians are alternative country. No Depression, the best-known magazine dedicated to the genre, declared that it covered \\"alternative-country music (whatever that is)\\".A. A. Fox, \\"Alternative to what?\\": O Brother, September 11 and the politics of country music\\", in C. K. Wolfe and J. E. Akenson, Country Music Goes to War (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2005), , p. 164. History The singer-songwriter Sarah Peacock Alternative country drew on traditional American country music, the music of working people, preserved and celebrated by practitioners such as Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and The Carter Family, often cited as major influences.G Smith, Singing Australian: a History of Folk and Country Music (Melbourne: Pluto Press Australia, 2005), , p. 134. Another major influence was country rock, the result of fusing country music with a rock & roll sound. The artist most commonly thought to have originated country rock is Gram Parsons (who referred to his sound as \\"Cosmic American Music\\"), although Michael Nesmith, Steve EarleK. Wolff and O. Duane, eds, Country Music: the Rough Guide (London: Rough Guides, 2000), , p. 396. and Gene Clark are frequently identified as important innovators.M. Demming, \\"Gene Clark: biography\\", Allmusic, May 3, 2014. The third factor was punk rock, which supplied an energy and DIY attitude.

They released three more influential albums, signing to a major label, before they broke up in 1994, with members and figures associated with them going on to form three major bands in the genre: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets. Bottle Rockets signed, along with acts like Freakwater, Old 97's and Robbie Fulks, to the Chicago-based indie label, Bloodshot, who pioneered a version of the genre under the name insurgent country.K. Wolff and O. Duane, eds, Country Music: the Rough Guide (London: Rough Guides, 2000), , p. 550.

It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll\\" as a distinct genre from the rockabilly that spawned it. Origins The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at RCA Victor, Columbia Records and Decca Records in Nashville, Tennessee. RCA Victor manager and producer Chet Atkins, and producers Steve Sholes, Owen Bradley and Bob Ferguson, and recording engineer Bill Porter invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style (fiddles, steel guitar, nasal lead vocals) with \\"smooth\\" elements from 1950s pop music (string sections, background vocals, crooning lead vocals), and using \\"slick\\" production, and pop music structures.The Tennessee Encyclopedia. Nashville Recording Industry. Accessed April 9, 2016.Sanjek, Russell. (1988). \\"American Popular Music and Its Business: the first four hundred years\\". Oxford University Press. . The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team, whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit-making process. The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s. In 1960, Time reported that Nashville had \\"nosed out Hollywood as the nation's second biggest (after New York) record-producing center.\\" The term Nashville sound was first mentioned in an article about Jim Reeves in 1958 in the Music Reporter and again in 1960 in a TIME article about Reeves.Bill Ivey, Encyclopedia of Country Music Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound. Country historian Rich Kienzle says that \\"Gone\\", a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956, \\"may well have pointed the way to the Nashville sound.\\" Writer Colin Escott proclaims Reeves' \\"Four Walls\\", recorded February 1957, to be the \\"first 'Nashville sound' record\\", and Chet Atkins, the RCA Victor producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound's primary artistic creator, pointed to his production of Don Gibson's \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" later the same year. In an essay published in Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles, David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley's rock and roll recording of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound. Cantwell, however, doesn't factor in earlier Nashville recordings using vocal choruses or the fact that Presley's recordings were not marketed as country. Regarding the Nashville sound, the record producer Owen Bradley stated Quonset Hut Studio, RCA Studio B and later RCA Studio A, located directly center of Music Row, were considered pivotal as well as essential locations to the development of the Nashville Sound musical techniques. RCA Studio A specifically was designed and built to incorporate these techniques and was designed by RCA's sound engineer John E. Volkmann. Countrypolitan Lynn Anderson In the early 1960s, the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths, in separate airplane crashes, of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, two of the Nashville sound's biggest stars. Nashville's pop song structure became more pronounced, and it morphed into what was called countrypolitan‚Äîa smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often background vocals provided by a choir. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and its music sold well through the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill (who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette's early career) and Glenn Sutton. Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette, Glen Campbell (who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville), Lynn Anderson, George Jones, Charlie Rich, and Charley Pride. The Bakersfield sound, and later outlaw country, dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts. Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was, Chet Atkins put his hand into his pocket, shook his loose change, and said \\"That's what it is. It's the sound of money\\". Country pop By the late 1970s and 1980s, many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop, the fusion of country music and pop music.

He is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and by the prophets Obadiah and Malachi. The New Testament alludes to him in the Epistle to the Romans and in the Epistle to the Hebrews. According to the Hebrew Bible, Esau is the progenitor of the Edomites and the elder brother of Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelites.Metzger & Coogan (1993). Oxford Companion to the Bible, pp. 191‚Äì92. Esau and Jacob were the sons of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandsons of Abraham and Sarah. Of the twins, Esau was the first to be born with Jacob following, holding his heel. Isaac was sixty years old when the boys were born. Esau, a \\"man of the field\\", became a hunter who had \\"rough\\" qualities that distinguished him from his twin brother. Among these qualities were his redness and noticeable hairiness. Jacob was a plain or simple man, depending on the translation of the Hebrew word tam (which also means \\"relatively perfect man\\"). Jacob's color was not mentioned. Throughout Genesis, Esau is frequently shown as being supplanted by his younger twin, Jacob (Israel).Attridge & Meeks. The Harper Collins Study Bible, (, ), 2006, p. 40 In Genesis=Birth= Genesis 25:25 narrates Esau's birth, \\"Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.\\" The meaning of the word esau is disputed. It could be related to the Arabic root ƒ°≈°w, meaning \\"to cover\\". Others have noted the similarity to Arabic ‚Äôathaa (ÿπÿ´ÿß) meaning \\"hirsute\\". In Hebrew, the word \\"hairy\\" (Heb: se‚Äôir) is a wordplay on Seir, the region in which he settled after being 40 years of age. The name Edom is also attributed to Esau, meaning \\"red\\" (Heb: \`admoni); the same color used to describe Esau's skin tone. Genesis parallels his redness to the \\"red lentil pottage\\" that he sold his birthright for. Esau became the progenitor of the Edomites in Seir. =Birthright= Esau and Jacob Presented to Isaac (painting circa 1779‚Äì1801 by Benjamin West) In Genesis, Esau returned to his twin brother Jacob, famished from the fields. He begs Jacob to give him some \\"red pottage\\" (a play on his nickname, \`Edom, meaning \\"red\\".) This refers to his red hair. Jacob offers Esau a bowl of lentil stew in exchange for Esau's birthright ( b…ô·∏µ≈çrƒÅh, the right to be recognized as firstborn son with authority over the family), and Esau agrees. Thus Jacob acquires Esau's birthright. This is the origin of the English phrase \\"for a mess of pottage\\". In , Jacob uses deception, motivated by his mother Rebecca, to lay claim to his blind father Isaac's blessing that was inherently due to the firstborn, Esau. In , Rebecca is listening while Isaac speaks to his son Esau. When Esau goes to the field to hunt for venison to bring home, Rebekah says to her son Jacob, \\"Behold, I heard thy father speak to thy brother Esau, saying: 'Bring me venison and prepare a savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.'\\" Rebecca then instructs Jacob in an elaborate deception through which Jacob pretends to be Esau, in order to steal from Esau his blessing from Isaac and his inheritance‚Äîwhich in theory Esau had already agreed to give to Jacob. Jacob follows through with the plan to steal his brother's birthright by bringing the meal his father Isaac requested and pretending to be Esau. Jacob pulled off his disguise by covering himself in hairy lamb skin so that when his blind father went to touch him, his smooth skin did not give him away as an imposter of his hairy brother. Jacob successfully received his father Isaac's blessing. As a result, Jacob becomes the spiritual leader of the family after Isaac's death and the heir of the promises of Abraham (). When Esau learns of his brother's thievery, he is livid and begs his father to undo the blessing. Isaac responds to his eldest son's plea by saying that he only had one blessing to give and that he could not reverse the sacred blessing. Esau is furious and vows to kill Jacob (). Once again Rebecca intervenes to save her younger son from being murdered by his elder twin brother, Esau. Therefore, at Rebecca's urging, Jacob flees to a distant land to work for his uncle Laban (). Jacob does not immediately receive his father's inheritance after the impersonation aimed at taking it from Esau. Having fled for his life, Jacob has left the wealth of Isaac's flocks, land and tents in Esau's hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban's household. Jacob, who had deceived and cheated his brother, is in turn deceived and cheated by his uncle. Jacob asks to marry Laban's daughter Rachel, whom he has met at the well, and Laban agrees, if Jacob will give him seven years of service. Jacob does so, but after the wedding finds that beneath the veil is not Rachel but Leah, Laban's elder daughter. He agrees to work another seven years and Jacob and Rachel are finally wed. However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban's sons. Francesco Hayez: Esau and Jacob reconcile (1844) tells of Jacob's and Esau's eventual reconciliation. Jacob sends multiple waves of gifts to Esau as they approach each other, hoping that Esau will spare his life. Esau refuses the gifts, as he is now very wealthy and does not need them. Jacob never apologizes to Esau for his actions; Jacob nevertheless bows down before Esau and insists on his receiving the gifts. Esau shows forgiveness in spite of this bitter conflict. (After this, God confirms his renaming of Jacob as \\"Israel\\".) =Jacob's deception= Genesis Chapter 27 verse 16 of the King James Version Bible: \\"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck:\\" Verse 19: \\"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\\" Verse 22-23: \\"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\\" =Family= describes Esau's marriage at the age of forty to two Canaanite women: Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. This arrangement grieved his parents. Upon seeing that his brother was blessed and that their father rejected Esau's union to Canaanites, Esau went to the house of his uncle Ishmael and married his cousin,Mandel. Ultimate Who's Who, p. 176 Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, and sister of Nebajoth. Esau's family is again revisited in , this passage names two Canaanite wives; Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, and a third: Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. Some scholars equate the three wives mentioned in Genesis 26 and 28 with those in Genesis 36.Phillips. Exploring Genesis, p. 284Jamieson-Fausset-Brown. Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible Casting his lot with the Ishmaelites, he was able to drive the Horites out of Mount Seir to settle in that region. According to some views Esau is considered to be the progenitor not only of the Edomites but of the Kenizzites and the Amalekites as well. Esau had five sons: * By Adah: Eliphaz * By Aholibamah: Jeush, Jaalam, Korah * By Bashemath: Reuel =Family tree= Other references =Minor prophet references= Esau was also known as Edom, the progenitor of the Edomites who were established to the south of the Israelites. They were an enemy nation of Israel.Peter Ackroyd, Exile and Restoration: A Study in Hebrew Thought of the Sixth Century B.C., 1968, p. 224. The minor prophets, such as Obadiah, claim that the Edomites participated in the destruction of the First Temple by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC. Exactly how the Edomites participated is not clear. Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon\\") suggests merely that Edom had encouraged the Babylonians: The Lord is asked to \\"remember against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said 'raze it, raze it to its foundations'\\".Psalm 137:7 But the prophecy of Obadiah insists on the literal \\"violence done\\" by Esau \\"unto your brother Jacob\\" when the Edomites \\"entered the gate of my people..., looted his goods..., stood at the parting of the ways to cut off the fugitive,... delivered up his survivors on his day of distress\\". By the intertestamental period, Edom had replaced Babylon as the nation that actually burned the Temple (\\"Thou hast also vowed to build thy temple, which the Edomites burned when Judah was laid waste by the Chaldees\\"1 Esdras 4:45). =New Testament references= depicts Esau as unspiritual for thoughtlessly throwing away his birthright. states \\"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,\\" based upon although this passage goes on to depict the nations of Israel (Jacob) and Edom (Esau).  Rabbinic Jewish sources  The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan connects the name Esau to the Hebrew asah, stating, \\"because he was born fully completed, with hair of the head, beard, teeth, and molars.\\" Other traditional sources connect the word with the Hebrew ≈°ƒÅv\` () meaning \\"worthless.\\"Anderson, Bradford A. (2011). Brotherhood and Inheritance: A Canonical Reading of the Esau and Edom Traditions. T&T; Clark International. p. 35. . Jewish commentaries have shed a negative view on Esau because of his rivalry with Jacob. The Midrash says that during Rebekah's pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.Bereshit Rabbah 63:6. He is considered to be a rebellious son who kept a double life until he was 15, when he sold his birthright to Jacob. According to the Talmud, the sale of the birthright took place immediately after Abraham died.Bava Batra 16b. The Talmudic dating would give both Esau and Jacob an age of 15 at the time. The lentils Jacob was cooking were meant for his father Isaac, because lentils are the traditional mourner's meal for Jews. On that day before returning, in a rage over the death of Abraham, Esau committed five sins; he raped a betrothed young woman, he committed murder (Nimrod), he denied God, he denied the resurrection of the dead, and he spurned his birthright.Bava Batra 16b Haman's lineage is given in the Targum Sheni as follows: \\"Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Srach, son of Buza, son of Iphlotas, son of Dyosef, son of Dyosim, son of Prome, son of Ma'dei, son of Bla'akan, son of Intimros, son of Haridom, son of Sh'gar, son of Nigar, son of Farmashta, son of Vayezatha, (son of Agag, son of Sumkei,) son of Amalek, son of the concubine of Eliphaz, firstborn son of Esau\\". According to Rashi, Isaac, when blessing Jacob in Esau's place, smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau's show of piety.Pirkei d'Rav Kahana, quoted in Scherman, p. 139. =Death= Esau Selling His Birthright by Hendrick ter Brugghen c. 1627 According to the Babylonian Talmud, Esau was killed by Hushim, son of Dan, son of Jacob, because Esau obstructed the burial of Jacob into the cave of Machpelah. When Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. Hushim (who was hard of hearing) did not understand what was going on, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: \\"Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?\\" He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave.Sotah 13a This means that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Jewish sources state that Esau sold his right to be buried in the cave. According to Shemot Rabbah, Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, ‚ÄúMy brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?‚ÄùShemot Rabbah 31:17 Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in Sefer HaYashar.Sefer Hayashar Chapter 27 p. 77b =Jubilees= In the Book of Jubilees, Esau's father, Isaac, compels Esau to swear not to attack or kill Jacob after Isaac has died. However, after the death of Isaac, the sons of Esau convince their father to lead them, and hired mercenaries, against Jacob in order to kill Jacob and his family and seize their wealth (especially the portion of Isaac's wealth that Isaac had left to Jacob upon his death). \\"Then Ya'aqov bent his bow and sent forth the arrow and struck Esau, his brother on his right breast and slew him (Jubilees 38:2) . . . Ya'aqov buried his brother on the hill which is in Aduram, and he returned to his house (Jubilees 38:9b).\\" ‚ÄúVerses Two & Nine.‚Äù Cepher, 3rd ed., Cepher Publishing Group, LLC, 2017, pp. 255‚Äì256.  Reputed grave on the West Bank  South of the Palestinian town of Sa'ir on the West Bank there is a tomb reputed to be that of Esau ‚Äì El 'Ais in his Arab name. The PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP), wrote that: \\"The tomb is in a chamber 37 feet east and west by 20 feet north and south, with a Mihrab on the south wall. The tomb is 12 feet long, 3 1/2 feet broad, 5 feet high, covered with a dark green cloth and a canopy above. An ostrich egg is hung near. North of the chamber is a vaulted room of equal size, and to the east is an open court with a fig- tree, and a second cenotaph rudely plastered, said to be that of Esau's slave. Rock-cut tombs exist south-west of this place.\\" The SWP stated this identification was false and that Esau's tomb was in the Biblical Mount Seir.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, p. 309 Conder, 1881, p. 215 ‚Äì6 in PEFQSConder, 1889, p. 123 ‚Äì4 in PEFQS Gallery File:Holman esau going for venison.jpgEsau Going for Venison (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible) File:Giotto di Bondone 080.jpgIsaac upon Esau's Return (fresco circa 1292‚Äì1294 by Giotto di Bondone) File:Maitre Birth of Esau and Jacob (detail).jpgBirth of Esau and Jacob (illumination circa 1475‚Äì1480 by Fran√ßois Maitre from Augustine's La Cit√© de Dieu, at the Museum Meermanno- Westreenianum) File:Master of Jean de Mandeville The Birth of Esau and Jacob.jpgThe Birth of Esau and Jacob (illumination by Master of Jean de Mandeville, Paris, from a Bible Historiale c. 1360‚Äì1370) File:Jan van den Hoecke - Jacob and Esau are reconciled.jpgThe reconciliation of Jacob and Esau (1640 painting by Jan van den Hoecke) File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpgEsau Sells His Birthright (from the 1728 Figures de la Bible)  Notes  References Bibliography * External links * Esau at the Jewish Encyclopedia * Category:Edom Category:Jacob Category:Biblical twins Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Nimrod ","title":"Esau"},{"id":"171111","text":"Tootsie's Orchid Lounge is the oldest Honky Tonk in Nashville, Tennessee. A honky-tonk (also called honkatonk, honkey-tonk, or tonk) is both a bar that provides country music for the entertainment of its patrons and the style of music played in such establishments. It can also refer to the type of piano (tack piano) used to play such music. Bars of this kind are common in the South and Southwest United States. Many eminent country music artists, such as Jimmie Rodgers, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Ernest Tubb, Johnny Horton and Merle Haggard, began their careers as amateur musicians in honky-tonks. The modern-day honky-tonk atmosphere has continued with the likes of Dwight Yoakam, Turnpike Troubadours, and Mike and the Moonpies. The origin of the term honky-tonk is disputed, originally referring to bawdy variety shows in areas of the old West (Oklahoma, the Indian Territories and Texas) and to the actual theaters showing them. The first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony; the style evolved in response to an environment in which pianos were often poorly cared for, tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys. This honky-tonk music was an important influence on the boogie-woogie piano style. Before World War II, the music industry began to refer to hillbilly music being played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as \\"honky-tonk\\" music. In the 1950s, honky-tonk entered its golden age, with the popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Faron Young, George Jones, and Hank Williams. Etymology The origin of the term honky-tonk is unknown. The earliest known use in print is an article in the Peoria Journal dated June 28, 1874, stating, \\"The police spent a busy day today raiding the bagnios and honkytonks.\\"‚ÄúUnderworld ‚Äì Women,‚Äù ‚ÄúPeoriana‚Äù collection, Peoria Public Library, pp. 2335-2342. The capitalization of the term suggests that it may have been the proper name of the theater; it is not known whether the name was taken from a generic use of the term or whether the name of the theater became a generic term for similar establishments. There are subsequent citations from 1890 in The Dallas Morning News,The Dallas Morning News (Dallas, Texas), 6 Aug. 1890: \\"Myself and him set and talked awhile and he got up and said he wanted to go to the honk-a-tonk (variety show).\\" 1892 in the Galveston Daily News (Galveston, Texas)Galveston Daily News, July 26, 1892, p. 6: \\"Fort Worth, Tex. (...) A youth named Goodman, who arrived here from Wilbarger county entered Andrews' honkatonk on Fifteenth street and was ordered out on account of his age.\\" (\\"Honky Tonk (Not from Tonk Pianos)'\\", retrieved July 9, 2006) (which used the term to refer to an adult establishment in Fort Worth), and in 1894 in The Daily Ardmoreite in Oklahoma,The Daily Ardmoreite (Oklahoma), February 26, 1894, p. 2, col. 1. (Oklahoma Historical Society, Microfilm #110). \\"The honk-a-tonk last night was well attended by ball heads, bachelors and leading citizens. Most of them are inclined to kick themselves this morning for being sold.\\" Early uses of the term in print mostly appear along a corridor roughly coinciding with cattle drive trails extending from Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, into south central Oklahoma, suggesting that the term may have been a localism spread by cowboys driving cattle to market. The sound of honky-tonk (or honk-a-tonk) and the types of places that were called honky- tonks suggests that the term may be an onomatopoeic reference to the loud, boisterous music and noise heard at these establishments. One theory is that the \\"tonk\\" portion of the name may have come from the brand name of piano made by William Tonk & Bros., an American manufacturer of large upright pianosPierce, Pierce Piano Atlas. (established 1881), which made a piano with the decal \\"Ernest A. Tonk\\". The Tonk brothers, William and Max, established the Tonk Bros. Manufacturing Company in 1873, so such an etymology is possible, however, these pianos were not manufactured until 1889, at which point the term seems to have already been established. An early source purporting to explain the derivation of the term (spelled honkatonk) was an article published in 1900 by the New York Sun and widely reprinted in other newspapers.Reno Evening Gazette (Nevada), 3 February 1900, p. 2, col. 5. The article, however, reads more like a humorous urban (or open range) legend or fable, so its veracity is questionable. History Jimmie Rodgers, one of the earliest honky-tonk innovators, from the 1920s‚Äì1930s An article in the Los Angeles Times of July 28, 1929, with the headline Honky-Tonk' Origin Told\\", which was probably in response to the Sophie Tucker movie musical, Honky Tonk (1929), reads: Honky-tonks were rough establishments, providing country music in the Deep South and Southwest and serving alcoholic beverages to a working- class clientele. Some honky-tonks offered dancing to music played by pianists or small bands, and some were centers of prostitution. Katrina Hazzard-Gordon wrote that the honky-tonk was \\"the first urban manifestation of the jook\\", and that \\"the name itself became synonymous with a style of music. Related to the classic blues in tonal structure, honky-tonk has a tempo that is slightly stepped up. It is rhythmically suited for many African-American dance.\\"Hazzard-Gordon, Katrina (1990). Jookin. Temple University Press. p. 84. . As Chris Smith and Charles McCarron wrote in their 1916 hit song \\"Down in Honky Tonk Town\\", \\"It's underneath the ground, where all the fun is found.\\" =Origins of the establishment= Although the derivation of the term is unknown, honky tonk originally referred to bawdy variety shows in the West (Oklahoma and Indian Territories and Texas) and to the theaters housing them. The earliest mention of them in print refers to them as \\"variety theaters\\"The Daily Oklahoman, Sunday, September 5, 1915, p. 1., col. 1. \\"There is scarcely an old-time gambler in the United States who does not remember the Reeves gambling house and 'honkytonk' in Guthrie. ... a stage and rows of curtained boxes, was built as an addition for the purposes of a free-and-easy variety show.\\" and describe the entertainment as \\"variety shows\\".Reno Evening Gazette (Nevada), 3 February 1900, pg. 2, col. 5. \\"The programme is made up largely of specialties. Whatever the feeling of a long-suffering public, the honkatonk vocalists never will permit 'Sweet Rosie O'Grady' and 'Just One Girl' to perish from the earth, and coon songs are sung as May Irwin never did and never will sing them. Always at least one drama is presented, the entire company, vocalists, dancers and all, participating. Among the most popular plays are 'The Dalton Boys' and 'Mildred, the She-Devil of the Plains,' for the old traditions still are respected to a certain extent, though the participation of the audience is no longer solicited.\\" The theaters often had an attached gambling house and always a bar. In recollections long after the frontiers closed, writers such as Wyatt Earp and E.C. Abbott referred to honky-tonks in the cowtowns of Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana in the 1870s and 1880s.Hunter, Trail Drivers of Texas, p. 832 : \\"I went to Dodge City, the honkatonk town, cleaned up an bought a suit of clothes, and left for San Antonio, reaching home July 1, 1885.\\" Their recollections contain lurid accounts of the women and violence accompanying the shows. However, in contemporary accounts these were nearly always called hurdy-gurdy shows, possibly derived from the term hurdy-gurdy, which was sometimes mistakenly applied to a small, portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers. As late as 1913, Col. Edwin Emerson, a former Rough Rider commander, hosted a honky-tonk party in New York City.\\"Col. Emerson's Novel Party; Rough Rider Veteran Gives 'Old Forty-niners' Honky-Tonk Fandango. The New York Times, February 23, 1913. p. C7 The Rough Riders were recruited from the ranches of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Indian Territories, so the term was still in popular use during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Music Hank Williams, an influential honky-tonker from the 1940s and early 1950s The honky-tonk sound has a full rhythm section playing a two-beat rhythm with a crisp backbeat. Steel guitar and fiddle are the dominant instruments.Campbell, Michael (2011). Popular Music in America: The Beat Goes On. Cengage Learning. p. 127. The first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk music was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony; the style evolved in response to an environment in which the pianos were often poorly cared for, tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys. Honky-tonk music influenced the boogie-woogie piano style, as indicated by Jelly Roll Morton's 1938 record \\"Honky Tonk Music\\" and Meade Lux Lewis's hit \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues.\\" Lewis recorded the latter many times from 1927 into the 1950s, and the song was covered by many other musicians, including Oscar Peterson. The twelve-bar blues instrumental \\"Honky Tonk\\" by the Bill Doggett Combo, with a sinuous saxophone line and driving, slow beat, was an early rock and roll hit. New Orleans native Fats Domino was another honky-tonk piano man, whose \\"Blueberry Hill\\" and \\"Walkin' to New Orleans\\" were hits on the popular music charts. In the years before World War II, the music industry began to refer to honky-tonk music played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as hillbilly music. More recently, the term has come to refer to the primary sound in country music, developing in Nashville as Western swing became accepted there. Originally, it featured the guitar, fiddle, string bass, and steel guitar (imported from Hawaiian folk music). The vocals were originally rough and nasal, as exemplified by the singer- songwriters Floyd Tillman and Hank Williams, but later developed a clear and sharp sound, such as that of George Jones and Faron Young. Lyrics tended to focus on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity. Copyrighted and released in 1941, \\"Walking the Floor Over You\\", by Ernest Tubb,\\"Walking The Floor Over You\\" Sheet Music by George IV Hamilton, SheetMusicNow.comErnest Tubb, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum his sixth release for Decca,Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum http://countrymusichalloffame.org/%7Bstash:permalink%7D helped establish the honky-tonk style and Tubb as one of its foremost practitioners.Morrison, Craig (1952). Go Cat Go! University of Illinois Press. p. 28. . Tubb, from Crisp, Texas, was a fan of Jimmie Rodgers and fused Western swing, which had been using electric guitars for years, with other \\"country\\" sounds.Nassour, Ellis. Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline. p. 39. He took the sound to Nashville, where he was the first musician to play electric guitar on Grand Ole Opry. In the 1950s, honky tonk entered its golden age, with the popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, Faron Young, George Jones, and Hank Williams. In the mid- to late 1950s, rockabilly (which melded honky-tonk country with rhythm and blues) and the slick country music of the Nashville sound ended honky-tonk's initial period of dominance. The Rolling Stones' number-one single and gold record \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" (1969) was based on the sound of 1940s honky-tonk artists like Hank Williams. and referred to the reputation of honky-tonk bars as centres of prostitution.. In the 1970s, outlaw country's brand of rough honky- tonk was represented by artists such as Gary Stewart, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, David Allan Coe, and Billy Joe Shaver.

SciFri is hosted by award- winning science journalist Ira Flatow and was created and is produced by the Science Friday Initiative. The program is divided into two one-hour programs, with each hour ending with a complete sign-off. The focus of each program is news and information on science, nature, medicine, and technology. For most of its existence, Science Friday was a sub-program within Talk of the Nation, serving as the fifth day of programming on Friday. Science Friday was spun off as a series in its own right when Talk of the Nation was canceled in June 2013. The Science Friday radio program is produced by the Science Friday Initiative, a 501(c)(3) organization. The Science Friday Initiative is an independently run organization with a governing Board of Directors and Executive Director. In addition to the radio program, the organization creates award-winning educational and digital content, finds underwriting for the program, and hosts public science events. Science Friday is also available in a podcasting format and is one of the most popular iTunes downloads, frequently in the top 15 downloads each week. SciFri podcasts are downloaded over 23 million times per year and over 1.8 million listeners tune in each week to hear the program. It is also carried via Sirius XM Radio. SciFri broadcasts excerpts from the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony on the Friday after Thanksgiving.Science Friday Archives: The 2007 Ig Nobel Awards Funding The Science Friday Initiative accepts tax-deductible donations on behalf of the radio program. Science Friday is funded by stations fees that broadcast the program, by individual donors, by advertising underwriters, and by foundation grants including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Research Corporation for Science Advancement, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and Heising-Simons Foundation. Formerly the program was supported by the Noyce Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Science Friday has received federal funding from the US National Science Foundation and NASA. History SciFri was created when the National Science Foundation agreed to fund a weekly science talk-show on NPR. After the Gulf War in 1991, NPR created the daily talk show Talk of the Nation, and incorporated Science Friday into it. Science Friday moved from NPR to Public Radio International in 2014. Science Friday maintained an island (Science Friday Island) in Second Life, including an open-air theater with live audio and video feeds of the broadcast. That venue is no longer in operation. On November 9, 2012, ScienceFriday, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in New York state court against a long-running Denver radio program, titled Real Science Friday, hosted by two young earth creationists including Colorado pastor and radio personality Bob Enyart. The show was re-titled Real Science Radio. RSR has always been a sub-program within the daily Bob Enyart Live program heard on Denver Christian Talk station KLTT.

He received the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1960 for his autobiography '. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. Biography=Dresden 1899-1919= Birthplace ‚Äì memorial plaque K√§stner was born in Dresden, Saxony, and grew up on K√∂nigsbr√ºcker Stra√üe in Dresden's √Ñu√üere Neustadt. Close by, the Erich K√§stner Museum was subsequently opened in the Villa Augustin that had belonged to K√§stner's uncle Franz Augustin. K√§stner's father, Emil Richard K√§stner, was a master saddlemaker. His mother, Ida Amalia (n√©e Augustin), had been a maidservant, but in her thirties she trained as a hairstylist in order to supplement her husband's income. K√§stner had a particularly close relationship with his mother. When he was living in Leipzig and Berlin, he wrote her fairly intimate letters and postcards almost every day, and overbearing mothers make regular appearances in his writings. It has been rumored that Erich K√§stner's natural father was the family's Jewish doctor, Emil Zimmermann (1864-1953), but these rumors have never been substantiated. K√§stner wrote about his childhood in his autobiography ' (1957, translated as When I Was a Little Boy). According to K√§stner, he did not suffer from being an only child, had many friends, and was not lonely or overindulged. In 1913, K√§stner entered a teacher training school in Dresden. However, he dropped out in 1916 shortly before completing the exams that would have qualified him to teach in state schools. He was drafted into the Royal Saxon Army in 1917 and was trained at a heavy artillery unit in Dresden. K√§stner was not sent to the front, but the brutality of the military training he underwent and the death of contemporaries he experienced strongly influenced his later antimilitarism. The merciless drilling he was subjected to by his drill sergeant also caused a lifelong heart condition. K√§stner portrays this in his poem Sergeant Waurich. After the end of the war, K√§stner went back to school and passed the Abitur exam with distinction, earning a scholarship from the city of Dresden. =Leipzig 1919-1927= In the autumn of 1919, K√§stner enrolled at the University of Leipzig to study history, philosophy, German studies, and theater. His studies took him to Rostock and Berlin, and in 1925 he received a doctorate for a thesis on Frederick the Great and German literature. He paid for his studies by working as a journalist and critic for a newspaper, the Neue Leipziger Zeitung. However, his increasingly critical reviews, and the \\"frivolous\\" publication of his erotic poem \\"Abendlied des Kammervirtuosen\\" (Evening Song of the Chamber Virtuoso) with illustrations by Erich Ohser, led to his dismissal in 1927. That same year, he moved to Berlin, although he continued to write for the Neue Leipziger Zeitung under the pseudonym \\"Berthold B√ºrger\\" (\\"Bert Citizen\\") as a freelance correspondent. K√§stner later used several other pseudonyms, including \\"Melchior Kurtz\\", \\"Peter Flint\\", and \\"Robert Neuner\\". =Berlin 1927-1933= K√§stner's years in Berlin, from 1927 until the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, were his most productive. He published poems, newspaper columns, articles, and reviews in many of Berlin's important periodicals. He was a regular contributor to dailies such as the Berliner Tageblatt and the Vossische Zeitung, as well as to Die Weltb√ºhne. Hans Sarkowicz and Franz Josef G√∂rtz, the editors of his complete works (1998), list over 350 articles written between 1923 and 1933, but he must have written even more, since many texts are known to have been lost when K√§stner's flat burned down during a bombing raid in February 1944. K√§stner published his first book of poems, Herz auf Taille, in 1928, and by 1933 he had published three more collections. His Gebrauchslyrik (Lyrics for Everyday Use) made him one of the leading figure of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which focused on using a sobering, distant and objective style to satirise contemporary society. In the autumn of 1928, he published his best-known children's book, Emil und die Detektive, illustrated by Walter Trier. The owner of the Weltb√ºhne publishing house, Edith Jacobsen, had suggested the idea of writing a detective story to K√§stner. The book sold two million copies in Germany alone and has since been translated into 59 languages. The novel was unusual in that, in contrast to most children's literature of the period, it is set in contemporary Berlin and not in a fairy- tale world. K√§stner also refrained from overt moralising, letting the characters' actions speak for themselves. Its sequel, Emil und die Drei Zwillinge (1933; Emil and the Three Twins) takes place on the shores of the Baltic. The Emil books may have influenced the creation of other books in the subgenre of literature about child detectives. Emil und die Detektive has been adapted for the cinema five times, three of them in Germany: in 1931, 1935 (UK), 1954, 1964 (USA) and 2001. K√§stner followed this success with P√ºnktchen und Anton (1931) and Das fliegende Klassenzimmer (1933). Walter Trier's illustration significantly contributed to the books' overwhelming popularity. Das fliegende Klassenzimmer has been adapted for the cinema several times: in 1954 by Kurt Hoffmann, in 1973 by Werner Jacobs and in by . In 1932 K√§stner wrote Der 35. Mai (The 35th of May), which is set in a fantasy land entered via a wardrobe and includes futuristic features such as mobile phones. Gerhard Lamprecht's film version of Emil und die Detektive (1931) was a great success. K√§stner, however, was dissatisfied with the screenplay, and that led him to become a screenwriter for the Babelsberg film studios. K√§stner's only major adult novel, ', was published in 1931. K√§stner included rapid cuts and montages in it, in an attempt to mimic cinematic style. Fabian, an unemployed literary expert, experiences the uproariously fast pace of the times as well as the downfall of the Weimar Republic. From 1927 until 1931, K√§stner lived at Prager Stra√üe 17 (today near no. 12) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf and after that, until February 1945, at Roscherstra√üe 16 in Berlin-Charlottenburg. =Berlin 1933-1945= K√§stner was a pacifist and wrote for children because of his belief in the regenerative powers of youth. He was opposed to the Nazi regime and was one of the signatories to the Urgent Call for Unity. However, unlike many other authors critical of the dictatorship, K√§stner did not go into exile. After the Nazis' rise to power, he visited Meran and Switzerland and met with exiled writers, yet he returned to Berlin, arguing that there he would be better able to chronicle events. It is probable that he also wanted to avoid abandoning his mother. His Necessary Answer to Superfluous Questions (Notwendige Antwort auf √ºberfl√ºssige Fragen) in Kurz und B√ºndig explains K√§stner's position: I'm a German from Dresden in Saxony My homeland won't let me go I'm like a tree that, grown in Germany, Will likely wither there also. The Gestapo interrogated K√§stner several times, the national writers' guild expelled him, and the Nazis burned his books as \\"contrary to the German spirit\\" during the book burnings of 10 May 1933, instigated by Joseph Goebbels. K√§stner witnessed the event in person and later wrote about it. He was denied membership of the new Nazi-controlled national writers' guild, Reichsverband deutscher Schriftsteller (RDS), because of what its officials called the \\"culturally Bolshevist attitude in his writings prior to 1933.\\" During the Third Reich, K√§stner published apolitical novels such as Drei M√§nner im Schnee (Three Men in the Snow) (1934) in Switzerland. In 1942, he received a special exemption to write the screenplay for M√ºnchhausen, using the pseudonym Berthold B√ºrger. The film was a prestige project by Ufa Studios to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its establishment, an enterprise backed by Goebbels. In 1944, K√§stner's home in Berlin was destroyed during a bombing raid. In early 1945, he and others pretended that they had to travel to the rural community of Mayrhofen in Tyrol for location shooting for a (non- existent) film, Das falsche Gesicht (The Wrong Face). The actual purpose of the journey was to avoid the final Soviet assault on Berlin. K√§stner had also received a warning that the SS planned to kill him and other Nazi opponents before arrival of the Soviets.\\"L√ºgen als √úberlebensstrategie\\" by Michael Watzke and Claus-Stephan Rehfeld, Deutschlandfunk Kultur, 26 June 2015 (in German) He was in Mayrhofen when the war ended. He wrote about this period in a diary published in 1961 under the title Notabene 45. Another edition, closer to K√§stner's original notes, was published in 2006 under the title Das Blaue Buch (The Blue Book). =K√§stner and the bombing of Dresden= In his diary for 1945, published many years later, K√§stner describes his shock at arriving in Dresden shortly after the bombing of Dresden in World War II in February 1945 and finding the city as a pile of ruins in which he could recognise none of the streets or landmarks among which he had spent his childhood and youth. His autobiography Als ich ein kleiner Junge war begins with a lament for Dresden (quoted from the English translation, When I Was a Little Boy): \\"I was born in the most beautiful city in the world. Even if your father, child, was the richest man in the world, he could not take you to see it, because it does not exist any more. ... In a thousand years was her beauty built, in one night was it utterly destroyed.\\" =Munich 1945-1974= After the end of the war K√§stner moved to Munich, where he became culture editor for the Neue Zeitung and publisher of ', a magazine for children and young people. He was also active in literary cabaret, in productions at the Schaubude (1945‚Äì1948) and Die kleine Freiheit (after 1951), and in radio. During this time, he wrote a number of skits, songs, audio plays, speeches, and essays about National Socialism, the war years, and the stark realities of life in post-war Germany. Most notable among these works are Marschlied 1945 and Deutsches Ringelspiel. He also continued to write children's books, including ' (The Animals' Conference), a pacifist satire in which the world's animals unite to successfully force humans to disarm and make peace. This picture book was made into by Curt Linda. K√§stner also renewed his collaboration with Edmund Nick, whom he had met in Leipzig in 1929, when Nick, then Head of the Music Department at Radio Silesia, wrote the music for K√§stner's radio play Leben in dieser Zeit. Nick, now the Musical Director at the Schaubude, set more than 60 of K√§stner's songs to music. K√§stner's optimism in the immediate post-war era gave way to resignation as Germans in the West attempted to normalize their lives following the economic reforms of the early 1950s and the ensuing \\"economic miracle\\" (\\"Wirtschaftswunder\\"). He became further disillusioned as Chancellor Konrad Adenauer remilitarized West Germany, made it a member of NATO, and rearmed it for possible military conflict with the Warsaw Pact. K√§stner remained a pacifist and spoke out at anti-militarist demonstrations against the stationing of nuclear weapons in West Germany. Later, he also took a stand against the Vietnam War. K√§stner began to publish less and less, partly because of his increasing alcoholism. He did not join any of the post- war literary movements in West Germany, and in the 1950s and 1960s he came to be perceived mainly as an author of children's books. His novel Fabian was made into a movie in 1980, as were several of his children's books. The most popular of these adaptations were the two U.S. versions of The Parent Trap, made in 1961 and 1998, and based on his novel Das doppelte Lottchen (Lottie and Lisa). In 1960 K√§stner received the Hans Christian Andersen Award for Als ich ein kleiner Junge war, his autobiography. The English translation by Florence and Isabel McHugh, published as When I Was a Little Boy in 1959, won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1961. Erich K√§stner (left) in the Englischer Garten, Munich, 1968 K√§stner received several other awards, including the Filmband in Gold for best screenplay for the German film version of Das doppelte Lottchen (1951), the literary prize of the city of Munich in 1956, and the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1957. The government of West Germany honored K√§stner with its order of merit, the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit), in 1959. In 1968 he received the together with the literary prize of the German Masonic Order. In 1951, K√§stner was elected President of the PEN Center of West Germany, and he remained in office until 1961. In 1965 he became President Emeritus. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Internationale Jugendbibliothek, a library of children's books, in Munich. In 1953 he was founding member of IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People). K√§stner never married. He wrote his last two children's books, Der kleine Mann and Der kleine Mann und die kleine Miss, for his son Thomas K√§stner, who was born in 1957. K√§stner frequently read from his works. In the 1920s, he recorded some of his poems of social criticism and in some of the films based on his books he performed as the narrator, as he did for the first audio production of P√ºnktchen und Anton. Other recordings for Deutsche Grammophon include poems, epigrams, and his version of the folk tale Till Eulenspiegel. He also read in theaters, such as the Cuvilli√©s Theatre in Munich, and for the radio, for which he read Als ich ein kleiner Junge war and other works. K√§stner died of esophageal cancer on 29 July 1974 in the Neuperlach Hospital in Munich. He was buried in the St. George cemetery in the Bogenhausen district of Munich. Shortly after his death, the Bavarian Academy of Arts established a literary prize in his name. The asteroid 12318 K√§stner is named after him.\\"(12318) K√§stner = 1992 HD7\\", Minor Planet Center Works A list of his works under their German titles, arranged by their German publication dates: * Herz auf Taille, 1928 * Emil und die Detektive, 1929 (Emil and the Detectives) * L√§rm im Spiegel, 1929 * Ein Mann gibt Auskunft, 1930 * ', 1931 (Anna Louise and Anton) * Der 35.

During the Industrial Revolution, it became one of the most industrialised parts of the UK with coal mines, coking, iron foundries, glass factories, brickworks and steel mills producing a high level of air pollution. The first trace of the phrase \\"The Black Country\\" as an expression dates from the 1840s. The name is believed to come from the soot from the heavy industries that covered the area, although the 30-foot-thick (10-metre) coal seam close to the surface is another possible origin. The road between Wolverhampton and Birmingham was described as \\"one continuous town\\" in 1785. Although the heavy polluting industry that gave the region its name has long since disappeared, a sense of shared history and tradition in the area has kept the term in use. In addition, the regeneration of the area by local and national government has brought official recognition to the region and to some extent defined its boundary.  Extent  South Staffordshire in 1911. The Black Country lies to the west and north-west of the city of Birmingham. The Black Country has no single set of defined boundaries. Some traditionalists define it as \\"the area where the coal seam comes to the surface ‚Äì so West Bromwich, Coseley, Oldbury, Blackheath, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Bilston, Dudley, Tipton, Wednesfield and parts of Halesowen, Wednesbury and Walsall but not Wolverhampton, Stourbridge and Smethwick or what used to be known as Warley\\". There are records from the 18th century of shallow coal mines in Wolverhampton, however.\\"RR Angerstein's Illustrated Travel Diary 1753‚Äì55\\" Others have included areas slightly outside the coal field which were associated with heavy industry. Bilston-born Samuel Griffiths, in his 1876 Griffiths Guide to the Iron Trade of Great Britain, stated \\"The Black Country commences at Wolverhampton, extends a distance of sixteen miles to Stourbridge, eight miles to West Bromwich, penetrating the northern districts through Willenhall to Bentley, The Birchills, Walsall and Darlaston, Wednesbury, Smethwick and Dudley Port, West Bromwich and Hill Top, Brockmoor, Wordsley and Stourbridge. As the atmosphere becomes purer, we get to the higher ground of Brierley Hill, nevertheless here also, as far as the eye can reach, on all sides, tall chimneys vomit forth great clouds of smoke\\". He also stated that \\"Wolverhampton is considered to be The Capital of the Black Country\\", as well as \\"The Capital of the Iron Trade in the Black Country\\". Today the term commonly refers to the majority or all of the four metropolitan boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton although it is said that \\"no two Black Country men or women will agree on where it starts or ends\\".\\"Birmingham and the Black Country are neighbouring areas located in the English West Midlands. ... The Black Country has no agreed physical or political boundaries being defined instead of what is it is not, and primarily, by its residents, in opposition to the neighbouring large city of Birmingham\\" . = Local government = The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire ‚Äì Prior to the West Midlands Order 1965 reorganisation Official use of the name came in 1987 with the Black Country Development Corporation, an urban development corporation covering the metropolitan boroughs of Sandwell and Walsall, which was disbanded in 1998. The Black Country Consortium (founded in 1999) and the Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership (founded in 2011) both define the Black Country as the four metropolitan boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton, an approximate area of . =Cultural and industrial definition= The borders of the Black Country can be defined by using the special cultural and industrial characteristics of the area. Areas around the canals (the cut) which had mines extracting mineral resources and heavy industry refining these are included in this definition. Cultural parameters include unique or characteristic foods such as Groaty pudding, Grey Peas and Bacon, faggots, gammon or pork hocks and pork scratchings; Black Country Humour; and the Black Country dialect. =Geological definitions= Mining the thick coal seam at one of the Earl of Dudley's pits in the 1870s The Black Country Society defines the Black Country's borders as the area on the thirty foot coal seam, regardless the depth of the seam. This definition includes West Bromwich and Oldbury, which had many deep pits, and Smethwick. The thick coal that underlies Smethwick was not mined until the 1870s and Smethwick has retained more Victorian character than most West Midland areas. Sandwell Park Colliery's pit was located in Smethwick and had 'thick coal' as shown in written accounts from 1878 and coal was also heavily mined in Hamstead, further east,http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/robertburden/Sandwell.htm whose workings extended well under what is now north Birmingham. Smethwick and Dudley Port were described as \\"a thousand swarming hives of metallurgical industries\\" by Samuel Griffiths in 1872.http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/BlackCountry2.htm Another geological definition, the seam outcrop definition, only includes areas where the coal seam is shallow making the soil black at the surface. Some coal mining areas to the east and west of the geologically defined Black Country are therefore excluded by this definition because the coal here is too deep down and does not outcrop. The seam outcrop definition excludes areas in North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire. Toponymy The first recorded use of the term \\"the Black Country\\" may be from a toast given by a Mr Simpson, town clerk to Lichfield, addressing a Reformer's meeting on 24 November 1841, published in the Staffordshire Advertiser. He describes going into the \\"black country\\" of Staffordshire ‚Äì Wolverhampton, Bilston and Tipton. In published literature, the first reference dates from 1846 and occurs in the novel Colton Green: A Tale of the Black Country by the Reverend William Gresley, who was then a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral. Gresley's opening paragraph starts \\"On the border of the agricultural part of Staffordshire, just before you enter the dismal region of mines and forges, commonly called the 'Black Country', stands the pretty village of Oakthorpe\\", \\"commonly\\" implying that the term was already in use. He also writes that \\"the whole country is blackened with smoke by day, and glowing with fires by night\\", and that \\"the 'Black Country' ... is about twenty miles in length and five in bredth reaching from north to south\\". The phrase was used again, though as a description rather than a proper noun, by the Illustrated London News in an 1849 article on the opening of the South Staffordshire Railway. An 1851 guidebook to the London and North Western Railway included an entire chapter entitled \\"The Black Country\\", including an early description: This work was also the first to explicitly distinguish the area from nearby Birmingham, noting that \\"On certain rare holidays these people wash their faces, clothe themselves in decent garments, and, since the opening of the South Staffordshire Railway, take advantage of cheap excursion trains, go down to Birmingham to amuse themselves and make purchases\\". The geologist Joseph Jukes made it clear in 1858 that he felt the meaning of the term was self- explanatory to contemporary visitors, remarking that \\"It is commonly known in the neighbourhood as the 'Black Country', an epithet the appropriateness of which must be acknowledged by anyone who even passes through it on a railway\\". Jukes based his Black Country on the seat of the great iron manufacture, which for him was geographically determined by the ironstone tract of the coalfield rather than the thick seam, running from Wolverhampton to Bloxwich, to West Bromwich, to Stourbridge and back to Wolverhampton again. A travelogue published in 1860 made the connection more explicit, calling the name \\"eminently descriptive, for blackness everywhere prevails; the ground is black, the atmosphere is black, and the underground is honeycombed by mining galleries stretching in utter blackness for many a league\\". An alternative theory for the meaning of the name is proposed as having been caused by the darkening of the local soil due to the outcropping coal and the seam near the surface. It was however the American diplomat and travel writer Elihu Burritt who brought the term \\"the Black Country\\" into widespread common usage with the third, longest and most important of the travel books he wrote about Britain for American readers, his 1868 work Walks in The Black Country and its Green Borderland. Burritt had been appointed United States consul in Birmingham by Abraham Lincoln in 1864, a role that required him to report regularly on \\"facts bearing upon the productive capacities, industrial character and natural resources of communities embraced in their Consulate Districts\\" and as a result travelled widely from his home in Harborne, largely on foot, to explore the local area. Burritt's association with Birmingham dated back 20 years and he was highly sympathetic to the industrial and political culture of the town as well as being a friend many of its leading citizens, so his portrait of the surrounding area was largely positive. He was the author of the famous early description of the Black Country as \\"black by day and red by night\\", adding appreciatively that it \\"cannot be matched, for vast and varied production, by any other space of equal radius on the surface of the globe\\". Burritt used the term to refer to a wider area than its common modern usage, however, devoting the first third of the book to Birmingham, which he described as \\"the capital, manufacturing centre, and growth of the Black Country\\", and writing \\"plant, in imagination, one foot of your compass at the Town Hall in Birmingham, and with the other sweep a circle of twenty miles [30 km] radius, and you will have, 'the Black Country\\" (this area includes Coventry, Kidderminster and Lichfield). History The Oak House, West Bromwich. A Yeoman Farmer's house dating from the late 16th or early 17th century, it represents a rare surviving building from the pre-industrial Black Country. A few Black Country places such as Wolverhampton, Bilston and Wednesfield are mentioned in Anglo-Saxon charters and chronicles and the forerunners of a number of Black Country towns and villages such as Cradley, Dudley, Smethwick, and Halesowen are included in the Domesday Book of 1086. At this early date, the area was mostly rural. A monastery was founded in Wolverhampton in the Anglo-Saxon period and a castle and priory was built at Dudley during the period of Norman rule. Another religious house, Premonstratensian Abbey of Halesowen, was founded in the early 13th century. A number of Black Country villages developed into market towns and boroughs in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, notably Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Coal mining was carried out for several centuries in the Black Country, starting from medieval times, and metalworking was important in the Black Country area as early as the 16th century spurred on by the presence of iron ore and coal in a seam thick, the thickest seam in Great Britain, which outcropped in various places. The first blast furnace recorded in the Black Country was built at West Bromwich in the early 1560s. Many people had an agricultural smallholding and supplemented their income by working as nailers or smiths, an example of a phenomenon known to economic historians as proto- industrialisation. In 1583, the accounts of the building of Henry VIII's Nonsuch Palace record that nails were supplied by Reynolde Warde of Dudley at a cost of 11s 4d per thousand. By the 1620s \\"Within ten miles [16 km] of Dudley Castle there were 20,000 smiths of all sorts\\". In the early 17th century, Dud Dudley, a natural son of the Baron of Dudley, experimented with making iron using coal rather than charcoal. Two patents were granted for the process: one in 1621 to Lord Dudley and one in 1638 to Dud Dudley and three others. In his work Metallum Martis, published in 1665, he claimed to have \\"made Iron to profit with Pit-cole\\". However, considerable doubt has been cast on this claim by later writers. An important development in the early 17th century was the introduction of the slitting mill to the Midlands area. In the Black Country, the establishment of this device was associated with Richard Foley, son of a Dudley nailer, who built a slitting mill near Kinver in 1628. The slitting mill made it much simpler to produce nail rods from iron bar. Another development of the early 17th century was the introduction of glass making to the Stourbridge area. One attraction of the region for glass makers was the local deposits of fireclay, a material suitable for making the pots in which glass was melted. In 1642 at the start of the Civil War, Charles I failed to capture the two arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, which although in cities loyal to Parliament were located in counties loyal to him. As he had failed to capture the arsenals, Charles did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, or shot; all these the Black Country could and did provide. From Stourbridge came shot, from Dudley cannon. Numerous small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of Worcestershire turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It was said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, Robert Porter, who manufactured swords in Digbeth, Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for \\"that man of blood\\" (A Puritan nickname for King Charles), or any of his adherents. As an offset to this sword-cutler and men like him in Birmingham, the Royalists had among their adherents Dud Dudley, now a Colonel in the Royalist army, who had experience in iron making, and who claimed he could turn out \\"all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts\\", both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way.John William Willis-Bund. The Civil War in Worcestershire, 1642‚Äì1646: And the Scotch Invasion of 1615, Birmingham: The Midland Educational Company, ltd., 1905, pp. 4,5,88Joan Zuckerman, Geoffrey Eley. The Birmingham Heritage, Taylor & Francis, 1979. , . p. 34 In 1712, a Newcomen Engine was constructed near Dudley and used to pump water from coal mines belonging to Lord Dudley. This is the earliest documented working steam engine. A Black Country scene from the 1870s including coal mines, mineral railways, furnaces and factories. An important milestone in the establishment of Black Country industry came when John Wilkinson set up an iron works at Bradley near Bilston. In 1757 he started making iron there by coke-smelting rather than using charcoal. His example was followed by others and iron making spread rapidly across the Black Country. Another important development of the 18th century was the construction of canals to link the Black Country mines industries to the rest of the country. Between 1768 and 1772 a canal was constructed by James Brindley starting in Birmingham through the heart of the Black Country and eventually leading to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. An 18th century enamelled snuff box made in Bilston, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York In the middle of the 18th century, Bilston became well known for the craft of enamelling. Items produced included decorative containers such as patch-boxes, snuff boxes and bonbonnieres. The iron industry grew during the 19th century, peaking around 1850‚Äì1860. In 1863, there were 200 blast furnaces in the Black Country, of which 110 were in blast. Two years later it was recorded that there were 2,116 puddling furnaces, which converted pig-iron into wrought iron, in the Black Country. In 1864 the first Black Country plant capable of producing mild steel by the Bessemer process was constructed at the Old Park Works in Wednesbury. In 1882, another Bessemer-style steel works was constructed at Spring Vale in Bilston by the Staffordshire Steel and Ingot Iron Company, a development followed by the construction of an open-hearth steelworks at the Round Oak works of the Earl of Dudley in Brierley Hill, which produced its first steel in 1894. By the 19th century or early 20th century, many villages had their characteristic manufacture, but earlier occupations were less concentrated. Some of these concentrations are less ancient than sometimes supposed. For example, chain making in Cradley Heath seems only to have begun in about the 1820s, and the Lye holloware industry is even more recent. The ironworks of W. Barrows and Sons, Tipton. Canals were of crucial importance in the development of Black Country industry. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, coal and limestone were worked only on a modest scale for local consumption, but during the Industrial Revolution by the opening of canals, such as the Birmingham Canal Navigations, Stourbridge Canal and the Dudley Canal (the Dudley Canal Line No 1 and the Dudley Tunnel) opened up the mineral wealth of the area to exploitation. Advances in the use of coke for the production of iron enabled iron production (hitherto limited by the supply of charcoal) to expand rapidly. By Victorian times, the Black Country was one of the most heavily industrialised areas in Britain, and it became known for its pollution, particularly from iron and coal industries and their many associated smaller businesses. This led to the expansion of local railways and coal mine lines. The line running from Stourbridge to Walsall via Dudley Port and Wednesbury closed in the 1960s, but the Birmingham to Wolverhampton line via Tipton is still a major transport route. The anchors and chains for the ill-fated liner RMS Titanic were manufactured in the Black Country in the area of Netherton. Three anchors and accompanying chains were manufactured; and the set weighed in at 100 tons. The centre anchor alone weighed 12 tons and was pulled through Netherton on its journey to the ship by 20 Shire horses. Glass cones where glass was made and worked were once a common sight in Dudley and Stourbridge. This example, now a museum, is situated near Stourbridge In 1913, the Black Country was the location of arguably one of the most important strikes in British trade union history when the workers employed in the area's steel tube trade came out for two months in a successful demand for a 23 shilling minimum weekly wage for unskilled workers, giving them pay parity with their counterparts in nearby Birmingham. This action commenced on 9 May in Wednesbury, at the Old Patent tube works of John Russell & Co. Ltd., and within weeks upwards of 40,000 workers across the Black Country had joined the dispute. Notable figures in the labour movement, including a key proponent of Syndicalism, Tom Mann, visited the area to support the workers and Jack Beard and Julia Varley of the Workers' Union were active in organising the strike. During this confrontation with employers represented by the Midlands Employers' Federation, a body founded by Dudley Docker, the Asquith Government's armaments programme was jeopardised, especially its procurement of naval equipment and other industrial essentials such as steel tubing, nuts and bolts, destroyer parts, etc. This was of national significance at a time when Britain and Germany were engaged in the Anglo-German naval arms race that preceded the outbreak of the First World War. Following a ballot of the union membership, a settlement of the dispute was reached on 11 July after arbitration by government officials from the Board of Trade led by the Chief Industrial Commissioner Sir George Askwith, 1st Baron Askwith.G. Askwith, Industrial Problems and Disputes (New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1920) One of the important consequences of the strike was the growth of organised labour across the Black Country, which was notable because until this point the area's workforce had effectively eschewed trade unionism. Chain making, once a major Black Country industry, as demonstrated at the Black Country Living Museum. The 20th century saw a decline in coal mining in the Black Country, with the last colliery in the region ‚Äì Baggeridge Colliery near Sedgley ‚Äì closing on 2 March 1968, marking the end of an era after some 300 years of mass coal mining in the region, though a small number of open cast mines remained in use for a few years afterwards. As the heavy industry that had named the region faded away, in the 1970s a museum, called the Black Country Living Museum started to take shape on derelict land near to Dudley. Today this museum demonstrates Black Country crafts and industry from days gone by and includes many original buildings which have been transported and reconstructed at the site. Geology and landscape A dark seam of coal is clearly visible on the sides of Doultons Clay Pit, in Saltwells Wood to the south of Netherton The history of industry in the Black Country is connected directly to its underlying geology. Much of the region lies upon an exposed coalfield forming the southern part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield where mining has taken place since the Middle Ages. There are, in fact several coal seams, some of which were given names by the miners. The top, thin coal seam is known as Broach Coal. Beneath this lies successively the Thick Coal, Heathen Coal, Stinking Coal, Bottom Coal and Singing Coal seams. Other seams also exist. The Thick Coal seam was also known as the \\"Thirty Foot\\" or \\"Ten Yard\\" seam and is made up of a number of beds that have come together to form one thick seam. Interspersed with the coal seams are deposits of iron ore and fireclay. The Black Country coal field is bounded on the north by the Bentley Fault, to the north of which lies the Cannock Chase Coalfield. Around the exposed coalfield, separated by geological faults, lies a concealed coalfield where the coal lies at much greater depth. A mine was sunk between 1870 and 1874 over the eastern boundary of the then known coal field in Smethwick and coal was discovered at a depth of over 400 yards. In the last decade of the 19th century, coal was discovered beyond the western boundary fault at Baggeridge at a depth of around 600 yards. A broken ridge runs across the Black Country in a north-westerly direction through Dudley, Wrens Nest and Sedgley, separating the Black Country into two regions. This ridge forms part of a major watershed of England with streams to the north taking water to the Tame and then via the Trent into the North Sea whilst to the south of the ridge, water flows into the Stour and thence to the Severn and the Bristol Channel. At Dudley and Wrens Nest, limestone was mined. This rock formation was formed in the Silurian period and contain many fossils. One particular fossilized creature, the trilobite Calymene blumenbachii, was so common that it became known as the \\"Dudley Bug\\" or \\"Dudley Locust\\" and was incorporated into the coat-of-arms of the County Borough of Dudley. At a number of places, notably the Rowley Hills and at Barrow Hill, a hard igneous rock is found. The rock, known as dolerite, used to be quarried and used for road construction. Symbols Black Country Tartan designed in 2008 by Philip Tibbetts from Halesowen The Flag of the Black Country, with colours representing Elihu Burritt's description of the region as \\"black by day and red by night\\", adopted July 2012 In recent years the Black Country has seen the adoption of symbols and emblems with which to represent itself. The first of these to be registered was the Black Country tartan in 2009, designed by Philip Tibbetts from Halesowen.Black Country gets its own tartan BBC NEWS, 12 January 2009Reference: WR3278 Scottish Tartan World Register Scottish Register of Tartans In 2008 the idea of a flag for the region was first raised. After four years of campaigning a competition was successfully organised with the Black Country Living Museum. This resulted in the adoption of the Flag of the Black Country as designed by Gracie Sheppard of Redhill School in Stourbridge and was registered with the Flag Institute in July 2012. The flag was unveiled at the museum on 14 July 2012 as part of celebration in honour of the 300th anniversary of the erection of the first Newcomen atmospheric engine. Following this it was agreed by the museum and Black Country society for 14 July to be recognised as Black Country Day to celebrate the area's role in the Industrial Revolution. The day was marked by Department for Communities and Local Government in 2013 and following calls to do more in 2014 more events were planned around the region. Black Country Day takes place on 14 July each year. Originally in March, the day was later moved to 14 July ‚Äì the anniversary of the invention of the Newcomen steam engine& now coincides with a wider series of events throughout the month aimed at promoting Black Country Culture called the Black Country Festival. The Black Country Anthem was written by James Stevens and is performed by Black Country band The Empty Can. The idea for the anthem was raised in 2013 by James Stevens and Steven Edwards who wanted the region to have an official anthem to accompany the Black Country flag & Black Country Day. Economy The heavy industry which once dominated the Black Country has now largely gone. The 20th century saw a decline in coal mining and the industry finally came to an end in 1968 with the closure of Baggeridge Colliery near Sedgley. Clean air legislation has meant that the Black Country is no longer black. The area still maintains some manufacturing, but on a much smaller scale than historically. Chainmaking is still a viable industry in the Cradley Heath area where the majority of the chain for the Ministry of Defence and the Admiralty fleet is made in modern factories. Much but not all of the area now suffers from high unemployment and parts of it are amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK. This is particularly true in parts of the metropolitan boroughs of Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. According to the Government's 2007 Index of Deprivation (ID 2007), Sandwell is the third most deprived authority in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham and Stoke-on- Trent, and the 14th most deprived of the UK's 354 districts. Wolverhampton is the fourth most deprived district in the West Midlands, and the 28th most deprived nationally. Walsall is the fifth most deprived district in the West Midlands region, and the 45th most deprived in the country. Dudley fares better, but still has pockets of deprivation. Overall Dudley is the 100th most deprived district of the UK, but the second most affluent of the seven metropolitan districts of the West Midlands, with Solihull coming top. It also benefits from tourism due to the popularity of the Black Country Living Museum, Dudley Zoo and Dudley Castle. As with many urban areas in the UK, there is also a significant ethnic minority population in parts: in Sandwell, 22.6 per cent of the population are from ethnic minorities, and in Wolverhampton the figure is 23.5 per cent. However, in Walsall 84.6 per cent of the population is described as white, while in Dudley 92 per cent of the population is white. Resistance to mass immigration in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s led to the slogan \\"Keep the Black Country white!\\". The Black Country suffered its biggest economic blows in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when unemployment soared largely because of the closure of historic large factories including the Round Oak Steel Works at Brierley Hill and the Patent Shaft steel plant at Wednesbury. Unemployment rose drastically across the country during this period as a result of Conservative Prime Minister Thatcher's economic policies; later, in an implicit acknowledgement of the social problems this had caused, these areas were designated as Enterprise Zones, and some redevelopment occurred. Round Oak and the surrounding farmland was developed as the Merry Hill Shopping Centre and Waterfront commercial and leisure complex, while the Patent Shaft site was developed as an industrial estate. Unemployment in Brierley Hill peaked at more than 25% ‚Äì around double the national average at the time ‚Äì during the first half of the 1980s following the closure of Round Oak Steel Works, giving it one of the worst unemployment rates of any town in Britain. The Merry Hill development between 1985 and 1990 managed to reduce the local area's unemployment dramatically, however.http://brierleyhillnesstoolkit.wordpress.com/my-brierley-hill-street- interviews/facts-and-stats/ The Black Country Living Museum in Dudley recreates life in the Black Country in the early 20th century, and is a popular tourist attraction. On 17 February 2012 the museum's collection in its entirety was awarded Designation by Arts Council England (ACE). Designation is a mark of distinction that celebrates unique collections of national and international importance. The four metropolitan boroughs of the Black Country form part of the Birmingham metropolitan economy, the second largest in the UK. In 2011, the government announced the creation of the Black Country Enterprise Zone. The zone includes 5 sites in Wolverhampton and 14 in Darlaston. The i54 business park in Wolverhampton is the largest of the 19 sites; its tenants include Jaguar Land Rover. The largest site in Darlaston is that of the former IMI James Bridge Copper Works. The four boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton and Walsall submitted a joint bid in late 2015 to become a UNESCO Global Geopark. The Geopark would increase the area's prospects as a tourism destination thereby supporting the local economy. To this end numerous 'geosites' were subsequently identified, leaflets published and public events organised.https://www.dudley.gov.uk/residents/environment/countryside-in- dudley/nature-reserves/wrens-nest-national-nature-reserve/black-country- geopark/ As of 2017, UNESCO had given the aspirant geopark its initial backing pending further assessment.http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/article/10898/UNESCO- recommendations-strengthen-geopark-bid Confirmation of the Black Country as a UNESCO Global Geopark was announced on 10 July 2020. Dialect and accent The traditional Black Country dialect, known as \\"Black Country Spake\\" (as in \\"Where's our Spake Gone\\", a 2014‚Äì2016 lottery-funded project to preserve and document the dialect) preserves many archaic traits of Early Modern English and even Middle EnglishStaff and Agencies Wolverhampton researches Black Country dialect Guardian Unlimited, 27 January 2003 and can be very confusing for outsiders. Thee, thy and thou are still in use, as is the case in parts of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Black Country dialect is well known by many as the oldest form of the English language despite being disputed unsuccessfully on a number of occasions. \\"'Ow B'ist,\\" or \\"Ow b'ist gooin\\" (How are you/ how are you going), to which typical responses would be \\"Bostin', ah kid\\" (Bostin' means \\"Busting\\", as in breaking, and is similar in usage to \\"smashing\\"; and \\"Ah Kid\\" (our kid) is a term of endearment ‚Äì relatively recently imported from Liverpool-centric T.V. shows in the 1900s) or \\"'Bay too bad,\\" or even \\"bay three bad\\" (\\"I be not too bad\\"/ I'm not too bad). Ain't is in common use as when \\"I haven't seen her\\" becomes \\"I ay sid 'er.\\" Black Country dialect often uses \\"ar\\" where other parts of England use \\"yes\\" (this is common as far away as Yorkshire). Similarly, the local version of \\"you\\" is pronounced , rhyming with \\"now.\\" The local pronunciation includes \\"goo\\" (elsewhere \\"go\\") or \\"gewin'\\" is similar to that elsewhere in the Midlands. It is quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say \\"'agooin'\\" where others say \\"going.\\" A woman is a \\"wench\\", a man is a \\"mon\\", a nurse is a \\"nuss\\" and home is \\"wom\\". An apple is an \\"opple\\". Other examples are \\"code\\" for the word cold, and \\"goost\\" for the word Ghost. A Sofa becomes a \\"sofie\\", and a Fag (cigarette), a \\"fake\\". Seen becomes \\"Sid\\". Put together, \\"Ah just sid a Goost, so Ah'm a gooin to sit on mah sofie and 'ave a fake\\" (I have just seen a ghost, so I am going to sit upon my sofa and have a cigarette) Food may be called \\"fittle\\" (after victuals or \\"vittles\\"), so \\"Bostin fittle\\" is \\"good food\\". One participant in the \\"Where's our Spake Gone\\" project related the following: \\"Day say yom call oos rabbits up ere. I say We day, dey say yow say \\"Tah rah rabbits\\". We'm say Tah-Ra a bit, 'n to dem, it sound like we'm calling dem rabbits.\\" (\\"They say you call us rabbits there, I said we don't, (but) they say you say \\"Tah Rah Rabbits\\". We say \\"Tah Rah A bit\\" (Tah Rah for a little while) and to them, it sounds like we are calling them rabbits.\\") The dialect has local differences, and sounds and phrases differ across the towns; often people can mishear a word or phrase and write it down wrong as in \\"shut charow up,\\" which actually is \\"shut ya row up,\\" so one has to be careful when hearing words and phrases. Depiction in art or literature From the 19th century onwards, the area gained widespread notoriety for its hellish appearance, a depiction that made its way into the published works of the time. Charles Dickens's novel The Old Curiosity Shop, written in 1841, described how the area's local factory chimneys \\"Poured out their plague of smoke, obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air\\". In 1862, Elihu Burritt, the American Consul in Birmingham, described the region as \\"black by day and red by night\\", because of the smoke and grime generated by the intense manufacturing activity and the glow from furnaces at night. Early 20th century representations of the region can be found in the Mercian novels of Francis Brett Young, most notably My Brother Jonathan (1928). Carol Thompson the curator \\"The Making of Mordor\\" at Wolverhampton Art Gallery in the last quarter of 2014 stated that J. R. R. Tolkien's description of the grim region of Mordor \\"resonates strongly with contemporary accounts of the Black Country\\", in his famed novel The Lord of the Rings. Indeed, in the Elvish Sindarin language, Mor-Dor means Dark (or Black) Land. It is also claimed by one Black Country scholar (Peter Higginson) that the character of Bilbo Baggins may have been based on Tolkien's observation of Mayor Ben Bilboe of Bilston in The Black Country, who was a Communist and Labour Party member from the Lunt in Bilston. But the scholarly evidence for this is still questionable. In popular culture David Bowie's 1970 album The Man Who Sold the World (UK release 1971) includes the track \\"Black Country Rock\\". The British Band Led Zeppelin's 1975 album Physical Graffiti includes the track \\"Black Country Woman\\" The British band The Mighty Lemon Drops, themselves from Wolverhampton in The Black Country, released a live album entitled Young, Gifted & Black Country in 2004. In 2009 the super group Black Country Communion formed. Their self-titled, debut album contained the track \\"Black Country\\" in direct reference to the region where drummer Jason Bonham's father was born and raised. Comedians Frank Skinner, Lenny Henry and Darren Harriott all grew up in the area and reference it in their routines. Brewing The Black Country is notable for its small breweries and brewpubs which, unlike most in Britain, continued brewing their own beer alongside larger breweries which opened in the Industrial Revolution. Small breweries and brewpubs in the Black Country include Bathams in Brierley Hill, Holdens in Woodsetton, Sarah Hughes in Sedgley Black Country Ales in Lower Gornaland the Old Swan Inn (Ma Pardoe's) in Netherton. They produce light and dark mild ales, as well as malt-accented bitters and seasonal strong ales. Media The Black Country is home to one television station, Made in Birmingham, and three region wide radio stations ‚Äì BBC WM, Free Radio and Free Radio 80s.http://www.freeradio.co.uk/listen-free-radio-80s/ Both Free Radio (formerly BRMB (Birmingham and Beacon Radio Wolverhampton) and Free Radio 80s (formerly Beacon 303, Radio WABC & Gold) have broadcast since 1976 from transmitters at Turner's Hill and Sedgley, with the studios which were previously located in Wolverhampton being moved to Oldbury and Birmingham respectively. The area also has three other radio stations which only officially cover part of the region. Black Country Radio (born from a merger of 102.5 The Bridge and BCCR) who are based in Stourbridge, Signal 107 who broadcast from Wolverhampton and Ambur Radio who broadcast from Walsall.http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/radiolicensing/mcamaps/MCAs.htm The Express and Star is one of the region's two daily newspapers, publishing eleven local editions from its Wolverhampton headquarters and its five district offices (for example the Dudley edition is considerably different in content from the Wolverhampton or Stafford editions). It is the biggest selling regional paper in the UK. Incidentally, the Express and Star, traditionally a Black Country paper, has expanded to the point where they sell copies from vendors in Birmingham city centre. The Black Country Mail ‚Äì a local edition of the Birmingham Mail ‚Äì is the region's other daily newspaper. Its regional base is in Walsall town centre. Established in 1973, from a site in High Street, Cradley Heath, the Black Country Bugle has also contributed to the region's history. It started as a fortnightly publication, but due to its widespread appeal, now appears on a weekly basis. It is now located above the Dudley Archives and Local History Centre on Tipton Road, Dudley.

Scholars believe that while they first settled in the Amazon rainforest, from about 2,900 years ago the Tupi started to migrate southward and gradually occupied the Atlantic coast of Southeast Brazil. History Tupi (violet), Tupi-Guarani (pink) languages areas and early probable areas (pink-grey). The Tupi people inhabited almost all of Brazil's coast when the Portuguese first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated at 1 million people, nearly equal to the population of Portugal at the time. They were divided into tribes, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some examples of these tribes are: Tupiniquim, Tupinamb√°, Potiguara, Tabajara, Caet√©s, Temimin√≥, Tamoios. The Tupi were adept agriculturalists; they grew cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, tobacco, squash, cotton and many others. There was not a unified Tupi identity despite the fact that they spoke a common language. =European colonization= From the 16th century onward, the Tupi, like other natives from the region, were assimilated, enslaved, or killed by diseases such as smallpox or by Portuguese settlers and Bandeirantes (colonial Brazil scouts), nearly leading to their complete annihilation, with the exception of a few isolated communities. The remnants of these tribes are today confined to indigenous territories or acculturated to some degree into the dominant society. =Cannibalism= According to primary source accounts by primarily European writers, the Tupi were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars the Tupi would normally try to capture their enemies to later kill them in cannibalistic rituals.Darcy Ribeiro ‚Äì O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101.\\" The warriors captured from other Tupi tribes were eaten as it was believed by them that this would lead to their strength being absorbed and digested; thus, in fear of absorbing weakness, they chose only to sacrifice warriors perceived to be strong and brave. For the Tupi warriors, even when prisoners, it was a great honor to die valiantly during battle or to display courage during the festivities leading to the sacrifice. The Tupi have also been documented to eat the remains of dead relatives as a form of honoring them.Agnolin, Adone. O apetite da antropologia. S√£o Paulo, Associa√ß√£o Editorial Humanitas, 2005. p. 285. The practice of cannibalism among the Tupi was made famous in Europe by Hans Staden, a German soldier, mariner, and mercenary, traveling to Brazil to steal riches, who was captured by the Tupi in 1552. In his account published in 1557, he tells that the Tupi carried him to their village where it was claimed he was to be devoured at the next festivity. There, he allegedly won the friendship of a powerful chief, whom he cured of a disease, and his life was spared. Staden, Hans. Duas viagens ao Brasil: primeiros registros sobre o Brasil. Porto Alegre: L&PM;, 2011, p. 51-52 Cannibalistic rituals among Tupi and other tribes in Brazil decreased steadily after European contact and religious intervention. When Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Santa Catarina in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalistic practices in the name of the King of Spain. Because our understanding of Tupi cannibalism relies solely on primary source accounts of primarily European writers, the very existence of cannibalism has been disputed by some in academic circles. William Arens seeks to discredit Staden's and other writers' accounts of cannibalism in his book The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology & Anthropophagy, where he claims that when concerning the Tupinamb√°, \\"rather than dealing with an instance of serial documentation of cannibalism, we are more likely confronting only one source of dubious testimony which has been incorporated almost verbatim into the written reports of others claiming to be eyewitnesses\\".(New York : Oxford University Press, 1979; ) =Race-mixing and Cunhadismo= Louis XIII in Paris in 1613, in Claude d'Abbeville, Histoire de la mission. Many indigenous peoples were important for the formation of the Brazilian people, but the main group was the Tupi. When the Portuguese explorers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, the Tupi were the first Amerindian group to have contact with them. Soon, a process of mixing between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Portuguese colonists rarely brought women, making the Indian women the \\"breeding matrix of the Brazilian people\\". When the first Europeans arrived, the phenomenon of \\"cunhadismo\\" (from Portuguese cunhado, \\"brother in law\\") began to spread by the colony. Cunhadismo was an old Indian tradition of incorporating strangers to their community. The Indians offered the Portuguese an Indian girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Indians of the tribe. Polygyny, a common practice among South American Indians, was quickly adopted by European settlers. This way, a single European man could have dozens of Indian wives (temeric√≥s). Albert Eckhout: a mixed- race (Mameluco) woman (circa 1641‚Äì1644) Cunhadismo was used as recruitment of labour. The Portuguese could have many temeric√≥s and thus a huge number of Indian relatives who were induced to work for him, especially to cut pau- brasil and take it to the ships on the coast. In the process, a large mixed- race (mameluco) population was formed, which in fact occupied Brazil. Without the practice of cunhadismo, the Portuguese colonization was impractical. The number of Portuguese men in Brazil was very small and Portuguese women were even fewer in number. The proliferation of mixed-race people in the wombs of Indian women provided for the occupation of the territory and the consolidation of the Portuguese presence in the region. =Influence in Brazil= Although the Tupi population largely disappeared because of European diseases to which they had no resistance or because of slavery, a large population of maternal Tupi ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory, taking the ancient traditions to several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that the features of the first Brazilians were much more Tupi than Portuguese, and even the language that they spoke was a Tupi-based language, named Nheengatu or L√≠ngua Geral, a lingua franca in Brazil until the 18th century. The region of S√£o Paulo was the biggest in the proliferation of Mamelucos, who in the 17th century under the name of Bandeirantes, spread throughout the Brazilian territory, from the Amazon rainforest to the extreme South. They were responsible for the major expansion of the Iberian culture in the interior of Brazil. They acculturated the Indian tribes who lived in isolation, and took the language of the colonizer, which was not Portuguese yet, but Nheengatu itself, to the most inhospitable corners of the colony. Nheengatu is still spoken in certain regions of the Amazon, although the Tupi- speaking Indians did not live there. The Nheengatu language, as in other regions of the country, was introduced there by Bandeirantes from S√£o Paulo in the 17th century. The way of life of the Old Paulistas could almost be confused with the Indians. Within the family, only Nheengatu was spoken. Agriculture, hunting, fishing and gathering of fruits were also based on Indian traditions. What differentiated the Old Paulistas from the Tupi was the use of clothes, salt, metal tools, weapons and other European items. A Tupiniquim chief (Cacique) in Bras√≠lia, 2007 When these areas of large Tupi influence started to be integrated into the market economy, Brazilian society gradually started to lose its Tupi characteristics. The Portuguese language became dominant and L√≠ngua Geral virtually disappeared. The rustic Indian techniques of production were replaced by European ones, in order to elevate the capacity of exportation. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi. Some examples of Portuguese words that came from Tupi are: mingau, mirim, soco, cutucar, tiquinho, perereca, tatu. The names of several local fauna - such as arara (\\"macaw\\"), jacar√© (\\"South American alligator\\"), tucano (\\"toucan\\") - and flora - e.g. mandioca (\\"manioc\\") and abacaxi (\\"pineapple\\") - are also derived from the Tupi language. A number of places and cities in modern Brazil are named in Tupi (Itaquaquecetuba, Pindamonhangaba, Caruaru, Ipanema). Anthroponyms include Ubirajara, Ubirat√£, Moema, Jussara, Jurema, Jana√≠na. Tupi surnames do exist, but they do not imply any real Tupi ancestry; rather they were adopted as a manner to display Brazilian nationalism. The Tupinamb√° tribe is fictitiously portrayed in Nelson Pereira dos Santos' satirical 1971 film How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman (Como Era Gostoso o Meu Franc√™s). Its name is also adapted by science: Tupinambis is a genus of tegus, arguably the best-known lizards of Brazil. The large offshore Tupi oil field discovered off the coast of Brazil in 2006 was named in honor of the Tupi people. The Guaran√≠ are a different native group which inhabits southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and northern Argentina and speaks the distinct Guaran√≠ languages, but these are in the same language family as Tupi.

Retrieved 2 January 2010.Ivan Illich, Deschooling Society, 1972 He served as the last bishop of the Unity of the Brethren before becoming a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book Didactica Magna. As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century. Comenius introduced a number of educational concepts and innovations including pictorial textbooks written in native languages instead of Latin, teaching based in gradual development from simple to more comprehensive concepts, lifelong learning with a focus on logical thinking over dull memorization, equal opportunity for impoverished children, education for women, and universal and practical instruction. Besides his native Bohemian Crown, he lived and worked in other regions of the Holy Roman Empire, and other countries: Sweden, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Transylvania, England, the Netherlands and Hungary. Life and work Oldest surviving manuscript by Comenius dated 1611; written in Latin and Czech Alphonse Mucha's The Slav Epic cycle No.16: he Last days of Jan Amos Komensk√Ω in Naarden: A Flicker of Hope (1918) John Amos Comenius was born in 1592 in the Margraviate of Moravia in the Bohemian Crown.\\"Unum necessarium\\" Komensky subscribed as \\"J.A. Comenius Moravus\\" (Czech translation) His birthplace is uncertain and possibilities include Uhersk√Ω Brod (as on his gravestone in Naarden), Nivnice, and Kom≈àa (from this village he took his surname, which means \\"a man from Kom≈àa\\"), all of which are located in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ District of today's Czech Republic. John was the youngest child and only son of Martin Komensk√Ω (died 1602‚Äì4) and his wife Anna Chmelov√°. His grandfather, whose name was Jan (J√°nos) Szeges, was of Hungarian origin. He started to use the surname Komensk√Ω after leaving Kom≈àa to live in Uhersk√Ω Brod.Vyskoƒçil, Franti≈°ek: JAN AMOS KOMENSK√ù. Kapitoly o jeho p≈ôedcich, rodiƒç√≠ch, p≈ôibuzn√Ωch a m√≠stƒõ narozen√≠. Brno 1990. p. 66 Martin and Anna Komensk√Ω belonged to the Moravian Brethren, a pre-Reformation Protestant denomination, and Comenius later became one of its leaders. His parents and two of his four sisters died in 1604 and young John went to live with his aunt in Str√°≈ænice. Owing to his impoverished circumstances he was unable to begin his formal education until later in life. He was 16 when he entered the Latin school in P≈ôerov (he later returned to this school as a teacher 1614‚Äì1618). He continued his studies in the Herborn Academy (1611‚Äì1613) and the University of Heidelberg (1613‚Äì1614). In 1612 he read the Rosicrucian manifesto Fama Fraternitatis. Comenius was greatly influenced by the Irish Jesuit William Bathe as well as his teachers Johann Piscator, Heinrich Gutberleth, and particularly Heinrich Alsted. The Herborn school held the principle that every theory has to be functional in practical use, therefore it has to be didactic (i.e. morally instructive). In the course of his study he also became acquainted with the educational reforms of Ratichius and with the report of these reforms issued by the universities of Jena and Giessen. Comenius became rector of a school in P≈ôerov. In 1616 he was ordained into the ministry of the Moravian Brethren and four years later became pastor and rector at Fulnek, one of its most flourishing churches. Throughout his life this pastoral activity was his most immediate concern. In consequence of the religious wars, he lost all his property and his writings in 1621. In 1627 he led the Brethren into exile when the Habsburg Counter-Reformation persecuted the Protestants in Bohemia. In 1628 he corresponded with Johann Valentin Andreae. He produced the book Janua linguarum reserata, or The Gate of Languages Unlocked, which brought him to prominence. However, as the Unity of the Brethren became an important target of the Counter Reformation movement, he was forced into exile even as his fame grew across Europe. Comenius took refuge in Leszno in Poland, where he led the gymnasium and, furthermore, was given charge of the Bohemian and Moravian churches. In 1638 Comenius responded to a request by the government of Sweden and traveled there to draw up a scheme for the management of the schools of that country, After his religious duties, Comenius's second great interest was in furthering the Baconian attempt at the organization of all human knowledge. He became one of the leaders in the encyclop√¶dic or pansophic movement of the seventeenth century, and, in fact, was inclined to sacrifice his more practical educational interests and opportunities for these more imposing but somewhat visionary projects. In 1639, Comenius published his Pansophi√¶ Prodromus, and in the following year his English friend Hartlib published, without his consent, the plan of the pansophic work as outlined by Comenius. The pansophic ideas find partial expression in the series of textbooks he produced from time to time. In these, he attempts to organize the entire field of human knowledge so as to bring it, in outline, within the grasp of every child. Comenius also attempted to design a language in which false statements were inexpressible. Portrait of an Old Man by Rembrandt, possibly a depiction of Comenius In 1641, he responded to a request by the English parliament and joined a commission there charged with the reform of the system of public education. The English Civil War interfered with the latter project. According to Cotton Mather, Comenius was asked by Winthrop to be the President of Harvard University (this being more plausibly John Winthrop the Younger than his father as junior Winthrop was in England) but in 1642, Comenius moved to Sweden instead.Johann Amos Comenius, Charles William Bardeen, and Charles Hoole, The orbis pictus of John Amos Comenius. , page ii, quoting Cotton Mather, Magnalia, vol. II, p. 14.Daniel Murphy, Comenius: A Critical Reassessment of His Life and Works (1995), p. 27. to work with Queen Christina (reigned 1632‚Äì1654) and the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (in office 1612‚Äì1654) on the task of reorganizing the Swedish schools. The same year he moved to ElblƒÖg (Elbing) in Poland and in 1648 went to England with the aid of Samuel Hartlib, who came originally from ElblƒÖg. In 1650 Zsuzsanna Lor√°ntffy, widow of George I R√°k√≥czi prince of Transylvania invited him to S√°rospatak. Comenius remained there until 1654 as a professor at the first Hungarian Protestant College; he wrote some of his most important works there. Comenius returned to Leszno. During the Deluge in 1655, he declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side, for which Polish Catholic partisans burned his house, his manuscripts, and the school's printing press in 1656. The manuscript of Pansophia was destroyed in the burning of his home in Leszno in 1657. From Leszno he took refuge in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. In 1659, Comenius produced a new edition of the 1618 Bohemian Brethren hymnal, Kancion√°l, to jest kniha ≈æalm≈Ø a p√≠sn√≠ duchovn√≠ch containing 606 texts and 406 tunes. In addition to revising the psalms and hymns, his revision greatly expanded the number of hymns and added a new introduction. This edition was reissued several times, into the nineteenth century. His texts in Czech were notable poetic compositions, but he used tunes from other sources. He also edited the German hymnal Kirchen-, Haus- und Hertzens-Musica (Amsterdam, 1661), which had been published under the title Kirchenges√§nge since 1566. In other writings, Comenius addresses both instrumental and vocal music in many places, although he dedicated no treatise to the topic. Sometimes he follows the medieval mathematical conception of music, but in other places he links music with grammar, rhetoric, and politics. Musical practice, both instrumental and vocal, played an important role in his system of education. He would die there in 1670. For unclear reasons he was buried in Naarden, where visitors can see his grave in the mausoleum, located in the Klooster straat, devoted to him. Educational influence Latin class from Orbis Pictus The most permanent influence exerted by Comenius was in practical educational work. Few men since his days have had a greater influence though, for the greater part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth, there was little recognition of his relationship to the current advance in educational thought and practice. The practical educational influence of Comenius was threefold. He was first a teacher and an organizer of schools, not only among his own people, but later in Sweden, and to a slight extent in Holland. In his Didactica Magna (Great Didactic), he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of the existing American system of kindergarten, elementary school, secondary school, college, and university. In the second place, the influence of Comenius was in formulating the general theory of education. In this respect, he is the forerunner of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Fr√∂bel, etc., and is the first to formulate that idea of \\"education according to nature\\" so influential during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. The influence of Comenius on educational thought is comparable with that of his contemporaries, Bacon and Descartes, on science and philosophy. In fact, he was largely influenced by the thought of these two; and his importance is largely due to the fact that he first applied or attempted to apply in a systematic manner the principles of thought and of investigation, newly formulated by those philosophers, to the organization of education in all its aspects. The summary of this attempt is given in the Didactica Magna, completed about 1631, though not published until several years later. The third aspect of his educational influence was that on the subject matter and method of education, exerted through a series of textbooks of an entirely new nature. The first-published of these was the Janua Linguarum Reserata (The Gate of Tongues Unlocked), issued in 1631. This was followed later by a more elementary text, the Vestibulum, and a more advanced one, the Atrium, and other texts. In 1658 the Orbis Pictus was published, probably the most renowned and most widely circulated of school textbooks. It was also the first successful application of illustrations to the work of teaching, though not, as often stated, the first illustrated book for children. Relief of Komensky in Dolany, Czech Republic These texts were all based on the same fundamental ideas: (1) learning foreign languages through the vernacular; (2) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words; (3) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects; (4) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment, physical and social, as well as instruction in religious, moral, and classical subjects; (5) making this acquisition of a compendium of knowledge a pleasure rather than a task; and (6) making instruction universal. The importance of the Comenian influence in education has been recognized since the middle of the nineteenth century. The educational writings of Comenius comprise more than forty titles. In 1892 the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius was very generally celebrated by educators, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed. Theology Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart by Comenius. John Amos Comenius was a bishop of the Unity of the Brethren church that had its roots in the teaching of Czech reformer Jan Hus. One of his most famous theological works is the Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart. The book represents his thinking about the world being full of various useless things and complex labyrinths. The true peace of mind and soul can be found only in the one's heart where Christ the Saviour should dwell and rule. This teaching is also repeated in one of his last works, Unum Necessarium (Only One is Needed), where he shows various labyrinths and problems in the world and provide simple solutions to various situation. In this book he also admits that his former believing in prophecies and revelations of those days was his personal labyrinth where he got lost many times. He was greatly influenced by Boehme. In his Synopsis physicae ad lumen divinum reformatae, Comenius gives a physical theory of his own, said to be taken from the Book of Genesis. He was also famous for his prophecies and the support he gave to visionaries. In his Lux in tenebris he published the visions of Christopher Kotterus, Mikul√°≈° Drab√≠k (lat. Nicolaus Drabicius) and Christina Poniatowska. Attempting to interpret the Book of Revelation, he promised the millennium in 1672, and guaranteed miraculous assistance to those who would undertake the destruction of the Pope and the house of Austria, even venturing to prophesy that Oliver Cromwell, Gustavus Adolphus, and George I R√°k√≥czi, prince of Transylvania, would perform the task. He also wrote to Louis XIV of France, informing him that the empire of the world should be his reward if he would overthrow the enemies of God. Family One of his daughters, Elisabeth, married Peter Figulus from Jablonn√© nad Orlic√≠. Their son, Daniel Ernst Jablonski (1660‚Äì1741), Comenius's grandson, later went to Berlin in 1693; there he became the highest official pastor at the court of King Frederick I of Prussia (reigned 1701‚Äì1713). There he became acquainted with Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700‚Äì1760). Zinzendorf was among the foremost successors to Comenius as a bishop (1737‚Äì1760) in the renewed Moravian Brethren's Church. Legacy The Comenius Medal, a UNESCO award honouring outstanding achievements in the fields of education research and innovation, commemorates Comenius. Peter Drucker hailed Comenius as the inventor of textbooks and primers. =Czech Republic= Czech koruna banknote depicting Comenius During the 19th-century Czech National Revival, Czechs idealised Comenius as a symbol of the Czech nation. This image persists to the present day. The Czech Republic celebrates 28 March, the birthday of Comenius, as Teachers' Day. The University of Jan Amos Komensk√Ω was founded in Prague in 2001, offering bachelor's, master's and graduate degree programmes. Gate to Languages, a project of lifelong education, taking place in the Czech Republic from October 2005 to June 2007 and aimed at language education of teachers, was named after his book Janua linguarum reserata (Gate to Languages Unlocked). Comenius is pictured on the 200 Czech koruna banknote. Asteroid 1861 Komensk√Ω, discovered by Lubo≈° Kohoutek, is named in his honor. =Elsewhere in Europe= Portrait of Comenius by the Slovak painter Karol Miloslav Lehotsk√Ω In S√°rospatak, Hungary, a teacher's college is named after him, which belongs to the University of Miskolc. Comenius' name has been given to primary schools in several German cities, including Bonn, Grafing, and Deggendorf. In Skopje, North Macedonia the Czechoslovak government built a school after a catastrophic 1963 earthquake and named it after Comenius (Jan Amos Komenski in Macedonian). In Poland, the Comenius Foundation is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the provision of equal opportunities to children under 10 years of age. In 1919 Comenius University was founded by an act of parliament in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, now in Slovakia. It was the first university with courses in the Slovak language. The Italian film director Roberto Rossellini took Comenius, and especially his theory of \\"direct vision\\", as his model in the development of his didactic theories, which Rossellini hoped would usher the world into a utopian future.Rossellini, Roberto. Utopia autopsia 1010. Rome: Armando, 1974. 195-6.

In the United Kingdom, the University of Sheffield's Western Bank Library holds the largest collection of Comenius manuscripts outside of the Czech Republic. =United States= In 1892 Comenius Hall, the principal classroom and faculty office building on Moravian College's campus in Pennsylvania, was built. In 1892 educators in many places celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed.New International Encyclopedia The education department at Salem College in North Carolina has an annual Comenius Symposium dedicated in his honor; the subjects usually deal with modern issues in education. The Comenius Foundation in the US, a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity, uses film and documentary production to further faith, learning, and love.

Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and a regulation ranging from local community-based groups to statewide government monopolies. The term utilities can also refer to the set of services provided by these organizations consumed by the public: coal, electricity, natural gas, water, sewage, telephone, and transportation. Broadband internet services (both fixed-line and mobile) are increasingly being included within the definition. United States In the United States, public utilities are often natural monopolies because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. As a result, they are often government monopolies, or if privately owned, the sectors are specially regulated by a public utilities commission. The first public utility in the United States was a grist mill erected on Mother Brook in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1640. Developments in technology have eroded some of the natural monopoly aspects of traditional public utilities. For instance, electricity generation, electricity retailing, telecommunication, some types of public transit and postal services have become competitive in some countries and the trend towards liberalization, deregulation and privatization of public utilities is growing. However, the infrastructure used to distribute most utility products and services has remained largely monopolistic. Public utilities can be privately owned or publicly owned. Publicly owned utilities include cooperative and municipal utilities. Municipal utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits or may not even serve the entire city. Cooperative utilities are owned by the customers they serve. They are usually found in rural areas. Publicly owned utilities are non-profit. Private utilities, also called investor-owned utilities, are owned by investors, and operate for profit, often referred to as a rate of return. Public utilities provide services at the consumer level, be it residential, commercial, or industrial consumer. In turn, utilities and very large consumers buy and sell electricity at the wholesale level through a network of regional transmission organizations (RTO) and independent system operators (ISO) within one of three grids, the Eastern Interconnection, the Texas Interconnection, which is a single ISO, and the Western Interconnection. =Public utilities commissions= A public utilities commission is a governmental agency in a particular jurisdiction that regulates the commercial activities related to associated electric, natural gas, telecommunications, water, railroad, rail transit, and/or passenger transportation companies. For example, the California Public Utilities Commission (or CPUC) and the Public Utility Commission of Texas regulate the utility companies in California and Texas, respectively, on behalf of their citizens and ratepayers (customers). These public utility commissions (PUCs) are typically composed of commissioners, who are appointed by their respective governors, and dedicated staff that implement and enforce rules and regulations, approve or deny rate increases, and monitor/report on relevant activities. Over the years, various changes have dramatically re-shaped the mission and focus of many public utility commissions. Their focus has typically shifted from the up-front regulation of rates and services to the oversight of competitive marketplaces and enforcement of regulatory compliance. United Kingdom and Ireland In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the state, private firms, and charities ran the traditional public utilities. For instance, the Sanitary Districts were established in England and Wales in 1875 and in Ireland in 1878. The term can refer to the set of services provided by various organizations that are used in everyday life by the public, such as: electricity generation, electricity retailing, electricity supplies, natural gas supplies, water supplies, Sewage works, sewage systems and broadband internet services. They are regulated by Ofgem, Ofwat and Ofcom. Disabled community transport services may occasionally be included within the definition. They were mostly privatised in the UK during the 1980s.

Unlike standardized systems of Romanization of Greek, as used internationally for purposes such as rendering Greek proper names or place names, or for bibliographic purposes, the term Greeklish mainly refers to informal, ad-hoc practices of writing Greek text in environments where the use of the Greek alphabet is technically impossible or cumbersome, especially in electronic media. Greeklish was commonly used on the Internet when Greek people communicate by forum, e-mail, IRC, instant messaging and occasionally on SMS, mainly because older operating systems did not have the ability to write in Greek, or in a unicode form like UTF-8. During this age, Greeklish became a controversial subject, with some claiming that it bastardized the Greek language or degraded the youth's linguistic ability. Nowadays, while the Greek alphabet has become more easily accessible and much Greek language content is written in it, Greeklish is still often used, primarily by younger generations on social media, be it for convenience or aesthetic reasons. Sometimes, the term Greeklish is also used informally for a non-standard language variety used by bilingual speakers of English and Greek, i.e. Greek with heavy macaronic or code-switching admixture of English words, or vice versa. History Some older traditions of using the Latin alphabet for Greek existed in earlier centuries. The term frankolevantinika properly refers to the use of the Latin script to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism. (\\"Frankos\\" is an older Greek term for Roman Catholic.) This usage was routine in the Venetian-ruled Greece and in Venetian Crete in the early modern era. Indeed, the autograph manuscripts of several Greek literary works of the Renaissance are in Latin script (e.g. the comedy Fortounatos by Markos Antonios Foskolos, 1655). This convention was also known as frankochiotika/œÜœÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøœáŒπœéœÑŒπŒ∫Œ±, \\"Frankish/Catholic Chiot\\", alluding to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios. Orthographic and phonetic Greeklish Greeklish may be orthographic or phonetic. In orthographic use, the intent is to reproduce Greek orthography closely: there is a one-to-one mapping between Greek and Latin letters, and digraphs are avoided, with occasional use of punctuation or numerals resembling Greek letters rather than Latin digraphs. While letters are in the first instance chosen for phonetic similarity, visual equivalence, and corresponding keyboard keys, are used when phonetically similar letters are exhausted. Thus, psi (œà) may be written as ps, 4 or y; xi (Œæ) as ks, x or 3; and theta (Œ∏) as th or 8. In phonetic use, there is no concern to reproduce Greek orthography, and the Greeklish is a phonetic transcription (usually with English phonetic norms, sometimes with other languages' like German) of Greek words ‚Äî although often there is a mixture of the two. In particular, iotacism is preserved: the various letters and digraphs now pronounced as /i/ are transcribed as i, and not differentiated as they are in an orthographic scheme (e.g. h, i, u, ei, oi for Œ∑ Œπ œÖ ŒµŒπ ŒøŒπ). In a phonetic scheme, xi is usually x or ks or 3; ks or 3 is used if x has been chosen, following orthographic norms, for chi (œá). Psi and theta will usually be the digraphs ps and th. 3 is often used to represent xi (Œæ) because of the similar shape of the number 3 to the original letter albeit mirrored. An example of orthographic Greeklish could be the word \\"plateia\\", which in Greek means \\"square\\" and using the Greek alphabet is spelled \\"œÄŒªŒ±œÑŒµŒØŒ±\\". The word \\"plateia\\" derives from the exact replacement of each Greek letter with its Latin respective: œÄ=p, Œª=l, Œ±=a, œÑ=t, Œµ=e, Œπ=i, Œ±=a. An example of phonetic Greeklish could be the same word, \\"square\\", written like this: \\"platia\\". The reason the same word is, in this occasion, written without the letter \\"e\\", is the fact that, phonetically, the word \\"square\\" in Greek sounds exactly like this: \\"platia\\" (since -\\"ŒµŒØ\\"- is now pronounced /i/, as an instance of iotacism), but not for the phonology and the historical or learned pronunciation of the Ancient Greek language (where it was \\"plateia\\"). The most extreme case of orthographic Greeklish, which achieves the greater optical resemblance to the Greek prototypes, is perhaps the so-called \\"byzantine\\" or \\"arabesque\\" or \\"calligraphic/artistic\\" Greeklish introduced in the Hellas mailing list by the mathematician George Baloglou. Main characteristics of Baloglou's \\"byzantine\\" is the distinction of œÉ and œÇ (œÉ=c œÇ=s), the distinction Œøf lower and upper letters, such as œÄ=n, Œ†=TT or 5, Œ∏=8, Œò=0 or Q, œà=y, Œ®=4, and the unusual, but with great resemblance with the Greek prototype, transliterations œÉ=c, œÄ=n œÅ=p Œ°=P. Since there were many relevant differences both in the written and in the spoken language -such as in the grammar, orthography and phonology of Greek- at the time of the Ancient Greek, the Koine, Jewish Koine, Medieval and Modern, thus the same word across the history may change outstandingly and therefore have multiple choices of \\"rendering\\" (transliteration or transcription) depending on the time on which the referring text was written or translated. Books written in Greeklish Giannis Androutsopoulos (see references) talks about Exegesis, a book in Greeklish that was published by Oxy Publications in 2000. The Greeklish transliteration was based on the Greek translation of the original book written by Astro Teller. A novel about artificial intelligence, it describes a computer program that has acquired a \\"mind\\" of its own. The original book was written entirely in the form of e-mail messages, something that prompted Androutsopoulos and his collaborators to publish a version of it in Greeklish. Computer usage In the past there was a variety of mutually incompatible systems for displaying non-ASCII characters (IBM 437, ELOT 928, ISO 8859-7 plus a few company-specific encodings) and no standard method for typing them on a computer keyboard. This situation was resolved with the introduction of Unicode. Before the introduction of Unicode-compatible software (web servers and clients) many Greek personal or informal web sites were written in Greeklish. This is no longer the case and most (if not all) of the sites with Greek content are written in native Greek. Almost all electronic mail messaging was also using Greeklish, and only recently, with the introduction of full Unicode compatibility in modern e-mail client software and gradual replacement of older programs, that usage of Greek characters became widespread. Some internet service providers in Greece use both Greek and Greeklish in their emails. For example, the corporate announcements sent to users via email are usually written in English, Greek, and Greeklish. This is done to ensure that the recipient can understand an important service message even if the settings of their computer for non-ASCII characters do not match those of the sender. Commercial use= Use in advertisements = As of 2008, business advertisements using Greeklish have appeared in Athens Metro and other areas. Companies that have used Greeklish in some of their advertisements include Pizza Hut, Forthnet and Vodafone. =Use in business communication= Use of Greeklish for business purposes or business communication is considered as a lack of business ability or respect.

The first open online application for the transcription of Greeklish to Greek, was developed by Artificial Intelligence Group at University of Patras, named deGREEKLISH.

The group were named after their keyboardist Manfred Mann, who later led the successful 1970s group Manfred Mann's Earth Band. The band had two different lead vocalists, Paul Jones from 1962 to 1966, and Mike d'Abo from 1966 to 1969. The group were regularly in the UK charts in the 1960s. Three of the band's most successful singles, \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\", \\"Pretty Flamingo\\" and \\"Mighty Quinn\\", topped the UK Singles Chart. Their 1964 hit \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" was the theme tune for the ITV pop music show Ready Steady Go!. They were the first southern-England-based group to top the US Billboard Hot 100 during the British invasion.  History = Beginnings (1962‚Äì1963) = The Mann-Hugg Blues Brothers were formed in London by keyboard player Manfred Mann and drummer/vibes/piano player Mike Hugg, who formed a house band in Clacton-on- Sea that also featured Graham Bond. Bringing a shared love of jazz to the British blues boom then sweeping London's clubs, the band was completed by Mike Vickers on guitar, alto saxophone and flute, bassist Dave Richmond and Paul Jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist. By this time they had changed their name to Manfred Mann & the Manfreds. Gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963, they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound. After changing their name to Manfred Mann at the behest of their label's producer John Burgess, the group signed with His Master's Voice in March 1963 and began their recorded output that July with the slow, blues instrumental single \\"Why Should We Not?\\", which they performed on their first appearance on television on a New Year's Eve show. It failed to chart, as did its follow-up (with vocals), \\"Cock-a-Hoop\\". The overdubbed instrumental soloing on woodwinds, vibes, harmonica and second keyboard lent considerable weight to the group's sound, and demonstrated the jazz-inspired technical prowess in which they took pride. = Early success (1964‚Äì1965) = In 1964, the group was asked to provide a new theme tune for the ITV pop music television programme Ready Steady Go!. They responded with \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" which, with the help of weekly television exposure, rose to No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. Shortly after \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" was recorded, Richmond left the band,Jazz4now ‚Äì The Dave Richmond Home Page \\"Please note that \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" was recorded before I left the band, in fact I still receive PPL payments every time it is broadcast\\" ‚Äì Dave Richmond though he would record with them occasionally later. He was replaced by Jones' friend Tom McGuinness‚Äîthe first of many changes. After a further self-penned hit, \\"Hubble Bubble (Toil And Trouble)\\", the band struck gold with \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\", a cover version of the Exciters' No. 78 Hot 100 hit earlier that year. The track reached the top of the UK, Canadian, and US charts. With the success of \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\" the sound of the group's singles moved away from the jazzy, blues-based music of their early years to a pop hybrid that continued to make hit singles from cover material. They hit No. 3 in the UK with another girl-group cover, \\"Sha La La\\", (originally by the Shirelles) which also reached No. 12 in the US and Canada, and followed it with the sentimental \\"Come Tomorrow\\" (originally by Marie Knight) but both were of a noticeably lighter texture than their earliest output. Meanwhile, \\"B\\" sides and four-song EPs showcased original material and instrumental solos. The group also returned to jazz and R&B; themes on their albums: their first, 1964's The Five Faces of Manfred Mann, included standards such as \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" while the second and last with this line-up, Mann Made, offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of \\"Stormy Monday Blues\\" alongside novelties and pop ballads. With a cover of Maxine Brown's \\"Oh No Not My Baby\\" began a phase of new depth and sophistication in the arrangements of their singles. The group began its string of successes with Bob Dylan songs with a track on the best-selling EP The One in the Middle, \\"With God on Our Side\\", next reaching No. 2 in the UK with \\"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\\". The EP's title track reached the British top ten singles, the last self-written song (by Jones) and the band's last R'n'B workout to do so. The run climaxed with a second UK No. 1 single, \\"Pretty Flamingo\\", produced by John Burgess. The group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion, and then had taken chart music in their stride‚Äîbut could not hope to cope with Paul Jones' projected solo career as singer and actor, and with Mike Vickers' orchestral and instrumental ambitions. Jones intended to go solo once a replacement could be found, but stayed with the band for another year, during which Vickers left. McGuinness moved to guitar, his original instrument, contributing the distinctive National Steel Guitar to \\"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\\" and \\"Pretty Flamingo\\", and was replaced on bass by Jack Bruce, who had been playing for the Graham Bond Organisation for some time before a recent brief stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. In his brief tenure before leaving to form Cream, Bruce played on \\"Pretty Flamingo\\" and on the EP Instrumental Asylum (for which both he, and wind instrumentalists Henry Lowther and Lyn Dobson, were included in the sleeve photo of the group), which began the group's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs. He was replaced by Klaus Voormann. The band changed record companies just afterward, although EMI quickly released an EP of earlier unissued 1963‚Äì66 era songs titled As Was (a pun on the title of their then new 1966 album, As Is), a hits compilation; Mann Made Hits (1966), an instrumental compilation LP that included one unissued instrumental track; Soul of Mann (1967); and most controversially used session players to complete the unfinished track \\"You Gave Me Somebody To Love\\" (c/w 'Poison Ivy\\"‚Äîboth sung by Paul Jones) which made No. 36 in the UK singles chart, upsetting the group‚Äîhence McGuinness's wry comment \\"Manfreds disown new single\\" on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label. = Mike d'Abo years (1966‚Äì1969) = The band in 1966 Manfred Mann & The Beatgirls on the Dutch TV programme Moef Ga Ga on 22 March 1968 Jones was replaced by Mike d'Abo in July 1966, and the group switched labels to Fontana Records, where they were produced by Shel Talmy. Their first Fontana single, a version of Dylan's \\"Just Like a Woman\\", released in July, scraped into the UK top ten and reached number one in Sweden. Their new long-player, As Is, followed in October; the group's increased studio technique sidelined their jazz, soul and blues roots. The next two singles, \\"Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr James\\" and \\"Ha Ha Said The Clown\\", both reached the Top 5. Another EP set of instrumentals, Instrumental Assassination, was released in December. This featured original member Dave Richmond on double bass, but not Mike d'Abo, suggesting the sessions dated from a little earlier in 1966. An instrumental version of Tommy Roe's \\"Sweet Pea\\" only reached No. 36 when issued as a single and the follow-up, Randy Newman's \\"So Long, Dad\\", with its intricate keyboard arrangement, missed the top twenty altogether. Thus, 1967 was for the group largely an unsuccessful year in the charts, besides \\"Ha Ha Said The Clown\\" which reached the UK singles chart early in 1967. There was no album, as Mann and Hugg explored other avenues of their career, although their record company did compile the UK budget-priced album What A Mann (Fontana SFL 13003), a predominantly instrumental set gathering together a few recent singles' A-sides, B-sides, and instrumental EP tracks. The following year 1968 brought two albums, the Mann‚ÄìHugg soundtrack to the film Up the Junction in February, from which an edited title track coupled with the rare B-side \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" was issued as an unsuccessful UK single; and Mighty Garvey! in July. They had a resounding success with \\"Mighty Quinn\\", their third UK No. 1 and third hit Dylan song, which also peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 10 in the US. In June 1968, the following single, John Simon's \\"My Name is Jack\\", was recalled when the US company Mercury Records complained about the phrase \\"Super Spade\\" in the lyrics, which referred to a Haight- Ashbury drug dealer. The release was delayed by a week until the offending name was re-recorded as \\"Superman\\"; however, the UK hit single version retained the original lyric. Their December 1968 release, \\"Fox on the Run\\", reached No. 5 in the UK. Frustrated with the limitations and image of being seen purely as a hit singles band (their last two albums failed to chart), the group split in 1969. = Aftermath = Mann and Hugg were already writing advertising jingles at the time of the group's demise, but continued to work together in a group format with Manfred Mann Chapter Three, an experimental jazz rock band described by Mann as an over-reaction to the hit factory of the Manfred Mann group.Manfred Mann's Earth Band ‚Äì History Of The Band Platform End On-Line For a moment their musical worlds coincided: a TV cigar advertisement, a long track from Chapter Three's first album Travellin' Lady, and \\"A \\"B\\" Side\\", the flip of the old group's last single, all used the same riff. However, the new group was short-lived and by 1971 after a second album (and an unreleased possibly incomplete third) they had disbanded and Mann had formed a new group. The original line-up of this new group consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (organ, synthesizer and vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals). In its very earliest stages, the band was simply billed as 'Manfred Mann' and thus a continuation of the 1960s group. The quartet (as 'Manfred Mann') released their first single, \\"Please Mrs. Henry\\", in 1971. Their second single, Randy Newman's \\"Living Without You\\", was also released by 'Manfred Mann' in Europe, but by 'Manfred Mann's Earth Band' in the US, where the track became a minor chart hit. From 1972 onward 'Manfred Mann's Earth Band' was the band name used on all releases by this group, and they are considered a separate band from Manfred Mann. Manfred Mann briefly reformed in June 1983, for an appearance at the Marquee Club in London to help celebrate the club's 25th anniversary. In the 1990s, most of the original 1960s line-up reformed as the Manfreds, minus Manfred Mann himself (hence the name), playing most of the old 1960s hits and a few jazz instrumentals, sometimes with both Paul Jones and Mike d'Abo fronting the line-up. Tom McGuinness formed McGuinness Flint in 1970, scoring a few hits before they disbanded in 1975. Both Jones and McGuinness have been mainstays of the Blues Band, which they helped form in 1978. In 2009, the Manfreds (d'Abo, Hugg, Jones and McGuinness) joined Klaus Voormann in performing a version of \\"Mighty Quinn\\" for his first solo collection A Sideman's Journey, credited to 'Voormann & Friends'.

The Restoration reacted against the \\"spiritual authoritarianism\\" of the Puritan era. Rochester embodied this new era, and he became as well known for his rakish lifestyle as his poetry, although the two were often interlinked. He died as a result of venereal disease at the age of 33. Rochester was described by his contemporary Andrew Marvell as \\"the best English satirist,\\" and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits.http://cerisia.cerosia.org/articles/251/Longman%20Anthology%20Instructors%20Manual/Restoration/76-JohnWilmot_IM.pdf His poetry was widely censored during the Victorian era, but enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards, with reappraisals from noted literary figures such as Graham Greene and Ezra Pound. The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked Rochester's libertinism to Hobbesian materialism. During his lifetime, Rochester was best known for A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind, and it remains among his best-known works today. Life=Upbringing and teens= John Wilmot was born at Ditchley House in Oxfordshire on 1 April 1647. His father, Henry, Viscount Wilmot, was created Earl of Rochester in 1652 for his military service to Charles II during the King's exile under the Commonwealth. Paul Davis describes Henry as \\"a Cavalier legend, a dashing bon vivant and war-hero who single-handedly engineered the future Charles II's escape to the Continent (including the famous concealment in an oak tree) after the disastrous battle of Worcester in 1651\\". His mother, Anne St. John, was a strong-willed Puritan from a noble Wiltshire family. From the age of seven, Rochester was privately tutored, two years later attending the grammar school in nearby Burford. His father died in 1658, and John Wilmot inherited the title of the Earl of Rochester in April of that year. In January 1660, Rochester was admitted as a Fellow commoner to Wadham College, Oxford, a new and comparatively poor college. Whilst there, it is said, the 13-year-old \\"grew debauched\\". In September 1661 he was awarded an honorary M.A. by the newly elected Chancellor of the university, Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, a family friend.Frank H. Ellis, \\"Wilmot, John, second earl of Rochester (1647‚Äì1680)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 12 July 2012 Elizabeth Wilmot (Malet) by Peter Lely As an act of gratitude towards the son of Henry Wilmot, Charles II conferred on Rochester an annual pension of ¬£500. In November 1661 Charles sent Rochester on a three year Grand Tour of France and Italy, and appointed the physician Andrew Balfour as his governor. This exposed him to an unusual degree to European (especially French) writing and thought.Treglown, Jeremy. \\"Rochester and the second bottle.\\" Times Literary Supplement [London, England] 10 Sept. 1993: 5. Times Literary Supplement Historical Archive. Web. 11 Dec. 2012. In 1664 Rochester returned to London, and made his formal d√©but at the Restoration court on Christmas Day.https://archive.org/details/letterswrittento00balf It has been suggested by a number of scholars that the King took a paternal role in Rochester's life. Charles II suggested a marriage between Rochester and the wealthy heiress Elizabeth Malet. Her wealth-hungry relatives opposed marriage to the impoverished Rochester, who conspired with his mother to abduct the young Countess. Samuel Pepys described the attempted abduction in his diary on 28 May 1665: > Thence to my Lady Sandwich's, where, to my shame, I had not been a great > while before. Here, [I told] her a story of my Lord Rochester's running away > on Friday night last with Mrs. Mallett, the great beauty and fortune of the > North, who had supped at White Hall with Mrs. Stewart, and was going home to > her lodgings with her grandfather, my Lord Haly, by coach; and was at > Charing Cross seized on by both horse and foot men, and forcibly taken from > him, and put into a coach with six horses, and two women provided to receive > her, and carried away. Upon immediate pursuit, my Lord of Rochester (for > whom the King had spoke to the lady often, but with no successe ) was taken > at Uxbridge; but the lady is not yet heard of, and the King mighty angry, > and the Lord sent to the Tower. Samuel Pepys, entry for 26 May 1665, Diary > of Samuel Pepys May 28, 1665. Accessed May 5, 2007 18-year-old Rochester spent three weeks in the Tower, and was only released after he wrote a penitent apology to the King. Rochester attempted to redeem himself by volunteering for the navy in the Second Dutch War in the winter of 1665, serving under the Earl of Sandwich. His courage at the Battle of V√•gen, serving on board the ship of Thomas Teddeman, made him a war hero. Pleased with his conduct, Charles appointed Rochester a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in March 1666, which granted him prime lodgings in Whitehall and a pension of ¬£1,000 a year.Frank H. Ellis, \\"Wilmot, John, second earl of Rochester (1647‚Äì1680)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 4 April 2013 The role encompassed, one week in every four, Rochester helping the King to dress and undress, serve his meals when dining in private, and sleeping at the foot of the King's bed. In the summer of 1666, Rochester returned to sea, serving aboard under Edward Spragge. He again showed extraordinary courage in battle, including rowing between vessels under heavy cannon fire, to deliver Spragge's messages around the fleet. Upon returning from sea, Rochester resumed his courtship of Elizabeth Malet. Defying her family's wishes, Malet eloped with Rochester again in January 1667, and they were married at the Knightsbridge chapel.Notes and Queries (2011) 58 (3): 381‚Äì386. doi: 10.1093/notesj/gjr109 They had four children: Lady Anne Wilmot (1669‚Äî1703), Charles Wilmot (1671‚Äî1681), Lady Elizabeth Wilmot (1674‚Äî1757) and Lady Malet Wilmot (1676‚Äî1708/1709). In October 1667, the monarch granted Rochester special licence to enter the House of Lords early, despite being seven months underage. The act was an attempt by the King to bolster his number of supporters among the Lords. Teenage actress Nell Gwyn \\"almost certainly\\" took him as her lover; she was later to become the mistress of Charles II. Gwyn remained a lifelong friend and political associate, and her relationship with the King gave Rochester influence and status within the Court. =Twenties and last years= Rochester's life was divided between domesticity in the country and a riotous existence at court, where he was renowned for drunkenness, vivacious conversation, and \\"extravagant frolics\\" as part of the Merry Gang (as Andrew Marvell described them).Google books Charles Beauclerk, Nell Gwyn: Mistress to a King (New York: Grove, 2005), 272. The Merry Gang flourished for about 15 years after 1665 and included Henry Jermyn; Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset; John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave; Henry Killigrew; Sir Charles Sedley; the playwrights William Wycherley and George Etherege; and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Gilbert Burnet wrote of him that, \\"For five years together he was continually Drunk‚Ä¶ [and] not‚Ä¶ perfectly Master of himself‚Ä¶ [which] led him to‚Ä¶ do many wild and unaccountable things.\\" Pepys's Diary records one such occasion on 16 February 1669 when Rochester was invited to dine with the King and the Dutch ambassador: > The King dining yesterday at the Dutch ambassador's, after dinner they drank > and were pretty merry; and among the rest of the King's company there was > that worthy fellow my Lord of Rochester, and Tom Killigrew, whose mirth and > raillery offended the former so much that he did give Tom Killigrew a box on > the ear in the King's presence, which do give much offence to the people > here at Court ... His actions were considered an offence against the King, or a l√®se-majest√©, and he was banned from the court, although the King soon called for his return. In 1673, Rochester began to train Elizabeth Barry as an actress. She went on to become the most famous actress of her age. He took her as his mistress in 1675. The relationship lasted for around five years, and produced a daughter, before descending into acrimony after Rochester began to resent her success. Rochester wrote afterwards, \\"With what face can I incline/To damn you to be only mine?‚Ä¶ Live up to thy might mind/And be the mistress of mankind\\". Portrait of the poet by Jacob Huysmans When the King's advisor and friend of Rochester, George Villiers, lost power in 1673, Rochester's standing fell as well. At the Christmas festivities at Whitehall of that year, Rochester delivered a satire to Charles II, \\"In the Isle of Britain\\" ‚Äì which criticized the King for being obsessed with sex at the expense of his kingdom. Charles' reaction to this satirical portrayal resulted in Rochester's exile from the court until February. During this time Rochester dwelt at his estate in Adderbury. Despite this, in February 1674, after much petitioning by Rochester, the King appointed him Ranger of Woodstock Park. In June 1675 \\"Lord Rochester in a frolick after a rant did ... beat downe the dyill (i.e. sundial) which stood in the middle of the Privie Garding, which was esteemed the rarest in Europ\\". John Aubrey learned what Rochester said on this occasion when he came in from his \\"revells\\" with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, and Fleetwood Sheppard to see the object: \\"'What‚Ä¶ doest thou stand here to fuck time?' Dash they fell to worke\\". It has been speculated that the comment refers not to the dial itself, which was not phallic in appearance, but a painting of the King next to the dial that featured his phallic sceptre. Rochester fled the court again. Rochester fell into disfavour again in 1676. During a late-night scuffle with the night watch, one of Rochester's companions was killed by a pike-thrust. Rochester was reported to have fled the scene of the incident, and his standing with the monarch reached an all- time low.Johnson, Profane Wit, 250-53 Following this incident, Rochester briefly fled to Tower Hill, where he impersonated a mountebank \\"Doctor Bendo\\". Under this persona, he claimed skill in treating \\"barrenness\\" (infertility), and other gynecological disorders. Gilbert Burnet wryly noted that Rochester's practice was \\"not without success\\", implying his intercession of himself as surreptitious sperm donor.Timbs, John. Doctors and patients, or, Anecdotes of the Medical World and Curiosities of Medicine. London: Richard Bentley and Son (1876), p. 151. On occasion, Rochester also assumed the role of the grave and matronly Mrs. Bendo, presumably so that he could inspect young women privately without arousing their husbands' suspicions.Alcock, Thomas. \\"Epistle Dedicatory\\" to Lord Rochester, The Famous Pathologist or The Noble Mountebank. Ed. and introd. Vivian de Sola Pinto. Nottingham: Sisson and Parker (1961), pp. 35‚Äì38 The coffin of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in its vault in Spelsbury church, Oxfordshire. The coffin plate removed from the coffin of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester from his burial vault under the north aisle of Spelsbury church, Oxfordshire =Death= By the age of 33, Rochester was dying from what is usually described as the effects of syphilis, gonorrhea, or other venereal diseases, combined with the effects of alcoholism. Carol Richards has disputed this, arguing that it is more likely that he died of renal failure due to chronic nephritis (Bright's disease) His mother had him attended in his final weeks by her religious associates, particularly Gilbert Burnet, later Bishop of Salisbury. After hearing of Burnet's departure from his side, Rochester muttered his last words: \\"Has my friend left me? Then I shall die shortly.\\" In the early morning of 26 July 1680, Rochester died \\"without a shudder or a sound\\".Johnson, Profane Wit, 327‚Äì43 He was buried at Spelsbury church in Oxfordshire. A deathbed renunciation of libertinism and conversion to Anglican Christianity, Some Passages of the Life and Death of the Honourable John Wilmot Earl of Rochester, was published by Reverend Burnet.Norton, D. A History of the English Bible as Literature Cambridge 2000 pp. 172‚Äì3 Because this account appears in Burnet's own writings, its accuracy has been disputed by some scholars, who accuse Burnet with having shaped the account of Rochester's denunciation of libertinism to enhance his own reputation. On the other hand Graham Greene, in his biography of Wilmot, calls Burnet's book \\"convincing\\". Greene, Graham (1974). Lord Rochester's Monkey, being the Life of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester. New York: The Bodley Head. p. 208 Works Rochester's manor house in Adderbury, Oxfordshire Rochester's poetic work varies widely in form, genre, and content. He was part of a \\"mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease\\",Alexander Pope, \\"First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace\\", line 108. who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts, rather than in publication. As a consequence, some of Rochester's work deals with topical concerns, such as satires of courtly affairs in libels, to parodies of the styles of his contemporaries, such as Sir Carr Scroope. He is also notable for his impromptus,Rochester composed at least 10 versions of Impromptus on Charles II luminarium.org one of which is a teasing epigram on King Charles II: > We have a pretty witty king, Whose word no man relies on. He never said a > foolish thing, And never did a wise onePapers of Thomas Hearne (17 November > 1706) quoted in Doble, C. E. (editor) (1885) Remarks and Collections of > Thomas Hearne Volume 1, Oxford: Clarendon Press for the Oxford Historical > Society, p. 308 To which Charles supposedly replied, \\"That's true, for my words are my own, but my actions are those of my ministers\\".A thorough discourse concerning this epigram and the king's response can be found from the 19th to 21st paragraph of the Foreword of \\"The Tryal of William Penn and William Mead\\" Rochester's poetry displays a range of learning and influences. These included imitations of Malherbe, Ronsard, and Boileau. He also translated or adapted from classical authors such as Petronius, Lucretius, Ovid, Anacreon, Horace, and Seneca. Rochester's writings were at once admired and infamous. A Satyr Against Mankind (1675), one of the few poems he published (in a broadside in 1679), is a scathing denunciation of rationalism and optimism that contrasts human perfidy with animal wisdom. The majority of his poetry was not published under his name until after his death. Because most of his poems circulated only in manuscript form during his lifetime, it is likely that much of his writing does not survive. Burnet claimed that Rochester's conversion experience led him to ask that \\"all his profane and lewd writings\\" be burned; it is unclear how much, if any, of Rochester's writing was destroyed. Rochester was also interested in the theatre. In addition to an interest in actresses, he wrote an adaptation of Fletcher's Valentinian (1685), a scene for Sir Robert Howard's The Conquest of China, a prologue to Elkanah Settle's The Empress of Morocco (1673), and epilogues to Sir Francis Fane's Love in the Dark (1675), Charles Davenant's Circe, a Tragedy (1677). The best-known dramatic work attributed to Rochester, Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery, has never been successfully proven to be written by him. Posthumous printings of Sodom, however, gave rise to prosecutions for obscenity, and were destroyed. On 16 December 2004 one of the few surviving copies of Sodom was sold by Sotheby's for ¬£45,600. \\"[Rochester's] letters to his wife and to his friend Henry Savile‚Ä¶ show an admirable mastery of easy, colloquial prose.\\" Sir Peter Lely, Dillington House Scholarship has identified approximately 75 authentic Rochester poems. Three major critical editions of Rochester in the twentieth century have taken very different approaches to authenticating and organising his canon. David Vieth‚Äôs 1968 edition adopts a heavily biographical organisation, modernising spellings and heading the sections of his book \\"Prentice Work\\", \\"Early Maturity\\", \\"Tragic Maturity\\", and \\"Disillusionment and Death\\". Keith Walker‚Äôs 1984 edition takes a genre-based approach, returning to the older spellings and accidentals in an effort to present documents closer to those a seventeenth-century audience would have received. Harold Love‚Äôs Oxford University Press edition of 1999, now the scholarly standard, notes the variorum history conscientiously, but arranges works in genre sections ordered from the private to the public. Reception and influence Rochester was the model for a number of rake heroes in plays of the period, such as Don John in Thomas Shadwell's The Libertine (1675) and Dorimant in George Etherege's The Man of Mode (1676). Meanwhile he was eulogised by his contemporaries such as Aphra Behn and Andrew Marvell, who described him as \\"the only man in England that had the true vein of satire\\".The Project Gutenberg eBook of Andrew Marvell, by Augustine Birrell Daniel Defoe quoted him in Moll Flanders, and discussed him in other works. Daniel Defoe, The Life And Misfortunes of Moll Flanders Voltaire, who spoke of Rochester as \\"the man of genius, the great poet\\", admired his satire for its \\"energy and fire\\" and translated some lines into French to \\"display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast\\".Great Books Online, Fran√ßois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694‚Äì1778). \\"Letter XXI‚ÄîOn the Earl of Rochester and Mr. Waller\\" Letters on the English. The Harvard Classics. 1909‚Äì14, Bartleby.com, Accessed 15 May 2007 By the 1750s, Rochester's reputation suffered as the liberality of the Restoration era subsided; Samuel Johnson characterised him as a worthless and dissolute rake. Horace Walpole described him as \\"a man whom the muses were fond to inspire but ashamed to avow\\".Horace Walpole, A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England, 1758. Despite this general disdain for Rochester, William Hazlitt commented that his \\"verses cut and sparkle like diamonds\\"William Hazlitt, Select British Poets (1824) while his \\"epigrams were the bitterest, the least laboured, and the truest, that ever were written\\".William Hazlitt, Referring to Rochester's perspective, Hazlitt wrote that \\"his contempt for everything that others respect almost amounts to sublimity\\". Meanwhile, Goethe quoted A Satyr against Reason and Mankind in English in his Autobiography. Goethe quotes Rochester without attribution. Despite this, Rochester's work was largely ignored throughout the Victorian era. Rochester's reputation would not begin to revive until the 1920s. Ezra Pound, in his ABC of Reading, compared Rochester's poetry favourably to better known figures such as Alexander Pope and John Milton.Pound, Ezra. ABC of Reading (1934) New Directions (reprint). Graham Greene characterised Rochester as a \\"spoiled Puritan\\".Lord Rochester's Monkey: Being the Life of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester by Graham Greene Review by: G. S. Avery The Modern Language Review , Vol. 70, No. 4 (October 1975), pp. 857-858 Although F. R. Leavis argued that \\"Rochester is not a great poet of any kind\\", William Empson admired him. More recently, Germaine Greer has questioned the validity of the appraisal of Rochester as a drunken rake, and hailed the sensitivity of some of his lyrics.Germaine Greer reviews ‚ÄòThe Works of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester‚Äô edited by Harold Love ¬∑ LRB 16 September 1999 Rochester was listed #6 in Time Out's \\"Top 30 chart of London's most erotic writers\\". Tom Morris, the associate director, of the National Theatre said ‚ÄòRochester reminds me of an unhinged poacher, moving noiselessly through the night and shooting every convention that moves. Bishop Burnett, who coached him to an implausible death-bed repentance, said that he was unable to express any feeling without oaths and obscenities. He seemed like a punk in a frock coat. But once the straw dolls have been slain, Rochester celebrates in a sexual landscape all of his own.‚Äô In popular culture A play, The Libertine (1994), was written by Stephen Jeffreys, and staged by the Royal Court Theatre. The 2004 film The Libertine, based on Jeffreys' play, starred Johnny Depp as Rochester, Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry, John Malkovich as King Charles II and Rosamund Pike as Elizabeth Malet. Michael Nyman set to music an excerpt of Rochester's poem \\"Signor Dildo\\" for the film. The play The Ministry of Pleasure by Craig Baxter also dramatises Wilmot's life and was produced at the Latchmere Theatre, London in 2004.

Advocacy includes activities and publications to influence public policy, laws and budgets by using facts, their relationships, the media, and messaging to educate government officials and the public. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on a specific issue or specific piece of legislation. Research has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States and Canada are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action. An advocate is someone who provides advocacy support to people who need it.  Forms  There are several forms of advocacy, each representing a different approach in a way to initiate changes in the society. One of the most popular forms is social justice advocacy. The initial definition does not encompass the notions of power relations, people's participation and a vision of a just society as promoted by social justice advocates. For them, advocacy represents the series of actions taken and issues highlighted to change the ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù into a ‚Äúwhat should be‚Äù, considering that this ‚Äúwhat should be‚Äù is a more decent and a more just society (ib., 2001.) Those actions, which vary with the political, economic and social environment in which they are conducted, have several points in common (ib., 2001.) They: * Question the way policy is administered * Participate in the agenda-setting as they raise significant issues * Target political systems \\"because those systems are not responding to people's needs\\" * Are inclusive and engaging * Propose policy solutions * Open up space for public argumentation Other forms of advocacy include: * Budget advocacy: another aspect of advocacy that ensures proactive engagement of Civil Society Organizations with the government budget to make the government more accountable to the people and promote transparency. Budget advocacy also enables citizens and social action groups to compel the government to be more alert to the needs and aspirations of people in general and the deprived sections of the community. * Bureaucratic advocacy: people considered \\"experts\\" have more chance to succeed at presenting their issues to decision- makers. They use bureaucratic advocacy to influence the agenda, although at a slower pace. * Express versus issue advocacy: These two types of advocacy when grouped together usually refers to a debate in the United States whether a group is expressly making their desire known that voters should cast ballots in a particular way, or whether a group has a long-term issue that isn't campaign and election season specific. * Health advocacy: supports and promotes patients' health care rights as well as enhance community health and policy initiatives that focus on the availability, safety and quality of care. * Ideological advocacy: in this approach, groups fight, sometimes during protests, to advance their ideas in the decision-making circles. * Interest- group advocacy: lobbying is the main tool used by interest groups doing mass advocacy. It is a form of action that does not always succeed at influencing political decision-makers as it requires resources and organization to be effective. * Legislative advocacy: the \\"reliance on the state or federal legislative process\\" as part of a strategy to create change. * Mass advocacy: any type of action taken by large groups (petitions, demonstrations, etc.) * Media advocacy: \\"the strategic use of the mass media as a resource to advance a social or public policy initiative\\" (Jernigan and Wright, 1996). In Canada, for example, the Manitoba Public Insurance campaigns illustrate how media advocacy was used to fight alcohol and tobacco-related health issues. We can also consider the role of health advocacy and the media in ‚Äúthe enactment of municipal smoking bylaws in Canada between 1970 and 1995.‚Äù * Special education advocacy: advocacy with a \\"specific focus on the educational rights of students with disabilities.\\" Different contexts in which advocacy is used: * In a legal/law context: An \\"advocate\\" is the title of a specific person who is authorized/appointed in some way to speak on behalf of a person in a legal process. * In a political context: An \\"advocacy group\\" is an organized collection of people who seek to influence political decisions and policy, without seeking election to public office. * In a social care context: Both terms (and more specific ones such as \\"independent advocacy\\") are used in the UK in the context of a network of interconnected organisations and projects which seek to benefit people who are in difficulty (primarily in the context of disability and mental health). * In the context of inclusion: Citizen Advocacy organisations (or programmes) seek to cause benefit by reconnecting people who have become isolated. Their practice was defined in two key documents: CAPE, and Learning from Citizen Advocacy Programs. = Tactics = Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink have observed four types of advocacy tactics: # Information politics: quickly and credibly generating politically usable information and moving it to where it will have the most impact. # Symbolic politics: calling upon symbols, actions, or stories that make sense of a situation for an audience that is frequently far away. # Leverage politics: calling upon powerful actors to affect a situation where weaker members of a network are unlikely to have influence. # Accountability politics: efforts to hold powerful actors to their previously stated policies or principles. These tactics have been also observed within advocacy organizations outside the USA. = Aims = Advocacy in all its forms seeks to ensure that people, particularly those who are most vulnerable in society, are able to: * Have their voice heard on issues that are important to them * Defend and safeguard their rights * Have their views and wishes genuinely considered when decisions are being made about their lives # Leading a change towards a greater social justice and equality Advocacy is a process of supporting and enabling people to: * Express their views and concerns * Access information and services * Defend and promote their rights and responsibilities * Explore choices and options =Use of the Internet= Groups involved in advocacy work have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of advocacy-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, suggesting that social media are beneficial to the advocacy community. = Other examples = Advocacy activities may include conducting an exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief.  Topics  People advocate for a large number and variety of topics. Some of these are clear-cut social issues that are universally agreed to be problematic and worth solving, such as human trafficking. Others‚Äîsuch as abortion‚Äîare much more divisive and inspire strongly-held opinions on both sides. There may never be a consensus on this latter type of issues, but intense advocacy is likely to remain. In the United States, any issue of widespread debate and deeply-divided opinion can be referred to as a social issue. The Library of Congress has assembled an extensive list of social issues in the United States, ranging from vast ones like abortion to same-sex marriage to smaller ones like hacking and academic cheating. Topics that appear to involve advancing a certain positive ideal are often known as causes. A particular cause may be very expansive in nature ‚Äî for instance, increasing liberty or fixing a broken political system. For instance in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama utilized such a meaning when he said, \\"this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause.\\" Change.org and Causes are two popular websites that allow people to organize around a common cause. Topics upon which there is universal agreement that they need to be solved include, for example, human trafficking, poverty, water and sanitation as a human right. \\"Social issues\\" as referred to in the United States also include topics (also known as \\"causes\\") intended by their advocates to advance certain ideals (such as equality) include: civil rights, LGBT rights, women's rights, environmentalism, and veganism.  Transnational advocacy  Advocates and advocacy groups represent a wide range of categories and support several issues as listed on worldadvocacy.com. The Advocacy Institute, a US-based global organization, is dedicated to strengthening the capacity of political, social, and economic justice advocates to influence and change public policy. The phenomenon of globalization draws a special attention to advocacy beyond countries‚Äô borders. The core existence of networks such as World Advocacy or the Advocacy Institute demonstrates the increasing importance of transnational advocacy and international advocacy. Transnational advocacy networks are more likely to emerge around issues where external influence is necessary to ease the communication between internal groups and their own government. Groups of advocates willing to further their mission also tend to promote networks and to meet with their internal counterparts to exchange ideas. Transnational advocacy is increasingly playing a role in advocacy for migrants rights, and migrant advocacy organizations have strategically called upon governments and international organizations for leverage. Transnational advocates spend time with local interest groups in order to better understand their views and wishes.

Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of Maya civilization throughout Middle America and in the planning of the Panama railroad. Early life John Lloyd Stephens was born November 28, 1805, in the township of Shrewsbury, New Jersey.Person Detail: John Lloyd Stephens, New York State Literary Tree. Accessed December 4, 2007. He was the second son of Benjamin Stephens, a successful New Jersey merchant, and Clemence Lloyd, daughter of an eminent local judge.Harris 2006, p. 1; Hawks 1853, pp. 64‚Äì65. The following year the family moved to New York City. There Stephens received an education in the Classics at two privately tutored schools. At the age of 13 he enrolled at Columbia College, graduating at the top of his class four years later in 1822.Harris 2006, p. 1 After studying law with an attorney for a year, he attended the Litchfield Law School. He passed the bar exam after completing his course of study, and practiced in New York City. Stephens embarked on a journey through Europe in 1834, and went on to Egypt and the Levant, returning home in 1836. He later wrote several popular books about his travels and explorations. Politics He was recommended for the post of Minister to the Netherlands in 1837, but Martin Van Buren nominated Harmanus Bleecker, who served until 1842. In 1846 Stephens was a delegate to the state constitutional convention, where he was responsible for the introduction and adoption of a conciliation court (small claims court). Mesoamerican studies Stephens read with interest early accounts of ruined cities of Mesoamerica by such writers and explorers as Alexander von Humboldt and Juan Galindo. In 1839, President Martin Van Buren commissioned Stephens as Special Ambassador to Central America. While there, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America fell apart, in a civil war. He later published an account of the events he witnessed in Central America, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucat√°n. Stephens and his travelling companion, architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood first came across Maya ruins at Cop√°n, having landed in British Honduras (now Belize). They were astonished at their findings and spent two weeks mapping the site. They surmised that it must have been built by some long-forgotten people, as they could not imagine it was the native Mayans. Stephens was actually able to buy the city of Copan for a sum of $50 and had dreams of floating it down the river and into museums in the United States. They went on to Palenque, Quirigu√° and Uxmal. They reached Palenque on May 11, 1840, and left in early June. While there, they documented the Temple of the Inscriptions, the Temple of the Cross, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Foliated Cross.McNally (n.d.) They continued investigating Maya ruins with a return trip to Yucat√°n in October 1841. According to Stephens's book about the trip, they visited a total of 44 Mayan sites such as Mayapan, Uxmal, Kabah, the gateway at Labn√°, Sayil, Xtampak, Chichen Itza, Tulum, and Izamal. In Uxmal, they documented the Governor's House, the Nunnery Quadrangle and the Pyramid of the Magician. Catherwood also drew a famous view of the well at Bolonch√©n.Fabio Bourbon, The Lost Cities of the Mayas, 1999 Catherwood's drawings and lithographs showed, without question, the Maya to have been the authors of some of the most artistic and intellectual works of pre-Columbian America. Besides large constructions, they produced works of artistic refinement such as stone and plaster sculptures, frescoes, painted pottery and bas-reliefs in wood. As a result of their explorations, Stephens and Catherwood argued convincingly that the Mayans built the ancient Central American cities in contrast to the theory that ethnic groups from European or Asian civilizations had built them. Stephens's books served to inspire Edgar Allan Poe,Harris 2006, p.2. who reviewed three of Stephens's books for the New York Review and Graham's Magazine. Panama Railroad Company At the time England enjoyed a monopoly over the ocean navigation to and from the United States. Stephens obtained a charter from the state of New York, and incorporated the Ocean Steam Navigation Company. The company acquired two steam ships, the Washington and the Hermann which made journeys to Europe. When the Panama Railroad Company was founded in 1849, Stephens was chosen to be Vice President. He visited Panama and New Granada to make arrangements for the laying of the railroad. On his way to Bogot√°, the capital of New Granada, he fell off his mule and sustained severe injuries from which he never fully recovered. He returned to the United States, and was appointed President of the railroad. While in Panama, he was struck down by malaria in the spring of 1852. He recovered sufficiently to return to New York, only to have a recurrence of the disease. The Path Between the Seas, David McCullough, ¬©1977, pp 139-140 He died October 13, 1852. He was buried at New York City Marble Cemetery.

It was the principal color photography process in use before the advent of subtractive color film in the mid-1930s. Prior to the Lumiere brothers, Louis Ducos du Hauron utilized the separation technique to create colour images on paper with screen plates, producing natural colours through superimposition, which would become the foundation of all commercial colour photography.Penichon, Sylvie. Twentieth-Century Colour Photographs. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute (2013), p14. Descendants of photographer Antoine Lumiere, inventors Louis and Auguste Lumiere utilized Du Hauron's (1869) technique, which had already been improved upon by other inventors such as John Joly (1894) and James William McDonough (1896), making it possible to print photographic images in colour.Lavedrine, Bertrand and Jean-Paul Gandolfo. The Lumiere Autochrome: History, Technology, and Preservation. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute (2013), p 53. The most broadly used form of colour photography in the early twentieth century, autochrome was cherished for its aesthetic appeal and uniqueness, which have also become its most recognizable characteristics.  Structure and use  Autochrome is an additive color \\"mosaic screen plate\\" process. The medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange, green, and blue-violet (an unusual but functional variant of the standard red, green, and blue additive colors); the grains of starch act as color filters. Lampblack fills the spaces between grains, and a black-and-white panchromatic silver halide emulsion is coated on top of the filter layer. Unlike ordinary black-and-white plates, the Autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion. The use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light, parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive. Because of the light loss due to all the filtering, Autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films, which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects. The plate was reversal- processed into a positive transparency ‚Äî that is, the plate was first developed into a negative image but not \\"fixed\\", then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed, then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed, producing a positive image. The luminance filter (silver halide layer) and the mosaic chrominance filter (the colored potato starch grain layer) remained precisely aligned and were distributed together, so that light was filtered in situ. Each starch grain remained in alignment with the corresponding microscopic area of silver halide emulsion coated over it. When the finished image was viewed by transmitted light, each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter, allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain, recreating the original proportions of the three colors. At normal viewing distances, the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye, reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains.  Manufacturing techniques  To create the Autochrome color filter mosaic, a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer. The dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye. They were then spread onto the adhesive, creating a layer with approximately 4,000,000 grains per square inch but only one grain thick. The exact means by which significant gaps and overlapping grains were avoided still remains unclear. It was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion, because the grains would be flattened slightly, making them more transparent, and pressed into more intimate contact with each other, reducing wasted space between them. As it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once, a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time. Lampblack was used to block up the slight spaces that remained. The plate was then coated with shellac to protect the moisture-vulnerable grains and dyes from the water-based gelatin emulsion, which was coated onto the plate after the shellac had dried. The resulting finished plate was cut up into smaller plates of the desired size, which were packaged in boxes of four. Each plate was accompanied by a thin piece of cardboard colored black on the side facing the emulsion. This was to be retained when loading and exposing the plate and served both to protect the delicate emulsion and to inhibit halation. The 1906 U.S. patent describes the process more generally: the grains can be orange, violet, and green, or red, yellow, and blue (or \\"any number of colors\\"), optionally with black powder filling the gaps. Experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues, including the addition of screen plates, a yellow filter designed to balance the blue, and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light.Lavedrine, Bertrand and Jean-Paul Gandolfo. The Lumiere Autochrome: History, Technology, and Preservation. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute (2013), p. 85.  Viewing techniques  Because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished Autochrome image very dark overall, bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results. Stereoscopic Autochromes were especially popular, the combined color and depth proving to be a bewitching experience to early 20th Century eyes. Usually of a small size, they were most commonly viewed in a small hand-held box-type stereoscope. Larger, non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a diascope, which was a folding case with the Autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side, and a mirror framed into the other side. The user would place the diascope near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the Autochrome, and the resulting back- lit, dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror. Slide projectors, then known as magic lanterns and stereopticons, were a less common but especially effective display technique, more suitable for public exhibitions. Unfortunately, projection required an extremely bright and therefore hot light source (a carbon arc or a 500 watt bulb were typical) and could visibly \\"fry\\" the plate if continued for more than two or three minutes, causing serious damage to the color.\\"Maximum Time Limit for Leaving Color Plates in the Stereopticon\\" (article subsection). American Annual of Photography, 1931, 45:69 More than a few surviving Autochromes suffer from such \\"tanning\\" and conventional projection is not a recommended means of displaying these irreplaceable images today. However, a projector-like optical system (i.e., using condenser lenses for illumination, with a viewing lens in place of the projection lens), employing daylight (not direct sunlight) for the light source, can produce comparably excellent visual results‚Äîalthough for only one viewer at a time‚Äîwithout the unacceptable hazards of actual projection. The use of a \\"light box\\" or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing Autochromes, although now nearly universal, is unfortunate, as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation. The slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering (the effect seen through a glass of water into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed) is exacerbated, and the use of artificial light‚Äîespecially fluorescent light‚Äîupsets the color rendition of a system which the Lumi√®re Brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight. Making modern film or digital copies of Autochromes introduces other problems, because a color system based on red, green, and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange, green, and blue-violet system, providing further opportunities for color degradation. Vintage reproductions of Autochromes in old books and magazines have often been noticeably hand- adjusted by the photoengravers in an effort to compensate for some of the difficulties of reproduction, and as a result they sometimes look more like hand-colored photographs than \\"natural color\\" ones. In short, it is very difficult to form an accurate impression of the appearance of any Autochrome image without seeing the original \\"in person\\" and correctly illuminated. The lamination of the grains, varnish and emulsion makes autochrome plates susceptible to deterioration with each layer being vulnerable to changes in environment including moisture, oxidation, cracking, or flaking as well as physical damage from handling; Solutions include conservative lighting conditions, chemical free materials, medium-range humidity control of between 63 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and a well designed preservation plan.Penichon, Sylvie. Twentieth-Century Colour Photographs. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute (2013), p 61, 78.  Artistic considerations  If an Autochrome was well made and has been well preserved, color values can be very good. The dyed starch grains are somewhat coarse, giving a hazy, pointillist effect, with faint stray colors often visible, especially in open light areas such as skies. The smaller the image, the more noticeable these effects are. Autochrome has been touted as ‚Äúthe colour of dreams.‚ÄùThis term was first coined by John Wood in his book The Art of Autochrome: The Birth of Colour Photography (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1993) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images. Josef Maria Eder, History of Photography (New York: Dover Publications Inc, 1978), 639. The resulting \\"dream-like\\" impressionist quality may have been one reason behind the enduring popularity of the medium even after more starkly realistic color processes had become available. Although difficult to manufacture and relatively expensive, Autochromes were relatively easy to use and were immensely popular among enthusiastic amateur photographers, at least among those who could bear the cost and were willing to sacrifice the convenience of black and white hand-held \\"snapshooting.\\" Autochromes failed to sustain the initial interest of more serious \\"artistic\\" practitioners, largely due to their inflexibility. Not only did the need for diascopes and projectors make them extremely difficult to publicly exhibit, they allowed little in the way of the manipulation much loved by aficionados of the then-popular Pictorialist approach.  Advent of film-based versions  Autochromes continued to be produced as glass plates into the 1930s, when film-based versions were introduced, first Lumi√®re Filmcolor sheet film in 1931, then Lumicolor roll film in 1933. Although these soon completely replaced glass plate Autochromes, their triumph was short-lived, as Kodak and Agfa soon began to produce multi- layer subtractive color films (Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu respectively). Nevertheless, the Lumi√®re products had a devoted following, above all in France, and their use persisted long after modern color films had become available. The final version, Alticolor, was introduced in 1952 and discontinued in 1955, marking the end of the nearly fifty-year-long public life of the Autochrome.  Important Autochrome collections  Between 1909 and 1931, a collection of 72,000 autochrome photographs, documenting life at the time in 50 countries around the world, was created by French banker Albert Kahn. The collection, one of the biggest of its kind in the world, is housed in The Albert Kahn Museum (Mus√©e Albert-Kahn) on the outskirts of Paris. A new compilation of images from the Albert Kahn collection was published in 2008. The National Geographic Society made extensive use of autochromes and other mosaic color screen plates for over twenty years. 15,000 original Autochrome plates are still preserved in the Society's archives. The collection contains unique photographs, including numerous Autochromes from Paris by Auguste L√©on from 1925 and by W. Robert Moore from 1936 just before WWII. In the U.S. Library of Congress's huge collection of American Pictorialist photographer Arnold Genthe's work, 384 of his autochrome plates were among the holdings as of 1955.Vanderbilt, P. (compiled by), Guide to the Special Collections of Prints & Photographs in the Library of Congress, the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., 1955, page 63 The George Eastman Museum in Rochester, N.Y. has an extensive collection of early colour photography, including Louise Ducos Du Hauron's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the Lumiere brothers. Bassetlaw Museum in Retford, Nottinghamshire holds a collection of over 700 autochromes by Stephen Pegler. This includes a collection of over 100 plates purchased by the museum in 2017 thanks to the generosity of local individuals and organisations.The images cover a range of subjects from still lifes, posed studies, local people and landscapes, and his travels abroad, and were taken between 1910 and the early 1930s. The Pegler collection of autochromes is thought to be the largest collection of autochromes by one photographer in Britain today. The Royal Horticultural Society, UK has among the earliest colour photographs of plants and gardens taken by amateur photographer William Van Sommer (1859 - 1941), including of RHS Garden Wisley taken around 1913. Commercial use One of the first books published with color photography used this technique. The 12 volumes of \\"Luther Burbank: His Methods and Discoveries, Their Practical Application\\" included 1,260 color photographs and a chapter on how this process worked. In the early 1900s Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan was an experimental photographer and artist and owner of the Standiford Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. She was commissioned by Louisville artist and art patron Eleanor Belknap Humphrey to create an autochrome diascope of her two oldest children. Both the autochrome photograph of the Humphrey children and the diascope mirror viewing device, which closes into itself in a leather-bound case similar in size and appearance to a book, are well preserved and still viewable in 2015. Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan later moved her Louisville enterprise Standiford Studios to Cleveland, Ohio and it is not known if any other examples of her autochrome diascopes still exist. Vladim√≠r Jind≈ôich Bufka was a pioneer and popularizer of Autochrome in Bohemia.  Neo-Autochromists  There has been a revival of interest in the process by some, including a few groups in France working with original Lumiere machinery and notes. One such recreation is a series of images from 2008 by the French photographer Fr√©d√©ric Mocellin.  In popular culture  *The 2006 film The Illusionist tried to recreate the look of Autochrome, although apparently basing that \\"look\\" on published reproductions rather than on actual Autochrome plates. *Modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a Bayer filter, which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an Autochrome plate‚Äîby breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements. In physical arrangement, however, the Bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the Autochrome era, such as the Paget and Finlay plates.

Musashi strove for as great a mastery in Japanese calligraphy as in swordsmanship. is a text on kenjutsu and the martial arts in general, written by the Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi around 1643. There have been various translations made over the years, and it enjoys an audience considerably broader than only that of martial artists and people across East Asia: for instance, some foreign business leaders find its discussion of conflict and taking the advantage to be relevant to their work in a business context. The modern-day Hy≈çh≈ç Niten Ichi-ry≈´ employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy. Musashi establishes a \\"no-nonsense\\" theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one's opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on- one duel or a massive battle. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to \\"investigate this thoroughly\\" through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading. Miyamoto Musashi in his prime, wielding two bokken. Musashi describes and advocates a two-sword fencing style (nit≈çjutsu): that is, wielding both katana and wakizashi, contrary to the more traditional method of wielding the katana two-handed. However, he only explicitly describes wielding two swords in a section on fighting against many adversaries. The stories of his many duels rarely refer to Musashi himself wielding two swords, although, since they are mostly oral traditions, their details may be inaccurate. Musashi states within the volume that one should train with a long sword in each hand, thereby training the body and improving one's ability to use two blades simultaneously.  The five books  right Miyamoto Musashi killing a giant creature, from The Book of Five Rings Although it is difficult to grasp it from the book, Go Rin No Sho, these books are actually the teachings which Musashi preached to his students in his own d≈çj≈ç. Though ideas are taken from other sources, the text is predominantly seminal. The five \\"books\\" refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle, just as there are different physical elements in life, as described by Buddhism, Shinto, and other Eastern religions. The five books below are Musashi's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements. The term \\"Ichi School\\" is referred to in the book, Go Rin No Sho. When referring to such books, it refers to \\"Niten No Ichi Ryu\\" or \\"Ni Ten Ichi Ryu\\", which literally translates to, \\"Two heaven, one school\\". Alternative translations include \\"Two Swords, One spirit\\", and \\"Two Swords, One Entity\\". The translation, \\"Two Swords, one Dragon\\" was thought to be a misinterpretation of the Kanji word Ryu. * The Book of Earth chapter serves as an introduction, and metaphorically discusses martial arts, leadership, and training as building a house. * The Book of Water chapter describes Musashi's style, Ni-ten ichi-ryu, or \\"Two Heavens, One Style\\". It describes some basic technique and fundamental principles. * The Book of Fire chapter refers to the heat of battle, and discusses matters such as different types of timing. * The Book of Wind chapter is something of a pun, since the Japanese character can mean both \\"wind\\" and \\"style\\" (e.g., of martial arts). It discusses what Musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting. * The Book of the Void chapter is a short epilogue, describing, in more esoteric terms, Musashi's probably Zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset. = The Book of EarthA Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi (translation from Japanese by Victor Harris), London: Allison and Busby, 1974. = The Earth book, according to \\"Go Rin No Sho\\", is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by Musashi at the Ichi School. It is said to be how to distinguish the Way through \\"Sword-Fencing\\", or \\"Swordsmanship\\". The idea of strategy would be encouraged to be very astute in their study and strategy: > Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and > the deepest things. As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground > ... These things cannot be explained in detail. From one thing, know ten > thousand things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one > thing you cannot see. You must study hard. Upon their mastery of the strategy and timing listed in the five books, Musashi states that you will be able to defeat ten men as easily as you could defeat one, and asks: \\"When you have reached this point, will it not mean that you are invincible?\\" The strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics, such as indoor weapons. Musashi states that the use of glaive-like naginata and spears are purely for the field, whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments, such as on horseback or in fierce battle. Musashi also remarks on the gun as having no equal on the battlefield, until swords clash, when it becomes useless. He does note that the gun had the disadvantage of being unable to see a bullet and adjust aim as one would with a bow. He writes, \\"The bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle, especially battles on a moor, as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen. However, it is unsatisfactory in sieges, or when the enemy is more than forty yards away. For this reason there are nowadays few traditional schools of archery. There is little use for this kind of skill.\\" One of the principles of the Niten Ichi-ry≈´ is that one should be versed in many weaponry skills. Musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon‚Äîthis is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon. Timing, as explained by Musashi, is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the Earth Book. The idea of timing as explained within the Earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill, in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack. In The Book of Five Rings he writes on timing: > \\"Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in > rhythm only if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the > military arts, shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and > abilities there is timing.... There is timing in the whole life of the > warrior, in his thriving and declining, in his harmony and discord. > Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and fall > of capital. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to > discern this. In strategy there are various timing considerations. From the > outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and > from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the > relevant timing, first seeing the distance timing and the background timing. > This is the main thing in strategy. It is especially important to know the > background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.\\" The Book of Earth ends with nine basic principles -- the \\"ground\\" upon which the samurai must rely. These are \\"practical\\" or \\"worldly,\\" each intended to help develop an understanding of strategy (while the other books focus on tactics and movement). These rules are for his students, and are complemented by the 21 \\"spiritual principles\\" for all to follow, which are found in the Dokk≈çd≈ç (Musashi's final work). 1\\\\. Do not think dishonestly. 2\\\\. The Way is in training. 3\\\\. Become acquainted with every art. 4\\\\. Know the Ways of all professions 5\\\\. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters. 6\\\\. Develop an intuitive judgement and understanding for everything. 7\\\\. Perceive those things which cannot be seen. 8\\\\. Pay attention even to trifles. 9\\\\. Do nothing which is of no use. = The Book of Water = The water book concerns strategy, spirituality and philosophy. The meaning of water in relation to life is flexibility. Water demonstrates natural flexibility as it changes to conform with the boundaries which contain it, seeking the most efficient and productive path. So also should one possess the ability to change in accordance with one‚Äôs own situation to easily shift between disciplines, methods, and options when presented with new information. A person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility. The spiritual bearing in strategy, which Musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of, or in formulation of a battle. Being a buddhist, most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness, tranquility and spiritual balance; > In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. > Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm. This balance refers to what could be thought of as yin and yang within yourself. The over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by Musashi, as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy. The idea is that a perfectly balanced spirit is also a perfectly balanced physical presence, and neither creates weakness nor reveals it to your enemy. During battle, the spirituality and balance is something of which Musashi notes that you should take advantage. Since small people know the spirituality of big people, they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other. This is something which seems easy, but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield, as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you, and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly. Just as your spirit should be balanced, your various techniques be honed to a perfectly balanced demeanor. In terms of stance, much like balance within the trooper, Musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy, or battle: Adopt a stance with the head erect, neither hanging down, nor looking up, nor twisted. This is part of what Musashi notes as wedging in. In regards to the gaze of someone, he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably, which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect. He notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy, as well as being able to see things which are close to you, such as the technique of an enemy. It is also used to perceive things far away, such as arriving troops or enemies, as that is the precursor to battle. You can then change your actions according to what you see.  Attitudes of swordsmanship  # Upper # Middle # Lower # Right Side # Left Side The five attitudes of swordsmanship are referred to as the five classifications of areas for attack on the human body. These are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy, and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where, for any reason, you should not be able to strike them. Then his mind should adjust accordingly. > Your attitude should be large or small according to the situation. Upper, > Lower and Middle attitudes are decisive. Left Side and Right Side attitudes > are fluid. Left and Right attitudes should be used if there is an > obstruction overhead or to one side. The decision to use Left or Right > depends on the place. As each is thought of as an attitude, it could be thought of that Musashi means to practice with each \\"attitude\\" so that you do not become over-reliant upon one, something which Musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique. \\"No Attitude\\" refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the \\"Five Attitudes\\" and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique, as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes. This is similar to taking chances as opposed to making chances. The attitude of \\"Existing - Non Existing\\", mixes the Five Attitudes with the Attitude of \\"No Attitude\\", meaning that the user of the longsword uses the techniques and principles of both at whichever moment he or she finds most opportune. \\"In-One Timing\\" refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies' defense, to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy. Although this is said to be difficult, Musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses. It is rumored that Musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken, but there are no descriptions mentioning \\"In one\\" timing. \\"Abdomen Timing of Two\\" refers to feinting an attack, then striking an enemy as they are retreating from the attack, hitting them in the abdomen with the correct timing of either two moves or two seconds. Although the technique seems relatively simple, Musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly. \\"No Design, No Conception\\" refers to When word and actions are spontaneously the same. Aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning, the technique is relatively simple to explain: if you are in a deadlock with the enemy, using the force from the cut, you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the Void Book to knock the enemy over. > This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must > train hard to understand it. \\"Flowing Water Cut\\" technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship. When attacking fast, Musashi notes that you will always be at stalemate, so like Stagnant water, you must cut as slowly as possible with your long sword. At the beginning of this technique you and your opponent will be searching for an opening within each other's defense. When your opponent either tries to push off your sword, or to hasten back as to disengage it, you must first expand your whole body and your mind. By moving your body first and then that of your sword, you will be able to strike powerfully and broadly with a movement that seems to reflect the natural flow of water. Ease and confidence will be attained when this technique is continuously practiced upon. \\"Continuous Cut\\" refers to when you are again faced with stalemate within a duel, where your swords are clasped together. In one motion, when your sword springs away from theirs, Musashi says to use a continuous motion to slash their head, body, and legs. \\"Fire and Stone's Cut\\" refers to when your swords clash together. Without raising your sword, you cut as strongly as possible. This means cutting quickly with hands, body, and legs. \\"Red Leaves Cut\\" refers to knocking down the enemy's long sword in the spirit of the \\"No Design, No Conception\\" cut. = The Book of Fire = The Fire Book refers to fighting methods unlike the specific fighting techniques listed in the Water Book. It goes into a broader scope in terms of hints as to assess a situation, as well as specific situational instructions. He notes obvious advantages of armor and preparedness before a duel or battle as it applies to one man or a whole group of men: > As one man can defeat ten men, so can one thousand men defeat ten thousand. > However, you can become a master of strategy by training alone with a sword, > so that you can understand the enemy's stratagems, his strength and > resources, and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to beat ten thousand > enemies. The dependence of location according to the Go Rin No Sho is crucial. You must be in a place where man-made objects such as buildings, towers, castles, and such do not obstruct your view, as well as facing or standing in a position where the sun or moon does not affect your vision. This is purely so that your vision is focused on nothing but the enemy, and thus there is more concentration upon the enemy's stratagems. Musashi also seems to note the age old strategy of the High Ground: > You must look down on the enemy, and take up your attitude on slightly > higher places. Other kinds of tactics which of Musashi tells are way of ensuring that the enemy is at a disadvantage. Forcing yourself on the non-dominant side of a trooper is one way because the left side is difficult for a right-handed soldier. Other disadvantages, such as forcing enemies into footholds, swamps, ditches, and other difficult terrain, force the enemy to be uncertain of his situation. > These things cannot be clearly explained in words. You must research what is > written here. In these three ways of forestalling, you must judge the > situation. This does not mean that you always attack first; but if the enemy > attacks first you can lead him around. In strategy, you have effectively won > when you forestall the enemy, so you must train well to attain this. Ken No Sen (Attacking) is the most obvious method of forestalling an enemy because a head-on collision forces both parties to a standstill. Although it is not mentioned, Musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper. As the name suggests, Tai No Sen (Waiting for the Initiative) is invented for very opportunistic and decided battles between parties. The main idea being to feign weakness as to open a weak spot, or Achilles' heel, in the opposing force, and then regrouping to exploit such a hole by attacking deep within the enemy's party. Although it is not mentioned, this would most likely be to kill the officer of the highest rank as an attempt to remove the tactical centre of a group of soldiers. A method particularly useful for Musashi or others, if attacking a general directly would signal the end of the battle upon his defeat. Only a small amount of text is written about Tai Tai No Sen (Accompanying and Forestalling). Albeit very confusing, the idea of Tai Tai No Sen is circumventing an ambush or quick attack from the enemy by taking the initiative and attacking in full force. Musashi admits himself that this is a difficult thing to explain. Although there are other methods, they are mostly situational methods relating to the crossing of rough terrain, and battling within such rough terrain. Although it spreads over two or more paragraphs, most information is common sense, relating to caution and avoidance of such situations. The idea of timing, as with singular battles, is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants. However, the type of timing in this instance is somewhat different from the timing noted in The Ground Book since this variety of timing requires looking at the various physical factors which affect an enemy during battle, such as determining if strength is waning or rising within a group of troopers. The idea of treading down the sword is a very simple technique. Squashing an enemy's attack before it starts by using a form of charging and then attacking under the veil of gunpowder smoke, and arrow fire, the initial attacks used when starting battles can be highly effective. Individually, it refers to attacking the enemy's sword, breaking it, removing it from play, and a technique of controlling it through direct blade on blade contact. Just as Musashi mentions in his philosophical style, there is a cause for a collapse. As there is collapse within an enemy, such as waning in his numbers, Musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage. He notes that an enemy's formation can fall if they lose rhythm. It was known that in such battles, drummers drummed a tune for their other fellow soldiers to march to; and, if the rhythm was lost, it led to a \\"collapse when their rhythm becomes deranged\\". = The Book of Wind = Whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today, this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time. The broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding your own way is to understand the way of your opponent as precisely as possible. Musashi notes that although most schools have secret and ancient strategies, most forms are derivative of other martial arts. Their similarities and differences evolved through situational factors, such as indoor or outdoor dueling, and the style adapted to the school. He indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own, and, in a way, he does not see parallels to his own creation and work. However, he still admits that without basic understanding of these alternate techniques, you will not be able to learn Ni Ten Ichi Ryu, probably for reasons of finding the wrongs in other techniques, and righting them within yourself in Ni Ten Ichi Ryu. The main difference that Musashi notes between the Ichi School and other strategists and schools is that other schools do not teach the \\"broader\\" meaning of strategy. There is a strategy above sword-fencing: \\"Some of the world's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing, and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body.\\" The book has many paragraphs on the subject of other schools' techniques, and much of the text lists the ways that other schools do not conform to the ideals which he himself writes about in the Book of Five Rings, such as footwork, sight, and over-reliance or over-familiarity with a weapon. = The Book of Void = Although short, the void book lists, philosophically, the nature of both human knowledge and other things. The void book expressly deals with \\"That which cannot be seen\\". > \\"By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist.\\" The Book of Nothing, according to Musashi, is the true meaning of the strategy of Ni Ten Ichi Ryu. It seems very esoteric in nature because he emphasizes that you must learn to perceive that which you cannot understand or comprehend. He notes that in this Void, what can be comprehended are things which we do and see, such as the way of the warrior, martial arts, and Ni Ten Ichi Ryu. At the same time, in the Void, things we do not do or see (which he calls Spirit) are part of the information which we perceive on a conscious level, but with which we have no physical relationship. It is arguable whether Musashi is referring to religious spirituality or if he is actually explaining a way to live a life and to process thoughts. > \\"In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has > existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.\\" In the above quote, Musashi speaks of \\"virtue and no evil\\". This may mean \\"goodness and banishment of evil\\" or \\"purpose and non-existence of good and evil\\", and the exact meaning is open to debate. Since Musashi is drawing upon classical Buddhist Five Element theory, Void in this case refers to Sunyata (in Pali), sometimes translated as \\"Emptiness,\\" or \\"ether.\\" Void, as such, is also empty of the sense of self (anatta), good and evil, wanting and non- wanting, and is the spiritual dynamic that forms the jumping off point to satori, enlightenment. Emptiness, and the establishing of the conditions that allow it to arise, is a common theme in Zen Buddhist meditation practice, which no doubt informed the perspective of the author.  Philosophical methods = Strike of Non-Thought = Your mind and body should be one with striking when you and your adversary are about to launch an attack. If this method is followed, your hand will attain movement through emptiness, with speed and power, without taking note of any point in which movement had begun. = Crimson-Leaves Strike = With this method, you will cause your adversary's sword to drop through a strike from your sword, then bring yourself immediately back to a readiness to strike. This method is combined with 'The Strike of Nonthought', in which you will always strike with true force by swinging your sword toward the ground when your opponent's sword is about to drop. = Blow Like a Spark from a Stone = If you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent's swords are to clash, you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent. This is The Blow Like a Spark from a Stone technique. If you are to perform this technique, you must first strike quickly with the three combined forces of your legs, your hands, and your body. This blow will be rather difficult to perform if you do not train at it frequently. If you diligently train yourself, you will be able to increase the overall force of the technique's impact. = Chance-Opening Blow = When you first start off by striking, your opponent will try to parry by hitting or by blocking your sword. At this point in time, you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword, and strike whenever you may see an opening, whether it may be the legs, arms, or head. Following the single way of the sword and performing a strike such as this is known as the Chance-Opening Blow. This technique will be useful at a moment while fighting, so it should be trained for, regularly. = Autumn Monkey's Body = With this method, you are to start off by assuming a posture in which you are not to use your hands. You are to think of getting your body close to your opponent before striking him. However, if you think of reaching out both of your hands, your body will remain distant. This is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy. When you are distant, you will exchange blows of the sword, and it will be rather easy to move closer to your opponent (Thomas Cleary translates this technique as \\"Body of the Short-Armed Monkey\\".) = Body of Lacquer and Paste = With this technique, one's objective is to get close to the opponent and stick to him. When one is to do this, one must first behave as though one had been strongly glued to him with one's feet, head, and body. It is generally known that during combat, most fighters will have a tendency to have their body hang back while their heads and feet are extended forward. One must attempt to paste one's body against the opponent's without leaving any area in which the bodies are not touching.

Still has been credited with laying the groundwork for the movement, as his shift from representational to abstract painting occurred between 1938 and 1942, earlier than his colleagues like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, who continued to paint in figurative- surrealist styles well into the 1940s. Biography Still was born in 1904 in Grandin, North Dakota and spent his childhood in Spokane, Washington and Bow Island in southern Alberta, Canada. In 1925 he visited New York, briefly studying at the Art Students League. He attended Spokane University from 1926 to 1927 and returned in 1931 with a fellowship, graduating in 1933. That fall, he became a teaching fellow, then faculty member at Washington State College (now Washington State University), where he obtained his Master of Fine Arts degree in 1935 and taught until 1941. He spent the summers of 1934 and 1935 at the Trask Foundation (now Yaddo) in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1937, along with Washington State colleague Worth Griffin, Still co-founded the Nespelem Art Colony that produced hundreds of portraits and landscapes depicting Colville Indian Reservation Native American life over the course of four summers.http://www.washingtonhistory.org/files/library/fall-2003-creighton.pdf In 1941 Still relocated to the San Francisco Bay area where he worked in various war industries while pursuing painting. He had his first solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) in 1943. He taught at the Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), now Virginia Commonwealth University, from 1943 to 1945, then went to New York City. Mark Rothko, whom Still had met in California in 1943, introduced him to Peggy Guggenheim, who gave him a solo exhibition at her gallery, The Art of This Century Gallery, in early 1946. The following year Guggenheim closed her gallery and Still, along with Rothko and other Abstract Expressionists, joined the Betty Parsons gallery. Still returned to San Francisco, where he became a highly influential professor at the California School of Fine Arts (now San Francisco Art Institute), teaching there from 1946 to 1950.Clyfford Still, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1976, p.112 In 1950, he moved to New York City, where he lived most the decade,Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 654. the height of Abstract Expressionism, but also a time when he became increasingly critical of the art world. In the early 1950s, Still severed ties with commercial galleries. In 1961 he moved to a 22-acre farm near Westminster, Maryland, removing himself further from the art world.Maryland SDAT listing for Still Farm property http://sdatcert3.resiusa.org/rp_rewrite/details.aspx?AccountNumber=07%20032161%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&County;=07&SearchType;=STREET retrieved 4 April 2013 Still used a barn on the property as a studio during the warm weather months.

In 1957, Still married Patricia Alice Garske, who had been one of his students at Washington State and was sixteen years his junior. Paintings Clyfford Still, 1957-D No. 1, 1957, oil on canvas, 113 √ó 159 in, Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York Still is considered one of the foremost Color Field painters ‚Äì his non-figurative paintings are non-objective, and largely concerned with juxtaposing different colors and surfaces in a variety of formations. Unlike Mark Rothko or Barnett Newman, who organized their colors in a relatively simple way (Rothko in the form of nebulous rectangles, Newman in thin lines on vast fields of color), Still's arrangements are less regular. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been \\"torn\\" off the painting, revealing the colors underneath. Another point of departure with Newman and Rothko is the way the paint is laid on the canvas; while Rothko and Newman used fairly flat colors and relatively thin paint, Still uses a thick impasto, causing subtle variety and shades that shimmer across the painting surfaces. His large mature works recall natural forms and natural phenomena at their most intense and mysterious; ancient stalagmites, caverns, foliage, seen both in darkness and in light lend poetic richness and depth to his work. By 1947, he had begun working in the format that he would intensify and refine throughout the rest of his career ‚Äì a large-scale color field applied with palette knives.Clyfford Still, 1948 (1948) Guggenheim Collection. Among Still's well known paintings is 1957-D No. 1, 1957 (right), which is mainly black and yellow with patches of white and a small amount of red. These four colors, and variations on them (purples, dark blues) are predominant in his work, although there is a tendency for his paintings to use darker shades. Exhibitions In 1943, Still's first solo show took place at the San Francisco Museum of Art. In 1947, Jermayne MacAgy, Assistant Director of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, gave him a solo show there. The artist then declined all public exhibitions from 1952 to 1959.Clyfford Still Tate Collection. A first comprehensive Still retrospective took place at the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, in 1959. Later solo exhibitions of Still's paintings were presented by the Institute of Contemporary Art of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1963 and at the Marlborough-Gerson gallery, New York, in 1969 to 1970. In 1975, a permanent installation of a group of his works opened at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.Clyfford Still Guggenheim Collection. In 1979, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the largest survey of Still's art to date and the largest presentation afforded by this institution to the work of a living artist. Awards Still received the Award of Merit for Painting in 1972 from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he became a member in 1978, and the Skowhegan Medal for Painting in 1975. Estate Still wrote a will in 1978 that left a portion of his work, along with his archives, to his wife Patricia and stated: \\"I give and bequeath all the remaining works of art executed by me in my collection to an American city that will agree to build or assign and maintain permanent quarters exclusively for these works of art and assure their physical survival with the explicit requirement that none of these works of art will be sold, given, or exchanged but are to be retained in the place described above exclusively assigned to them in perpetuity for exhibition and study.\\" After Still's death in 1980, the Still collection of approximately 2,400 works was sealed off completely from public and scholarly access for more than two decades. Clyfford Still Museum Clyfford Still Museum, Denver, Colorado In August 2004, the City of Denver, Colorado announced it had been chosen by Patricia Still to receive the artworks contained within the Clyfford Still Estate (roughly 825 paintings on canvas and 1575 works on paper ‚Äì drawings and limited-edition fine-art prints). The Clyfford Still Museum, an independent nonprofit organization, opened under the directorship of Dean Sobel in November 2011. The museum also houses the complete Still archives of sketchbooks, journals, notebooks, the artist's library, and other archival materials, inherited upon Patricia Still's death in 2005. The building was designed by Allied Works Architecture, led by Brad Cloepfil. The museum is recognized as a successful implementation of contemporary architecture and an icon for the city of Denver. From January 24 to April 17, 2016, the Denver Art Museum hosted a temporary exhibit called \\"Case Work\\", which showcased the design process used for this museum and other major works by Allied and Cloepfil.Allied Works Architecture (2016). Case Work Premieres at the Denver Art Museum After Denver, the exhibit was planned to show at the Portland Art Museum and then embark on a two-year international tour.Denver Art Museum (2016). Case Work: Studies in Form, Space & Construction by Brad Cloepfil / Allied Works Architecture, through April 17, 2016. In March 2011, a Maryland court with jurisdiction over Patricia Still's estate ruled that four of Still's works could be sold before they officially became part of the museum's collection. In November 2011, Sotheby's in New York sold the four works; PH-351 (1940) for US$1.2 million, 1947-Y-No. 2 (1947) for US$31.4 million, 1949-A-No. 1 (1949) for US$61.7 million and PH-1033 (1976) for US$19.6 million. The proceeds from the sales, US$114 million, went to the Clyfford Still Museum \\"to support its endowment and collection-related expenses.\\" In the decade prior to the sale, only 11 of Still's works came up at auction. In December 2011, a visitor to the museum was accused of causing $10,000 worth of damage to Still's 1957-J no.2 oil painting. In 2013, the Clyfford Still Museum Research Center was launched. Its aim is to explore the period of art and history in which the abstract painter worked. Plans include a fellowship program, cross-disciplinary scholarly publications, and research symposia.Pobric, Pac (October 30, 2013), Clyfford Still Museum opens research centre The Art Newspaper.

The adherents of the Mu øtazili school, known as Mu øtazilites, are best known for rejecting the doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God,Abdullah Saeed. The Qur'an: an introduction. 2008, page 203 asserting that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically \\"must have preceded his own speech\\". The philosophical speculation of the Mu øtazilites centre on the concepts of divine justice (Al-'adl) and divine unity (Tawhid). The school worked to resolve the theological \\"problem of evil\\": how to reconcile the justice of an all-powerful God with the reality of evil in the world, in accordance to the guidance of the Quran. Mu'tazilites reasoned that, since God is believed to be just and wise, and since he cannot command what is contrary to reason or act with disregard for the welfare of His creatures, evil must be regarded as something that stems from errors in human acts, arising from man's divinely bestowed free will.Al-Shahrastani, al-Milal, p.31 fAl-Baghdadi, Usul al Din, pp.150f Mu øtazilites believe that good and evil are not always determined by revealed scripture or interpretation of scripture, but they are rational categories that could be \\"established through unaided reason\\";Al-Baghdadi, A.Q.,Usul al Din, Istanbul, 1928, pp.26fAl-Shahrastani, M.,al-Milal wa'l-Nihal, London, 1892, p.31al-Ash'ari, Maqalat, p.356 because knowledge is derived from reason; reason, alongside scripture, was the \\"final arbiter\\" in distinguishing right from wrong.Oussama Arabi. Studies in Modern Islamic Law and Jurisprudence. page 27‚Äì28 This part alone made them the enemy of those who follow the Hadith (by far the majority of Muslims today, including all Sunni and Shia sects). The Mu øtazili school of Kalam considered the injunctions of God to be accessible to rational thought and inquiry and that reason, not \\"sacred precedent\\", is the effective means to determine what is just and religiously obligatory. The movement reached its political height during the Abbasid Caliphate during the mihna, the period of religious persecution instituted by the 'Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun in AD 833 in which religious scholars (such as Sunnis and Shias) were punished, imprisoned, or even killed unless they conformed to Mu øtazila doctrine. The policy lasted for fifteen years (833‚Äì848 CE) as it continued through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors, al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq, and two years of al-Mutawakkil who reversed it in 848 (or possibly 851). The school of thought also flourished under Aghlabid rule in the Maghreb.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25203138 In contemporary Salafi jihadism, the epithet or supposed allegations of being a Mu øtazilite have sometimes been used between rival groups as a means of denouncing their credibility.The North African \\"Institute for the Faith Brigades\\" denounced Bin Laden's \\"misguided errors\\" and accused Abu Hafs al Mawritani, a leading figure in Al-Qaeda's juridicial committee, of being a Mu øtazilite.

Assaf Moghadam, Brian Fishman, Publisher Taylor & Francis, 2011, page 81, , 9781136710582 Name The name Mu øtazili is derived from the reflexive stem VIII (ifta øala) of the triconsonantal root ÿπ-ÿ≤-ŸÑ \\"separate, segregate\\", as in i øtazala \\"to separate (oneself); to withdraw from\\".For example, Quran 18:16, 19:48 and 4:90). According to Sarah Siroumsa, \\"The verb i'tazala means \\"to withdraw\\", and in its most common use, as given in the dictionaries and attested in Hadith literature, it denotes some sort of abstinence from sexual activity, from worldly pleasures, or, more generally, from sin. Ibn Manzur, Lisan al-'Arab, s.v oy.':/ : wensirck, Concordance a indices de la tradition musulmatle, vol Iv, p. 11)7. 'Amr taught his followers to be \\"the party which abstains\\" (i.e., from evil: al-firqa al-mu øtazila), asceticism was their most striking characteristic. They were given the name \\"Mu'tazila\\" in reference to their pious asceticism, and they were content with this name,\\" http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~stroums/files/MuTazila_Reconsidered.pdf The name is derived from the founder's \\"withdrawal\\" from the study circle of Hasan al- Basra over a theological disagreement: WƒÅ·π£il ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ' asked about the legal state of a sinner: is a person who has committed a serious sin a believer or an unbeliever? Hasan answered the person remains a Muslim. Wasil dissented, suggesting that a sinner was neither a believer nor an unbeliever and withdrew from the study circle. Others followed to form a new circle, including  øAmr ibn  øUbayd. Hasan's remark, \\"WƒÅ·π£il has withdrawn from us\\", is said to be the origin of the movement's name. The group later referred to themselves as Ahl al-Taw·∏•ƒ´d wa l- øAdl (, \\"people of monotheism and justice\\", and the name mu øtazili was first used by its opponents. The verb i øtizal is also used to designate a neutral party in a dispute (as in \\"withdrawing\\" from a dispute between two factions). According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"The name [Mutazilah] first appears in early IslƒÅmic history in the dispute over  øAlƒ´'s leadership of the Muslim community after the murder of the third caliph,  øUthmƒÅn (656). Those who would neither condemn nor sanction  øAlƒ´ or his opponents but took a middle position were termed the Mu øtazilah.\\" Nallino (1916) argued that the theological Mu'tazilism of Wasil and his successors was merely a continuation of this initial political Mu'tazilism.Mutazilah at the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed 13 March 2014. Some of the Companions of Muhammad such as Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdullah ibn Umar were neutral in the dispute between  øAlƒ´ and his opponents (Muawiyah I). Encyclopaedia of Islam s.v. \\"Mu'tazila\\", Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands (1999): \\"It is an explanation of this kind which today, in particular as a result of the studies undertaken by Nallino (\\"Sull'origine del nome dei Mu'taziliti\\", in RSO, vii [1916]), is generally accepted: i'tizal would designate a position of neutrality in the face of opposing factions. Nallino drew support for the argument from the fact that at the time of the first civil war, some of the Companions ('Abd Allah b. 'Umar, Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas, etc.), who had chosen to side neither with  øAli nor with his adversaries, were for that reason called mu øtazila. He even drew the conclusion that the theological Mu'tazilism of Wasil and his successors was merely a continuation of this initial political Mu'tazilism; in reality, there does not seem to have been the least connection between one and the other. But, in its principle, this explanation is probably valid.\\" History=Origin= According to Sunni sources, Mu øtazili theology originated in the eighth century in Basra (now in Iraq) when WƒÅ·π£il ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ' (d. 131 AH/748 AD) left the teaching lessons of Hasan al-Basri after a theological dispute regarding the issue of al-Manzilah bayna al-Manzilatayn (a position between two positions). Though Mu øtazilis later relied on logic and different aspects of early Islamic philosophy, ancient Greek philosophy, and Indian philosophy, the basics of Islam were their starting point and ultimate reference. The accusations leveled against them by rival schools of theology that they gave absolute authority to extra-Islamic paradigms reflect more the fierce polemics between various schools of theology than any objective reality. For instance, Mu øtazilis adopted unanimously the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, contrary to certain Muslim philosophers who, with the exception of al-Kindi, believed in the eternity of the world in some form or another. ;Ahl al-kalƒÅm Scholar Daniel Brown describes the Mu øtazili as \\"the later ahl al-kalƒÅm\\", suggesting the ahl al-kalƒÅm were forerunners of the Mu øtazili.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.15 The ahl al-kalƒÅm are remembered in Islamic history as opponents of Al-Shafi‚Äòi and his principle that the final authority of Islam was the hadith of Muhammad,Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.13-15 so that even the Qur'an was \\"to be interpreted in the light of [the hadith], and not vice versa.\\"J. SCHACHT, An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964), supra note 5, at 47 Ahl al-kalƒÅm argued to the contrary, that the book of God was an explanation of everything (), and that verses in the Qur'an ordering Muslims to obey the Messenger meant that Muslims should obey the Qur'an, which God had revealed through Muhammad.Musa, ibid, pp.36‚Äì37; taken from Abdur Rab, ibid, p. 199. =Historical development= Abu al-Hudhayl al-'Allaf (d. 235 AH/849 AD), who came a couple of generations after WƒÅ·π£il ibn  øAtƒÅ æ (ŸàÿßÿµŸÑ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ∑ÿßÿ°) and  øAmr ibn  øUbayd, is considered the theologian who systematized and formalized Mu øtazilism in Basra. Another branch of the school found a home in Baghdad under the direction of Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir (d. 210 AH/825 AD); the instigators thought it was the Caliph's own scheme: under Ma\`mun the Great (813-833), \\"Mu øtazilism became the established faith.‚Äù The first Caliph however to adopt the principles of the Mu‚Äôtazilite doctrine was the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid II.https://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/download/8399/8037 The Mu øtazilites maintained man's creatingAdamson, Peter. \\"Al-Kindi and Mu'tazila: Divine Attributes, Creation and Freedom.\\" Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 1 (2003): 45-77. free will, as did the Qadarites of the later Omayyad period. The Mu øtazilites also maintained that justice and reason must form the foundation of the action God takes toward men. Both of these doctrines were repudiated by the later orthodox school of the Ash øarites.\\"William Thomson, \\"The Moslem World\\", in William L. Langer (1948), ed., An Encyclopedia of World History, rev. edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p.189. The persecution campaign, nonetheless, cost them their theology and generally, the sympathy of the Muslim masses. As the number of Muslims increased throughout the Islamic empire, and in reaction to the excesses of this newly imposed rationalism, theologians began to lose ground. The problem was exacerbated by the Mihna, the inquisition launched under the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (d. 218 AH/833 AD). Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the Sunni jurist and founder of the Hanbali school of thought was a victim of Ma'mun's Mihna. Due to his rejection of Ma'mun's demand to accept and propagate the Mu øtazila creed, ibn Hanbal was imprisoned and tortured by the Abbasid rulers. Under Caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861), \\"who sought to reestablish the traditional Moslem faith\\" (intentionally wanted to restore his legitimacy due to backlash towards Ahmad Ibn Hanbal's persecution under previous Caliphs), Mu øtazilite doctrines were repudiated; their professors persecuted; Shias, Christians and Jews were also persecuted.\\"William Thomson, \\"The Moslem World\\", in William L. Langer (1948), ed., An Encyclopedia of World History, rev. edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 189. =Mu øtazilism today= Today, Mu‚Äòtazilism persists mainly in the Maghreb among those who call themselves the Wasiliyah, referencing Wasil ibn ‚ÄòAta the reputed founder of Mu‚Äòtazila, the movement uses the mantle of the Mu‚Äòtazila primarily as an identity marker. Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) was one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism that contributed to a revival of Mu øtazilite thought, although he does not seem to have called himself a Mu øtazilite. After he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt in 1899, he attempted to adapt Islam to the modern times and to introduce changes in its teaching, in particular at Al-Azhar University. His reforms met with much opposition from the traditional establishment but, even though his immediate successors, such as Rashid Rida (1865-1935), did not follow in his steps, he was a source of inspiration for later modernist and reformist scholars and philosophers such as Fazlur Rahman (1919-1988), Farid Esack (born 1959), and in particular Harun Nasution (1919-1998) and Nasr Abu Zayd (1943-2010), who openly espoused Mu øtazilite views. The Association for the Renaissance of Mu'tazilite Islam (, ARIM) was founded in France in February 2017. Beliefs=The Five Principles= According to a \\"leading Mu øtazilite authority\\" of the end of the ninth century (Al-Khayyat), and \\"clearly enunciated for the first time by Abu al-Hudhayl\\", five basic tenets make up the Mu'tazilite creed: #monotheism, #justice and unity, #the inevitability of the threats and promises of God (or \\"the warning and the promise\\"), #the intermediary position (i.e. Muslims who die without repentance after committing a grave sin are neither mu'mineen (believers), nor kuffar (non-believers), but in an intermediate position), #the injunction of right, and the prohibition of wrong.Al-Khayyat, A.H., Kitab al-Intisar, Beirut, 1957, p.93 Monotheism All Muslim schools of theology faced the dilemma of affirming divine transcendence and divine attributes, without falling into anthropomorphism on the one hand or emptying scriptural references to those attributes of all concrete meaning. The doctrine of Tawhƒ´d, in the words of the prominent Mu øtazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: > the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares > with him. This is explained by the fact that you know that the world has a > creator who created it and that: he existed eternally in the past and he > cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And > you know that he was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not > possible for him. And you know that he is omniscient of the past and present > and that ignorance is not possible for him. And you know that he knows > everything that was, everything that is, and how things that are not would > be if they were. And you know that he is eternally in the past and future > living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for him. And you know > that he sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that he does > not have need of sense organs. And you know that he is eternally past and in > future sufficient and it is not possible for him to be in need. And you know > that he is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for him to > get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and > body members. And you know that he is not like the accidents of motion, > rest, color, food or smells. And you know that he is One throughout eternity > and there is no second beside him, and that everything other than he is > contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. > Thus, if you know all of that you know the oneness of God. Divine justice Facing the problem of existence of evil in the world, the Mu øtazilis pointed at the free will of human beings, so that evil was defined as something that stems from the errors in human acts. God does nothing ultimately evil, and he demands not from any human to perform any evil act. If man's evil acts had been from the will of God, then punishment would have been meaningless, as man performed the will of God no matter what he did. Mu øtazilis did not deny the existence of suffering that goes beyond human abuse and misuse of their free will granted to them by God. In order to explain this type of \\"apparent\\" evil, Mu øtazilis relied on the Islamic doctrine of taklif ‚Äî \\"God does not order/give the soul of any of his creation, that which is beyond its capacity.\\" [Qur'an 2:286] This entailed the existence of an \\"act of god\\" to serve a greater good, or the existence of evil acts to prevent a far greater evil. In conclusion, it comprised life is an ultimate \\"fair test\\" of coherent and rational choices, having a supremely just accountability in one's current state, as well as the hereafter. Humans are required to have belief, iman, secure faith and conviction in and about God, and do good works, amal saleh, to have iman reflected in their moral choices, deeds, and relationship with God, fellow humans, and all of the creation in this world. If everyone is healthy and wealthy, then there will be no meaning for the obligations imposed on humans to, for example, be generous, help the needy, and have compassion for the deprived and trivialized. The inequalities in human fortunes and the calamities that befell them are, thus, an integral part of the test of life. Everyone is being tested. The powerful, the rich, and the healthy are required to use all their powers and privileges to help those who suffer and to alleviate their suffering. In the Qiyamah (Judgment Day), they will be questioned about their response to Divine blessings and bounties they enjoyed in their lives. The less fortunate are required to patiently persevere and are promised a compensation for their suffering that, as the Qur'an puts it in 39:10, and as translated by Muhammad Asad, is \\"beyond all reckoning\\". The test of life is specifically for adults in full possession of their mental faculties. Children may suffer, and are observed to suffer, given the nature of life but they are believed to be completely free from sin and liability. Divine justice is affirmed through the theory of compensation. All sufferers will be compensated. This includes non-believers and, more importantly, children, who are destined to go to Paradise. The doctrine of 'Adl in the words of  øAbd al-Jabbar: It is the knowledge that God is removed from all that is morally wrong (qabih) and that all his acts are morally good (hasana). This is explained by the fact that you know that all human acts of injustice (zulm), transgression (jawr), and the like cannot be of his creation (min khalqihi). Whoever attributes that to him has ascribed to him injustice and insolence (safah) and thus strays from the doctrine of justice. And you know that God does not impose faith upon the unbeliever without giving him the power (al-qudra) for it, nor does he impose upon a human what he is unable to do, but he only gives to the unbeliever to choose unbelief on his own part, not on the part of God. And you know that God does not will, desire or want disobedience. Rather, he loathes and despises it and only wills obedience, which he wants and chooses and loves. And you know that he does not punish the children of polytheists (al-mushrikin) in Hellfire because of their fathers' sin, for he has said: \\"Each soul earns but its own due\\" (Qur'an 6:164); and he does not punish anyone for someone else's sin because that would be morally wrong (qabih), and God is far removed from such. And you know that he does not transgress his rule (hukm) and that he only causes sickness and illness in order to turn them to advantage. Whoever says otherwise has allowed that God is iniquitous and has imputed insolence to him. And you know that, for their sakes, he does the best for all of his creatures, upon whom he imposes moral and religious obligations (yukallifuhum), and that He has indicated to them what he has imposed upon them and clarified the path of truth so that we could pursue it, and he has clarified the path of falsehood (tariq l-batil) so that we could avoid it. So, whoever perishes does so only after all this has been made clear. And you know that every benefit we have is from God; as he has said: \\"And you have no good thing that is not from Allah\\" (Qur'an 16:53); it either comes to us from him or from elsewhere. Thus, when you know all of this you become knowledgeable about justice from God. Promise and warning This comprised questions of the Last day, or in Arabic, the Qiyamah (Day of Judgment). According to 'Abd al-Jabbar, The doctrine of irreversible Divine promises and warnings, is fashioned out the Islamic philosophy of human existence. Humans, (or insan in Arabic) are created with an innate need in their essence to submit themselves to something. Also, it is seen as an innate need of all humans to pursue an inner peace and contentment within the struggles of an imperfect world. Knowledge of God, truth, and choices, in relation to one's innate need of submission is seen in Islam as the promise and recompense of God (al-thawab) to those who follow. His warning is looked at as a conscious decision by a human submitting themselves, and choosing a varying principle which he had given a clear warning to. He will not go back on his word, nor can he act contrary to his promise and warning, nor lie in what he reports, in contrast to what the Postponers (Murjites) hold. Intermediate position That is, Muslims who commit grave sins and die without repentance are not considered as mu‚Äôminƒ´n (believers), nor are they considered kafirs (non-believers), but in an intermediate position between the two. The reason behind this is that a mu‚Äômin is, by definition, a person who has faith and conviction in and about God, and who has his/her faith reflected in his/her deeds and moral choices. Any shortcoming on any of these two fronts makes one, by definition, not a mu‚Äômin. On the other hand, one does not become a kafir (i.e. rejecter; non-believer), for this entails, inter alia, denying the Creator ‚Äî something not necessarily done by a committer of a grave sin. The fate of those who commit grave sins and die without repentance is Hell. Hell is not considered a monolithic state of affairs but as encompassing many degrees to accommodate the wide spectrum of human works and choices, and the lack of comprehension associated to The Ultimate Judge (one of the other names in Islam of God.) Consequently, those in the intermediate position, though in Hell, would have a lesser punishment because of their belief and other good deeds. Mu øtazilites adopted this position as a middle ground between Kharijites and Murjites. In the words of  øAbd al-Jabbar, the doctrine of the intermediate position is the knowledge that whoever murders, or fornicates (zina), or commits serious sins is a grave sinner (fasiq) and not a believer, nor is his case the same that of believers with respect to praise and attributing greatness, since he is to be cursed and disregarded. Nonetheless, he is not an unbeliever who cannot be buried in our Muslim cemetery, or be prayed for, or marry a Muslim. Rather, he has an intermediate position, in contrast to the Seceders (Kharijites) who say that he is an unbeliever, or the Murjites who say that he is a believer. The enjoining of right and prohibiting of wrong These two tenets, like the \\"intermediate position\\" follow logically (according to scholar Majid Fakhry) from the basic Mu øtazilite concepts of divine unity, justice and free will, of which they are the logical conclusion. Even though they are accepted by most Muslims, Mu øtazilites give them a specific interpretation in the sense that, even though God enjoins what is right and prohibits what is wrong, the use of reason allows a Muslim in most cases to identify for himself what is right and what is wrong, even without the help of revelation. Only for some acts is the revelation necessary to determine whether a certain act is right or wrong. This is discussed in further details below. = The use of reasoning and logic = Mu øtazilites based the analysis of all religious texts and doctrines to be analysed by sane mind and solid logic and if there is a discrepancy then the texts or doctrines should be rejected. This part alone made them the enemy of state and orthodox Muslims who conservatively follow the Hadith (by far the majority of Muslims today, including all Sunni and Shia sects). =Theory of interpretation= Mu øtazilah relied on a synthesis between reason and revelation. That is, their rationalism operated in the service of scripture and Islamic theological framework. They, as the majority of Muslim jurist- theologians, validated allegorical readings of scripture whenever necessary. Justice  øAbd al-Jabbar (935-1025) said in his Sharh al-Usul al-Khamsa (The Explication of the Five Principles): The hermeneutic methodology proceeds as follows: if the literal meaning of an ayah (verse) is consistent with the rest of scripture, the main themes of the Qur'an, the basic tenets of the Islamic creed, and the well-known facts, then interpretation, in the sense of moving away from the literal meaning, is not justified. If a contradiction results from adopting the literal meaning, such as a literal understanding of the \\"hand\\" of God that contravenes his transcendence and the Qur'anic mention of his categorical difference from all other things, then an interpretation is warranted. In the above quote, Justice 'Abd al-Jabbar emphatically mentioned that if there are two possible interpretations, both capable of resolving the apparent contradiction created by literal understanding of a verse, then the interpretation closer to the literal meaning should take precedence, for the relationship between the interpretations, close and distant, becomes the same as the literal understanding and the interpretation. Note: Sharh al-Usul al- Khamsah may be a paraphrase or supercommentary made by Abd al-Jabbar's student Mankdim . =The first obligation= Mu øtazilis believed that the first obligation on humans, specifically adults in full possession of their mental faculties, is to use their intellectual power to ascertain the existence of God, and to become knowledgeable of his attributes. One must wonder about the whole existence, that is, about why something exists rather than nothing. If one comes to know that there is a being who caused this universe to exist, not reliant on anything else and absolutely free from any type of need, then one realizes that this being is all-wise and morally perfect. If this being is all-wise, then his very act of creation cannot be haphazard or in vain. One must then be motivated to ascertain what this being wants from humans, for one may harm oneself by simply ignoring the whole mystery of existence and, consequently, the plan of the Creator. This paradigm is known in Islamic theology as wujub al-nazar, i.e., the obligation to use one's speculative reasoning to attain ontological truths. About the \\"first duty,\\"  øAbd al-Jabbar said it is \\"speculative reasoning (al-nazar) which leads to knowledge of God, because he is not known by the way of necessity (daruratan) nor by the senses (bi l-mushahada). Thus, he must be known by reflection and speculation.\\" The difference between Mu øtazilis and other Muslim theologians is that Mu øtazilis consider al-nazar an obligation even if one does not encounter a fellow human being claiming to be a messenger from the Creator, and even if one does not have access to any alleged God-inspired or God-revealed scripture. On the other hand, the obligation of nazar to other Muslim theologians materializes upon encountering prophets or scripture. =Reason and revelation= Averroes insisted that all natural phenomena followed laws that God created. For al-Ghazali's argument see The Incoherence of the Philosophers. Translated by Michael E. Marmura. 2nd ed, Provo Utah, 2000, pp.116-7.For Ibn Rushd's response, see Khalid, Muhammad A. ed. Medieval Islamic Philosophical Writings, Cambridge UK, 2005, p.162) The Mu øtazilis had a nuanced theory regarding reason, Divine revelation, and the relationship between them. They celebrated power of reason and human intellectual power. To them, it is the human intellect that guides a human to know God, his attributes, and the very basics of morality. Once this foundational knowledge is attained and one ascertains the truth of Islam and the Divine origins of the Qur'an, the intellect then interacts with scripture such that both reason and revelation come together to be the main source of guidance and knowledge for Muslims. Harun Nasution in the Mu øtazila and Rational Philosophy, translated in Martin (1997), commented on Mu øtazili extensive use of rationality in the development of their religious views saying: \\"It is not surprising that opponents of the Mu øtazila often charge the Mu øtazila with the view that humanity does not need revelation, that everything can be known through reason, that there is a conflict between reason and revelation, that they cling to reason and put revelation aside, and even that the Mu øtazila do not believe in revelation. But is it true that the Mu øtazila are of the opinion that everything can be known through reason and therefore that revelation is unnecessary? The writings of the Mu øtazila give exactly the opposite portrait. In their opinion, human reason is not sufficiently powerful to know everything and for this reason humans need revelation in order to reach conclusions concerning what is good and what is bad for them.\\" The Mu øtazili position on the roles of reason and revelation is well captured by what Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324 AH/935 AD), the eponym of the Ash øari school of theology, attributed to the Mu'tazili scholar Ibrahim an-Nazzam (d. 231 AH/845 AD) (1969): In the above formulation, a problem emerged, which is rendering something obligatory on the Divine being ‚Äî something that seems to directly conflict with Divine omnipotence. The Mu øtazili argument is predicated on absolute Divine power and self-sufficiency, however. Replying to a hypothetical question as to why God does not do that which is ethically wrong (la yaf\`alu al-qabih), 'Abd al- Jabbar replied: Because he knows the immorality of all unethical acts and that he is self-sufficient without them...For one of us who knows the immorality of injustice and lying, if he knows that he is self-sufficient without them and has no need of them, it would be impossible for him to choose them, insofar as he knows of their immorality and his sufficiency without them. Therefore, if God is sufficient without need of any unethical thing it necessarily follows that he would not choose the unethical based on his knowledge of its immorality. Thus every immoral thing that happens in the world must be a human act, for God transcends doing immoral acts. Indeed, God has distanced himself from that with his saying: \\"But Allah wills no injustice to his servants\\" (Qur'an 40:31), and his saying: \\"Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with humankind in anything\\" (Qur'an 10:44). The thrust of  øAbd al-Jabbar's argument is that acting immorally or unwisely stems from need and deficiency. One acts in a repugnant way when one does not know the ugliness of one's deeds, i.e., because of lack of knowledge, or when one knows but one has some need, material, psychological, or otherwise. Since God is absolutely self-sufficient (a result from the cosmological \\"proof\\" of his existence), all-knowing, and all-powerful, he is categorically free from any type of need and, consequently, he never does anything that is ridiculous, unwise, ugly, or evil. The conflict between Mu øtazilis and Ash øaris concerning this point was a matter of focus. Mu øtazilis focused on divine justice, whereas the Ash øaris focused on divine omnipotence. Nevertheless, Divine self-restraint in Mu øtazili discourse is part of divine omnipotence, not a negation of it. =Validity of hadith= The Mu'tazilite \\"Ahl al-Kalam\\" argued that the prophetic example of Muhammad in his capacity as a messenger \\"is found in following the Quran alone\\", rather than oral Hadith.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.15-16excerpted from Abdur Rab, ibid, pp. 199‚Äì200. The early Mu'tazilis viewed the transmission of the oral Hadith as not sufficiently reliable.Sabine Schmidtke, The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology, Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 264-265 The Hadith, according to them, was mere guesswork, conjecture, and bidah (innovation), while the Quran was complete and perfect, and did not require the Hadith or any other book to supplement or complement it.Azami, M. A., Studies in Hadith Methodology and Literature, Islamic Book Trust, Kuala Lumpur, 92; cited in Akbarally Meherally, Myths and Realities of Hadith ‚Äì A Critical Study, (published by Mostmerciful.com Publishers), Burnaby, BC, Canada, 6; available at http://www.mostmerciful.com/Hadithbook-sectionone.htm ; excerpted from Abdur Rab, ibid, p. 200. For example, during the Abassid dynasty, the poet, theologian, and jurist, Ibrahim an-Nazzam founded a madhhab called the Nazzamiyya that rejected the authority of Hadiths. His famous student, Al- Jahiz, was also critical of those who followed oral Hadiths, referring to his Hadithist opponents as al-nabita (\\"the contemptible\\"). According to Racha El Omari, early Mutazilites believed that hadith were susceptible to \\"abuse as a polemical ideological tool\\"; that the matn (content) of the hadith -- not just the isnad -- ought to be scrutinized for doctrine and clarity; that for hadith to be valid they ought to be mutawatir, i.e. supported by tawƒÅtur or many isnƒÅd (chains of oral transmitters), each beginning with a different Companion.see: ·∏åirƒÅr b.  øAmr (d. 728/815) In his al-Ta·∏•rƒ´sh wa-l-irjƒÅ æ In writing about mutawatir (multi-isnƒÅd Hadith) and ahad (single-isnad hadith, i.e. almost all hadith) and their importance from the legal theoretician's point of view, Wael Hallaq notes the medieval scholar Al-Nawawi (1233‚Äì1277) argued that any non-mutawatir hadith is only probable and can not reach the level of certainty that a mutawatir hadith can. However, these mutawir were extremely scarce. Scholars like Ibn al-Salah (d. 1245 CE), al-Ansari (d. 1707 CE), and Ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Shakur (d. 1810 CE) found \\"no more than eight or nine\\" hadiths that fell into the mutawatir category. WƒÅ·π£il ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ æ (700‚Äì748 CE, by many accounts a founder of the Mutazilite school of thought), held that there was evidence for the veracity of a report when it had four independent transmitters. His assumption was that there could be no agreement between all transmitters in fabricating a report. WƒÅ·π£il‚Äôs acceptance of tawƒÅtur seems to have been inspired by the juridical notion of witnesses as proof that an event did indeed take place. Hence, the existence of a certain number of witnesses precluded the possibility that they were able to agree on a lie, as opposed to the single report which was witnessed by one person only, its very name meaning the ‚Äúreport of one individual‚Äù (khabar al-wƒÅ·∏•id). Ab≈´ l-Hudhayl al-  øAllƒÅf (d. 227/841) continued this verification of reports through tawƒÅtur, but proposed that the number of witnesses required for veracity be twenty, with the additional requirement that at least one of the transmitters be a believer. One Mu'tazilite who expressed the strongest statement of skepticism of any source of knowledge outside of reason and the Qur æƒÅn was Ibrahim an- Nazzam (c. 775 ‚Äì c. 845). For him, both the single and the mutawƒÅtir reports could not be trusted to yield knowledge. He recounted contradictory ·∏•adƒ´th and examined their divergent content (matn) to show why they should be rejected: they relied on both faulty human memory and bias, neither of which could be trusted to transmit what is true. Al-Na·∫ì·∫ìƒÅm bolstered his strong refutation of the trustworthiness of ·∏•adƒ´th within the larger claim that ·∏•adƒ´th circulated and thrived to support polemical causes of various theological sects and jurists, and that no single transmitter could by himself be held above suspicion of altering the content of a single report. Al-Na·∫ì·∫ìƒÅm‚Äôs skepticism involved far more than excluding the possible verification of a report, be it single or mutawƒÅtir. His stance also excluded the trustworthiness of consensus, which proved pivotal to classical Mu øtazilite criteria devised for verifying the single report (see below). Indeed, his shunning of both consensus and tawƒÅtur earned him a special mention for the depth and extent of his skepticism, even among fellow Mu øtazilites.Racha El-Omari, \\"Accommodation and Resistance: Classical Mu øtazilites on ·∏§adƒ´th\\" in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 71, No. 2 (October 2012), pp. 234-235 See also *Ash'ari *Bahshamiyya *Bishriyya *Abu'l Husayn al-Basri *Abd al- Jabbar ibn Ahmad *Abu 'Ali Muhammad al-Jubba'i *Ibrahim an-Nazzam *Al-Jahiz *Fazlur Rahman Malik *Harun Nasution *Nasr Abu Zayd *Islamic schools and branches *Jahm bin Safwan *Jewish Kalam *Kalam *Karaite Judaism *Mihna *Punishment of the Grave *Zaidiyyah, a similar school of thought *Ijtihad ReferencesBibliography      External links  * Mu'tazila: The use of reason in Islamic theology * Association pour la renaissance de l'Islam mutazilite (ARIM) Category:Islamic philosophical schools Category:Abbasid Caliphate Category:Rationalism Category:Islamic branches ","title":"Mu øtazila"},{"id":"171170","text":"Europop (also spelled Euro pop) is a style of pop music that originated in Europe during the mid to late 1960s and developed to today's form throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Many successful Europop artists came from Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. History During the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of ABBA (1972‚Äì1983). The Swedish four-piece band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored nineteen top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Steps, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group Eiffel 65 were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group Alcazar. One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more dance and trance oriented. In central Europe, Italo disco (also known as 1980s Euro disco) and Euro house were the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.

Philosophy was used to make sense out of the world in a non-religious way. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, mathematics, political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics. Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \\"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\\".Alfred North Whitehead (1929), Process and Reality, Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I. Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Roman Philosophy, Early Islamic philosophy, Medieval Scholasticism, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.Kevin Scharp (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) ‚Äì Diagrams . Greek philosophy was influenced to some extent by the older wisdom literature and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient Near East, though the extent of this influence is debated. The classicist Martin Litchfield West states, \\"contact with oriental cosmology and theology helped to liberate the early Greek philosophers' imagination; it certainly gave them many suggestive ideas. But they taught themselves to reason. Philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation\\". Subsequent philosophic tradition was so influenced by Socrates as presented by Plato that it is conventional to refer to philosophy developed prior to Socrates as pre-Socratic philosophy. The periods following this, up to and after the wars of Alexander the Great, are those of \\"classical Greek\\" and \\"Hellenistic\\" philosophy.  Pre-Socratic philosophy  The convention of terming those philosophers who were active prior to the death of Socrates as the pre-Socratics gained currency with the 1903 publication of Hermann Diels' Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, although the term did not originate with him.Greg Whitlock, preface to The Pre-Platonic Philosophers, by Friedrich Nietzsche (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xiv‚Äìxvi. The term is considered useful because what came to be known as the \\"Athenian school\\" (composed of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) signaled the rise of a new approach to philosophy; Friedrich Nietzsche's thesis that this shift began with Plato rather than with Socrates (hence his nomenclature of \\"pre-Platonic philosophy\\") has not prevented the predominance of the \\"pre-Socratic\\" distinction.Greg Whitlock, preface to The Pre-Platonic Philosophers, by Friedrich Nietzsche (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xiii‚Äìxix. The pre-Socratics were primarily concerned with cosmology, ontology, and mathematics. They were distinguished from \\"non-philosophers\\" insofar as they rejected mythological explanations in favor of reasoned discourse.John Burnet, Greek Philosophy: Thales to Plato, 3rd ed. (London: A & C Black Ltd., 1920), 3‚Äì16. Scanned version from Internet Archive = Milesian school = Thales of Miletus, regarded by Aristotle as the first philosopher,Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18. held that all things arise from a single material substance, water.Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983 b6 8‚Äì11. It is not because he gave a cosmogony that John Burnet calls him the \\"first man of science,\\" but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the cosmos and supported it with reasons.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 3‚Äì4, 18. According to tradition, Thales was able to predict an eclipse and taught the Egyptians how to measure the height of the pyramids.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 18‚Äì20; Herodotus, Histories, I.74. Thales inspired the Milesian school of philosophy and was followed by Anaximander, who argued that the substratum or arche could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something \\"unlimited\\" or \\"indefinite\\" (in Greek, the apeiron). He began from the observation that the world seems to consist of opposites (e.g., hot and cold), yet a thing can become its opposite (e.g., a hot thing cold). Therefore, they cannot truly be opposites but rather must both be manifestations of some underlying unity that is neither. This underlying unity (substratum, arche) could not be any of the classical elements, since they were one extreme or another. For example, water is wet, the opposite of dry, while fire is dry, the opposite of wet.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 22‚Äì24. This initial state is ageless and imperishable, and everything returns to it according to necessity.Guthrie, p.83 Anaximenes in turn held that the arche was air, although John Burnet argues that by this he meant that it was a transparent mist, the aether.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 21. Despite their varied answers, the Milesian school was searching for a natural substance that would remain unchanged despite appearing in different forms, and thus represents one of the first scientific attempts to answer the question that would lead to the development of modern atomic theory; \\"the Milesians,\\" says Burnet, \\"asked for the œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ of all things.\\"Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 27. = Xenophanes = Xenophanes was born in Ionia, where the Milesian school was at its most powerful, and may have picked up some of the Milesians' cosmological theories as a result.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 35. What is known is that he argued that each of the phenomena had a natural rather than divine explanation in a manner reminiscent of Anaximander's theories and that there was only one god, the world as a whole, and that he ridiculed the anthropomorphism of the Greek religion by claiming that cattle would claim that the gods looked like cattle, horses like horses, and lions like lions, just as the Ethiopians claimed that the gods were snubnosed and black and the Thracians claimed they were pale and red-haired.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 35; Diels-Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, Xenophanes, frs. 15‚Äì16. Xenophanes was highly influential to subsequent schools of philosophy. He was seen as the founder of a line of philosophy that culminated in Pyrrhonism,Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica Chapter XVII possibly an influence on Eleatic philosophy, and a precursor to Epicurus' total break between science and religion.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 33, 36. = Pythagoreanism = Pythagoras lived at roughly the same time that Xenophanes did and, in contrast to the latter, the school that he founded sought to reconcile religious belief and reason. Little is known about his life with any reliability, however, and no writings of his survive, so it is possible that he was simply a mystic whose successors introduced rationalism into Pythagoreanism, that he was simply a rationalist whose successors are responsible for the mysticism in Pythagoreanism, or that he was actually the author of the doctrine; there is no way to know for certain.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 37‚Äì38. Pythagoras is said to have been a disciple of Anaximander and to have imbibed the cosmological concerns of the Ionians, including the idea that the cosmos is constructed of spheres, the importance of the infinite, and that air or aether is the arche of everything.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 38‚Äì39. Pythagoreanism also incorporated ascetic ideals, emphasizing purgation, metempsychosis, and consequently a respect for all animal life; much was made of the correspondence between mathematics and the cosmos in a musical harmony.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 40‚Äì49. Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.C.M. Bowra 1957 The Greek experience p. 166\\" = Heraclitus = Heraclitus must have lived after Xenophanes and Pythagoras, as he condemns them along with Homer as proving that much learning cannot teach a man to think; since Parmenides refers to him in the past tense, this would place him in the 5th century BCE.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 57. Contrary to the Milesian school, which posits one stable element as the arche, Heraclitus taught that panta rhei (\\"everything flows\\"), the closest element to this eternal flux being fire. All things come to pass in accordance with Logos,DK B1. which must be considered as \\"plan\\" or \\"formula\\",pp. 419ff., W.K.C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962. and \\"the Logos is common\\".DK B2. He also posited a unity of opposites, expressed through dialectic, which structured this flux, such as that seeming opposites in fact are manifestations of a common substrate to good and evil itself.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 57‚Äì63. Heraclitus called the oppositional processes ·ºîœÅŒπœÇ (eris), \\"strife\\", and hypothesized that the apparently stable state of Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ∑ (dik√™), or \\"justice\\", is the harmonic unity of these opposites.DK B80 = Eleatic philosophy = Parmenides of Elea cast his philosophy against those who held \\"it is and is not the same, and all things travel in opposite directions,\\"‚Äîpresumably referring to Heraclitus and those who followed him.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 64. Whereas the doctrines of the Milesian school, in suggesting that the substratum could appear in a variety of different guises, implied that everything that exists is corpuscular, Parmenides argued that the first principle of being was One, indivisible, and unchanging.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 66‚Äì67. Being, he argued, by definition implies eternality, while only that which is can be thought; a thing which is, moreover, cannot be more or less, and so the rarefaction and condensation of the Milesians is impossible regarding Being; lastly, as movement requires that something exist apart from the thing moving (viz. the space into which it moves), the One or Being cannot move, since this would require that \\"space\\" both exist and not exist.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 68. While this doctrine is at odds with ordinary sensory experience, where things do indeed change and move, the Eleatic school followed Parmenides in denying that sense phenomena revealed the world as it actually was; instead, the only thing with Being was thought, or the question of whether something exists or not is one of whether it can be thought.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 67. In support of this, Parmenides' pupil Zeno of Elea attempted to prove that the concept of motion was absurd and as such motion did not exist. He also attacked the subsequent development of pluralism, arguing that it was incompatible with Being.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 82. His arguments are known as Zeno's paradoxes. = Pluralism and atomism = The power of Parmenides' logic was such that some subsequent philosophers abandoned the monism of the Milesians, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, where one thing was the arche, and adopted pluralism, such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 69. There were, they said, multiple elements which were not reducible to one another and these were set in motion by love and strife (as in Empedocles) or by Mind (as in Anaxagoras). Agreeing with Parmenides that there is no coming into being or passing away, genesis or decay, they said that things appear to come into being and pass away because the elements out of which they are composed assemble or disassemble while themselves being unchanging.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 70. Leucippus also proposed an ontological pluralism with a cosmogony based on two main elements: the vacuum and atoms. These, by means of their inherent movement, are crossing the void and creating the real material bodies. His theories were not well known by the time of Plato, however, and they were ultimately incorporated into the work of his student, Democritus.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 94. = Sophism = Sophism arose from the juxtaposition of physis (nature) and nomos (law). John Burnet posits its origin in the scientific progress of the previous centuries which suggested that Being was radically different from what was experienced by the senses and, if comprehensible at all, was not comprehensible in terms of order; the world in which people lived, on the other hand, was one of law and order, albeit of humankind's own making.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 105‚Äì10. At the same time, nature was constant, while what was by law differed from one place to another and could be changed. The first person to call themselves a sophist, according to Plato, was Protagoras, whom he presents as teaching that all virtue is conventional. It was Protagoras who claimed that \\"man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not,\\" which Plato interprets as a radical perspectivism, where some things seem to be one way for one person (and so actually are that way) and another way for another person (and so actually are that way as well); the conclusion being that one cannot look to nature for guidance regarding how to live one's life.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 113‚Äì17. Protagoras and subsequent sophists tended to teach rhetoric as their primary vocation. Prodicus, Gorgias, Hippias, and Thrasymachus appear in various dialogues, sometimes explicitly teaching that while nature provides no ethical guidance, the guidance that the laws provide is worthless, or that nature favors those who act against the laws.  Classical Greek philosophy = Socrates = Socrates, believed to have been born in Athens in the 5th century BCE, marks a watershed in ancient Greek philosophy. Athens was a center of learning, with sophists and philosophers traveling from across Greece to teach rhetoric, astronomy, cosmology, and geometry. The great statesman Pericles was closely associated with this new learning and a friend of Anaxagoras, however, and his political opponents struck at him by taking advantage of a conservative reaction against the philosophers; it became a crime to investigate the things above the heavens or below the earth, subjects considered impious. Anaxagoras is said to have been charged and to have fled into exile when Socrates was about twenty years of age.Debra Nails, The People of Plato (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2002), 24. There is a story that Protagoras, too, was forced to flee and that the Athenians burned his books.Nails, People of Plato, 256. Socrates, however, is the only subject recorded as charged under this law, convicted, and sentenced to death in 399 BCE (see Trial of Socrates). In the version of his defense speech presented by Plato, he claims that it is the envy he arouses on account of his being a philosopher that will convict him. While philosophy was an established pursuit prior to Socrates, Cicero credits him as \\"the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens, placed it in cities, introduced it into families, and obliged it to examine into life and morals, and good and evil.\\"Marcus Tullius Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, V 10‚Äì11 (or V IV). By this account he would be considered the founder of political philosophy.Leo Strauss, Natural Right and History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953), 120. The reasons for this turn toward political and ethical subjects remain the object of much study.Seth Benardete, The Argument of the Action (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), 277‚Äì96.Laurence Lampert, How Philosophy Became Socratic (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010). The fact that many conversations involving Socrates (as recounted by Plato and Xenophon) end without having reached a firm conclusion, or aporetically,Cf. Plato, Republic 336c & 337a, Theaetetus 150c, Apology of Socrates 23a; Xenophon, Memorabilia 4.4.9; Aristotle, Sophistical Refutations 183b7. has stimulated debate over the meaning of the Socratic method.W.K.C. Guthrie, The Greek Philosophers (London: Methuen, 1950), 73‚Äì75. Socrates is said to have pursued this probing question-and-answer style of examination on a number of topics, usually attempting to arrive at a defensible and attractive definition of a virtue. While Socrates' recorded conversations rarely provide a definite answer to the question under examination, several maxims or paradoxes for which he has become known recur. Socrates taught that no one desires what is bad, and so if anyone does something that truly is bad, it must be unwillingly or out of ignorance; consequently, all virtue is knowledge.Terence Irwin, The Development of Ethics, vol. 1 (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2007), 14Gerasimos Santas, \\"The Socratic Paradoxes\\", Philosophical Review 73 (1964): 147‚Äì64, 147. He frequently remarks on his own ignorance (claiming that he does not know what courage is, for example). Plato presents him as distinguishing himself from the common run of mankind by the fact that, while they know nothing noble and good, they do not know that they do not know, whereas Socrates knows and acknowledges that he knows nothing noble and good.Apology of Socrates 21d. Numerous subsequent philosophical movements were inspired by Socrates or his younger associates. Plato casts Socrates as the main interlocutor in his dialogues, deriving from them the basis of Platonism (and by extension, Neoplatonism). Plato's student Aristotle in turn criticized and built upon the doctrines he ascribed to Socrates and Plato, forming the foundation of Aristotelianism. Antisthenes founded the school that would come to be known as Cynicism and accused Plato of distorting Socrates' teachings. Zeno of Citium in turn adapted the ethics of Cynicism to articulate Stoicism. Epicurus studied with Platonic and Pyrrhonist teachers before renouncing all previous philosophers (including Democritus, on whose atomism the Epicurean philosophy relies). The philosophic movements that were to dominate the intellectual life of the Roman empire were thus born in this febrile period following Socrates' activity, and either directly or indirectly influenced by him. They were also absorbed by the expanding Muslim world in the 7th through 10th centuries AD, from which they returned to the West as foundations of Medieval philosophy and the Renaissance, as discussed below. = Plato = Plato was an Athenian of the generation after Socrates. Ancient tradition ascribes thirty-six dialogues and thirteen letters to him, although of these only twenty-four of the dialogues are now universally recognized as authentic; most modern scholars believe that at least twenty-eight dialogues and two of the letters were in fact written by Plato, although all of the thirty-six dialogues have some defenders.John M. Cooper, ed., Complete Works, by Plato (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1997), v‚Äìvi, viii‚Äìxii, 1634‚Äì35. A further nine dialogues are ascribed to Plato but were considered spurious even in antiquity.Cooper, ed., Complete Works, by Plato, v‚Äìvi, viii‚Äìxii. Plato's dialogues feature Socrates, although not always as the leader of the conversation. (One dialogue, the Laws, instead contains an \\"Athenian Stranger.\\") Along with Xenophon, Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two. While the Socrates presented in the dialogues is often taken to be Plato's mouthpiece, Socrates' reputation for irony, his caginess regarding his own opinions in the dialogues, and his occasional absence from or minor role in the conversation serve to conceal Plato's doctrines.Leo Strauss, The City and Man (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964), 50‚Äì51. Much of what is said about his doctrines is derived from what Aristotle reports about them. The political doctrine ascribed to Plato is derived from the Republic, the Laws, and the Statesman. The first of these contains the suggestion that there will not be justice in cities unless they are ruled by philosopher kings; those responsible for enforcing the laws are compelled to hold their women, children, and property in common; and the individual is taught to pursue the common good through noble lies; the Republic says that such a city is likely impossible, however, generally assuming that philosophers would refuse to rule and the people would refuse to compel them to do so.Leo Strauss, \\"Plato\\", in History of Political Philosophy, ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1987): 33‚Äì89. Whereas the Republic is premised on a distinction between the sort of knowledge possessed by the philosopher and that possessed by the king or political man, Socrates explores only the character of the philosopher; in the Statesman, on the other hand, a participant referred to as the Eleatic Stranger discusses the sort of knowledge possessed by the political man, while Socrates listens quietly. Although rule by a wise man would be preferable to rule by law, the wise cannot help but be judged by the unwise, and so in practice, rule by law is deemed necessary. Both the Republic and the Statesman reveal the limitations of politics, raising the question of what political order would be best given those constraints; that question is addressed in the Laws, a dialogue that does not take place in Athens and from which Socrates is absent. The character of the society described there is eminently conservative, a corrected or liberalized timocracy on the Spartan or Cretan model or that of pre-democratic Athens. Plato's dialogues also have metaphysical themes, the most famous of which is his theory of forms. It holds that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas), and not the material world of change known to us through our physical senses, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Plato often uses long-form analogies (usually allegories) to explain his ideas; the most famous is perhaps the Allegory of the Cave. It likens most humans to people tied up in a cave, who look only at shadows on the walls and have no other conception of reality. If they turned around, they would see what is casting the shadows (and thereby gain a further dimension to their reality). If some left the cave, they would see the outside world illuminated by the sun (representing the ultimate form of goodness and truth). If these travelers then re-entered the cave, the people inside (who are still only familiar with the shadows) would not be equipped to believe reports of this 'outside world'. This story explains the theory of forms with their different levels of reality, and advances the view that philosopher-kings are wisest while most humans are ignorant. One student of Plato (who would become another of the most influential philosophers of all time) stressed the implication that understanding relies upon first-hand observation. = Aristotle = Aristotle moved to Athens from his native Stageira in 367 BC and began to study philosophy (perhaps even rhetoric, under Isocrates), eventually enrolling at Plato's Academy.Carnes Lord, Introduction to The Politics, by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984): 1‚Äì29. He left Athens approximately twenty years later to study botany and zoology, became a tutor of Alexander the Great, and ultimately returned to Athens a decade later to establish his own school: the Lyceum.Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1972). At least twenty-nine of his treatises have survived, known as the corpus Aristotelicum, and address a variety of subjects including logic, physics, optics, metaphysics, ethics, rhetoric, politics, poetry, botany, and zoology. Aristotle is often portrayed as disagreeing with his teacher Plato (e.g., in Raphael's School of Athens). He criticizes the regimes described in Plato's Republic and Laws,Aristotle, Politics, bk. 2, ch. 1‚Äì6. and refers to the theory of forms as \\"empty words and poetic metaphors.\\"Aristotle, Metaphysics, 991a20‚Äì22. He is generally presented as giving greater weight to empirical observation and practical concerns. Aristotle's fame was not great during the Hellenistic period, when Stoic logic was in vogue, but later peripatetic commentators popularized his work, which eventually contributed heavily to Islamic, Jewish, and medieval Christian philosophy.Robin Smith, \\"Aristotle's Logic,\\" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2007). His influence was such that Avicenna referred to him simply as \\"the Master\\"; Maimonides, Alfarabi, Averroes, and Aquinas as \\"the Philosopher.\\"  Hellenistic philosophy  The philosopher Pyrrho of Elis, in an anecdote taken from Sextus Empiricus' Outlines of Pyrrhonism (upper) PIRRHO ‚Ä¢ HELIENSIS ‚Ä¢ PLISTARCHI ‚Ä¢ FILIVS translation (from Latin): Pyrrho ‚Ä¢ Greek ‚Ä¢ Son of Plistarchus (middle) OPORTERE ‚Ä¢ SAPIENTEM HANC ILLIVS IMITARI SECVRITATEM translation (from Latin): It is right wisdom then that all imitate this security (Pyrrho pointing at a peaceful pig munching his food) (lower) Whoever wants to apply the real wisdom, shall not mind trepidation and misery During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, many different schools of thought developed in the Hellenistic world and then the Greco-Roman world. There were Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Syrians and Arabs who contributed to the development of Hellenistic philosophy. Elements of Persian philosophy and Indian philosophy also had an influence. The most notable schools of Hellenistic philosophy and some of their best-known philosophers were: * Cyrenaicism: Aristippus of Cyrene * Pyrrhonism: Pyrrho, Sextus Empiricus, Aenesidemus, Timon of Phlius * Academic Skepticism: Arcesilaus, Carneades, Cicero (Roman) * Cynicism: Antisthenes, Diogenes of Sinope, Crates of Thebes * Epicureanism: Epicurus (Greek) and Lucretius (Roman) * Stoicism: Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Crates of Mallus (brought Stoicism to Rome c. 170 BCE), Panaetius, Posidonius, Cato Uticensis (Roman), Seneca (Roman), Epictetus (Greek/Roman), Marcus Aurelius (Roman) * Middle Platonism: Antiochus of Ascalon, Plutarch, Theon of Smyrna, Gaius the Platonist (Greek/Roman), Albinus, Alcinous, Apuleius (Numidian) * Neoplatonism: Plotinus (Egyptian), Ammonius Saccas, Porphyry (Syrian), Zethos (Arab), Iamblichus (Syrian), Proclus The spread of Christianity throughout the Roman world, followed by the spread of Islam, ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of Medieval philosophy, which was dominated by the three Abrahamic traditions: Jewish philosophy, Christian philosophy, and early Islamic philosophy.  Transmission of Greek philosophy under Byzantium and Islam  During the Middle Ages, Greek ideas were largely forgotten in Western Europe due to the Migration Period, which resulted in a decline in literacy. In the Byzantine Empire Greek ideas were preserved and studied, and not long after the first major expansion of Islam, however, the Abbasid caliphs authorized the gathering of Greek manuscripts and hired translators to increase their prestige. Islamic philosophers such as Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) reinterpreted these works, and during the High Middle Ages Greek philosophy re-entered the West through translations from Arabic to Latin and also from the Byzantine Empire.Lindberg, David. (1992) The Beginnings of Western Science. University of Chicago Press. p. 162. The re-introduction of these philosophies, accompanied by the new Arabic commentaries, had a great influence on Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas.

The period is known as the Islamic Golden Age, and the achievements of this period had a crucial influence in the development of modern philosophy and science. For Renaissance Europe, \\"Muslim maritime, agricultural, and technological innovations, as well as much East Asian technology via the Muslim world, made their way to western Europe in one of the largest technology transfers in world history.‚ÄùHistory of Europe - Middle Ages - Reform and renewal - Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, use TOC This period starts with al-Kindi in the 9th century and ends with Averroes (Ibn Rushd) at the end of 12th century. The death of Averroes effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Arabic School, and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries, namely in Islamic Spain and North Africa, though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular Persia and India where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: Avicennism, Illuminationist philosophy, Mystical philosophy, and Transcendent theosophy. Some of the significant achievements of early Muslim philosophers included the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or \\"backing\\"; the development of a method of open inquiry to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which could be generally applied to many types of questions (although which to apply it to is an ethical question); the willingness to both accept and challenge authority within the same process; recognition that science and philosophy are both subordinate to morality, and that moral choices should be made prior to any investigation or concern with either; the separation of theology (kalam) and law (shariah) during the early Abbasid period, a precursor to secularism;Kevin Staley (1989). \\"Al-Kindi on Creation: Aristotle's Challenge to Islam\\", Journal of the History of Ideas 50 (3), p. 355-370. the distinction between religion and philosophy, marking the beginning of secular thought; the beginning of a peer review process; early ideas on evolution; the beginnings of the scientific method, an important contribution to the philosophy of science; the introduction of temporal modal logic and inductive logic; the beginning of social philosophy, including the formulation of theories on social cohesion and social conflict; the beginning of the philosophy of history; the development of the philosophical novel and the concepts of empiricism and tabula rasa; and distinguishing between essence and existence. Saadia Gaon, David ben Merwan al-Mukkamas, Maimonides, and Thomas Aquinas, were influenced by the Mutazilite work, particularly Avicennism and Averroism, and the Renaissance and the use of empirical methods were inspired at least in part by Arabic translations of Greek, Jewish, Persian and Egyptian works translated into Latin during the Renaissance of the 12th century, and taken during the Reconquista in 1492. Early Islamic philosophy can be divided into clear sets of influences, branches, schools, and fields, as described below. Origin=Muhammad = The life of Muhammad or sira generated both the Qur'an (revelation) and hadith (his daily utterances and discourses), during which philosophy was defined by Muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message. Together the sira and hadith constitute the sunnah and are validated by isnad (\\"backing\\") to determine the likely truth of the report of any given saying of Muhammad. Key figures are Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim, Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i. This work, which was not completed until the 10th century, began shortly after The Farewell Sermon in 631. Branches= Kalam = Ilm al-KalƒÅm (, literally the study of \\"speech\\" or \\"words\\") is the Islamic philosophical discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic. KalƒÅm in Islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument. A scholar of kalƒÅm is referred to as a mutakallim (plural mutakallimiin). With Kalam, questions about the sira and hadith, as well as science (Islamic science) and law (fiqh and sharia), began to be investigated beyond the scope of Muhammad's beliefs. This period is characterized by emergence of ijtihad and the first fiqh. As the Sunnah became published and accepted, philosophy separate from Muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants. During this period, traditions similar to Socratic method began to evolve, but philosophy remained subordinate to religion. Independent minds exploiting the methods of ijtihad sought to investigate the doctrines of the Qur'an, which until then had been accepted in faith on the authority of divine revelation. One of the first debates was that between the Qadarites, who affirmed free will, and the Jabarites, who maintained the belief in fatalism. At the 2nd century of the Hijra, a new movement arose in the theological school of Basra, Iraq. A pupil, Wasil ibn Ata (AD 700‚Äì748), who was expelled from the school of Hasan of Basra because his answers were contrary to then-orthodox Islamic tradition and became leader of a new school, and systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites. This new school was called Mutazilite (from i'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent) that lasted from the 8th to 10th centuries. Its principal dogmas were three: #God is an absolute unity, and no attribute can be ascribed to Him. #Man is a free agent. It is on account of these two principles that the Mu'tazilities designate themselves the \\"Partisans of Justice and Unity\\". #All knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason; humans could acquire knowledge before, as well as after, Revelation, by the sole light of reason. This fact makes knowledge obligatory upon all men, at all times, and in all places. The Mutazilities, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day, looked for support in philosophy, and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called Ilm-al-Kalam (Scholastic theology); those professing it were called Mutakallamin. This appellation became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles. The first Mutakallamin had to debate both the orthodox and the non-Muslims, and they may be described as occupying the middle ground between those two parties. But subsequent generations were to large extent critical towards the Mutazilite school, especially after formation of the Asharite concepts. Throughout history, the place of kalam in Islamic thought has been controversial. The vast majority of the early traditional Sunni Muslim scholars have either criticized or prohibited it. Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics, generally, stopped short in their respective Aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion. =Falsafa= From the 9th century onward, owing to Caliph al-Ma'mun and his successor, Greek philosophy was introduced among the Arabs, and the Peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them; such were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and Ibn Rushd (Averro√´s), all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the Mutakallamin. Another trend, represented by the Brethren of Purity, used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean world view. During the Abbasid caliphate a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them heterodox Muslims or non- Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, Hindu, and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the Christian West. They contributed to making Aristotle known in Christian Europe. Three speculative thinkers, al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al-Kindi, combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam. They were considered by many as highly unorthodox and a few even described them as non-Islamic philosophers. From Spain Arabic philosophic literature was translated into Hebrew and Latin, contributing to the development of modern European philosophy. The philosophers Moses Maimonides (a Jew born in Muslim Spain) and Ibn Khaldun (born in modern-day Tunisia), the father of sociology and historiography, were also important philosophers, though the latter did not identify himself as a falsafa, but rather a kalam author. =Some differences between Kalam and Falsafa= Aristotle attempted to demonstrate the unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. To assert that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to denying prophecy. One other part of Aristotle's theory shocked the faith of the Mutakallamin -- the Aristotelian theory of the soul. According to Aristotelianism, the human soul is simply man's substantial form, the set of properties that make matter into a living human body.Anthony Kenny, Aquinas on Mind (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 24, 26, 28 This seems to imply that the human soul cannot exist apart from the body. Indeed, Aristotle writes, \\"It is clear that the soul, or at least some parts of it (if it is divisible), cannot be separated from the body. [...] And thus, those have the right idea who think that the soul does not exist without the body.\\"De Anima 413a4-5; 414a19-20 In Aristotelianism, at least one psychological force, the active intellect, can exist apart from the body.\\"This intellect is separate, unaffected, and unmixed [...] In separation, it is just what it is, and this alone is immortal and eternal\\" (De Anima 430a18, 23-24). However, according to many interpretations, the active intellect is a superhuman entity emanating from God and enlightening the human mind, not a part of any individual human soul.Medieval Philosophy, ed. John Marenbon (London: Routledge, 2003), p. 54Timothy Robinson, Aristotle in Outline (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1995) p. 51 Thus, Aristotle's theories seem to deny the immortality of the individual human soul. Wherefore the Mutakallamin had, before anything else, to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by Democritus. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter. For, indeed, if it be supposed that God commenced His work at a certain definite time by His \\"will\\", and for a certain definite object, it must be admitted that He was imperfect before accomplishing His will, or before attaining His object. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to Time, and claimed that just as Space is constituted of atoms and vacuum, Time, likewise, is constituted of small indivisible moments. The creation of the world once established, it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a Creator, and that God is unique, omnipotent, and omniscient. =Main protagonists of Falsafa and their critics= The 12th century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the Kalam, which later, being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. This supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed, in great measure, to Al-Ghazali (1005‚Äì1111) among the Persians, and to Judah ha-Levi (1140) among the Jews. It can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by Al-Ghazali in his work, Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), not only produced, by reaction, a current favorable to philosophy, but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism. They thereafter made their theories clearer and their logic closer. The influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the Islamic Peripatetic school ever produced, namely, Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes), both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy. Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, the Persian Ghazali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the \\"Kuzari\\", in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, \\"I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them\\" (\\"Kuzari\\", v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: \\"Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?\\" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in Judah ha-Levi's eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament. Ibn Rushd (Averro√´s), the contemporary of Maimonides, closed the first great philosophical era of the Muslims. He was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Averroes' philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al- Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Ibn Rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world--hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. His ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion, further developed by the Averroist school of philosophy, were later influential in the development of modern secularism. But while Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, \\"Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ex nihilo\\" (Munk, \\"M√©langes\\", p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Ibn Sina declared--in order to make concessions to the orthodox-- but also a necessity. Driven from the Islamic schools, Islamic philosophy found a refuge with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men--such as the Ibn Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides--joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd's commentary. It should be mentioned that this depiction of intellectual tradition in Islamic Lands is mainly dependent upon what West could understand (or was willing to understand) from this long era. In contrast, there are some historians and philosophers who do not agree with this account and describe this era in a completely different way. Their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on Islamic Philosophy, especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd.Henry Corbin, History of Islamic Philosophy. =Judeo-Islamic philosophy= The oldest Jewish religio- philosophical work preserved is that of Saadia Gaon (892-942), Emunot ve-Deot, \\"The Book of Beliefs and Opinions\\". In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world ex nihilo, just as the Bible attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter. To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (sifat al- dhatia) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (sifat-al- fi'aliya). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an \\"accident\\" 'arad (compare Guide for the Perplexed i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: \\"Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident\\" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: \\"If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love\\", etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views; just as the Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics stopped short in their respective Aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion. Schools=Farabism= Al-Farabi (Alfarabi), the founder of Farabism. Al-Farabi (Alfarabi) was a founder of his own school of Islamic philosophy but which was later overshadowed by Avicennism. Al-Farabi's school of philosophy \\"breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle [... and ...] moves from metaphysics to methodology, a move that anticipates modernity\\", and \\"at the level of philosophy, Alfarabi unites theory and practice [... and] in the sphere of the political he liberates practice from theory\\". His Neoplatonic theology is also more than just metaphysics as rhetoric. In his attempt to think through the nature of a First Cause, Alfarabi discovers the limits of human knowledge\\". Al-Farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and was widely considered second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of \\"the Second Teacher\\") in his time. His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Ibn Sina (Avicenna). =Avicennism= Due to Avicenna's (Ibn Sina's) successful reconciliation between Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism along with Kalam, Avicennism eventually became the leading school of Islamic philosophy by the 12th century. Avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then, and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time:Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (d. 1288)\\", Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame. Avicennism was also influential in medieval Europe, particularly his doctrines on the nature of the soul and his existence-essence distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholastic Europe. This was particularly the case in Paris, where Avicennism was later proscribed in 1210. Nevertheless, his psychology and theory of knowledge influenced William of Auvergne and Albertus Magnus, and his metaphysics influenced the thought of Thomas Aquinas.The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (ca. 980-1037) Averroes (Ibn Rushd), the founder of Averroism. =Averroism= Averroes (Ibn Rushd) is most famous for his commentaries on Aristotle's works and for writing The Incoherence of the Incoherence in which he defended the falasifa against al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers. While he had very little influence in the Islamic world, which was then dominated by Avicennian philosophy and Ash'ari theology, Averroism became very influential in medieval Europe, especially among the Scholastics. Averroism eventually led to the development of modern secularism,Abdel Wahab El Messeri.

Averroes: His Life, Works and Influence. Oneworld Publications. . The concept of \\"existence precedes essence\\", a key foundational concept of existentialism, can also be found in the works of Averroes, as a reaction to Avicenna's concept of \\"essence precedes existence\\". Ethics=Environmental philosophy= Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of natural capital, i.e. producing land. Traditions of haram and hima and early urban planning were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within carrying capacity and to preserve the natural environment as an obligation of khalifa or \\"stewardship\\".S. Nomanul Haq, \\"Islam\\", in Dale Jamieson (2001), A Companion to Environmental Philosophy, pp. 111-129, Blackwell Publishing, . Muhammad is considered a pioneer of environmentalism for his teachings on environmental preservation. His hadiths on agriculture and environmental philosophy were compiled in the \\"Book of Agriculture\\" of the Sahih Bukhari, which included the following saying:S. Nomanul Haq, \\"Islam\\", in Dale Jamieson (2001), A Companion to Environmental Philosophy, pp. 111-129 [119-129], Blackwell Publishing, . Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:S. Nomanul Haq, \\"Islam\\", in Dale Jamieson (2001), A Companion to Environmental Philosophy, pp. 111-129 [111-119], Blackwell Publishing, . The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and environmental science, especially pollution, were Arabic medical treatises written by al-Kindi, Qusta ibn Luqa, al-Razi, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay‚Äò, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Ibn al-Quff, and Ibn al-Nafis. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, municipal solid waste mishandling, and environmental impact assessments of certain localities.L. Gari (2002), \\"Arabic Treatises on Environmental Pollution up to the End of the Thirteenth Century\\", Environment and History 8 (4), pp. 475-488. Cordoba, al-Andalus also had the first waste containers and waste disposal facilities for litter collection.S. P. Scott (1904), History of the Moorish Empire in Europe, 3 vols, J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia and London. F. B. Artz (1980), The Mind of the Middle Ages, Third edition revised, University of Chicago Press, pp 148-50. (cf. References , 1001 Inventions) =Medical ethics= The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by Ishaq bin Ali Rahawi, who wrote the Adab al-Tabib (Conduct of a Physician), the first treatist dedicated to medical ethics. He regarded physicians as \\"guardians of souls and bodies\\", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics, Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation. * What the physician must avoid and beware of * The manners of visitors * The care of remedies by the physician * The dignity of the medical profession * The examination of physicians * The removal of corruption among physicians =Humanism= Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, rational and scientific discourses in their search for knowledge, meaning and values. A wide range of Islamic writings on love poetry, history and philosophical theology show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of individualism, occasional secularism, skepticism and liberalism. Another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on freedom of speech, as summarized by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph al-Ma'mun) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to convert through reason: Certain aspects of Renaissance humanism has its roots in the medieval Islamic world, including the \\"art of dictation, called in Latin, ars dictaminis,\\" and \\"the humanist attitude toward classical language.\\" Logic In early Islamic philosophy, logic played an important role. Islamic law placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a novel approach to logic in Kalam, but this approach was later displaced by ideas from Greek philosophy and Hellenistic philosophy with the rise of the Mu'tazili philosophers, who highly valued Aristotle's Organon. The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the Organon by Averroes. The works of al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali and other Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the Renaissance. According to the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Important developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of \\"Avicennian logic\\" as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. Avicenna's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic and inductive logic. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or \\"backing\\", and the development of a scientific method of open inquiry to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which could be generally applied to many types of questions. =Logic in Islamic law and theology= Early forms of analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and categorical syllogism were introduced in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.Wael B. Hallaq (1993), Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians, p. 48. Oxford University Press, . =Aristotelian logic= The first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by al-Kindi (Alkindus) (805‚Äì873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873‚Äì950), who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference.History of logic: Arabic logic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being \\"idea\\" and the second being \\"proof\\". Averroes (1126‚Äì98) was the last major logician from al-Andalus, who wrote the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic. =Avicennian logic= Avicenna (980-1037) developed his own system of logic known as \\"Avicennian logic\\" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.I. M. Bochenski (1961), \\"On the history of the history of logic\\", A history of formal logic, p. 4-10. Translated by I. Thomas, Notre Dame, Indiana University Press. (cf. Ancient Islamic (Arabic and Persian) Logic and Ontology) The first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by Avicenna (980‚Äì1037), who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of definition and classification and the quantification of the predicates of categorical propositions, and developed an original theory on \\"temporal modal\\" syllogism. Its premises included modifiers such as \\"at all times\\", \\"at most times\\", and \\"at some time\\". While Avicenna (980-1037) often relied on deductive reasoning in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of inductive logic, which he used to pioneer the idea of a syndrome. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation which are critical to inductive logic and the scientific method.Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), Islamic Humanism, p. 155, Oxford University Press, . Ibn Hazm (994-1064) wrote the Scope of Logic, in which he stressed on the importance of sense perception as a source of knowledge.Science and Muslim Scientists , Islam Herald. Al-Ghazali (Algazel) (1058‚Äì1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in Kalam. Despite the logical sophistication of al-Ghazali, the rise of the Ash'ari school in the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as Persia and the Levant. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's \\"first figure\\" and developed a form of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806‚Äì1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155‚Äì1191), who developed the idea of \\"decisive necessity\\", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation. Another systematic refutation of Greek logic was written by Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328), the Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin (Refutation of Greek Logicians), where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the syllogismSee pp. 253-254 of and in favour of inductive reasoning. Metaphysics=Cosmological and ontological arguments= Avicenna's proof for the existence of God, known as the \\"Proof of the Truthful\\", was the first ontological argument, which he proposed in the Metaphysics section of The Book of Healing.Steve A. Johnson (1984), \\"Ibn Sina's Fourth Ontological Argument for God's Existence\\", The Muslim World 74 (3-4), 161‚Äì171. This was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. \\"It is ontological insofar as ‚Äònecessary existence‚Äô in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent\\". The proof is also \\"cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent.\\" =Distinction between essence and existence= Islamic philosophy, imbued as it is with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism the difference between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. This was first described by Avicenna's works on metaphysics, who was himself influenced by al-Farabi. Some orientalists (or those particularly influenced by Thomist scholarship) argued that Avicenna was the first to view existence (wujud) as an accident that happens to the essence (mahiyya). However, this aspect of ontology is not the most central to the distinction that Avicenna established between essence and existence. One cannot therefore make the claim that Avicenna was the proponent of the concept of essentialism per se, given that existence (al-wujud) when thought of in terms of necessity would ontologically translate into a notion of the Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself (wajib al- wujud bi-dhatihi), which is without description or definition, and particularly without quiddity or essence (la mahiyya lahu). Consequently, Avicenna's ontology is 'existentialist' when accounting for being qua existence in terms of necessity (wujub), while it is 'essentialist' in terms of thinking about being qua existence (wujud) in terms of contingency qua possibility (imkan; or mumkin al-wujud: contingent being).For recent discussions of this question see: Nader El-Bizri, \\"Avicenna and Essentialism\\", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 54 (June 2001), pp. 753-778. Some argue that Avicenna anticipated Frege and Bertrand Russell in \\"holding that existence is an accident of accidents\\" and also anticipated Alexius Meinong's \\"view about nonexistent objects.\\" He also provided early arguments for \\"a 'necessary being' as cause of all other existents.\\" The idea of \\"essence precedes existence\\" is a concept which dates back to Avicenna and his school of Avicennism as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his Illuminationist philosophy. The opposite idea of \\"existence precedes essence\\" was thus developed in the works of Averroes and Mulla Sadra's transcendent theosophy. More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of phenomenological methods of investigation in ontology (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with Heidegger's thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.For recent studies that engage in this line of research with care and thoughtful deliberation, see: Nader El-Bizri, The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000) =Resurrection= Ibn al-Nafis wrote the Theologus Autodidactus as a defense of \\"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\\" The book presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus as forms of evidence. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to Avicenna's metaphysical argument on spiritual resurrection (as opposed to bodily resurrection), which was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.Fancy, p. 42 & 60 =Soul and spirit= The Muslim physician-philosophers, Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and in particular, the Avicennian doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the Scholastics. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul included the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of \\"The Ten Intellects\\", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final intellect. Avicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the heart, whereas Ibn al-Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul \\"is related to the entirety and not to one or a few organs.\\" He further criticized Aristotle's idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al- Nafis concluded that \\"the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul\\" and he defined the soul as nothing other than \\"what a human indicates by saying ‚ÄòI‚Äô.\\"Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (d. 1288)\\", p. 209-210, Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame. =Thought experiments= :Further information: Avicennism - Thought experiments on self-consciousness While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul. He referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. His \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance.Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (1996), History of Islamic Philosophy, p. 315, Routledge, . This argument was later refined and simplified by Ren√© Descartes in epistemic terms when he stated: \\"I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness.\\" =Time= While ancient Greek philosophers believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, early medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creationism shared by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher John Philoponus presented a detailed argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Muslim and Arab Jewish philosophers like Al- Kindi, Saadia Gaon, and Al-Ghazali developed further arguments, with most falling into two broad categories: assertions of the \\"impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite\\" and of the \\"impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition\\". =Truth= In metaphysics, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth as: Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth in his Metaphysics: In his Quodlibeta, Thomas Aquinas wrote a commentary on Avicenna's definition of truth in his Metaphysics and explained it as follows: Early Islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion and emphsized the process of ijtihad to find truth. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In his Aporias against Ptolemy, Ibn al-Haytham further wrote the following comments on truth: Natural philosophy=Atomism= Atomistic philosophies are found very early in Islamic philosophy, and represent a synthesis of the Greek and Indian ideas. Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy. Yet it was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some schools of Islamic thought. The most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the Asharite school of philosophy, most notably in the work of the philosopher al- Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is \\"accidental\\" meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof.L. Gardet (2001), \\"djuz‚Äô\\", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, CD-ROM Edition, v. 1.1, Leiden: Brill Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Spain, including the noted commentator Averroes (1126-1198 AD) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of Aristotle in later Jewish and Christian scholastic thought. =Cosmology= There are several cosmological verses in the Qur'an (610-632) which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the expansion of the universe and possibly even the Big Bang theory: > Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined > together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? > We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent > (thereof). In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creation myth shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His reasoning was adopted by many, most notably; Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the \\"argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite\\", which states: :\\"An actual infinite cannot exist.\\" :\\"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.\\" :\\".‚Ä¢. An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.\\" The second argument, the \\"argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition\\", states: :\\"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition.\\" :\\"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition.\\" :\\".‚Ä¢. The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite.\\" Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his thesis of the first antimony concerning time. In the 10th century, the Brethren of Purity published the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity, in which a heliocentric view of the universe is expressed in a section on cosmology: =Evolution= ;Struggle for existence The Mu'tazili scientist and philosopher al-Jahiz (c. 776-869) was the first of the Muslim biologists and philosophers to develop an early theory of evolution. He speculated on the influence of the environment on animals, considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and first described the struggle for existence, a precursor to natural selection.Conway Zirkle (1941). Natural Selection before the \\"Origin of Species\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 84 (1), p. 71-123.Mehmet Bayrakdar (Third Quarter, 1983). \\"Al-Jahiz And the Rise of Biological Evolutionism\\", The Islamic Quarterly. London. Al-Jahiz's ideas on the struggle for existence in the Book of Animals have been summarized as follows: In Chapter 47 of his India, entitled \\"On Vasudeva and the Wars of the Bharata,\\" Abu Rayhan Biruni attempted to give a naturalistic explanation as to why the struggles described in the Mahabharata \\"had to take place.\\" He explains it using natural processes that include biological ideas related to evolution, which has led several scholars to compare his ideas to Darwinism and natural selection. This is due to Biruni describing the idea of artificial selection and then applying it to nature: In the 13th century, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi explains how the elements evolved into minerals, then plants, then animals, and then humans. Tusi then goes on to explain how hereditary variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things:Farid Alakbarov (Summer 2001). A 13th-Century Darwin? Tusi's Views on Evolution, Azerbaijan International 9 (2). Tusi discusses how organisms are able to adapt to their environments: Tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals: ;Transmutation of species Al-Dinawari (828-896), considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Book of Plants, discussed plant evolution from its birth to its death, describing the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit., in Ibn Miskawayh's al-Fawz al-Asghar and the Brethren of Purity's Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa) developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on Charles Darwin and his inception of Darwinism, but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic.Footnote 27a to Chapter 6, Part 5 in English translations of the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity were available from 1812,\\"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research\\", by A. L. Tibawi, as published in volume 2 of The Islamic Quarterly in 1955; pgs. 28-46 while Arabic manuscripts of the al- Fawz al-Asghar and The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa were also available at the University of Cambridge by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly Charles Darwin. In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity. The following statements from his 1377 work, the Muqaddimah, express evolutionary ideas: Numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths Ibn al-Haytham and Al- Khazini, discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the Renaissance and may have influenced Western philosophy and science. =Phenomenology= The Ash'ari polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) is considered a pioneer of phenomenology. He articulated a relationship between the physical and observable world and that of intuition, psychology and mental functions. His theories regarding knowledge and perception, linking the domains of science and religion, led to a philosophy of existence based on the direct observation of reality from the observer's point of view. Much of his thought on phenomenology was not further developed until the 20th century.Dr Val√©rie Gonzalez, \\"Universality and Modernity\\", The Ismaili United Kingdom, December 2002, p. 50-53. =Philosophy of mind= The philosophy of mind was studied in medieval Islamic psychological thought, which refers to the study of the nafs (literally \\"self\\" or \\"psyche\\" in Arabic) in the Islamic world, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age (8th‚Äì15th centuries) as well as modern times (20th‚Äì21st centuries), and is related to psychology, psychiatry and the neurosciences. =Place and space= The Arab polymath al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen; died c. 1041) presented a thorough mathematical critique and refutation of Aristotle's conception of place (topos) in his Risala/Qawl fi‚Äôl-makan (Treatise/Discourse on Place). Aristotle's Physics (Book IV - Delta) stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Ibn al-Haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place (al-makan) is the imagined (three- dimensional) void (al-khala' al-mutakhayyal) between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to space, foreshadowing Descartes's notion of place as space qua Extensio or even Leibniz's analysis situs. Ibn al-Haytham's mathematization of place rested on several geometric demonstrations, including his study on the sphere and other solids, which showed that the sphere (al-kura) is the largest in magnitude (volumetric) with respect to other geometric solids that have equal surface areas. For instance, a sphere that has an equal surface area to that of a cylinder, would be larger in (volumetric) magnitude than the cylinder; hence, the sphere occupies a larger place than that occupied by the cylinder; unlike what is entailed by Aristotle's definition of place: that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal in magnitude.Nader El-Bizri (2007), \\"In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place\\", Arabic Sciences and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press), Vol. 17, Issue 1: 57‚Äì80. Ibn al-Haytham rejected Aristotle's philosophical concept of place on mathematical grounds. Later, the philosopher 'Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (13th century) tried to defend the Aristotelian conception of place in a treatise titled: Fi al-Radd ‚Äòala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan (A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place), although his effort was admirable from a philosophical standpoint, it was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical viewpoints.El-Bizri (2007) and handouts of El- Bizri's lectures at the Dept. of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge Ibn al-Haytham also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his Book of Optics (1021). His experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the visual perception of space was understood, contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by Euclid and Ptolemy. In \\"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.\\" Philosophy of education In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a maktab, which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the maktab entitled \\"The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children\\", as a guide to teachers working at maktab schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sina described the curriculum of a maktab school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a maktab school. =Primary education= Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a maktab school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics, language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills). =Secondary education= Ibn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account. Philosophy of science=Scientific method= The pioneering development of the scientific method by the Arab Ash'ari polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) was an important contribution to the philosophy of science. In The Model of the Motions, Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of Occam's razor, where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the cosmological hypotheses that cannot be observed from Earth.Roshdi Rashed (2007). \\"The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham\\", Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 17, p. 7-55 [35-36]. Cambridge University Press. In his Aporias against Ptolemy, Ibn al-Haytham commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge: He held that the criticism of existing theories ‚Äî which dominated this book ‚Äî holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge: Ibn al-Haytham attributed his experimental scientific method and scientific skepticism to his Islamic faith. He believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only God is perfect. He reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In The Winding Motion, Ibn al- Haytham further wrote that faith should only apply to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities, in the following comparison between the Islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative sciences: Ibn al-Haytham described his search for truth and knowledge as a way of leading him closer to God: His contemporary Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ also introduced an early scientific method in nearly every field of inquiry he studied. For example, in his treatise on mineralogy, Kitab al-Jamahir (Book of Precious Stones), he is \\"the most exact of experimental scientists\\", while in the introduction to his study of India, he declares that \\"to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method\\" and develops comparative sociology as a scientific method in the field. He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into mechanics,Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), \\"Statics\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, pp. 614-642 [642], Routledge, London and New York the first to conduct elaborate experiments related to astronomical phenomena,Dr. A. Zahoor (1997), Abu Raihan Muhammad al-Biruni , Hasanuddin University. and a pioneer of experimental psychology. Unlike his contemporary Avicenna's scientific method where \\"general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work\\", al-Biruni developed scientific methods where \\"universals came out of practical, experimental work\\" and \\"theories are formulated after discoveries.\\" During his debate with Avicenna on natural philosophy, al-Biruni made the first real distinction between a scientist and a philosopher, referring to Avicenna as a philosopher and considering himself to be a mathematical scientist. Al-Biruni's scientific method was similar to the modern scientific method in many ways, particularly his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both systematic errors and random errors, such as \\"errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers.\\" He argued that if instruments produce random errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, analyzed qualitatively, and on this basis, arrive at a \\"common-sense single value for the constant sought\\", whether an arithmetic mean or a \\"reliable estimate.\\" =Experimental medicine= Avicenna (Ibn Sina) is considered the father of modern medicine,Cas Lek Cesk (1980). \\"The father of medicine, Avicenna, in our science and culture: Abu Ali ibn Sina (980-1037)\\", Becka J. 119 (1), p. 17-23. for his introduction of experimental medicine and clinical trials,David W.

Huff (2003), The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West, p. 218. Cambridge University Press, . in his medical encyclopedia, The Canon of Medicine (11th century), which was the first book dealing with experimental medicine. It laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs or medications, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials: #\\"The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality.\\" #\\"It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease.\\" #\\"The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones.\\" #\\"The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them.\\" #\\"The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused.\\" #\\"The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect.\\" #\\"The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man.\\" =Peer review= The first documented description of a peer review process is found in the Ethics of the Physician written by Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi (854‚Äì931) of al-Raha, Syria, who describes the first medical peer review process. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient.Ray Spier (2002), \\"The history of the peer-review process\\", Trends in Biotechnology 20 (8), p. 357-358 [357]. Other fields=Epistemology= :Further information: Avicennism - Epistemology Avicenna's most influential theory in epistemology is his theory of knowledge, in which he developed the concept of tabula rasa. He argued that the \\"human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know\\" and that knowledge is attained through \\"empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts\\" which is developed through a \\"syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts.\\"Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), Avicenna/Ibn Sina (ca. 980-1037), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy In the 12th century, Ibn Tufail further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his Arabic novel, Hayy ibn Yaqzan, in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child \\"from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society\\" on a desert island. The Latin translation of his work, entitled Philosophus Autodidactus, published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke's formulation of tabula rasa in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.G. A. Russell (1994), The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England, pp. 224-262, Brill Publishers, . =Eschatology= Islamic eschatology is concerned with the Qiyamah (end of the world; Last Judgement) and the final judgement of humanity. Eschatology relates to one of the six articles of faith (aqidah) of Islam. Like the other Abrahamic religions, Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of Jannah (Heaven), while the unrighteous are punished in Jahannam (Hell). A significant fraction (one third, in fact) of the Quran deals with these beliefs, with many hadith elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as fitna (a test) and malahim (or ghayba in the shi'ite tradition). Ibn al-Nafis dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his Theologus Autodidactus, where he rationalized the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of Arabic fiction, hence his Theologus Autodidactus may be considered the earliest science fiction work.Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \\"Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher\\", Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait (cf. Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher , Encyclopedia of Islamic World). =Legal philosophy= Sharia (') refers to the body of Islamic law. The term means \\"way\\" or \\"path\\"; it is the legal framework within which public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence. Fiqh is the term for Islamic jurisprudence, made up of the rulings of Islamic jurists. A component of Islamic studies, Fiqh expounds the methodology by which Islamic law is derived from primary and secondary sources. Mainstream Islam distinguish fiqh, which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars, from sharia that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh. Scholars hope that fiqh and sharia are in harmony in any given case, but they cannot be sure.On the Sources of Islamic Law and Practices, The Journal of law and religion [0748-0814] Souaiaia yr:2005 vol:20 iss:1 pg:123 =Philosophical novels= The Islamic philosophers, Ibn Tufail (Abubacer)Jon Mcginnis, Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources, p. 284, Hackett Publishing Company, . and Ibn al-Nafis,Muhsin Mahdi (1974), \\"The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society 94 (2), p. 232-234. were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus) as a response to al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers, and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional novel Theologus Autodidactus as a response to Ibn Tufail's Philosophus Autodidactus. Both of these novels had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus, developing into the first example of a science fiction novel.Nahyan A. G.

Ibn al-Nafis described his book Theologus Autodidactus as a defense of \\"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\\" He presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysical claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (d. 1288)\\", p. 42 & 60, Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame. A Latin translation of Philosophus Autodidactus was published in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger.G. J. Toomer (1996), Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England, pp. 220-221, Oxford University Press, . The first English translation by Simon Ockley was published in 1708, and German and Dutch translations were also published at the time. Philosophus Autodidactus went on to have a significant influence on European literature,Martin Wainwright, Desert island scripts, The Guardian, 22 March 2003. and became an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.G. A. Russell (1994), The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England, p. 228, Brill Publishers, . These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the first novel in English.Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature, Al- Rashid House for Publication.Cyril Glasse (2001), New Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 202, Rowman Altamira, .Amber Haque (2004), \\"Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists\\", Journal of Religion and Health 43 (4): 357-377 [369].

It became \\"one of the most important books that heralded the Scientific Revolution\\" and European Enlightenment, and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in \\"different variations and to different degrees in the books of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.\\"Samar Attar, The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought, Lexington Books, . The novel inspired the concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" developed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) by Locke, who was a student of Pococke.G. A.

The novel also inspired Robert Boyle, another acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, The Aspiring Naturalist.G. J. Toomer (1996), Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England, p. 222, Oxford University Press, . Other European scholars influenced by Philosophus Autodidactus include Gottfried Leibniz, Melchis√©dech Th√©venot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens,G. A.

This view was challenged by the Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more secular view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. The only Greek political treatise known to medieval Muslims at the time was Plato's Republic. By the end of the Islamic Golden Age, however, the Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed. Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al- Farabi (Alfarabi), ƒ∞bn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa -and even the \\"core\\" terms of the Qur'an, i.e. ibada, din, rab and ilah- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. The 14th-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist Ernest Gellner considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of government, \\"an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself\\", the best in the history of political theory.Ernest Gellner, Plough, Sword and Book (1988), p. 239 See also *Islamic philosophy **Modern Islamic philosophy *Islamic science *Islamic Golden Age *Peripatetic school *Sufi philosophy NotesReferences De Lacy O'Leary, D.D.

He first intended to be an actor (his lead role in the Dragon's 1937 production of Richard II gained glowing reviews in The Draconian) and then a writer, but his father persuaded him against it, advising: \\"My dear boy, have some consideration for your unfortunate wife... [the law] gets you out of the house.\\" At 17, Mortimer went up to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read law, though he was actually based at Christ Church because the Brasenose buildings had been requisitioned for the war effort.David Hughes \\"Sir John Mortimer: Lawyer and writer who created Rumpole of the Bailey and elegised a bygone England\\", The Independent, 17 January 2009.

But Mortimer was still allowed to take his Bachelor of Arts degree in law in October 1943. His close friend Michael Hamburger believed he had been very harshly treated. Early writing career With weak eyes and doubtful lungs, Mortimer was classified as medically unfit for military service in World War II. He worked for the Crown Film Unit under Laurie Lee, writing scripts for propaganda documentaries. > I lived in London and went on journeys in blacked-out trains to factories > and coal-mines and military and air force installations.

Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955 with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio's Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958 before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. It was revived by Christopher Morahan in 2007 as part of a touring double bill, Legal Fictions. His play A Voyage Round My Father, given its first radio broadcast in 1963, is autobiographical, recounting his experiences as a young barrister and his relationship with his blind father. It was memorably televised by BBC Television in 1969 with Mark Dignam in the title role. In a slightly longer version the play later became a stage success (first at Greenwich Theatre with Dignam, then in 1971 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, now starring Alec Guinness). In 1981 it was remade by Thames Television with Laurence Olivier as the father and Alan Bates as young Mortimer. In 1965, he and his wife wrote the screenplay for the Otto Preminger film Bunny Lake is Missing, which also starred Olivier. Legal career Mortimer was called to the Bar (Inner Temple) in 1948, at the age of 25. His early career consisted of testamentary and divorce work, but on taking silk in 1966, he began to undertake work in criminal law. His highest profile, though, came from cases relating to claims of obscenity, which, according to Mortimer, were \\"alleged to be testing the frontiers of tolerance.\\" He has sometimes been cited as a member in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial defence team, though this is inaccurate.Mortimer's biographer Valerie Grove dismisses this canard in her tribute article . Mortimer did however successfully represent publishers John Calder and Marion Boyars in their 1968 appeal against their conviction for publishing Hubert Selby Jr.'s Last Exit to Brooklyn. He assumed a similar role three years later, this time unsuccessfully, for Richard Handyside, the English publisher of The Little Red Schoolbook. In 1971, Mortimer successfully defended the editors of the satirical Oz against a charge of \\"conspiracy to corrupt and debauch the morals of the young of the Realm\\", which likely carried a sentence of 12 years of hard labour.https://flashbak.com/the- schoolkids-oz-dirty-books-and-the-downfall-of-the-dirty- squad-56477/https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/06/archive/ In 1976, he defended Gay News editor Denis Lemon (Whitehouse v. Lemon) for the publication of James Kirkup's The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name against charges of blasphemous libel; Lemon was convicted with a suspended prison sentence, later overturned on appeal.Brett Humphreys \\"The Law that Dared to Lay the Blame ...\\" , pinktriangle.org.uk; accessed 13 January 2016. His defence of Virgin Records in the 1977 obscenity hearing for their use of the word bollocks in the title of the Sex Pistols album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, and the manager of the Nottingham branch of the Virgin record shop chain for the record's display in a window and its sale, led to the defendants' being found not guilty. Mortimer retired from the bar in 1984. Later writing career Mortimer is best remembered for creating a barrister named Horace Rumpole, inspired by his father Clifford,Robert McCrum, Mortimer Tribute, The Observer, p.29, 18 January 2009 whose speciality is defending those accused of crime in London's Old Bailey. Mortimer created Rumpole for a BBC Play For Today in 1975. Although not Mortimer's first choice of actor (in an interview on the DVD set, he said he wanted Alistair Sim \\"but he turned out to be dead so he couldn't take it on\\"), Australian born Leo McKern played the character with gusto and proved popular; accordingly, the idea was developed into a series, Rumpole of the Bailey, for Thames Television in which McKern again took the lead role. Mortimer also wrote a series of Rumpole books. In September‚ÄìOctober 2003, BBC Radio 4 broadcast four new 45-minute Rumpole plays by Mortimer with Timothy West in the title role. Mortimer also dramatised many of the real-life cases of the barrister Edward Marshall-Hall in a radio series featuring former Doctor Who star Tom Baker as the protagonist. Mortimer was credited with writing the script for Granada Television's 1981 serialization of Brideshead Revisited, based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh. However, Graham Lord's unofficial biography, John Mortimer: The Devil's Advocate,Published in United States as John Mortimer. The Secret Lives of Rumpole's Creator (New York, Thomas Dunne Books, 2006) revealed in 2005 that none of Mortimer's submitted scripts had in fact been used and that the screenplay was actually written by the series' producer and director. Mortimer adapted John Fowles's The Ebony Tower starring Laurence Olivier for Granada in 1984. In 1986, his adaptation of his own novel Paradise Postponed was televised. He wrote the script, based on the autobiography of Franco Zeffirelli, for the 1999 film Tea with Mussolini, directed by Zeffirelli and starring Joan Plowright, Cher, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. From 2004, Mortimer worked as a consultant for the politico-legal US \\"dramedy\\" television show Boston Legal.In appreciation of John Mortimer , csmonitor.com, 16 January 2009; accessed 13 January 2016. He developed his career as a dramatist by rising early to write before attending court, and his work in total includes over fifty books, plays, and scripts. Personal life Mortimer married Penelope Fletcher (he was her second husband), later better known as Penelope Mortimer, in 1949 and had a son, Jeremy Mortimer, and a daughter, Sally Silverman.Obituary: Penelope Ruth Mortimer , 1999 The unstable marriage inspired work by both writers, of which Penelope's novel, The Pumpkin Eater (1962), later made into the film of the same name, is the best known. The couple divorced in 1971 and he married Penelope Gollop in 1972. They had two daughters, Emily Mortimer (1971), and Rosie Mortimer (1984). He lived with his second wife in the village of Turville Heath in Buckinghamshire. The split with his first wife had been bitter, but they were on friendly terms by the time of her death in 1999. In September 2004, Graham Lord discovered the existence of a second son, Ross Bentley, conceived during a secret affair Mortimer pursued with the English actress Wendy Craig more than 40 years earlier,John Walsh \\"Wit, flirt, genius: John Mortimer dies aged 85\\" , The Independent, 17 January 2009 who was born in November 1961. Craig and Mortimer had met when the actress had been cast playing a pregnant woman in Mortimer's first full-length West End play, The Wrong Side of the Park. Ross Bentley was raised by Craig and her husband, Jack Bentley, the show business writer and musician. In Mortimer's memoirs, Clinging to the Wreckage, he wrote of \\"enjoying my mid-thirties and all the pleasures which come to a young writer.\\" Honours Awarded the CBE in 1986, he was knighted in 1998. Death Mortimer suffered a stroke in October 2008.

In 2016, there were 182,701 inhabitants, around 3.5% of the total population of Norway. Its area was about . The county administration was located in its largest city, Kristiansand. Shipping, commerce, and recreation are the main industries here. Compared to other counties of Norway, Vest-Agder is noted for having the highest level of foreign exports. Another international dimension linked to the county is the large-scale emigration to North America that took place from the 1850s and onwards, which resulted in many Americans returning to the county after Norway became prosperous. This feature is particularly predominant in Kvinesdal and Farsund, which maintains strong cultural links with the United States. General information=Name= The meaning of the name is \\"(the) western (part of) Agder\\". See also: Aust-Agder Lister og Mandal amt was created on 1 January 1662 and it consisted of the two old lens of Lister and Mandal. This name continued until 1 January 1919, when the name was changed to Vest-Agder. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 12 December 1958. They show an oak tree in yellow on a green background, representing the rich nature in the area. Geography Vest-Agder county house in Kristiansand Vest-Agder is the western and southernmost part of the current county of Agder, extending inland from the North Sea and its arm, the Skagerrak, to the southern fringes of Setesdalen, surrounded by the mountain range Setesdalsheiene. It includes the southernmost point of the entire country, Pysen island south of Mandal, and the southernmost part of continental Norway, Lindesnes. It has a very broken and hilly surface. From the coast there are six valleys that stretch north into the county: Audnedalen, Lyngdalen, Kvinesdalen, Mandalen, Sirdalen, and Otradalen (which continues into Aust-Agder where it is called Setesdalen). Most of the habitation lies along the coast, including the towns Kristiansand, Mandal, Flekkefjord, and Farsund. About 31 fjords are located there. The northern portion is mountainous and sparsely settled, while the central upland moors are used for pasturing of cattle and sheep. Since the Gulf Stream touches the coast of Vest-Agder, it is also called \\"the Norwegian Riviera\\", and Agder as a whole is also called \\"The California of Norway\\". History In the 16th century, Dutch merchant vessels began to visit ports in southern Norway to purchase salmon and other goods. Soon thereafter the export of timber began, as oak from southern Norway was exceptionally well suited for shipbuilding. As the Netherlands developed in the 17th century, it began to suffer from a severe labor shortage, and many families from Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder emigrated to the Netherlands, especially the coastal areas. In the 19th century, emigration to the United States started. One of the most important causes of this emigration was the emergence of steamships. While Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder had historically had very strong positions in the manufacture and repair of sailing ships, the change to steam resulted in very hard times for this industry. Emigration to the United States was a means of escaping from the high unemployment that followed. Municipalities On 1 January 1838, all the counties were divided into local administrative units each with their own governments (see formannskapsdistrikt). The number and borders of these municipalities were based on the parishes of the Church of Norway. Over time the number and locations of these have changed, and at present there are 15 municipalities in Vest-Agder. The municipality of √Öseral was part of the neighboring county of Nedenes until 1880, when it was moved to Vest-Agder. = Municipalties before 2020 = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - bgcolor=\\"pink\\" !

Hordaland was the third largest county after Akershus and Oslo by population. The county government was the Hordaland County Municipality which is located in Bergen. Before 1972, the city of Bergen was its own separate county apart from Hordaland. On 1 January 2020, the county was merged with neighbouring Sogn og Fjordane county to form the new Vestland county.  Name and symbols = Name = Hordaland (Old Norse: H«´r√∞aland) is the old name of the region which was revived in 1919. The first element is the plural genitive case of h«´r√∞ar, the name of an old Germanic tribe (see Charudes). The last element is land which means \\"land\\" or \\"region\\" in the Norwegian language. Until 1919 the name of the county was S√∏ndre Bergenhus amt which meant \\"(the) southern (part of) Bergenhus amt\\". (The old Bergenhus amt was created in 1662 and was divided into Northern and Southern parts in 1763.) = Flag = The flag of Hordaland Hordaland's flag shows two golden axes and a crown in red. The flag is a banner of the coat of arms derived from the old seal of the guild of St. Olav from Onarheim in Tysnes municipality. This seal was used by the delegates of Sunnhordland in 1344 on the document to install king Haakon V of Norway. It was thus the oldest symbol used for the region and adapted as the arms and flag in 1961. The symbols refer to the patron saint of the guild, Saint Olav, King of Norway, whose symbol is an axe. = Coat of arms = The coat-of-arms were officially granted on 1 December 1961. They were designed by Magnus Hardeland, but the general design had been originally used in the Sunnhordland region during the 14th century. In the early 20th century, leaders of the county began using the old arms as a symbol for the county once again. The arms are on a red background and consist of two golden axes that are crossed with a golden crown above them.  History  Hordaland county has been around for more than one thousand years. Since the 7th century, the area was made up of many petty kingdoms under the Gulating and was known as Hordafylke since around the year 900. In the early 16th century, Norway was divided into four len. The Bergenhus len was headquartered in Bergen and encompassed much of western and northern Norway. In 1662, the lens were replaced by amts. Bergenhus amt originally consisted of the present-day areas of Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Sunnm√∏re and the far northern Nordlandene amt was subordinate to Bergenhus. In the 1680s, Nordlandene and Sunnm√∏re were split from Bergenhus. In 1763, the amt was divided into northern and southern parts: Nordre Bergenhus amt and S√∏ndre Bergenhus amt. When the amt was split, the present day municipality of Gulen was split with the southern part ending up in S√∏ndre Bergenhus amt. In 1773, the border was re-drawn so that all of Gulen was located in the northern part. S√∏ndre Bergenhus amt was renamed Hordaland fylke in 1919. The city of Bergen was classified as a city-county (byamt) from 1831‚Äì1972. During that time in 1915, the municipality of √Örstad was annexed into Bergen. In 1972, the neighbouring municipalities of Arna, Fana, Laksev√•g and √Ösane were annexed into the city of Bergen. Also at that same time, the city of Bergen lost its county status, and became a part of Hordaland county.  Government  Hardanger is one of Norway's most important sources of fruit, providing approximately 40% of the country's fruit production, including apples, plums, pears, cherries, and redcurrants. A county (fylke) is the chief local administrative area in Norway. The whole country is divided into 19 counties. A county is also an election area, with popular votes taking place every 4 years. In Hordaland, the government of the county is the Hordaland County Municipality. It includes 57 members are elected to form a county council (Fylkesting). Heading the Fylkesting is the county mayor (fylkesordf√∏rar). Since 2015, the Hordaland county municipality has been led by Anne Gine Hestetun, the county mayor. The county also has a County Governor (fylkesmann) who is the representative of the King and Government of Norway. Lars Sponheim is the current County Governor of Hordaland. The municipalities in Hordaland are divided among four district courts (tingrett): Nordhordland, Sunnhordland, Bergen, and Hardanger. Hordaland is also part of the Gulating Court of Appeal district based in Bergen.:no:Hordaland * Nordhordland District Court: Ask√∏y, Austevoll, Austrheim, Fedje, Fjell, Fusa, Lind√•s, Masfjorden, Meland, Modalen, Os, Oster√∏y, Rad√∏y, Samnanger, Sund, Vaksdal, Voss, √òygarden, and Gulen (Gulen is actually in neighbouring Sogn og Fjordane county) * Sunnhordland District Court: B√∏mlo, Etne, Fitjar, Kvinnherad, Stord, Sveio and Tysnes * Bergen District Court: the city of Bergen * Hardanger District Court: Eidfjord, Granvin, Jondal, Kvam, Odda, Ullensvang and Ulvik Most of the municipalities in Hordaland are part of the Hordaland police district.

Hordaland is semi-circular in shape. It is located on the western coast of Norway, split from southwest to northeast by the long, deep Hardangerfjorden, one of Norway's main fjords and a great tourist attraction. About half of the National park of Hardangervidda is in this county. The county also includes many well-known waterfalls, such as V√∏ringsfossen and Stykkjedalsfossen. It also includes the Folgefonna and Hardangerj√∏kulen glaciers. More than 60% of the inhabitants live in Bergen and the surrounding area. Other urban or semi-urban centres include Leirvik, Voss and Odda.

Bordering previous counties M√∏re og Romsdal, Oppland, Buskerud, and Hordaland, the county administration was in the village of Hermansverk in Leikanger municipality. The largest town in the county was F√∏rde. Although Sogn og Fjordane has some industry, predominantly hydroelectricity and aluminium, it is predominantly an agricultural area. Sogn og Fjordane is also home to the Urnes Stave Church and the N√¶r√∏yfjord, which are both listed by UNESCO as world heritage sites. The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences has campuses in Sogndal and F√∏rde. Name The name Sogn og Fjordane was created in 1919; a literal translation is: Sogn and the fjords. The first element is the name of the region of Sogn, located in the southern part of the county. The last element is the plural definite form of fjord, which refers to the two regions in the county called Nordfjord and Sunnfjord in the northern and central parts of the county. Prior to 1919, the name of the county was Nordre Bergenhus amt which meant \\"(the) northern (part of) Bergenhus amt\\". (The old Bergenhus amt, created in 1662, was divided into northern and southern halves in 1763.) Coat of arms The coat of arms of Sogn og Fjordane was granted on 23 September 1983. The arms show the geographical layout of the county: three large blue fjords protruding into the white colored land. The three fjords represent the three regions of the county: Nordfjord (surrounding Nordfjorden), Sunnfjord (with F√∏rdefjorden), and Sogn (surrounding Sognefjorden). Nearly all villages and towns are situated along one of these fjords and the name of the county is based on the fjords. Written standard Sogn og Fjordane is the only county in Norway in which all municipalities have declared Nynorsk to be their official written form of the Norwegian language. History The county currently consists of the two historic counties: Firdafylke (now the Fjordane region; Nordfjord-Sunnfjord) and Sygnafylke (now the Sogn region). These both were formed in the Middle Ages under the Gulating government. They were merged with Hordafylke (now Hordaland) and Sunnm√∏rafylke (now Sunnm√∏re) to form the Bergenhus len in the late Middle Ages. The Bergenhus len was one of four len in Norway. It was administered from the Bergenhus Fortress in the city of Bergen.:no:Sogn og Fjordane On 19 February 1662, a royal decree changed the name to Bergenhus amt. The Sunnm√∏re region was moved to Romsdalen amt in 1689. Later, in 1763, the amt was divided in half creating: Nordre Bergenhus and S√∏ndre Bergenhus (Northern and Southern Bergenhus). Later, on 1 January 1919, Nordre Bergenhus amt was renamed Sogn og Fjordane fylke during a period of time when many location names in Norway were changed. Government A county (fylke) is the chief local administrative area in Norway. The country is divided into 19 counties. A county is also an election area, with popular votes taking place every 4 years. The Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality is the government that oversees the county. It is a group of 39 members who are elected to form a county council (Fylkesting). Heading the Fylkesting is the county mayor (fylkesordf√∏rar). Since 2011, the Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality has been led by √Öshild Kjelsnes, the county mayor. She replaced Nils R. Sandal who was county mayor from 2003 until 2011. The county also has a County Governor (fylkesmann) who is the representative of the King and Government of Norway. Anne Karin Hamre has been the County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane since 2011. Oddvar Fl√¶te was county governor from 1994 until 2011. The municipalities of Sogn og Fjordane are divided among three district courts (tingrett): Sogn, Fjordane, and Nordhordland. Sogn og Fjordane is also part of the Gulating Court of Appeal district based in Bergen. * Sogn District Court: Aurland, Balestrand, Leikanger, Luster, L√¶rdal, Sogndal, Vik, and √Ördal * Fjordane District Court: Askvoll, Bremanger, Eid, Fjaler, Flora, F√∏rde, Gaular, Gloppen, Hornindal, Hyllestad, H√∏yanger, J√∏lster, Naustdal, Selje, Solund, Stryn, and V√•gs√∏y * Nordhordland District Court: Gulen (and the rest of the Nordhordland district of the county of Hordaland) All of the municipalities of Sogn og Fjordane except Gulen and Solund are part of the Sogn og Fjordane police district. Gulen and Solund are part of the Hordaland police district.  Geography  It is mainly a rural area with a scattered population. Sogn og Fjordane includes the largest glacier in mainland Norway, Jostedalsbreen, in the Breheimen mountain range, and the deepest lake, Hornindalsvatnet. There are also many famous waterfalls located in the area. Ramnefjellsfossen (previously called Utigardfossen) is the tallest in Norway and third tallest in the world and Vettisfossen is one of Norway's highest waterfalls with a vertical drop of . Both are located in the Jotunheim mountains. Cruise ships visit Sogn og Fjordane all summer because of the unique vistas of high mountains and deep blue fjords. The famous N√¶r√∏yfjord is located in the south of the county. This is a UNESCO listed fjord area. There are several archipelagos, including Bulandet, Bremangerlandet and islands around Flor√∏. The westernmost point in Norway proper is Holmeb√•en in Solund municipality. The island of Unst, part of Shetland Islands is around west of Holmeb√•en. The terrain changes quite rapidly with mostly smaller mountains on the coastline, gradually increasing to mountains reaching more than . Because of the steep rise in elevation and fjords cutting through the terrain, the amount of precipitation is very high. Low pressure systems come in from the west and meet the mountains (a phenomenon known as orographic lifting) and cause rain and snowfall. Transport Transport is made more difficult because of the fjords and the mountains. The fjords have to be crossed by ferries or rounded, often a large detour. There are four airports in the county, at Flor√∏, F√∏rde, Sandane and Sogndal. There is only one railway station, Fl√•m. The county contracts bus and boat companies for bus and boat routes in the county, under the new (2015) brand name Kringom. Districts The county is conventionally divided into three traditional districts. These are Sogn (in the south), Sunnfjord (in the centre), and Nordfjord (in the north). Sogn surrounds Sognefjorden from Solund on the offshore island of Sula in the North Sea to the village of Skjolden in Luster along Lustrafjorden, a branch of the Sognefjord. The total length is . The middle district of Sunnfjord actually has two main fjords: F√∏rdefjorden and Dalsfjorden. The northern district surrounds Nordfjorden. Municipalities Map of current municipalities in Sogn og Fjordane county In 1837, the counties were divided into local administrative units, each with their own governments. The number and borders of these municipalities have changed over time, and at present there are 26 municipalities in Sogn og Fjordane. Originally the municipalities were the same as the old Church of Norway parishes. # Askvoll # Aurland # √Ördal # Balestrand # Bremanger # Eid # Fjaler # Flora # F√∏rde # Gaular # Gloppen # Gulen # Hornindal # Hyllestad # H√∏yanger # J√∏lster # Leikanger # Luster # L√¶rdal # Naustdal # Selje # Sogndal # Solund # Stryn # Vik # V√•gs√∏y Cities * Flor√∏ * F√∏rde * M√•l√∏y Parishes * Arnafjord * Askrova * Askvoll * Aurland * Bakka * Balestrand (Tjugum) * Batalden * Berle * Bjordal * Borgund * Old Borgund * Breim * Brekke * Bremanger * Bremangerpollen * Bru (Svan√∏) * Bygstad (Svan√∏) * Bulandet * B√∏ * Dale i Fjaler * Dale i Luster * Davik * Eid * Eikefjord * Ervik * Farnes * Feios (Rinde) * Fet * Fjaler (Ytre Holmedal) * Fj√¶rland (Mundal) * Flor√∏ * Fl√•m * Folkestad * Fortun * Fresvik * Fr√∏ya * F√∏rde * Gaular * Old Gaupne * Gaupne * Gimmestad * Old Gimmestad * Gjemmestad * Gloppen * Guddal * Gulen (Evindvik) * Hafslo * Hauge * Heggjabygda * Helgheim * Haukedalen * Hellevik * Hersvik * Hestad * Holmedal * Holsen * Hopperstad * Hornindal * Hove * Hus√∏y (Hus√∏) * Hyen * Hyllestad * H√∏yanger * Indre Holmedal, see Gaular * Innvik * Joranger * Jostedal * J√∏lster * Kaupanger * Kinn (Kinden) * Kirkeb√∏, see Kyrkjeb√∏ * Kj√∏lsdalen * Kvams√∏y * Kyrkjeb√∏ * Lavik * Leikanger * Leikanger (Leganger) i Selje * Ljosheim * Loen * Luster (Lyster) * L√¶rdal * Midtgulen * Mj√∏mna (Mj√∏men) * Mundal (Fj√¶reland) * Naustdal (N√∏ssedal) * Nedstryn * Nes * Nordal * Norddalsfjord * Nord-V√•gs√∏y * Nordsida * Norum * N√¶r√∏y * Olden * Old Olden * Oppstryn * Ortnevik * Randabygd * Rinde * Rugsund * Sandane * Sande * Selje * Sogndal * Solund (Sulen) * Solvorn * Stavang * Stedje * Stongfjorden * Stryn (Innvik) * St√•rheim * Sulen, see Solund * Svan√∏y * Svelgen * S√¶le * S√∏r-V√•gs√∏yS√∏r-V√•gs√∏y * Tjugum (Balestrand) * Totland * T√∏njum * Undredal * Urnes * Utvik * Vangen * Vangsnes * Vassenden * Veitastrond * Vereid * Vereide * Vevring (Vefring) * Vik * Vik (Hopperstad, Hove) * Viksdalen * Vilnes * V√¶rlandet * Ytre Holmedal, see Fjaler * √òlmheim * √òn * √Ölfoten * √Ölhus * √Ördal Villages * Arnafjord * Askvoll * Aurlandsvangen * Austreim * Bakka * Balestrand * Barekstadlandet * Barmen * Barm√∏ya * Berle * Bjordal * Borgund * Brands√∏y * Brekke * Bremanger * Bruland * Brulandet * Bryggja * Bygstad * Byrkjelo * Byrknes * Dale * Dals√∏yra * Davik * Degnepoll * Deknepollen * Dingja * Eikefjord * Eimhjellen * Eivindvik * Egge * Ervik * Espedal * Feios * Fimreite * Fj√¶rland * Flatraket * Flekke * Flo * Fl√•m * Fortun * Fresvik * Fr√∏nningen * Gaupne * Gimmestad * Grod√•s * Grov * Guddal * Gudvangen * Hafslo * Hardbakke * Haukedalen * Heggjabygda * Helgheim * Helle * Hermansverk * Hersvikbygda * Hestad * Holvik * Holmedal * Holsen * Hopland * Hovden * Hyen * Hyllestad * H√•vik * H√∏yanger * Indre Offerdal * Indrevevring * Innvik * Instefjord * Isane * Jostedal * Kalv√•g * Kandal * Kaupanger * Kj√∏lsdalen * Kj√∏rnes * Kolgrov * Kvalheim * Kvammen * Kvams√∏y * Kyrkjeb√∏ * Langenes * Langhaugane * Lavik * Leikanger * Leikanger * Leirvik * Loen * Losnegard * Lote * Luster * L√¶rdals√∏yri * Midtgulen * Mj√∏mna * Mogrenda * Myrdal * Naustdal * Nedstryn * Nes * Nese * Norane * Norddalsfjord * Nordfjordeid * Nornes * Nordsida * Nyttingnes * Olden * Oppstryn * Ornes * Ortnevik * Randabygda * Raudeberg * Re * Reed * Refvik * Rognaldsv√•g * Roset * Rugsund * Rutledal * Rygg * Sandane * Sande * Seimsdalen * Selje * Silda * Skei * Skjolden * Skorpa * Sogndalsfj√∏ra * Solvorn * Stavang * Steinhovden * Stongfjorden * Straume * Stryn * St√•rheim * Svan√∏ya * Svelgen * S√∏rb√∏v√•gen * S√∏rstranda * Systrond * Tenneb√∏ * Totland * Tjugum * T√∏njum * Undredal * Urnes * Utvik * Vadheim * Vangsnes * Vassenden * Vedvik * Veitastrond * Vereide * Vik * Vik√∏yri * V√•gsv√•g * Ytre Oppedal * √òvre √Ördal * √Ölfoten * √Ölhus * √Ördalstangen Former Municipalities * Borgund * Breim * Brekke * Bru * Davik * Eikefjord * Flor√∏ * Hafslo * Innvik * Jostedal * Kinn * Kyrkjeb√∏ * Lavik * Lavik og Brekke * Nord-V√•gs√∏y * S√∏r-V√•gs√∏y * Vevring Gallery File:Myklebustdalen-sanddal-fjordane.jpgMyklebustdalen valley east of Byrkjelo File:Stadt Hoddevik.jpgThe village of Hoddevik on the Stad peninsula in Selje File:Laerdalsoyri03.jpgSome old houses in L√¶rdals√∏yri, L√¶rdal File:Norway Aurland Laerdal.jpgView from Aurland See also * List of villages in Sogn og Fjordane * List of churches in Sogn og Fjordane References External links  * County web site * NRK County encyclopedia * Firda ‚Äì Sogn og Fjordane's largest newspaper * forum.firda.no ‚Äì Sogn og Fjordane's largest discussion group Category:Former counties of Norway Category:History of Vestland Category:2020 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Sogn og Fjordane"},{"id":"171193","title":"Hedmark"},{"id":"171194","title":"Oppland"},{"id":"171197","text":"Jean Crotti, New York, circa 1915 Jean Crotti, 1915, Portrait of Marcel Duchamp (Sculpture made to measure), mixed media.

Crotti was born in Bulle, Fribourg, Switzerland. He first studied in Munich, Germany at the School of Decorative Arts, then at age 23 moved to Paris to study art at the Acad√©mie Julian. Initially he was influenced by Impressionism, then by Fauvism and Art Nouveau. Around 1910 he began to experiment with Orphism, an offshoot of Cubism, and a style that would be enhanced by his association in New York City with Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia. A refugee from World War I, he looked to America as a place where he could live and develop his art. In New York, he shared a studio with Marcel Duchamp and met his sister, Suzanne Duchamp. She was part of the Dada movement in which Crotti would become involved. In 1916, he exhibited Orphist-like paintings, several of which had religious titles that also included his Portrait of Marcel Duchamp and his much discussed Les Forces M√àcaniques de l'amour Mouvement, created by using found objects. In the fall of 1916, Crotti separated from his wife, Yvonne Chastel, and returned to Paris. He had begun a relationship with Suzanne Duchamp that would culminate in his divorce in 1919 and immediate marriage to Suzanne. An artist in her own right, she would greatly influence Jean Crotti's painting. In 1920, he produced one of his best known works, a portrait of Thomas Edison. He would be part of the 1925 Exposition International in Paris, and the International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926 - 1927. Over the ensuing years, he would create numerous paintings and be the subject for several solo exhibitions at major galleries in England, France, Germany, and the United States. Crotti died in Paris. Jean Crotti's heirs donated his personal papers to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, where they can be consulted by researchers.Jean Crotti Papers, 1910-1973. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. In Spring 2011, Francis M. Naumann Fine Art showed an exhibition, Inhabiting Abstraction, including important examples from every significant phase and development in the realm of abstraction that Crotti explored, as well as one-of-a-kind works such as \\"Parterre de reve\\" (1920), in which he framed his painting palette and then signed it.

Cotton carder (known as dhunuri or lep wallah) in Howrah, Kolkata, India. Carding is a mechanical process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibres to produce a continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing. This is achieved by passing the fibres between differentially moving surfaces covered with card clothing. It breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibres to be parallel with each other. In preparing wool fibre for spinning, carding is the step that comes after teasing. The word is derived from the Latin carduus meaning thistle or teasel, as dried vegetable teasels were first used to comb the raw wool. Overview These ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre: Cotton, batting, felt, woollen or worsted yarn, etc. Carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours. When blending, the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix. Commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool. Common to all carders is card clothing. Card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded. The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the card clothing product developed during the latter half of the 19th century and was found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller, became known as metallic card clothing. Carding machines are known as cards. Fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning. History Cloth worker using a teasel frame to card cloth, 15th century stained-glass window, Notre Dame de Semur- en-Auxois, France. A \\"Cotton carder\\". An old engraving copied from artist Pierre Sonnerat's 1782 illustration. Science historian Joseph Needham ascribes the invention of bow-instruments used in textile technology to India. The earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from India (2nd century CE). These carding devices, called kaman (bow) and dhunaki, would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string. At the turn of the eighteenth century, wool in England was being carded using pairs of hand cards, in a two-stage process: 'working' with the cards opposed and 'stripping' where they are in parallel. In 1748 Lewis Paul of Birmingham, England, invented two hand driven carding machines. The first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals. This failed. On the second, a coat of wire slips was placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder. Daniel Bourn obtained a similar patent in the same year, and probably used it in his spinning mill at Leominster, but this burnt down in 1754. The invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton. Arkwright's second patent (of 1775) for his carding machine was subsequently declared invalid (1785) because it lacked originality. From the 1780s, the carding machines were set up in mills in the north of England and mid-Wales. Priority was given to cotton but woollen fibres were being carded in Yorkshire in 1780. With woollen, two carding machines were used: the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres, the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web. The first in Wales was in a factory at Dolobran near Meifod in 1789. These carding mills produced yarn particularly for the Welsh flannel industry. In 1834 James Walton invented the first practical machines to use a wire card. He patented this machine and also a new form of card with layers of cloth and rubber. The combination of these two inventions became the standard for the carding industry, using machines first built by Parr, Curtis and Walton in Ancoats, and from 1857 by Jams Walton & Sons at Haughton Dale. By 1838, the Spen Valley, centred on Cleckheaton had at least 11 card clothing factories and by 1893, it was generally accepted as the card cloth capital of the world, though by 2008 only two manufacturers of metallic and flexible card clothing remained in England, Garnett Wire Ltd. dating back to 1851 and Joseph Sellers & Son Ltd established in 1840. Baird from Scotland took carding to Leicester, Massachusetts in the 1780s. In the 1890s, the town produced one-third of all hand and machine cards in North America. John and Arthur Slater, from Saddleworth went over to work with Slater in 1793. A 1780s scribbling mill would be driven by a water wheel. There were 170 scribbling mills around Leeds at that time. Each scribbler would require to operate. Modern machines are driven by belting from an electric motor or an overhead shaft via two pulleys. Cotton manufacturing processes Carding machine Carding: the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow) at the conclusion of this stage. ::The cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered with small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres. In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of willowing, lapping, carding and drawing. In willowing the fibres are loosened. In lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres; Carding itself is the combing of the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, it can then be optionally combed, is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn. A Combing machine In drawing a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one. Repeated drawing increases the quality of the sliver allowing for finer counts to be spun. Each sliver will have thin and thick spots, and by combining several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the slubbing frame which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. Intermediate Frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the roving frames reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube. Hand carding Predating mechanised weaving, hand loom weaving was a cottage industry that used the same processes but on a smaller scale. These skills have survived as an artisan craft in less developed societies- and as art form and hobby in advanced societies. =Hand carders= Creating a rolag using hand cards. Irreler Bauerntradition shows carding, spinning and knitting in the Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum. Hand cards are typically square or rectangular paddles manufactured in a variety of sizes from to . The working face of each paddle can be flat or cylindrically curved and wears the card cloth. Small cards, called flick cards, are used to flick the ends of a lock of fibre, or to tease out some strands for spinning off. A pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction. The aligned fibre is then peeled from the card as a rolag. Carding is an activity normally done outside or over a drop cloth, depending on the wool's cleanliness. Rolag is peeled from the card. A carding machine in Haikou, Hainan Province, China. This product (rovings, rolags, and batts) can be used for spinning. Carding of wool can either be done \\"in the grease\\" or not, depending on the type of machine and on the spinner's preference. \\"In the grease\\" means that the lanolin that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out, leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel. The large drum carders do not tend to get along well with lanolin, so most commercial worsted and woollen mills wash the wool before carding. Hand carders (and small drum carders too, though the directions may not recommend it) can be used to card lanolin rich wool. =Drum carders= Carding Llama hair with a hand-cranked drum carder. The simplest machine carder is the drum carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked but some are powered by an electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with card clothing. The licker- in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain- drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's card cloth. Fibre is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full. Some drum carders have a soft-bristled brush attachment that presses the fibre into the storage drum. This attachment serves to condense the fibres already in the card cloth and adds a small amount of additional straightening to the condensed fibre. =Cottage carders= Cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card. These carders do not store fibre in the card cloth as the drum carder does but, rather, fibre passes through the workings of the carder for storage or for additional processing by other machines. A typical cottage carder has a single large drum (the swift) accompanied by a pair of in-feed rollers (nippers), one or more pairs of worker and stripper rollers, a fancy, and a doffer. In-feed to the carder is usually accomplished by hand or by conveyor belt and often the output of the cottage carder is stored as a batt or further processed into roving and wound into bumps with an accessory bump winder. The cottage carder in the image below supports both outputs. Raw fibre, placed on the in-feed table or conveyor is moved to the nippers which restrain and meter the fiber onto the swift. As they are transferred to the swift, many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift's card cloth. These fibres will be carried past the worker / stripper rollers to the fancy. As the swift carries the fibres forward, from the nippers, those fibres that are not yet straightened are picked up by a worker and carried over the top to its paired stripper. Relative to the surface speed of the swift, the worker turns quite slowly. This has the effect of reversing the fibre. The stripper, which turns at a higher speed than the worker, pulls fibres from the worker and passes them to the swift. The stripper's relative surface speed is slower than the swift's so the swift pulls the fibres from the stripper for additional straightening. Straightened fibres are carried by the swift to the fancy. The fancy's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer. The fancy and the swift are the only rollers in the carding process that actually touch. The slowly turning doffer removes the fibres from the swift and carries them to the fly comb where they are stripped from the doffer. A fine web of more or less parallel fibre, a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder's rollers, exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing.

(born Eric Barrier) and MC Rakim (born William Michael Griffin Jr.). AllMusic wrote that \\"during rap's so-called golden age in the late '80s, Eric B. & Rakim were almost universally recognized as the premier DJ/MC team in all of hip-hop.\\" Tom Terrell of NPR called them \\"the most influential DJ/MC combo in contemporary pop music period.\\" The editors of About.com ranked them as No. 5 on their list of the 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time, and Rolling Stone ranked them No. 5 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Career=Early years and Paid in Full= Eric Barrier was born and raised in the East Elmhurst section of Queens, New York. He played trumpet and drums throughout high school, and later switched to experimenting with turntables prior to graduation. The newly dubbed \\"Eric B.\\" soon began DJing for radio station WBLS in New York City, including WBLS' promotional events around the city. Barrier wound up meeting Alvin Toney, a promoter based in Queens. Eric B. had been looking for rappers and Toney recommended he use Freddie Foxxx, a Long Island MC. Toney took Eric B. to Foxxx's home, but Foxxx was not there, so Toney suggested another option: William Griffin, a.k.a. Rakim. Eric B. & Rakim began their critically acclaimed partnership in 1986 with the release of \\"Eric B. is President\\" / \\"My Melody\\". Griffin had begun writing rhymes as a teenager in Wyandanch and had taken the name \\"Rakim\\" as a result of his conversion to The Nation of Gods and Earths. Eric B. borrowed records from Rakim's brother, Stevie Blass Griffin (who worked at a plant pressing bootleg albums) and began cutting them in the basement for Rakim, who was down there drinking a beer and relaxing. Said Eric B., \\"I took Fonda Rae's \\"Over Like A Fat Rat\\" and said 'This is the bass line I'm going to use for this record.' Rakim spit the beer all over the wall and thought it was the funniest shit in the world. I told Rakim, just like you laughing now you going to be laughing all the way to the bank and be a millionaire one day because of this record.\\" Eric B. & Rakim decided to record together and came under the tutelage of Marley Marl. Stories vary over who actually produced their first single, 1986s \\"Eric B. Is President\\" (often cited as \\"Eric B For President\\" because of a mistake made when licensing the recording). Built on the Fonda Rea bass line sample, Eric B. later told AllHipHop, \\"I took the records to Marley Marl's house in Queensbridge and paid Marley Marl to be the engineer. Marley got paid. That's why he's not a producer; that's why he is not getting publishing. I brought the music. I just couldn't work the equipment because that's not what I did...\\" The duo recorded its debut album, Paid in Full, at Power Play Studios in New York. The album was named in part after the Paid in Full posse, a notorious New York collective of gangsters and rappers: including the original 50 Cent, Killer Ben, Kool G Rap and Freddie Foxxx. The Paid in Full posse are featured on the back cover of the album. In 1987, 4th & B'way Records issued the album. After the success of \\"Eric B. is President\\", the album climbed into the Top Ten on the US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Eric B. would later admit that the album was rushed. \\"The reason Paid In Full is so short is because we stood in the studio for damn-near a week. The whole album came together in a week. Listen to the lyrics on it and listen to how short they are. That's because Rakim wrote it right there and we'd been in the studio like for a whole forty- eight hours trying to get the album finished.\\" Rakim agrees: \\"[I] used to write my rhymes in the studio and go right into the booth and read them. When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes - but I'm my worst critic. That's what I hear, though - because that's what it was. I'd go into the studio, put the beat down, write the song in like an hour, and go into the booth and read it from the paper...\\" Marley Marl stated that his cousin MC Shan was an assistant engineer on some tracks, including the single \\"My Melody,\\" though Eric B. denies this. MTV listed the album as the greatest in hip hop history: 'When Paid in Full was released in 1987, Eric B. and Rakim left a mushroom cloud over the hip-hop community. The album was captivating, profound, innovative and instantly influential. MCs like Run-DMC, Chuck D and KRS-One had been leaping on the mic shouting with energy and irreverence, but Rakim took a methodical approach to his microphone fiending. He had a slow flow, and every line was blunt, mesmeric. And Eric B. had an ear for picking out loops and samples drenched with soul and turned out to be a trailblazer for producers in the coming years.' The record has sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1995. On the heels of the albums' success, the duo signed a deal with MCA. =Follow the Leader and Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em= Follow the Leader, the duo's follow-up to Paid In Full; saw their production move away from the blunt minimalism of their debut. The title track and \\"Lyrics of Fury\\" were two of Rakim's most acclaimed lyrical performances. In 2003, comedian Chris Rock referred to Rakim's rhymes on the \\"...Fury\\" as 'lyrically, the best rapping anyone's ever done...' Rock also listed Follow the Leader as 12th on his Vibe magazine's list of the Top 25 Hip Hop Albums of All-Time. At the time, the record went largely unnoticed by the mainstream music industry. In 1989, the pair teamed up with Jody Watley on her single \\"Friends\\" from the album Larger Than Life. The song would reach the Top Ten on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was one of the first notable collaborations between hip hop and dance pop. Eric B. & Rakim rarely collaborated with other rappers. This was evident in early 1990, when KRS-One's Stop the Violence Movement put together the charity single \\"Self-Destruction\\". The song featured numerous notable rappers, but Rakim was noticeably absent from the proceedings. He told HalftimeOnline.net years later, \\"I don't think they hollered at me or they hollered at Eric B. and he didn't say anything to me. I was a little bitter with that shit because I felt I had something to do with bringing consciousness in hip hop to the table. I came out and did what I did in '86 and then you know people started running with it. Then when it comes time to do something they didn't holler at me so I was a little bitter. At the same time a lot of reasons I didn't do records with people is because I never wanted their light to reflect on me. I don't have a problem with it but everybody who knows at that time knows they were trying to say I was responsible for gangsta rap, too. They thought I was that dude in the hood so maybe they didn't holler at me for a reason. I love Kris, though ‚Äî he definitely contributed a lot to hip hop. I've been on tour with him and I know him as a person. He's a good dude. I like Kris, but they definitely didn't holler at me for that man because I would have definitely did it.\\" Their 1990 album Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em was not as successful commercially as their first two LPs. Rakim referenced his enigmatic reputation on the song \\"Set 'Em Straight\\": \\"Here's the inside scoop on the fiend/They want to know why I'm seldom seen/'Cause who needs the TV screens and magazines/Or shooting through the city in fly limousines/'Cause one thing I don't need is a spotlight/'Cause I already got light...\\" He later said about his relative lack of commercial success: \\"You could sell a couple records and keep your integrity or you could go pop and sell a bunch of records and be gone tomorrow. I was trying to stick to my guns at that point.\\" Mark Coleman of Rolling Stone stated: > \\"There's nothing trendy about this impassive duo, no Steely Dan bites or > bits of Afrodelic rhetoric here. Eric B. and Rakim are hip-hop formalists > devoted to upholding the Seventies funk canon and advancing rap's original > verbal mandate. Almost every track on their third album is built on poetic > boasts and wicked J.B. samples, but dismissing Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em as > some sort of conservative reaction ‚Äì a gold-chain throwback ‚Äì completely > misses the point. Masters of their appointed tasks, rapper Rakim and Eric B. > are also formal innovators. They both can riff and improvise like jazzmen, > spinning endless variations on basic themes and playing off each other's > moves with chilly intuition. The resulting music is as stark, complex and > edgy as Rakim's stone-cold stare on the album cover.\\" The album was one of the first to receive the honor of a 5 mic rating in The Source. But, much like their debut album, there exists controversy over the production credit. =Don't Sweat the Technique and split up= The duo made an appearance on the soundtrack for the 1991 comedy House Party 2, (\\"What's On Your Mind\\") and also recorded the theme for the film, Juice. Both singles were included on what would become the duo's last album together. Don't Sweat the Technique was released in 1992. The album was not supposed to be the last; but their contract with MCA was due to expire. During the recording of the album, both members expressed an interest in recording solo albums. However, Eric B. refused to sign the label's release contract, fearful that Rakim would abandon him. This led to a court case involving the two musicians and their former label. The legal wrangling eventually led to the duo dissolving completely. Eric B. has clarified that the monetary problems stemmed from labels like Island and others claiming ownership of the masters ‚Äî not from any financial disputes between him and Rakim: > \\"The money got split 50 /50 from the door, because I remember people would > try to keep shit going. When we first came out, people were saying 'Eric was > getting all the money' and 'he was trying to shine more than Rakim,' but > that's not true. [I] would go to all the interviews, [because] Rakim didn't > want to go to the interviews. He didn't like that part of the business. > [But] we split all the money from dime one. I don't care what money I spent > in the past, that money is never coming back. Whatever money we made, we > split 50/50. Even up until now, we split every dime 50/50.\\" =Post-breakup and legacy= Eric B. released a self-titled solo album in 1995 on the independent label 95th Street Recordings. Legal issues continued to delay Rakim's solo career, but he finally released The 18th Letter in 1997. In 1999, Rakim's second solo album The Master was released to less favorable reviews. By the turn of the millennium, Eric B. was pursuing other business interests outside of music. Rakim signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label in 2000, but the expected album never materialized. Since then, Rakim has made guest appearances with numerous other artists such as Jay-Z (\\"The Watcher, Part 2\\"), Truth Hurts (\\"Addictive\\"), Nas, KRS-One and Kanye West (\\"Classic\\"). In 2002, \\"Don't Sweat The Technique\\" appeared in the video game Aggressive Inline. In 2004 \\"I Know You Got Soul\\" appeared on the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on Playback FM. In November 2009, Rakim released The Seventh Seal. Ownership of the duo's catalog consolidated in 1999, when PolyGram (which owned Island Records, which released Paid in Full) merged with Universal Music Group, an outgrowth of MCA Records, which owned the rest of the duo's albums. Eric B. & Rakim were announced as one of fifteen finalists to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in September 2011. =Reunion= On October 20, 2016, Eric B. announced via Twitter that he and Rakim have reunited as a duo after 23 years and would tour in 2017. This was confirmed by Eric B's business representative Uncle Louie during an interview with Rolling Stone. The duo's first reunion concert was held at the Apollo Theater in New York City on July 7, 2017. In 2018, they announced a 17-date American tour for that spring. =Loss of material= On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Eric B. & Rakim among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Artistry=Rapping technique= Rakim's rhyming deviated from the simple rhyme patterns of early 1980s hip hop. His free-rhythm style ignored bar lines and had earned comparisons to Thelonious Monk. The New York Times Ben Ratliff wrote that Rakim's \\"unblustery rapping developed the form beyond the flat-footed rhythms of schoolyard rhymes\\".Ratliff, Ben. Review: Paid in Full. The New York Times. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.

Calvin Johnson, Heather Lewis, and Bret Lunsford have been the band's continual members. Beat Happening were early leaders in the American indie pop and lo-fi movements, noted for their use of primitive recording techniques, disregard for the technical aspects of musicianship, and songs with subject matters of a childish or coy nature. History=Formation= Beat Happening met while attending The Evergreen State College and began recording in 1983. The band took its name from a student art film, Beatnik Happening, made by Bret's girlfriend. The band's basic line-up was drums, guitar and vocals, though when they formed their only instruments were a pair of maracas and a Sears Silvertone guitar purchased at a thrift shop. Heather once joked in an interview that the history of the band could be told through a list of the various people whose drums they'd borrowed. Heather and Calvin had been members of a previous band and approached Bret, who had no musical experience at the time, saying they ought to start a band and go to Japan. Early recordings made use of an Echoplex machine to add heavy reverb to Bret's guitar, in an attempt to mask his poor performance. The band traveled to Tokyo in 1984 with intentions of touring. Their first show in Japan was at the high school of a former exchange student Calvin knew. The band members recorded Three Tea Breakfast, a 5-song EP that marked the band's first release. =Studio albums= Beat Happening (1985), their full-length debut, was critically acclaimed, as was Jamboree (1988). By the release of Dreamy in 1991, Beat Happening was one of the most popular bands in the indie rock community, leading to their pivotal role in the International Pop Underground Festival, which brought anti-corporate rock its earliest mainstream acceptance. Their last full-length album was 1992's You Turn Me On, which represented the band breaking many of their established conventions from earlier albums, most notably on \\"Godsend\\", which runs 9 minutes and features blatant use of multitrack recording. The album was described by allmusic.com as a \\"masterpiece.\\" Though never announcing a break-up and claiming at one point to still practice once a month, the members of Beat Happening have moved on to various other projects. In 2000 they released the \\"Angel Gone\\" single, their first new release in eight years. Crashing Through, which collects all of the band's officially released music except for two of their tracks from a live cassette split with The Vaselines, was released in 2002. The box set included a booklet containing a lengthy essay on the history and impact of the band by Lois Maffeo, as well as rare photos of Calvin, Heather, and Bret. In September 2015, the band announced the release of a new compilation spanning their entire career entitled Look Around, set to be released on Domino Records. With the full cooperation of the band and Calvin's K Records label, Domino released a vinyl box set of the entire Beat Happening discography, We Are Beat Happening, in November of 2019. =Influence= The English indie-pop band This Many Boyfriends are named after a Beat Happening song - namely The This Many Boyfriends Club. The band's live performances stood out for Calvin's pogo, hula, and shimmy moves, which he'd seen on news reports about UK punks. It did not ingratiate the band to hardcore audiences when they toured with Fugazi in the late 1980s, and audiences were openly hostile, even throwing an ashtray at the band. Nonetheless, rock critic Michael Azzerrad suggests that Beat Happening \\"was a major force in widening the idea of a punk rocker from a mohawked guy in a motorcycle jacket to a nerdy girl in a cardigan.\\" The presence of Heather Lewis on drums and Calvin's non-threatening stage presence presented a wider variety of punk identities and genders than other acts in the hardcore scene of the time, which was predominantly male. Beat Happening has been cited as an influence on early riot grrl acts such as Bratmobile and Kathi Wilcox of Bikini Kill. Kurt Cobain had the K Records logo tattooed on his forearm, saying it was to \\"try and remind me to stay a child.\\" The song \\"Lounge Act\\" on Nevermind references his logo tattoo in the line, ‚ÄúI'll arrest myself and wear a shield.‚Äù Cobain also played guitar on a K Records release, \\"Bikini Twilight,\\" with Johnson, released as The Go Team. Calvin Johnson was one of the founders of indie-rock label K Records. =Current status= Though not officially broken up, the band has not performed together in public since the early 1990s. In 2005, they were invited by Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties but respectfully declined.

Amelanchier is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxonomically in North America, especially in the northeastern United States and adjacent southeastern Canada, and at least one species is native to every U.S. state except Hawaii and to every Canadian province and territory. Two species also occur in Asia, and one in Europe. The taxonomic classification of shadbushes has long perplexed botanists, horticulturalists, and others, as suggested by the range in number of species recognized in the genus, from 6 to 33, in two recent publications. A major source of complexity comes from the occurrence of hybridization, polyploidy, and apomixis (asexual seed production), making species difficult to characterize and identify.University of Maine: Amelanchier Systematics and Evolution The various species of Amelanchier grow to 0.2‚Äì20 m tall; some are small trees, some are multistemmed, clump-forming shrubs, and yet others form extensive low shrubby patches (clones). The bark is gray or less often brown, and in tree species smooth or fissuring when older. The leaves are deciduous, cauline, alternate, simple, lanceolate to elliptic to orbiculate, 0.5‚Äì10 x 0.5‚Äì5.5 cm, thin to coriaceous, with surfaces above glabrous or densely tomentose at flowering, and glabrous or more or less hairy beneath at maturity. The inflorescences are terminal, with 1‚Äì20 flowers, erect or drooping, either in clusters of one to four flowers, or in racemes with 4‚Äì20 flowers. The flowers have five white (rarely somewhat pink, yellow, or streaked with red), linear to orbiculate petals, 2.6‚Äì25 mm long, with the petals in one species (A. nantucketensis) often andropetalous (bearing apical microsporangia adaxially). The flowers appear in early spring, \\"when the shad run\\" according to North-American tradition (leading to names such as \\"shadbush\\"). The fruit is a berry-like pome, red to purple to nearly black at maturity, 5‚Äì15 mm diameter, insipid to delectably sweet, maturing in summer. Amelanchier plants are valued horticulturally, and their fruits are important to wildlife.

Several natural or horticultural hybrids also exist, and many A. arborea and A. canadensis plants that are offered for sale are actually hybrids, or entirely different species. A. √ó grandiflora is another hybrid of garden origin, between A. arborea and A. laevis. The cultivar 'La Paloma' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. A taxon called Amelanchier lamarckii (or A. x lamarckii) is very widely cultivated and naturalized in Europe, where it was introduced in the 17th century. It is apomictic, breeding true from seed, and probably of hybrid origin, perhaps descending from a cross between A. laevis and either A. arborea or A. canadensis. While A. lamarckii is known to be of North American origin, probably from eastern Canada, it is not known to occur naturally in the wild in North America.Bean, W. J. (1976). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 1. John Murray .Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . Etymology The origin of the generic name Amelanchier is probably derived from amalenqui√®r, amelanchi√®r, the Proven√ßal names of the European Amelanchier ovalis.Jepson Flora: Amelanchier alnifolia The name serviceberry comes from the similarity of the fruit to the related European Sorbus. A fanciful etymology explains the name 'serviceberry' by noting that the flowers bloom about the time roads in the Appalachian mountains became passable, allowing circuit-riding preachers to resume church services. A similar etymology says that blooming serviceberry indicated the ground had thawed enough to dig graves, so burial services could be held for those who died in the winter when the only way to deal with the bodies was to allow them to freeze and wait for spring. Both of these fanciful etymologies are unlikely to be correct since the term is attested for both English and New World species as early as the 16th century, well before settlement of English North America,Oxford English Dictionary http://www.oed.com and serviceberry is far from unique in blossoming early in the year. Juneberry refers to the fruits of certain species becoming ripe in June. The name saskatoon originated from a Cree noun mis√¢skwat√¥mina (misƒÅskwat≈çmina, misaaskwatoomina) for Amelanchier alnifolia. The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is named after this plant. Shadberry refers to the shad runs in certain New England streams, which generally took place about when the trees bloomed. Ecology Amelanchier plants are preferred browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone moth, brown-tail, grey dagger, mottled umber, rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple and the white admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight. Fruit and leaves of Amelanchier ovalis Uses and cultivation The fruit of several species are excellent to eat raw, tasting somewhat like a blueberry, strongly accented by the almond-like flavour of the seeds. Selections from Amelanchier alnifolia have been chosen for fruit production, with several named cultivars. Other cultivars appear to be derived from hybridization between A. alnifolia and A. stolonifera. Propagation is by seed, divisions, and grafting. Serviceberries graft so readily that grafts onto other genera, such as Crataegus and Sorbus, are often successful. Fruit is harvested locally for pies and jams.https://www.youtube.com/watchv=wokPJzsV730&feature;=channel_page The saskatoon berry is harvested commercially. One version of the Native American food pemmican was flavored by serviceberry fruits in combination with minced dried meat and fat. The wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The heartwood is reddish-brown, and the sapwood is lighter in color. It can be used for tool handles and fishing rods. Native Americans used it for arrow shafts. Members of the Pit River Tribe would use the wood to create a sort of body armor, crafting it into a heavy robe or overcoat and corset armor worn during fighting.Merriam, C. Hart 1966 Ethnographic Notes on California Indian Tribes. University of California Archaeological Research Facility, Berkeley (p. 222) =Garden history= Several species are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their flowers, bark, and fall color. All need similar conditions to grow well, requiring good drainage, air circulation (to discourage leaf diseases), watering during drought, and soil appropriate for the species. George Washington planted specimens of Amelanchier on the grounds of his estate, Mount Vernon, in Virginia. ReferencesExternal links * Juneberry, in What Am I Eating?

Formed in Penilee in Glasgow in 1985, the Orchids released a series of underground singles on Sarah Records. The group's line-up comprised James Hackett (vocals), Pauline Hynds Bari (vocals), John Scally (guitar), Chris Quinn (drums), Matthew Drummond (guitar) and James Moody (bass). Their producer, Ian Carmichael, often played keyboards on their records. They changed their line up in 1993 when bassist James Moody left and Ronnie Borland, a long time collaborator and supporter of the band, took over on bass. They went quiet after their 1994 album release, their last on Sarah Records, only surfacing in 1995 to play at the Sarah Records farewell party. After that they took a break until 2004 when they got back together. Starting with a melancholy guitar pop sound on Lyceum and contemporaneous singles, they moved on to become more keyboard and sample/effects-based for their second and third albums, Unholy Soul and Striving For the Lazy Perfection, developing a more electronic sound, possibly as a result of their producer, Ian Carmichael, who was a member of dance band One Dove. Their entire back catalogue was re- released on CD on LTM in 2005. In 2007 they released their fourth album, Good to Be a Stranger. The album was issued on Madrid based label Siesta, with the band playing live gigs for the first time in eleven years. In 2010 the group released a fifth album, The Lost Star, through Pebble Records, mixed by a returning Ian Carmichael. In October 2014, they released their sixth album, Beatitude#9, on another Spanish record label Acurela. In September 2017, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their first physical release (a flexi disc on the sha la la label) they released a retrospective featuring 20 \\"best of\\" songs from their singles and albums plus an 18 track rarities disc.

Career The Field Mice initially formed as a duo from South London suburb of Mitcham comprising Robert Wratten (for vocals and guitar) and Michael Hiscock (on bass guitar). The group's first EP, Emma's House, was released in November 1988, and reached number 20 in the UK Independent Chart.Strong, Martin C.

The original duo were joined by Harvey Williams (of Another Sunny Day) on guitar: the first fruits of this new line-up being the Skywriting mini-LP and in late 1990 the band expanded to include Anne Mari Davies on vocals, keyboards and guitar and Mark Dobson on drums. This five-piece line-up later recorded what was to be their final album (but their first full length for Sarah Records), For Keeps. Over a three-year career, the band were often dogged with the reputation of having a post-C86 indie pop, or generic Sarah Records sound, despite producing tracks with numerous styles and influences. Early singles and even their sleeves harked back to early Factory Records bands such as New Order and The Wake, with many tracks often featuring sequencers and samples. Many of the group's recordings, notably \\"Triangle\\" and their epic seven-minute swan song, \\"Missing the Moon\\", displayed a strong influence from the popular dance music of the time. Most of the group's records were produced by Ian Catt, who later went on to develop the pop dance sound of \\"Missing The Moon\\" further with Saint Etienne (whose second single was a cover version of The Field Mice's \\"Let's Kiss and Make Up\\"). Split and legacy The band split up in 1991 after a fractious tour to promote the For Keeps album, during which lead singer/guitarist Robert Wratten announced he was leaving. Later, Field Mice members Wratten, Anne Mari Davies (Wratten's ex-girlfriend), and Mark Dobson briefly formed Yesterday Sky before becoming the more synth-oriented outfit Northern Picture Library, and then Wratten went on to form Trembling Blue Stars in 1995. A double-album compilation of the now long-deleted Field Mice releases, Where'd You Learn to Kiss That Way? was released in 1998 and sold more copies than any Field Mice record ever sold at the time. Their entire back catalogue was reissued on CD for the first time by LTM Recordings in 2005.

Juvenile's career began in the early 1990s as a teenager with bounce music recordings that made him a local star. He released his debut album Being Myself in 1995. After signing to Cash Money, Juvenile released Solja Rags in 1997, which included the major local hit \\"Solja Rag\\". A year later, he released the multi-platinum 400 Degreez, which included his first nationwide hits \\"Ha\\" and \\"Back That Azz Up\\". He released other successful solo albums for Cash Money: Tha G-Code, Project English and Juve the Great, which included the number-one hit \\"Slow Motion\\". After leaving Cash Money, Juvenile has released several other albums, including The Beginning of the End with group UTP, which included the anthem \\"Nolia Clap\\" and the solo number-one album Reality Check. Music career=1994‚Äì97: Beginnings, Being Myself and Solja Rags= Juvenile was raised in the Magnolia Projects of New Orleans. He first began recording his raps in the early 1990s. Juvenile's debut album, Being Myself, was released in 1995 after signing with Warlock Records. The album did not gain much national attention and did not chart, but did fairly well on a local level. After the regional success of his debut Juvenile signed to the larger Cash Money Records. In 1997 Solja Rags, Juvenile's debut album with Cash Money Records, was released. It became popular among local rap audiences, and also saw some national success as it charted on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was the first time he worked with Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh, who would go on to produce all of Juvenile's albums on Cash Money in their entirety except Juve the Great. Also in 1997, Juvenile joined the Hot Boys with fellow Cash Money rappers B.G., Turk, and Lil Wayne. They released their debut album as a group, titled Get It How U Live!. =1998‚Äì2002: 400 Degreez, Tha G-Code and Project English= Juvenile's next album, titled 400 Degreez, was released in 1998. It was his breakout to the national rap scene. The Cash Money label now had joint distribution by Universal Records, which gave the music much more national promotion. This along with much more critically praised music made Juvenile a mainstream star. The album's first single \\"Ha\\" and later \\"Back That Azz Up\\" both became very successful songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Powered by these two singles, 400 Degreez was eventually certified 4X platinum by the RIAA. It is his best selling album to date. However, there came a dispute over who owned the rights to the title of \\"Back That Azz Up\\", as another New Orleans performer DJ Jubilee claimed that Juvenile's song sounded very similar to a song of his. In January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans denied the case. In 1998, capitalizing off Juvenile's popularity off 400 Degreez, a remixed version of Being Myself and reissue of Solja Rags were released. The second Hot Boys group album, Guerrilla Warfare also came out and was successful, being certified Platinum. Over the next few years Juvenile released two more solo albums for Cash Money: Tha G-Code in 1999 being certified Double Platinum, and Project English in 2001 being certified Platinum. These albums each were very successful as they both reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 200, but they did not match the success of 400 Degreez. UTP Records had promised an album titled 600 Degreez but it never materialized. =2003‚Äì2006: Juve the Great and Reality Check= Juvenile's manager Aubrey Francis and Cash Money's Baby met and worked out a deal for Juve and CMR to partner for another album. Juvenile returned to Cash Money Records in 2003, releasing Juve the Great. Juve The Great was certified Platinum; it featured the number-one hit \\"Slow Motion\\" featuring Soulja Slim. It was the only number-one hit for Juvenile and Slim before Slim died in November 2003. The last Hot Boys album Let 'Em Burn came out in 2003. In 2005 Juvenile signed a new deal with Atlantic Records for himself, and also a separate label deal for his UTP Records imprint. UTP Records is the label that was started by Juve along with his longtime manager Aubrey \\"Pied Piper\\" Francis, and older brother Corey. The group called \\"UTP\\" (Juve, Skip, and Wacko) released the hit song \\"Nolia Clap\\" as part of UTP Records first album release. It was produced by Juve along with producer XL Robertson. Atlantic Records. Juvenile also performed the song \\"Booty Language\\". It was part of the soundtrack for the movie Hustle And Flow. Juve performed alongside fellow Atlantic artist at the movies premier party in West Hollywood, California. Juvenile's Slidell, Louisiana home was damaged during Hurricane Katrina. Juvenile and fellow New Orleans rapper Master P and other hip hop artists raised funds and supplies for some hurricane victims. He moved to Atlanta briefly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In Spring 2006 he returned home to New Orleans. Reality Check, Juvenile's 2006 album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, being his first number-one album. It was certified Gold. Production began in May 2005, most of it being done at a Holiday Inn hotel room in New Orleans. Its first single was \\"Animal\\", followed by \\"Rodeo\\", \\"Get Ya Hustle On\\" produced by Donald XL Robertson, \\"What's Happenin'\\" Produced by Terrence \\"Sinista\\" Freeman, and \\"Way I Be Leanin'\\" featuring Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Skip, and Wacko. A portion of the album was recorded with engineer, Stewart Cararas at his studio Paradigm Park Studios in New Orleans. Within one month, the studio suffered the wrath of Hurricane Katrina. Stewart now lives and operates in Los Angeles. On signing to Atlantic, Juvenile criticized his former label Cash Money for not giving him enough creative freedoms as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency over his perceptions over their handling of Hurricane Katrina. Shaheem Reid noted \\"Get Ya Hustle On\\" as a criticism of Ray Nagin's and the George W. Bush administration's handling of the whole Hurricane Katrina Disaster. =2007‚Äì13: Cocky & Confident, Beast Mode and Rejuvenation= In a 2009 interview with Allhiphop.com writer Han O'Connor, Juvenile stated that his album Cocky & Confident would take a totally different direction from his last project, which was made when he was still \\"mourning Katrina.\\" He also revealed that he decided to work only with fresh, young producers on the album and discussed his respect for younger artists like Soulja Boy. Cocky & Confident was released in December 2009. It peaked at #49 on the Billboard 200. It was Juvenile's lowest charting album since 1997. It featured one charting single, \\"Gotta Get It\\", which peaked at #53 on the Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles chart. Following this album's release Juvenile began work on his next album, Beast Mode. This album was released in July 2010. Its first single is titled \\"Drop That Thang\\". Juvenile released his tenth studio album Rejuvenation on June 19, 2012, which was distributed by Rap-A-Lot Records. The first single from the album is \\"Power\\" featuring Rick Ross. Juvenile collaborated with Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled, and Drake for the album. =2014‚Äìpresent: The Fundamentals and Cash Money Reunion= On February 18, 2014, Juvenile released his eleventh studio album The Fundamentals. On October 28, 2014, Juvenile announced and confirmed that he re-signed to Cash Money. On March 28, 2019, both Juvenile and Birdman released a joint album called Just Another Gangsta.Birdman & Juvenile Reunite For \\"Just Another Gangsta\\" Project Personal life Juvenile had a daughter, Jelani, with Joy Deleston. On February 29, 2008, 4-year-old Jelani was shot and killed in her home, along with mother Deleston and older half sister. It was reported that Deleston's oldest child, 17-year-old son Anthony Tyrone Terrell Jr., returned to the home after police arrived and implicated himself in the murder of his mother and siblings. Terrell was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of aggravated assault. He remains in the DeKalb County jail. Though Juvenile received some criticism for not attending the funeral for his daughter and her mother, several statements were released that the rapper was \\"shocked and devastated\\" by the event. The rapper stated that he made the decision not to appear at the funeral to prevent subsequent media attention, and was concerned that it would divert attention away from the ceremony. Terrell was given two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to killing Joy Deleston, 39, and her daughters, Micaiah, 11, and Jelani. Due to his age, he could not be sentenced to death in Georgia. He endorsed Tom Steyer in the 2020 United States presidential election. A video of him dancing with Steyer to his hit song \\"Back That Azz Up\\" went viral on the internet shortly before the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary was held. =Legal troubles= In the summer of 2002, Juvenile was arrested for assaulting his barber over charges that the barber was bootlegging his music. In January 2003, Juvenile was arrested in New Orleans on drug charges. The next month, he was sentenced to 75 hours of community service for a fight outside a nightclub in Miami, Florida in 2001. Juvenile was involved in a legal dispute over failure to pay child support for his daughter Jelani with Joy Deleston, a deputy sheriff in Gwinnett County, Georgia. A paternity lawsuit was issued by Deleston in 2004, resulting in a DNA test and both parties agreeing that Juvenile was Jelani's father. His attorney stated that the case was resolved peacefully by consent order in 2006. On February 25, 2010, Juvenile was arrested in Arabi, Louisiana. While Juvenile was recording music at a house there, a neighbor called police to report smelling marijuana. He was cited on a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession and later released on bond. He pleaded guilty in August 2010 and received a suspended three-month jail sentence and six months of probation and paid a $250 fine and court costs. In 2013, Juvenile was arrested for failing to pay $170,000 in child support.

Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429 (1895), affirmed on rehearing, 158 U.S. 601 (1895), was a landmark case of the Supreme Court of the United States. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the income tax imposed by the Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff Act for being an unapportioned direct tax. The decision was superseded in 1913 by the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allows Congress to levy income taxes without apportioning them among the states. Congress had previously introduced an income tax during the American Civil War, but this tax had been repealed in 1872. In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, which lowered tariff rates and made up for some of the lost revenue by introducing taxes on income, corporate profits, gifts, and inheritances. Chief Justice Melville Fuller's majority opinion in Pollock held that a federal tax on income derived from property was unconstitutional when it was not apportioned among the states according to representation in the United States House of Representatives. Fuller also held that federal taxation of interest earned on certain state bonds violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. In one dissent, Associate Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote that the majority opinion \\"involves nothing less than the surrender of the taxing power to the moneyed class.\\" The Court's decision in Pollock was unpopular, but it effectively prevented Congress from implementing another income tax over the next two decades since the apportionment requirements were widely regarded as unworkable. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment essentially overturned the key holding in Pollock, and Congress established a new federal income tax in the Revenue Act of 1913. The Court's holding regarding the taxation of interest income on certain bonds was later overruled in the 1988 case of South Carolina v. Baker.  Before Pollock =Early income tax= In order to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War, Congress imposed the first federal income tax in U.S. history through passage of the Revenue Act of 1861.Joseph A. Hill, \\"The Civil War Income Tax,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 8, No. 4 (Jul., 1894), pp. 416‚Äì452 in JSTOR; appendix in JSTOR The act created a flat tax of three percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms). This taxation of income reflected the increasing amount of wealth held in stocks and bonds rather than property, which the federal government had taxed in the past.Weisman (2002), pp. 30‚Äì35. Congress later further raised taxes, and by the end of the war, the income tax constituted about one-fifth of the revenue of the federal government. The federal income tax remained in effect until its repeal in 1872.Weisman (2002), pp. 99‚Äì101. The constitutionality of the federal income tax was later upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1881 case of Springer v. United States. The Socialist Labor Party advocated a graduated income tax in 1887.Socialist Labor Party Platform The Populist Party \\"demanded a graduated income tax\\" in its 1892 platform.Populist Party Platform, 1892 =Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act= After winning control of Congress and the presidency in the 1892 elections, the Democratic Party made tariff reduction a key priority.Weisman, 120, 131 President Grover Cleveland and his congressional allies proposed a bill that affected moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.Nevins, 564‚Äì566; Jeffers, 285‚Äì287 The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000, equivalent to $ today. Corporate profits, gifts, and inheritances would also be taxed at a two percent rate.Welch, 132‚Äì133 The bill would restore the federal income tax for the first time since the 1870s; supporters of the income tax believed that it would help reduce income inequality and shift the burden of taxation to the wealthy.Weisman, 122‚Äì124, 137‚Äì139. The Cleveland administration were ambivalent about the income tax, but it was included in the proposed bill due in large part to the efforts of Congressmen William Jennings Bryan and Benton McMillin.Weisman, 132‚Äì133 Despite strong conservative opposition to the income tax in the Senate, it remained a component of the final tariff bill, partly because many members of Congress believed that the Supreme Court would eventually declare the tax to be unconstitutional.Weisman, 144‚Äì145 In August 1894, the bill became law as the Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff Act.  Plaintiff  In compliance with the Act, the New York-based Farmers' Loan & Trust Company announced to its shareholders that it would not only pay the tax but also provide, to the collector of internal revenue in the Department of the Treasury, the names of all people for whom the company was acting and thus were liable for being taxed under the Act. Charles Pollock was a Massachusetts citizen who owned only ten shares of stock in the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company. He sued the company to prevent the company from paying the tax. He lost in the lower courts but finally appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Arguing for Pollock was Joseph Hodges Choate, one of the most eminent Wall Street lawyers of his day.Irons, Peter. A People's History of the Supreme Court. New York, Penguin, 1999, p. 244.  Decision  The Court handed down its decision on April 8, 1895, with Chief Justice Melville Fuller delivering the opinion of the Court. He ruled in Pollock's favor, stating that the taxes levied by the Wilson-Gorman Act on income from property were unconstitutional. The Court treated the tax on income from property as a direct tax. The Constitution of the United States then said that such direct taxes were required to be imposed in proportion to the states' population. The tax in question had not been apportioned and so was invalid. As Chief Justice Fuller stated: > First.

Instead, the Court held that although generally income taxes are indirect taxes (excises) authorized by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, taxes on interest, dividends and rents in the 1894 Act had a profound effect on the underlying assets. The Court ruled that the tax on dividends, interest and rent should be viewed as a direct tax, as they fell on the property itself, rather than as an indirect tax. Direct taxes were required to follow the rule of apportionment found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3. The rule of apportionment requires the amount of a direct tax collected to be divided by the number of members in the United States House of Representatives, with the quotient then multiplied by the number of representatives each state has to determine each state's share of the tax that it then needs to lay and collect, through its own taxing authority. A separate holding by the Court in Pollock, that federal taxation of interest earned on certain state bonds violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, was declared by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 to have been \\"effectively overruled by subsequent case law\\" (see South Carolina v. Baker). = Dissent = Justices John Marshall Harlan, Howell Edmunds Jackson, Edward Douglass White, and Henry Billings Brown dissented from the majority opinion. Justice White argued: > It is, I submit, greatly to be deplored that after more than 100 years of > our national existence, after the government has withstood the strain of > foreign wars and the dread ordeal of civil strife, and its people have > become united and powerful, this court should consider itself compelled to > go back to a long repudiated and rejected theory of the constitution, by > which the government is deprived of an inherent attribute of its being‚Äîa > necessary power of taxation.158 U.S. 638 In his dissent, Justice Brown wrote: > The decision involves nothing less than the surrender of the taxing power to > the moneyed class.

Even the > spectre of socialism is conjured up to frighten Congress from laying taxes > upon the people in proportion to their ability to pay them.Irons, p. 245.  Subsequent history  In the years after Pollock, Congress did not implement another federal income tax, partly because many Congressmen feared that any tax would be struck down by the Supreme Court.Weisman 2002, p. 177 Few considered attempting to impose an apportioned income tax, since such a tax was widely regarded as unworkable. Justice Harlan had predicted this in his dissent in Pollock, writing, > When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does now adjudge, that Congress > cannot impose a duty or tax upon personal property, or upon income arising > either from rents of real estate or from personal property, including > invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds, > except by apportioning the sum to be so raised among the States according to > population, it practically decides that, without an amendment of the > Constitution‚Äîtwo-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the > States concurring‚Äîsuch property and incomes can never be made to contribute > to the support of the national government.Harlan dissent to Pollock decision = Subsequent court treatments of Pollock and the Sixteenth Amendment = Nebraska Republican Senator Norris Brown publicly decried the Court's decision in Pollock, and proposed a constitutional amendment to remove the requirement that certain income taxes to be apportioned among the states by population. Brown's proposal would be ratified in 1913 as the Sixteenth Amendment. (Pollock case \\"was in effect reversed by the sixteenth amendment\\").\\"The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution overruled Pollock [....]\\" Graf v. Commissioner, 44 T.C.M. (CCH) 66, TC Memo. 1982-317, CCH December 39,080(M) (1982). The Sixteenth Amendment removed the requirement for those income taxes deemed to be direct in substance (such as taxes on income from property) to be apportioned among the states according to population. Thus, the effect of the Pollock decision has indeed been overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment.William D. Andrews, Basic Federal Income Taxation, p. 2, Little, Brown and Company (3d ed. 1985) (\\"In 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted, overrruling Pollock.\\").Calvin H.

Sebelius, no. 11-393; no. 11-398; no. 11-400 (p. 41, slip opinion, U.S. Supreme Court, June 28, 2012). The Revenue Act of 1913, which greatly lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax, was enacted shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.Weisman 2002, pp. 230‚Äì232, 278‚Äì282 Three years after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in the case of Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad. In Brushaber, the Court reviewed the history of the dichotomy between excises (indirect taxes) and direct taxes. The Brushaber Court noted that the 1913 Income Tax Act was written as an indirect tax and did not violate the rule of uniformity and so it was not written as a direct tax and thus was not subject to the rule of apportionment. The Court summarized what it had decided in Pollock and then went on to state the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment with respect to income taxes: > [T]he command of the amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to > the rule of apportionment by a consideration of the source from which the > taxed income may be derived forbids the application to such taxes of the > rule applied in the Pollock case by which alone such taxes were removed from > the great class of excises, duties, and imposts subject to the rule of > uniformity and were placed under the other or direct class.240 U.S. 1 18-19 > (1916). The Court in Brushaber also noted that before Pollock, taxes on income from professions, trades, employments, or vocations were excises. They were indirect in both form and substance and therefore had never been apportioned and so they were entitled to be so enforced afterwards.FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code By contrast, with respect to taxes on income from property, the Pollock decision had disregarded form and considered substance alone. Justice White's decision in Brushaber shows how the Sixteenth Amendment was written to prevent consideration of the direct effects of any income tax laid by Congress. The Supreme Court, in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., added that the \\"Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged.\\" 240 U.S. 112 (1916).Howard Zaritsky, Legislative Attorney American Law Division, \\"Some Constitutional Questions Regarding The Federal Income Tax Laws\\" Report No. 79-131 A, (Congressional Research Service Report for Congress) May 25, 1979. This effect was reaffirmed in Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., , in which the Supreme Court reviewed Pollock, the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and the Sixteenth Amendment. It concluded, \\"It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had power to tax all incomes.\\"  See also  * Hylton v.

He was one of the most prolific black musical arrangers and, along with Duke Ellington, is considered one of the most influential arrangers and bandleaders in jazz history. Henderson's influence was vast. He helped bridge the gap between the Dixieland and the swing eras. He was often known as \\"Smack\\" Henderson (because of smacking sounds he made with his lips). Biography Built by his father in 1888, the Fletcher Henderson House in Cuthbert, Georgia, where Henderson was born in 1897. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1982 James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson was born in Cuthbert, Georgia, in 1897. He grew up in a middle-class African-American family. His father, Fletcher Hamilton Henderson (1857‚Äì1943), was the principal of the nearby Howard Normal Randolph School from 1880 until 1942. His home, now known as the Fletcher Henderson House, is a historic site. His mother, a teacher, taught him and his brother Horace to play the piano. He began lessons by the age of six. His father would occasionally lock Fletcher in his room to practice for hours. By age 13, Henderson possessed a keen ability to read music and sense pitch. He pursued the studies with his mother and further engaged himself in lessons on European art. Although a talented musician, Henderson decided to dedicate himself to math and science. At age 18 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and changed his name to Fletcher Henderson, giving up James, his grandfather's name. He attended Atlanta University (where he was a member of the fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha) and graduated in 1920 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics. After graduation, he moved to New York City with the intention of attending Columbia University for a master's degree in chemistry, but there is no evidence that he actually enrolled. He did get a part-time job as a lab assistant in a downtown Manhattan chemistry firm, but this only lasted a year. In New York City, Henderson shared an apartment with a pianist who worked as a musician in a riverboat orchestra. When his roommate was too sick to perform, Henderson took his place, which soon gave him a job as a full-time replacement. In the fall of 1920 he found work as a song demonstrator with the Pace and Handy Music Co. Henderson now found that music would be more profitable than chemistry and left his job as a lab chemist to begin a life in music. When Pace left the company to start Black Swan Records, he took Henderson with him to be musical director, a job which lasted from 1921-1923. From 1920-1923, he primarily played piano accompaniment for blues singers. Henderson toured with the Black Swan Troubadours featuring Ethel Waters from October 1921 to July 1922. After hearing Louis Armstrong in New Orleans while on tour in April 1922, Henderson sent him an offer, but Armstrong refused because Henderson would not hire Zutty Singleton as well. His activities up to the end of 1923 were mainly recording dates for Black Swan and other labels. His band at this point was only a pick-up unit for recordings, not a regular working band. In January 1924 the recording band became the house band at the Club Alabam at 216 W. 44th St. Despite many erroneous publications indicating otherwise, this 1924 band was Henderson's first working band. In July 1924 the band began a brief engagement at the Roseland Ballroom. Although only meant to stay for a few months, the band was brought back for the autumn season. Henderson called on the 23-year-old cornetist Louis Armstrong for a second time to join the band. Henderson's offer on October 13, 1924 made history when the Henderson band began their re- engagement at Roseland with Armstrong now in the orchestra. Quickly the band became known as the best African-American band in New York. By late 1924 the arrangements by Don Redman were featuring more solo work. In addition to adding hot solos to arrangements, Redman arranged Armstrong's repertoire with the King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, such as turning \\"Dippermouth Blues\\" into \\"Sugar Foot Stomp.\\" Armstrong played in the band for only a year because he could not grow accustomed to the arrangements and to the \\"pretension\\" of the other band members. Despite this, his influence on the Henderson band and all jazz during this time cannot be overstated. Through his hot solos, knowledge of jazz repertoire, and introduction of clarinetist Buster Bailey to the band, Armstrong turned Henderson's Orchestra into a jazz band. Henderson's band boasted the formidable arranging talents of Don Redman. After Redman's departure from the band in 1927, Henderson took on some of the arranging, but Benny Carter was Redman's replacement as saxophone player and arranger from 1930‚Äì31, and Henderson also bought scores from freelance musicians (including John Nesbitt from McKinney's Cotton Pickers). Henderson developed his arranging skills from 1931 to the mid-1930s. His band c. 1925 included Howard Scott, Coleman Hawkins (who started with Henderson in 1923, playing the tuba parts on a bass saxophone, and quickly moving to tenor saxophone and a leading solo role), Louis Armstrong, Charlie Dixon, Kaiser Marshall, Buster Bailey, Elmer Chambers, Charlie Green, Ralph Escudero, and Don Redman. In 1925, with Henry Troy, he wrote \\"Gin House Blues\\", recorded by Bessie Smith and Nina Simone among others. His other compositions include \\"Soft Winds\\". Henderson recorded extensively in the 1920s for nearly every label, including Vocalion, Paramount, Columbia, Olympic, Ajax, Path√©, Perfect, Edison, Emerson, Brunswick, and the dime-store labels Banner, Oriole, Regal, Cameo, and Romeo. From 1925‚Äì1930, he recorded primarily for Columbia and Brunswick/ Vocalion under his own name and a series of acoustic recordings as the Dixie Stompers for Harmony Records and associated dime-store labels (Diva and Velvet Tone). During the 1930s, he recorded for Columbia, Crown (as \\"Connie's Inn Orchestra\\"), ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, Vocalion), Bluebird, Victor, and Decca. Starting in the early 1920s, he recorded popular hits and jazz tunes. In 1924 he and his band recorded 80 sides. His version of the pop tune \\"I Can't Get the One I Want\\", recorded about June 19, 1924, was issued on at least 23 labels. In addition to Armstrong, lead trumpeters included Henry \\"Red\\" Allen, Joe Smith, Rex Stewart, Tommy Ladnier, Doc Cheatham and Roy Eldridge. Lead saxophonists included Coleman Hawkins, Buster Bailey, Benny Carter and Chu Berry. Sun Ra also worked as an arranger during the 1940s, during Henderson's engagement at the Club DeLisa in Chicago. Sun Ra said that on first hearing Henderson's orchestra as a teenager he assumed that they were angels because no human could produce such beautiful music. Although Henderson's band was popular, he had little success in managing it. His lack of recognition outside of Harlem had to do more with the times in which he lived, apparently lackluster management, and the hard times that resulted after the 1929 stock market crash. Fletcher had a knack for finding talent, but he did not have much luck keeping it. On many occasions he lost talented members to other bandleaders. He also had trouble with finances. When the band split up in 1934, he was forced to sell some of his popular arrangements to Benny Goodman to keep them together. After about 1931, his own arrangements became influential. In addition to arrangements for his band, he wrote arrangements for Teddy Hill, Isham Jones and Benny Goodman. His shoulder was injured in an auto accident in 1928. His wife, Leora, blamed the accident for his diminishing success. She said that John Hammond and Goodman bought Henderson's arrangements to support him, that Goodman always gave Henderson credit for the arrangements and said that he played them better than his own. In addition, Goodman and Hammond organized broadcasts and recordings to help Henderson when he was ill.Reading Jazz, ed. Robert Gottlieb Four decades later, two of his songs, \\"Queer Notions\\" and \\"Yeah, Man!\\" were performed in the movie Kansas City. =Benny Goodman= In 1935, Goodman's Orchestra was selected as a house band for the NBC radio program Let's Dance. Since Goodman needed new charts every week for the show, his friend John Hammond suggested that he purchase some from Henderson. Many of Goodman's hits from the swing era were played by Henderson and his own band in the late 1920s and early 1930s, usually as head arrangements, which he transcribed from his own records and then sold to Goodman. However, his brother Horace Henderson recounted (in Ross Firestone's biography of Goodman, Swing, Swing, Swing) that the clarinetist made heavy demands on Henderson for fresh charts while his band was engaged for the Let's Dance show in 1934‚Äì35, and that he himself helped his brother complete some of them. The singer Helen Ward also stated that Henderson was delighted to hear the Goodman Orchestra realize his creations with such impeccable musicianship. In 1939, Henderson disbanded his band and joined Goodman's, first as pianist and arranger and then working full-time as staff arranger. He re-formed bands of his own several times in the 1940s and toured with Ethel Waters again in 1948‚Äì1949. Henderson suffered a stroke in 1950, resulting in partial paralysis that ended his days as a pianist. He died in New York City in 1952, eleven days after his 55th birthday. =Contributions to jazz and the Harlem Renaissance= Henderson, along with Don Redman, established the formula for swing music. The two broke the band into sections (sax section, trumpet section, etc). These sections worked together to create a unique sound. Sometimes, the sections would play in call- and-response style, and at other times one section would play supporting riffs behind the other. Swing, its popularity spanning over a decade, was the most fashionable form of jazz ever in the United States. Henderson was also responsible for bringing Louis Armstrong from Chicago to New York in October 1924, thus flipping the focal point of jazz in the history of the United States (although Armstrong left the band in November 1925 and returned to Chicago). Henderson also played a key role in bringing improvisatory jazz styles from New Orleans and other areas of the country to New York, where they merged with a dance-band tradition that relied heavily on arrangements written out in musical notation. A museum is being established in his memory in Cuthbert, Georgia. Henderson differed from other musicians in his time. He made the idea of playing jazz exclusively popular to ambitious, young, black musicians. He made it financially stable and a way to seize cultural power during the time. Henderson was genuine when it came to the appearance of the band. He was all for making an impact on the era. Henderson would intently see to it that each member had a clean-shaven face, a tuxedo, and polished shoes. It was recorded that he would do this before every performance, especially ones in predominantly white communities, such as Times Square. Henderson created a band that was capable of playing dance music and complex arrangements. Louis Metcalf said, \\"The sight of Fletcher Henderson's men playing behind music stands brought on a learning-to-read-music kick in Harlem which hadn't cared before it. There were two years of real concentration. Everybody greeted you with 'How's studying?'\\"Magee, Jeffrey (2000). \\"Before Louis: When Fletcher Henderson Was the 'Paul Whiteman of the Race'\\".

Formed in Bolln√§s, Sweden in 1991, they are led by guitarist Christer \\"Krunt\\" Andersson.

Their full-length debut was Leaving the Past Behind, released in 1993. In the subsequent decade the band went through numerous lineup changes, with Andersson as the only consistent member, and released a total of seven albums. The band released Modus Vivendi in 2004, which signaled a shift away from symphonic and progressive metal toward a more traditional metal sound. The band toured for several years after the release of Modus Vivindi, with several more lineup changes including a stint by singer Joe Comeau, but they were unable to return to the recording studio. Tad Morose reformed in 2013 with a new lineup featuring singer Ronny Hemlin, formerly of Steel Attack.

It is one of two genera in the family Psilotaceae, the other being Tmesipteris. Plants in these two genera were once thought to be descended from the earliest surviving vascular plants, but more recent phylogenies place them as basal ferns, as a sister group to Ophioglossales. They lack true roots and leaves, the stems being the organs containing conducting tissue. There are only two species in Psilotum and a hybrid between the two. They differ from those in Tmesipteris in having stems with many branches and a synangium with three lobes rather than two. Description and life cycle Whisk ferns in the genus Psilotum lack true roots but are anchored by creeping rhizomes. The stems have many branches with paired enations, which look like small leaves but have no vascular tissue. Above these enations there are synangia formed by the fusion of three sporangia and which produce the spores. When mature, the synangia release yellow to whitish spores which develop into a gametophyte less than long. The gametophyte lives underground as a saprophyte, sometimes in a mycorrhizal association. When the gametophyte is mature, it produces both egg and sperm cells. The sperm cells swim using several flagella and when they reach an egg cell, unite with it to form the young sporophyte. A mature sporophyte may grow to a height of or more but lacks true leaves. The stem has a core of thick-walled protostele in its centre surrounded by an endodermis which regulates the flow of water and nutrients. The surface of the stem is covered with stomata which allow gas exchange with the surroundings. The gametophyte of Psilotum is unusual in that it branches dichotomously, lives underground and possesses vascular tissue. The nutrition of the gametophyte appears to be myco-heterotrophic, assisted by endophytic fungi. Taxonomy and naming The genus Psilotum was first formally described in 1801 by Olof Swartz and the description was published in Journal f√ºr die Botanik (Schrader). The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek word psilos meaning \\"bare\\", \\"smooth\\" or \\"bald\\" referring to the lack of the usual plant organs, such as leaves. Species and distribution There are two species, Psilotum nudum and Psilotum complanatum, with a hybrid between them known, Psilotum √ó intermedium W. H. Wagner. The distribution of Psilotum is tropical and subtropical, in the New World, Asia, and the Pacific, with a few isolated populations in south-west Europe. The highest latitudes known are in South Carolina, C√°diz province in Spain, and southern Japan for P. nudum. In the U.S., P. nudum is found from Florida to Texas, and P. complanatum in Hawaii. Relation to ferns Psilotum superficially resembles certain extinct early vascular plants, such as the rhyniophytes and the trimerophyte genus Psilophyton. The unusual features of Psilotum that suggest an affinity with early vascular plants include dichotomously branching sporophytes, aerial stems arising from horizontal rhizomes, a simple vascular cylinder, homosporous and terminal eusporangia and a lack of roots. Unfortunately, no fossils of psilophytes are known to exist. A careful study of the morphology and anatomy suggests that whisk ferns are not closely related to rhyniophytes, and that the ancestral features present in living psilophytes represent a reduction from a more typical modern fern plant. Significant differences between Psilotum and the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes are that the development of its vascular strand is exarch, while it is centrarch in rhyniophytes and trimerophytes. The sporangia of Psilotum are trilocular synangia resulting from the fusion of three adjacent sporangia, and these are borne laterally on the axes. In the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes the sporangia were single and in a terminal position on branches. Molecular evidence strongly confirms that Psilotum is a fern (in the broad sense that includes horsetails) and that psilophytes are sister to ophioglossoid ferns.Qiu, Y-L and Palmer, J (1999) \\"Phylogeny of early land plants: insights from genes and genomes.\\" Trends in Plant Science 4(1), 26-30 References Category:Psilotaceae Category:Fern genera ","title":"Psilotum"},{"id":"171268","text":"Christopher Julius Rock (born February 7, 1965) is an American comedian, actor, television producer, and filmmaker. After working as a stand-up comedian and appearing in supporting film roles, Rock came to wider prominence as a cast member of Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s. He went on to more prominent film appearances, with starring roles in Down to Earth (2001), Head of State (2003), The Longest Yard (2005), the Madagascar film series (2005‚Äì2012), Grown Ups (2010), its sequel Grown Ups 2 (2013), Top Five (2014), and a series of acclaimed stand-up specials for HBO. He developed, wrote, and narrated the sitcom Everybody Hates Chris (2005‚Äì2009), which was based on his early life. Rock hosted the Academy Awards twice, in 2005 and in 2016. He has won four Emmy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He was voted the fifth-greatest stand-up comedian in a poll conducted by Comedy Central. He was also voted in the United Kingdom as the ninth-greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups in 2007, and again in the updated 2010 list as the eighth- greatest stand-up comic. Early life Christopher Julius Rock was born in Andrews, South Carolina on February 7, 1965.Sources differ on his year of birth. In his book Rock This!, Rock gives his birth date as February 7, 1966. However, Rock stated he was 42 years old on his February 28, 2007, appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which is pre-taped and not broadcast live. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. A few years later, they relocated and settled in the working class area of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant. His mother, Rosalie (n√©e Tingman), was a teacher and social worker for the mentally handicapped; his father, Julius Rock, was a truck driver and newspaper deliveryman. Julius died in 1988 after ulcer surgery. Rock's younger brothers Tony, Kenny, and Jordan are also in the entertainment business. His older half-brother, Charles, died in 2006 after a long struggle with alcoholism. Rock has said that he was influenced by the performing style of his paternal grandfather, Allen Rock, a preacher. Rock's family history was profiled on the PBS series African American Lives 2 in 2008. A DNA test showed that he is of Cameroonian descent, specifically from the Udeme (Ould√©m√©) people of northern Cameroon.Goffe, Leslie. \\"Americans seek their African roots\\" , BBC, June 29, 2009. Rock's great-great- grandfather, Julius Caesar Tingman, was a slave for 21 years before serving in the American Civil War as part of the United States Colored Troops. During the 1940s, Rock's paternal grandfather moved from South Carolina to New York City to become a taxicab driver and preacher. Rock was bused to schools in predominately white neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he endured bullying and beatings from white students. As he got older, the bullying became worse and Rock's parents pulled him out of James Madison High School. He dropped out of high school altogether, but he later earned a GED. Rock then worked menial jobs at various fast-food restaurants. Career=Early career= Rock began doing stand-up comedy in 1984 in New York City's Catch a Rising Star. He slowly rose up the ranks of the comedy circuit in addition to earning bit roles in the film I‚Äôm Gonna Git You Sucka and the TV series Miami Vice. Upon seeing his act at a nightclub, Eddie Murphy befriended and mentored the aspiring comic. Murphy gave Rock his first film role in Beverly Hills Cop II. =Saturday Night Live= Rock became a cast member of the popular sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live in 1990. He and other new cast members Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and David Spade became known as the Bad Boys of SNL. In 1991, he released his first comedy album, Born Suspect and won acclaim for his role as a crack addict in the film New Jack City. His tenure on SNL gave Rock national exposure. Rock has hosted SNL three times; in 1996, 2014 and 2020. =Standup success= left With plans to leave Saturday Night Live after the 1992‚Äì93 season, Rock was effectively \\"fired\\" from the show. Beginning that fall, he appeared in six episodes of the predominantly African- American sketch show In Living Color as a special guest star. The show was canceled a month after he arrived. Rock then wrote and starred in the low- budget comedy CB4, which made $18 million against its budget of $6 million. Rock starred in his first HBO comedy special in 1994 titled Big Ass Jokes as part of HBO Comedy Half-Hour. His second special, 1996's Bring the Pain, made Rock one of the most acclaimed and commercially successful comedians in the industry. Rock won two Emmy Awards for the special and gained large critical acclaim. The most well-known and controversial piece of the special was \\"Niggas vs. Black People\\". Adding to his popularity was his much-publicized role as a commentator for Comedy Central's Politically Incorrect during the 1996 Presidential elections, for which he earned another Emmy nomination. Rock also was the voice for the \\"Lil Penny\\" puppet who was the alter ego to basketball star Penny Hardaway in a series of Nike shoe commercials from 1994‚Äì1998, and hosted the '97 MTV Video Music Awards. Rock later had two more HBO comedy specials: Bigger & Blacker in 1999, and Never Scared in 2004. Articles relating to both specials called Rock \\"the funniest man in America\\" in Time and Entertainment Weekly. HBO also aired his talk show, The Chris Rock Show, which gained critical acclaim for Rock's interviews with celebrities and politicians. The show won an Emmy for writing. His television work has won him a total of three Emmy Awards and 15 nominations. By the end of the decade, Rock was established as one of the preeminent stand-up comedians and comic minds of his generation. During this time, Rock also translated his comedy into print form in the book Rock This! and released the Grammy Award-winning comedy albums, Roll with the New, Bigger & Blacker and Never Scared. Rock's fifth HBO special, Kill the Messenger, premiered on September 27, 2008, and won him another Emmy for outstanding writing for a variety or music program. On October 30, 2016, Netflix announced that they would be releasing two new stand-up comedy specials from Rock, with Rock being paid $40 million per special. The first special, Chris Rock: Tamborine, was released on Netflix on February 14, 2018. It was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The specials marked the comedian's first concert specials released in 10 years. =Film star= Rock at the Israeli premiere of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, on November 22, 2008 It was not until the success of his stand-up act in the late 1990s that Rock began receiving leading man status in films. Though he started off with supporting roles in films such as Dogma, Beverly Hills Ninja, Lethal Weapon 4, and Nurse Betty, he went on to star in films like The Longest Yard, Bad Company, and Down to Earth. Some of his 2010s film appearances include Death at a Funeral, Grown Ups, and 2 Days in New York. Rock has also increasingly worked behind the camera, both as a writer and director of Head of State and I Think I Love My Wife (both in which he played the lead role). Additionally, he has done voice work in the Madagascar animated film franchise, voicing the eccentric zebra Marty. Following the release of his first documentary, 2009's Good Hair, Rock is working on a documentary about debt called Credit Is the Devil. in 2014, Rock wrote, directed and starred in the critically acclaimed film Top Five, which critics have drawn comparison to Woody Allen's Stardust Memories. The film is a social commentary on fame and society. =Television producer= In the fall of 2005, the UPN television network premiered a comedy series called Everybody Hates Chris, loosely based on Rock's school days, of which he is the executive producer and narrator. The show has garnered both critical and ratings success. The series was nominated for a 2006 Golden Globe for Best TV Series (Musical or Comedy), a 2006 People's Choice Award for Favorite New Television Comedy, and two 2006 Emmy Awards for costuming and cinematography. He produced the series Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, which premiered in August 2012. =Academy Awards= In early 2005, Rock hosted the 77th Academy Awards ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an \\"edge\\" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying \\"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!\\" During one segment Rock asked, \\"Who is this guy?\\" in reference to actor Jude Law seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent Tom Cruise (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: \\"If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!\\"). Subsequently, an angry Sean Penn took the stage to present and said, \\"In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.\\" (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting All the King's Men.) Law was not the only actor that Rock roasted that evening, however‚Äîhe turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, \\"If you want Denzel [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!\\" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony. Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as \\"idiotic\\", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night. On October 21, 2015 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Rock would host the 88th Academy Awards. When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony. Rock declined however, stating at the ceremony that it would have accomplished little since the show would have proceeded anyway, with him simply replaced. Instead, Rock spoke of his concerns about the lack of diversity in AMPAS at various times during the show, closing by saying \\"Black Lives Matter.\\" =Music videos= Rock's first music video was for his song \\"Your Mother's Got a Big Head\\" from his album Born Suspect. Rock also made videos for his songs \\"Champagne\\" from Roll With the New and \\"No Sex (In the Champagne Room)\\" from Bigger & Blacker. He directed and appeared in the music video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers song \\"Hump de Bump\\", and has simply appeared in several videos, including the Big Daddy Kane music video \\"Smooth Operator\\" as a guy getting his hair cut, one of the many celebrities seen lip-synching in Johnny Cash's \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", a cameo in Madonna's \\"Bitch I'm Madonna\\", and as a Wild West sheriff chasing down an 1889 cowboy version of Lil Nas X in \\"Old Town Road\\". =Stage plays= In 2011, Rock appeared on Broadway in Stephen Adly Guirgis' play The Motherfucker with the HatHealy, Patrick. \\"Chris Rock Takes On Broadway in ‚ÄòHat‚Äô\\" , The New York Times blog, October 22, 2010. with Bobby Cannavale and Annabella Sciorra. Rock was nominated for a Drama League Award. In an interview with Vibe Magazine, Rock stated that he chose to do Broadway because he wanted more people to see him \\"really act. Sometimes when you do comedy, that can be a little formulaic, and it's hard for really good directors to see that you can act.\\"Osorio, Kim. \\"V Exclusive! Chris Rock's 'School Of Rock' Interview\\" , \\"Vibe\\" January 24, 2012. Comedic style and views Rock's subject matter typically involves family, politics, romance, music, celebrities, and race relations in the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in Bensonhurst (an Italian-ethnic neighborhood of Brooklyn known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir Rock This, he recalls, \\"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\\"Rock, Chris. Rock This Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \\"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\\" Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 Roll With The New show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \\"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\\"Rock, Chris. Rock This; Hyperion, 1997, p. 16. Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: \\"You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.\\" At the London Live Earth concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the BBC, before introducing the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rock called the crowd \\"motherfuckers\\" and said \\"shit\\", after a brief pause he said he was joking. Due to the broadcast being at 5:45 pm Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for his use of the word \\"motherfucker.\\" Chris Rock has been an avid fan of the New York Mets baseball team since childhood. He complained that his team \\"had no money\\" during a 2011 interview with David Letterman. Rock is a Democrat, who has expressed support for Barack Obama, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton. During a 2008 rant on his Kill the Messenger tour, Rock labelled George W. Bush as \\"the worst President ever.\\" At the 84th Academy Awards Rock made a joke about the lack of challenges in voice acting, and was criticised by voice-actors Maurice LaMarche and Tara Strong. Influences Rock's comedy influences are Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Flip Wilson, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Pigmeat Markham, Woody Allen, Bill Maher, Eddie Murphy, Sam Kinison, George Carlin, Mort Sahl, and Rodney Dangerfield. part 2 Comedians who have claimed Rock as an influence are Dave Chappelle, Christian Finnegan, George Lopez, Kevin Hart, and Trevor Noah. Personal life Rock married Malaak Compton- Rock on November 23, 1996. Compton-Rock is the founder and executive director of StyleWorks, a non-profit, full-service hair salon that provides free services for women leaving welfare and entering the workforce. The couple lived in Alpine, New JerseyRich, Frank (November 30, 2014). \\"In Conversation: Chris Rock\\" . New York. with their two daughters, Lola Simone (born 2002) and Zahra Savannah (born 2004). In December 2014, Rock filed for divorce from Compton-Rock. Rock admitted to infidelity in the marriage, as well as struggling with a pornography addiction. The divorce was finalized on August 22, 2016. Rock is a critic of racial profiling and often speaks of the \\"everyday racism\\" he claims to experience, despite being famous. In a 2013 episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld, Rock and Seinfeld are pulled over by the police for speeding while Seinfeld was driving. In the episode Rock admits to Seinfeld that \\"If you weren't here, I'd be scared. Yeah, I'm famous ‚Äì still black.\\" In 2015, Rock was pulled over three times in the first three months of the year. Each time Rock posted a selfie of the incident, without further comment as to the reason for the stops or whether he was issued a citation. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Chris Rock among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. On August 20, 2019, Rock, along with several other celebrities, invested in a funding round for Lowell Herb Co, a California cannabis brand. He is known to be \\"a dedicated cannabis consumer\\".

Croupiers are typically employed by casinos. Origin of the word Originally a \\"croupier\\" meant one who stood behind a gambler, with extra reserves of cash to back him up during a gambling session. The word derived from croupe (the rump of a horse) and was by way of analogy to one who rode behind on horseback. It later came to refer to one who was employed to collect the money from a gaming-table.Oxford English Dictionary, Croupier Originally a \\"dealer\\" meant one who was responsible for distributing cards or the player in the dealer position, regardless of whether or not that player was responsible for distributing the cards.  Training  A blackjack dealer at Harrah's Las Vegas (2011) Training methods to become a casino croupier vary from country to country. In North America, blackjack is almost always the game that dealers learn first, as it is simple and popular, and when the dealer makes errors, they tend not to cost the casino much money. In Europe, croupiers tend to learn roulette first. Complex, busy games such as craps, with complicated payout systems, etc., are usually reserved for the most competent and/or ambitious dealers. Select colleges and non-collegiate third-level educational institutions now offer croupier training courses, formally dubbed Casino Operations Training, which when put it in an historical context is a milestone achievement for the legitimization of poker in the mainstream. Besides courses, there's a host of private lessons available on social media, poker forums and classifieds sections worldwide, which could serve even better than attending an official course, giving one-on-one apprentice‚Äìmaster attention. Casinos may also offer an in-house training program. However, sometimes it serves better to get a \\"general qualification\\" than to be trained exclusively into one companies way of operating. Prospective employers often prefer candidates without fully relevant experience over a candidate highly experienced in the idiosyncrasies of another operation.  Licensing  American, Australian, Canadian and British croupiers are required to apply for a gambling license. This license includes police background checks and credit rating checks, to help determine if they are eligible to commence employment. Croupiers are not permitted to deal at a casino until being issued this license.  Tipping  As is common with customer service staff in the United States, croupiers there depend on tips to make their wage worthwhile. While a croupier should theoretically have no personal interest in the outcome of the game, a successful player customarily tips the croupier, especially in American casinos. Tips are often pooled and divided amongst all the staff. Fraternising with customers is frowned upon, and most casinos prevent their gambling staff from being seen smoking or even being seen in uniform outside the casino. Some gambling strategies include suggestions to tip the casino dealer in order to create a good atmosphere and improve dealer's mood. According to these strategies, tipping might even make the dealer shuffle the cards less frequently and thereby allow easier tracking of particular cards. Australian casinos forbid dealers from taking tips. Secondhand smoke exposure Because casinos tend to allow smoking on the gambling floor, American croupiers are exposed to secondhand smoke. A health hazard evaluation of several Las Vegas casinos showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the casinos and had cotinine and NNAL (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples.West, Christine. Secondhand Smoke and Casino Dealers. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. June 16, 2009. Britain banned smoking in all public places, including casinos, in 2007.

Hip hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in the Bronx, New York; East Coast hip hop only became a distinct subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States emerged with different styles. In contrast to other styles, East Coast hip hop music has prioritized complex lyrics for attentive listening rather than beats for dancing. The main components of hip hop culture from that time and still today are MCing, DJing, break dancing and graffiti.  Musical style  In contrast to the simplistic rhyme pattern and scheme utilized in old school hip hop, East Coast hip hop has been noted for its emphasis on lyrical dexterity. It has also been characterized by multi-syllabic rhymes, complex wordplay, a continuous free-flowing delivery and intricate metaphors. Although East Coast hip hop can vary in sound and style, \\"aggressive\\" beats and the combining of samples were common to the subgenre in the mid- to late 1980s. The aggressive and hard-hitting beats of the form were emphasized by such acts as EPMD, Beastie Boys and Public Enemy, while artists such as Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, Big Daddy Kane, Nas, Notorious B.I.G and Slick Rick were noted for their lyrical skill. Lyrical themes throughout the history of East Coast hip hop have ranged from lyrical consciousness by such artists as Public Enemy and A Tribe Called Quest to mafioso rap themes by rappers such as Raekwon, MF Grimm and Kool G Rap.  History = Emergence (1970s‚Äì80s) = East coast hip hop is occasionally referred to as New York rap due to its origins and development at block parties thrown in New York City during the 1970s.Adaso, Henry. What Is East Coast HIp-Hop. About.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-01. According to AllMusic, \\"At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap.\\"[ Genre: East Coast Rap]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 2009-03-01. Leading up to hip hop, there were spoken-word artists such as the Last Poets who released their debut album in 1970, and Gil Scott-Heron, who gained a wide audience with his 1971 track \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\\". These artists combined spoken word and music to create a kind of \\"proto-rap\\" vibe. \\"Jalal Mansur Nuriddin: farewell to the 'grandfather of rap'\\", The Guardian, 6 June 2018. Retrieved 7 December 2018. Following this, early artists of hip hop such as DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Jam Master Jay and Run-D.M.C., pioneered East Coast hip hop during hip hop's development in the mid-1970s. As the genre developed, lyrical themes evolved through the work of East Coast artists such as the Native Tongues, a collective of hip hop artists associated with generally positive, Afrocentric themes, and assembled by Afrika Bambaataa. New York-based groups such as De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and the Jungle Brothers also earned recognition for their musical eclecticism. = Renaissance (1990s) = RZA, producer and member of the Wu-Tang Clan This was called \\"The Golden Age\\" of hip hop. Although East Coast hip hop was more popular throughout the late 1980s, N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton (released in the summer of 1988) presented the toughened sound of West Coast hip hop, which was accompanied by gritty, street-level subject matter. Later in 1992, Dr. Dre's G-Funk record The Chronic would introduce West Coast hip hop to the mainstream. Along with a combined ability to keep its primary function as party music, the West Coast form of hip hop became a dominant force during the early 1990s. Although G-Funk was the most popular variety of hip hop during the early 1990s, the East Coast hip hop scene remained an integral part of the music industry. During this period, several New York City rappers rising from the local underground scene, began releasing noteworthy albums in the early and mid nineties such as Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. and others. Nas's 1994 debut album Illmatic was critically acclaimed Nas's 1994 debut album Illmatic has also been noted as one of the creative high points of the East Coast hip hop scene, and featured production from such renowned New York-based producers as Large Professor, Pete Rock and DJ Premier. Meanwhile, The Wu-Tang Clan, Lost Boyz and Mobb Deep became pillars in New York's hardcore hip hop scene, achieving widespread critical acclaim for their landmark albums, Enter the Wu- Tang (36 Chambers) (1993), Legal Drug Money (1996) and The Infamous (1995). The Notorious B.I.G. became the central figure in East Coast hip hop during most of the 1990s. Bad Boy Records comprised a team of producers known as the Hitmen Stevie J, Derrick \\"D Dot\\" Angelletie and Amen Ra directed by Sean Combs to move the focus on hip hop to New York with the Notorious B.I.G.'s Billboard topping hits. His success on the music charts and rise to the mainstream drew more attention to New York at the time of West Coast hip hop's dominance. According to AllMusic editor Steve Huey, the success of his 1994 debut album Ready to Die \\"reinvented East Coast rap for the gangsta age\\" and \\"turned the Notorious B.I.G. into a hip-hop sensation ‚Äî the first major star the East Coast had produced since the rise of Dr. Dre's West Coast G-funk\\". Many saw his dominating presence as a catalyzing factor in the East Coast/ West Coast hip hop rivalry that polarized much of the hip hop community, stirring the issue enough to result in the Brooklyn rapper's 1997 death, as well as his West Coast counterpart, Tupac Shakur, months prior. His commercial success helped pave the way for the success of other East Coast rappers such as Jay-Z, DMX, Busta Rhymes and many upcoming rappers.Huey, Steve (September 26, 2003).

Legacy Many knowledgeable hip hop fans look favorably upon this period as a time of creative growth and influential recordings, describing it as \\"The East Coast Renaissance.\\" Music writer May Blaize of MVRemix Urban comments on the nostalgia felt among hip hop fans for records released during this time: David Drake of Stylus Magazine writes of hip hop during 1994 and its contributions, stating: \\"The beats were hot, the rhymes were hot - it really was an amazing time for hip-hop and music in general. This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work - Digable Planets, Gang Starr, Pete Rock, Jeru, O.C., Organized Konfusion - I mean, this was a year of serious music.\\"Gloden, Gabe.

Johnson gave the year of his birth as 1879, although there is speculation that he may have been younger by as much as a decade. Education and early musical career Johnson received lessons from Adam Olivier and began playing professionally in Olivier's orchestra. Johnson probably played a few adolescent jobs with Buddy Bolden, but was not a regular member of Bolden's Band (contrary to Johnson's claim). Johnson was regarded as one of the top trumpeters in New Orleans in the years 1905‚Äì1915, in between repeatedly leaving the city to tour with minstrel shows and circus bands. After he failed to appear for a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade job in 1915, he learned that krewe members intended to do him bodily harm. So he left town, touring with shows and then by the early 1920s settling in New Iberia, Louisiana. In 1931 he lost his trumpet and front teeth when a fight broke out at a dance in Rayne, Louisiana, putting an end to his playing. He thereafter worked in manual labor, occasionally giving music lessons. Career revival and first recordings In 1938 and 1939 the writers of an early book of jazz history, Jazzmen, interviewed several prominent musicians of the time, including Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Clarence Williams, who spoke highly of Johnson in the old days in New Orleans. The writers tracked down Johnson's address, and traded several letters with him, where he recalled (and possibly embellished) his early career. Johnson stated that he could play again if he only had new teeth and a new trumpet. A collection was taken up by writers and musicians, and he was fitted with a set of dentures by Bechet's dentist brother, Leonard, and given a new trumpet. He made his first recordings in 1942, for Jazz Man Records. Bunk (left) with Lead Belly in New York City, 1946 Later touring career These first recordings propelled Johnson (along with clarinetist George Lewis) into public attention, attracting a cult following. Johnson and his band played in New Orleans, San Francisco, Boston, and New York City and made many more recordings. Johnson's work in the 1940s shows why he was well regarded by his fellow musicians‚Äîon his best days playing with great imagination, subtlety, and beauty‚Äîas well as suggesting why he had not achieved fame earlier, for he was unpredictable, temperamental, with a passive-aggressive streak and a fondness for drinking alcohol to the point of impairment. Death and legacy Johnson suffered from a stroke in late 1948 and died in New Iberia the following year. Jazz fans and historians still debate Johnson's legacy, and the extent to which his colorful reminiscences of his early career were accurate, misremembered, exaggerated, or untrue. Although in recent years, new evidence has appeared in jazz historian Vic Hobson's 2014 Creating Jazz Counterpoint. New Orleans, Barbershop Harmony, and the Blues, in which is stated that Buddy Bolden's band member Willy Cornish - who is seen on the only surviving picture of the Bolden Band - affirmed Bunk Johnson as a member of the early jazz group. This puts Johnson's own statements and recordings, in which he actively recreated the Bolden tunes, in a plausible and positive light, making them of great historical and musicological importance to the study of jazz and New Orleans Jazz in particular. The majority of his recordings remain in print on CD reissues, and his playing is an important influence on many contemporary traditional jazz musicians. Johnson plays a small, but significant, role in Alan Schroeder's picture book Satchmo's Blues. In that book, Johnson serves as a source of musical inspiration to the young Louis Armstrong.

It was founded in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont, and sold in 2000 to British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. Today it operates globally as a fully owned subsidiary of Unilever. Its present-day headquarters is in South Burlington, Vermont, with its main factory in Waterbury, Vermont. History= Founding = Jerry Greenfield (left) and Ben Cohen (right) in 2010 Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were childhood friends from Merrick, New York. Although Greenfield finished college, he found himself unable to make his way into medical school. Cohen dropped out of school. In 1977, Cohen and Greenfield completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from Pennsylvania State University's creamery. Cohen has severe anosmia, a lack of a sense of smell or taste, and so relied on \\"mouth feel\\" and texture to provide variety in his diet. This led to the company's trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream. On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000 investment (), the two business partners opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont. In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first \\"free cone day\\", now an annual event at every Ben & Jerry's store. In 1980, they rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry's franchise opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerry's ice cream was used to build \\"the world's largest ice cream sundae\\" in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed . That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.Dan Chu and Martha Babcock. \\"The Whole Country Cowtows as Artist Woody Jackson Makes His Big Moove Toward Udder Success\\" , People magazine, August 28, 1989 Domino's store In 1984, H√§agen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben & Jerry's in Boston, prompting Ben & Jerry's to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous \\"What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?\\" campaign. In 1987, H√§agen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben & Jerry's filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company. In 1985, the Ben & Jerry's Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben & Jerry's to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the company's annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben & Jerry's launched its \\"Cowmobile\\", a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben & Jerry's ice cream in a unique, cross-country \\"marketing drive\\"‚Äîdriven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The \\"Cowmobile\\" burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like \\"the world's largest baked Alaska\\". In 1987, as a tribute to guitarist Jerry Garcia & Grateful Dead fans everywhere, Ben & Jerry's presented its first ice cream named for a rock legend and the most famous of fan-suggested flavors, \\"Cherry Garcia\\".https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/cherry-garcia-ice-cream In 1988, the two men won the title of U.S. Small Business Persons of the Year, awarded by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Also that year, the first brownies were ordered from Greyston Bakery, which led to the development of the popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor. In 1992, Ben & Jerry's joined in a co-operative campaign with the national non-profit Children's Defense Fund; the campaign goal was to bring children's basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards were sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues. In 1995, they hired Robert Holland, Jr. as CEO after holding a \\"Yo! I'm your C.E.O.\\" essay contest as part of the search. Holland left after 20 months following philosophical differences and was replaced by Perry Odak in 1997.Staff report (January 3, 1997). Ben & Jerry's Appoints Former Gun Exec as CEO. Los Angeles Times In 1989, Ben & Jerry's revealed their opposition of the use of rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) in all their products. This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows to boost milk production, but Ben & Jerry's does not support this practice and is in favor of using less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment. In 1994, Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop, written by Fred \\"Chico\\" Lager, former CEO of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, was published.

New York: Crown Publishers, 1994. Print. Ben & Jerry's ice-cream branch at the United Square Shopping Mall in Singapore = Unilever era = In April 2000, Ben & Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever. Unilever said it hoped to carry on the tradition of engaging \\"in these critical, global economic and social missions\\". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company. In 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to \\"Eco-Pint\\" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available. On Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben & Jerry's launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed , and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.http://www.benjerry.com/our_company/about_us/social_mission/social_audits/2005_sear/sear05_9.1.2.cfm http://www.benjerry.com/features/baked_alaska/index.cfm In March 2009, \\"CyClone Dairy\\" launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows. On April 1, 2009 (April Fool's Day), Ben & Jerry's announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben & Jerry's had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned-animal products. The hoax was revealed on April Fool's Day with the message: \\"We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat ‚Äì and not to eat cloned foods if you don't want to. And that's why Ben & Jerry's believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.\\" In 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: \\"My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: 'Change is a wonderful thing,'\\" he said. \\"The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business. Historically, this company has been and must continue to be a pioneer to continually challenge how business can be a force for good and address inequities inherent in global business.\\" In 2013, Ben & Jerry's committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation. In 2018, Matthew McCarthy, previously a Unilever executive, replaced Jostein Solheim and became the new CEO of the company. \\"We are delighted to welcome Matthew, who brings a wealth of commercial experience, along with rock-solid values and a courageous vision for the role businesses can and should play in the world,\\" said Ben & Jerry's board of directors Chairperson, Anuradha Mittal. Factories Ben & Jerry's has production facilities in the following locations: * Saint Albans, Vermont, United States * Waterbury, Vermont, United States * Henderson, Nevada, United States (until August 30, 2019) * Hellendoorn, Netherlands * Be'er Tuvia, Israel Original flavors and sundaes A pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream There was an official survey taken among the general public to find out the best Ben and Jerrys flavour. Cookie dough was the winner with 60% and in last place was chocolate chip brownie with 8.5%. The \\"Vermonster\\" is a large ice cream sundae served in a \\"Vermonster Bucket\\" in Ben & Jerry's \\"scoop shops.\\" Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 4 ladles of hot fudge, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 1 chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, 2 scoops each of any 4 toppings, and whipped cream. It contains , and of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben & Jerry's in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year. \\"Chubby Hubby\\" consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben and Jerry's, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed \\"Chubby Hubby\\" to \\"Hubby Hubby,\\" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men in tuxedos getting married beneath a rainbow. On March 13, 2012, Ben & Jerry's announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavors in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. \\"Oh! My! Apple Pie!\\" would become \\"Apple-y Ever After\\" and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows. \\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\" was temporarily renamed \\"I Dough, I Dough\\" in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights). Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, to promote their new ice cream flavor, \\"Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream\\", and Cohen's progressive advocacy group TrueMajority. The company renamed a flavor, \\"Yes Pecan!\\", in reference to Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund. On March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"Late Night Snack\\", whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it. On February 24, 2012, Ben & Jerry's released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\", \\"Blueberry Vanilla Graham\\", \\"Raspberry Fudge Chunk\\", \\"Banana Peanut Butter\\", and \\"Vanilla\\" (scoop shop exclusive): On April 12, 2013, \\"Pineapple Passionfruit\\", \\"Vanilla Honey Caramel\\", and \\"Liz Lemon\\" were added to the Greek Yogurt line. The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom 30 Rock. On February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"The Tonight Dough\\", with all of its proceeds going to the SeriousFun Children's Network that supports camps for children with major illnesses. In 2015, Charoset flavored ice cream became widely available in time for the Passover holiday. In April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers' feedback, led by a petition and FARM organization. In early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with four flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors ‚Äì \\"Chunky Monkey\\" and \\"Chocolate Fudge Brownie\\" ‚Äì and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: \\"Coffee Caramel Fudge\\" and \\"Peanut Butter & Cookies\\". In February 2017, three new non-dairy flavors were added: Caramel Almond Brittle, Cherry Garcia, and Coconut Seven Layer Bar. In January 2018, the company added two new non-dairy flavors to its growing line of vegan options. Peanut Butter Half Baked features chocolate and peanut butter with fudge brownies and pieces of peanut butter cookie dough, while Cinnamon Buns is made with cinnamon-spiced ice cream and features cinnamon bun dough and a cinnamon streusel swirl. Ben and Jerry's non-dairy line also features flavors such as PB & Cookies, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, and Caramel Coffee fudge. Among their newest non- dairy flavors are the following: chocolate caramel cluster, chocolate chip cookie dough, and chocolate salted n' swirled. Ben & Jerry's also just released new snack-able \\"cookie dough chunks\\" that have a vegan option for the non-dairy connoisseur. They continue to take new non-dairy flavor suggestions on their website. In October 2018, Ben and Jerry's launched a campaign for a limited-edition ice cream flavor that also held a political message focusing on resisting the US's current governmental administration under Trump. The campaign debuted the new flavor, ‚ÄòPecan Resist‚Äô and included new packaging that advertised their messages. The company donated $25,000 to four organizations that supported their interests towards progress with societal issues including inclusivity, justice for people of color, women, refugees, the LGBTQ community, and issues of climate change.https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/pecan-resist-ice-cream Woman in cow costume promoting Free Cone Day outside a Ben & Jerry's shop in Stockholm, Sweden Free Cone Day is an annual event held between late March and early May, in which Ben & Jerry's scoop shops give out free ice cream cups and cones. Free Cone Day was first held on Saturday, May 5, 1979, by Ben and Jerry as a customer and staff appreciation event for the first anniversary of their store's opening. Every year over one million cones are given away, prompting the company's ad slogan \\"Be One In A Million.\\" Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there. Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote (in those countries where that is necessary). Political stances and controversies=Commercial= The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling their ice cream as \\"all natural\\" due to the company's use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients. In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as \\"all natural\\". In 2011,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2011/09/07/140266537/yes-its-true-ben-jerrys-introduces-schweddy-balls- ice-cream-flavor Ben & Jerry's released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit of the same name. This received protest from One Million Moms, a project of the conservative Christian group American Family Associated, who said that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelves. Spokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: \\"I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don't say something? Maybe they'll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.\\" However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to The Huffington Post: \\"We just think it's funny, that's all, and honestly we all really want to try it\\", adding that she consistently checks for the item's availability at her local supermarket. Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the SNL skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011, episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called \\"Go Fudge Yourself\\" had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that \\"thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond,\\" as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death. =Political= Following rumors that suggested Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal‚Äîwho was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner‚Äîthe company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that \\"the system of American justice be followed fully in the case\\". Between 2005 and 2008, Ben and Jerry's collaborated with polar explorer Marc Cornelissen and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to run the Climate Change College - an initiative to train young people in communications and campaigning around climate change. Controversy emerged in 2006 after the company released a flavor of ice cream called \\"Black and Tan\\". It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink, which is made by mixing stout with pale ale, but the \\"Black and Tans\\" are also known as a paramilitary police force of British World War I veterans recruited during the Irish Revolution. At the time that the flavor was released, the Irish Republican movement was still offended by the historical association of the title. In 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP) contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and the CEO of Ben & Jerry's after learning that ice cream produced by Ben & Jerry's franchise in Israel was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York and California on 'Free Cone Day' in April 2013 and April 2014. , 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben & Jerry's to end its commercial ties to such settlements. In late April 2014, Ben & Jerry's signed onto the \\"Fight for the Reef\\" campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland state senator Matt Canavan both said in statements that Ben & Jerry's was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the Great Barrier Reef, and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that \\"The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerry's and Unilever. If you understand the facts, you'd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerry's\\". Australian Ben & Jerry's brand manager Kalli Swaik responded that \\"Ben & Jerry's believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australia's most iconic treasures.\\" In February 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen created an ice cream flavor called \\"Bernie's Yearning\\" in support of U.S Senator Bernie Sanders' run for president in the 2016 Democratic Primaries against Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The flavor consisted of plain mint ice cream covered by a solid layer of mint chocolate. According to Cohen, \\"The chocolate disk represents the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1 percent since the end of the recession. Beneath it, the rest of us.\\"Ben & Jerry's founder creates Bernie Sanders ice cream flavor This was done in an effort to showcase the United States' current socioeconomic issues. In April 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, were both arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests on the U.S. Capitol steps in Washington, D.C. In May 2017, Ben and Jerry's announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage. They said this would encourage \\"fans to contact their MP's to tell them the time has come-make marriage equality legal!\\". This stance, they said, would continue for however long it took for same-sex marriage to be legalized. In June 2018, Ben & Jerry's announced their support for some 9,000 Afghan asylum seekers' right to stay in Sweden, drawing heavy criticism from some commentators. On October 30, 2018, they announced their new limited batch flavor called \\"Pecan Resist\\". It was introduced as a part of the opposition campaign against President Donald Trump. It was marketed as \\"a campaign to lick injustice and champion those fighting to create a more just and equitable nation of us all\\". In August 2019, they produced another Bernie Sanders flavor called \\"Bernie's Back.\\" It was not for sale in stores, but was awarded as a prize to 40 contest winners. Ben Cohen endorsed Bernie Sanders for President. In 2020, Ben & Jerry's announced that it plans to join the \\"#StopHateForProfit\\" campaign, halting paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the U.S. The company said it was asking Facebook \\"to take the clear and unequivocal actions called for by the campaign to stop its platform from being used to spread and amplify racism and hate.\\" In August 2020, Ben & Jerry's attracted criticism from several British commentators and government officials for defending the channel crossings of migrants from France, which had started after a tweet sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel, calling for their treatment as asylum seekers. Additionally, the company claimed people cannot be illegal, even when entering a country for economic reasons with the crossings coming from the developed First World country of France. With these points of contention being voiced by some. Minister James Cleverly also criticized the statements from the company as being statistically inaccurate and described them as 'virtue signalling.' Spiked considered the statements hypocritical due to the company's own practices in relation to worker's rights and pay. The publication also alleged the hiring of illegal immigrants in which they were said to be treated with poor working conditions, 12 to 14-hour days and a barely minimum wage pay rate. =Social= In February 2012, a Ben & Jerry's franchise near Harvard University created a limited edition frozen yogurt flavor named \\"Taste the Lin-Sanity\\" in honor of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin, a Harvard alumnus. At inception, the product contained vanilla frozen yogurt, lychee honey swirls, and fortune cookie pieces, leading to a widely publicized controversy about racial stereotyping due to the association of the fortune cookie ingredient with Chinese culture. The latter ingredient was later replaced with waffle cookies, as the fortune cookies became soggy and the franchise received returns from customers. Ben & Jerry's general manager for Boston and Cambridge explained to the media: \\"we obviously weren't looking to offend anybody and the majority of the feedback about it has been positive.\\" Ben & Jerry's released an official statement shortly after the launch of the product apologizing to those who were offended. In September 2014, anti-hazing activists raised concerns about the ice cream flavor \\"Hazed & Confused\\", which had been released earlier that year. The concern was that the name could be perceived as belittling of hazing and bullying problems. The company has noted that the name was based on the word hazelnut and a play on the phrase \\"dazed and confused\\", which is both a song popularized by Led Zeppelin and a 1993 film. The decision was made in October to not rename the flavor. Attempts by migrant laborers to directly contact company Ben & Jerry's officials in Waterbury, Vermont, during 2018 resulted in arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \\"Zero\\" farms are reported to be in compliance with the Milk With Dignity Code of Conduct, according to Will Lambek of Migrant Justice.https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/08/13/migrant-injustice-ben-jerrys- farmworker-exploitation/ During the 2020 protests against racial prejudice following the police killing of George Floyd, Ben & Jerry's publicized a statement encouraging Americans to \\"dismantle white supremacy\\" and face \\"the sins of our past.\\" =Product safety= The Organic Consumers Association announced in July 2017 that it found traces of the herbicide glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the company's ice creams.

He was the founder of Academic Skepticism and what is variously called the Second or Middle or New Academy‚Äîthe phase of the Academy in which it embraced philosophical skepticism. Arcesilaus succeeded Crates of Athens as the sixth scholarch of the Academy around 264 BC. He did not preserve his thoughts in writing, so his opinions can only be gleaned second-hand from what is preserved by later writers. In Athens Arcesilaus interacted with the Pyrrhonist philosopher, Timon of Phlius, whose philosophy appears to have influenced Arcesilaus to become the first Academic to adopt a position of philosophical skepticism, that is, he doubted the ability of the senses to discover truth about the world, although he may have continued to believe in the existence of truth itself. This brought in the skeptical phase of the Academy. His chief opponent was his contemporary, Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, whose dogma of katalepsis (i.e., that reality could be comprehended with certainty) Arcesilaus denied. Life Arcesilaus was born in Pitane in Aeolis. His early education was provided by Autolycus the mathematician, with whom he migrated to Sardis. Afterwards, he studied rhetoric in Athens. He then studied philosophy, becoming a disciple first of Theophrastus and afterwards of Crantor.Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica VI He also attended the school of Pyrrho, whose philosophy he maintained, except in name.Eusebius of Caesarea, Praeparatio Evangelica Chapter VI He subsequently became intimate with Polemo and Crates of Athens, who made Arcesilaus his successor as scholarch (head) of the Platonic Academy. Diogenes La√´rtius says that, like his successor Lacydes, Arcesilaus died of excessive drinking, but the testimony of others (e.g. Cleanthes) and his own precepts discredit the story. He is known to have been much respected by the Athenians. Philosophy Arcesilaus committed nothing to writing. His opinions were imperfectly known to his contemporaries, and can now only be gathered from the statements of later writers. This makes his philosophy difficult to evaluate and partly inconsistent. This led scholars to see his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophy as completely negative or destructive of all philosophical views. Others regard him as taking the position that nothing can be known on the basis of his philosophical arguments. Others claimed he held no positive views on any philosophical topic, including the possibility of knowledge. Sextus Empiricus said that Arcesilaus' philosophy appeared essentially the same as Pyrrhonism, but granted that this might have been superficial.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book 1, Chapter 33, Section 232 Numenius of Apamea concurred, saying \\"Arcesilaus accompanied Pyrrho. He remained Pyrrhonist in his rejection of everything, except in name. At least the Pyrrhonists Mnaseas, Philomelos and Timon call him a Pyrrhonist, just as they were themselves, because he too rejected the true, the false, and the persuasive.\\"Numenius, fr. 25.64-71 On the one hand, Arcesilaus is said to have restored the doctrines of Plato in an uncorrupted form; while, on the other hand, according to Cicero,Cicero, Academica, i. 12 he summed up his opinions in the formula, \\"that he knew nothing, not even his own ignorance.\\" There are two ways of reconciling the difficulty: either we may suppose him to have thrown out such aphorisms as an exercise for his pupils, as Sextus Empiricus,Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrh. Hypotyp. i. 234 who calls him a \\"skeptic\\", would have us believe; or he may have really doubted the esoteric meaning of Plato, and have supposed himself to have been stripping his works of the figments of the Dogmatists, while he was in fact taking from them all certain principles.Cicero, De Oratore, iii. 18. Cicero attributes the following argument to Arcesilaus: (i) it is rash and shameful to assent to something false or unknown, but since (ii) nothing can be known (and obviously we shouldn‚Äôt do what is rash and shameful), (iii) we should suspend judgment about everythingCicero Academica Varro, 44-45 Zeno of Citium and the other Stoics were the chief opponents of Arcesilaus. He attacked their dogma of katal√™ptik√™ phantasia (i.e., a convincing conception) as understood to be a mean between episteme (knowledge) and doxa (opinion). He argued that this mean could not exist. It involved a contradiction in terms, as the very idea of phantasia implied the possibility of false as well as true conceptions of the same object. As such, it was merely the interpolation of a name.Cicero, Academica, ii. 24. Commentary on Arcesilaus The Pyrrhonist philosopher and contemporary of Arcesilaus, Timon of Phlius ridiculed Arcesilaus in his Silloi, but also praised him in Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus.Diogenes La√´rtius Lives of the Eminent Philosophers Book IX, Chapter 12, Section 114‚Äì115 Fragments from Timon about Arcesilaus include: * \\"Having the lead of Menedemus at his heart, he will run either to that mass of flesh, Pyrrho, or to Diodorus.\\" * \\"I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked Diodorus.\\" * \\"And mixing sound sense with wily cavils.\\"Diogenes La√´rtius Lives of the Eminent Philosophers Book IV, Chapter 6, Section 33 Blaise Pascal wrote of Arcesilaus in his Pens√©es (1669, para. 375): > I have seen changes in all nations and men, and thus after many changes of > judgement regarding true justice, I have recognized that our nature was but > in continual change, and I have not changed since; and if I changed, I would > confirm my opinion.

West Coast Hip-Hop began to dominate from a radio play and sales standpoint during the early to-mid 1990s with the birth of G-Funk and the emergence of record labels such as Suge Knight and Dr Dre's Death Row Records, Ice Cube's Lench Mob Records and the continued success of Eazy-E's Ruthless Records and others. History=Early years= A number of events laid the foundations for West Coast Hip-Hop, long before the emergence of West Coast rappers such as Mellow Man Ace, Eazy-E, Ice-T, Kid Frost and Too Short. According to geniusrap.com, \\"a cataclysmic event helped give rise to it out West: the Watts Riots of 1965.\\" In 1967, Bud Schulberg founded a creative space entitled Watts Writers Workshop, intended to help the people of the Watts neighborhood and provide a place for them to express themselves freely; one group to emerge from the workshop was the Watts Prophets. The origins of West Coast Hip-Hop trace back to the late 1970s in Los Angeles when Alonzo Williams, a young disc jockey from Compton, California formed a partnership with another DJ named Rodger Clayton from Los Angeles, California who created a promotion company called Unique Dreams that would hire Williams to DJ at local events. The two eventually went their separate ways: Williams started a group called the World Class Wreckin' Cru and became the house DJs at a local nightclub called Eve's After Dark while Clayton launched what would perhaps be the foremost successful mobile DJ crew in the region by the name of Uncle Jamm's Army that would host parties by top DJs for thousands of people at large venues. Other smaller DJ and party crews emerged around this time, hoping to establish themselves in the area. Unlike their East Coast counterparts, the Hip-Hop sound emerging from Southern California was more fast-paced and influenced by electronic music. This could be largely credited to the fact that the local West Coast Hip-Hop scene revolved more around DJing than rapping. A localized dance sub-culture later came out of this party scene, which was highlighted on a national scale on such motion pictures as Breakin'. Breakdancing, popping and locking gave the Los Angeles music scene some of its earliest credibility outside the region. Further attention came to the West Coast as Uncle Jamm's Army began inviting such well-known East Coast Hip-Hop acts such as Whodini and Run-DMC to their functions. Another early landmark occurred in 1981, when Duffy Hooks launched the first West Coast rap label, Rappers Rapp Records, inspired by Sugar Hill Records in New York. Its first act was the duo of Disco Daddy and Captain Rapp, whose debut single was \\"The Gigolo Rapp\\" which was also released in 1981. The song became a minor success but failed to gain much radio play. Many other Hip-Hop songs recorded in California were released during the early 1980s, but many of them received little or no radio play. Captain Rapp created the classic West Coast song released in 1983 called,\\"Bad Times (I Can't Stand It)\\", which is a politically conscious response to Grandmaster Flash's \\"The Message\\" arranged by the legendary production duo of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and Rich Cason. Clayton's group, Uncle Jamm's Army, released their first single, \\"Dial-a-Freak\\", and in 1984 Egyptian Lover released his On the Nile album, which includes the popular 12\\" single \\"Egypt Egypt\\". Members of Uncle Jamm's Army and the World Class Wreckin' Cru, including Dr. Dre, The Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover, Ice-T and Kid Frost would later go on to help define the early West Coast Hip-Hop sound throughout the 1980s. Bay Area rapper Too Short In the mid-1980s, Mixmaster Spade defined an early form of gangsta rap with his Compton Posse. From this group, Spade mentored future rap stars of the West Coast, including Toddy Tee, who recorded the South Central LA anthem \\"The Batteram\\" in 1985. In the same period, the Compton-based former locking dancer Alonzo Williams formed the World Class Wreckin' Cru, which included future N.W.A members Dr. Dre and DJ Yella. Williams also founded Kru-Cut Records and established a recording studio in the back of his nightclub, Eve's After Dark, which was founded in 1979. The club was where local drug dealer Eazy-E and Jerry Heller decided to start Ruthless Records and where Dr. Dre and DJ Yella met the group CIA, which included future N.W.A member Ice Cube, Laylaw, Dr. Dre's cousin Sir Jinx and K-Dee. During this period, one of the greatest factors in the spread of West Coast Hip-Hop was the radio station, 1580 KDAY, which was the first radio station in the U.S. to play rap and Hip-Hop 24 hours a day, and radio DJ Greg \\"Mack Attack\\" Mack. =Late 1980s and 1990s= In 1988, N.W.A's landmark album Straight Outta Compton was released. Focusing on life and adversities in Compton, California, a notoriously rough area which had gained a reputation for gang violence, it was released by group member Eazy-E's record label Ruthless Records. As well as establishing a basis for the popularity of gangsta rap, the album drew much attention to West Coast Hip-Hop, especially the Los Angeles scene. In particular, the controversial \\"Fuck tha Police\\" and the ensuing censorship attracted substantial media coverage and public attention. Following the dissolution of N.W.A due to in-fighting, the group's members Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and MC Ren would later become platinum- selling solo artists in the 1990s. Ice Cube released some of the West Coast's most critically acclaimed albums, such as 1990's AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted and 1991's Death Certificate, as well as making film and television appearances such as in John Singleton's Boyz n the Hood in 1991. The early 1990s was a period in which Hip-Hop went from strength to strength. Tupac Shakur's debut album 2Pacalypse Now was released in 1991, demonstrating a social awareness, with attacks on social injustice, poverty and police brutality. Shakur's music and philosophy was rooted in various philosophies and approaches, including the Black Panther Party, Black nationalism, egalitarianism, and liberty. Also in 1991, Suge Knight founded Death Row Records using money he had extorted from the pop-rapper Vanilla Ice, and the West Coast saw the debut of arguably its most influential and popular rapper. In 1992, Dr. Dre released his solo debut, The Chronic; this marked the birth of the G-funk sound that became a hallmark of the West Coast sound in the 1990s, with the album's lead single \\"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\\" peaking at #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Other Death Row releases such as Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle (1993), Tha Dogg Pound's Dogg Food (1995), and 2Pac's All Eyez on Me (1996) became huge sellers and were also critically acclaimed. Also in the early-to-mid 1990s, the group Cypress Hill made a big impact on the scene with their albums such as their debut studio album of the same name and Black Sunday. They are considered to be among the main progenitors of West Coast rap and Hip-Hop. Other groups such as House of Pain and The Pharcyde had success with their albums and songs such as Jump Around by House of Pain which peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and went on to go platinum and The Pharcyde's albums such as Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde and Labcabincalifornia, which both gained success with their singles such as Passin' Me By and Drop. The popularity of Hip-Hop was undoubtedly assisted by the ensuing feud between Death Row Records and the East Coast's Bad Boy Records, fronted by Puff Daddy and The Notorious B.I.G. The east‚Äìwest feud gained particular traction when Shakur was shot on November 30, 1994 outside Quad Recording Studios in New York, coincidentally where Biggie Smalls and Puff Daddy had been recording that day, which led Shakur to accuse them of setting him up. Tensions rose to their highest at the Source Awards in 1995, with artists from both sides making indirect comments about the other. The drive-by shooting of Tupac Shakur on September 7, 1996 which led to his death almost a week later due to his injuries on September 13, 1996 was a major turning point for Hip-Hop as a whole. Shakur had been one of the West Coast's most popular rappers and among the most critically acclaimed. After his death and Suge Knight's incarceration, Death Row Records - once home to the majority of the West Coast's mainstream rappers - fell into obscurity in 1997. The death of the East Coast rapper and former Tupac adversary, The Notorious B.I.G, concluded the west‚Äìeast feud that had riddled Hip-Hop throughout the 1990s. The West Coast scene slowly started to fade from the mainstream in the early 2000s, as fans drifted more towards the East Coast scene, with new artists such as 50 Cent coming to the fore alongside 1990s veterans such as Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan. In addition, Southern hip hop reached the mainstream in the early 2000s and, arguably, Atlanta's rap scene became the most popular in the country with the rise of crunk in 2003‚Äì2004. = 2000s and 2010s = West Coast Hip-Hop's position in the mainstream dwindled greatly in the late 1990s and 2000s, with a few notable exceptions such as Dr. Dre's 2001, Xzibit's Restless, Snoop Dogg's No Limit Top Dogg and Tha Last Meal albums. However, the trend soon changed. Although gangsta rap was still popular on the West Coast in the 2000s, the West Coast sound became more designed for nightclubs with the rise of the Bay Area's hyphy scene, featuring flamboyant raps and explicit references to sex and drugs. A key artist in the genre was E-40, who found a substantial audience with his 1995 album In a Major Way; he found even greater success with the song \\"Tell Me When To Go\\" in 2006, featuring Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak. Bay area rapper Too Short, already well known for his collaborations with artists such as Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G, found a new lease on life with the hyphy scene, his 16th studio album Blow the Whistle in 2006 debuting at number 14 on the Billboard 200. The Game also brought attention back to the West Coast with his double platinum album, The Documentary, as did Xzibit's platinum certified Restless album, and gold certified albums Man vs. Machine and Weapons of Mass Destruction. Artists from the 1990s such as Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube and groups such as the Tha Dogg Pound and Westside Connection continued to release albums throughout the 2000s and had success but did not garner the same level of fame as they had experienced in the 1990s. Throughout the 2000s, a number of peripheral West Coast Hip-Hop artists such as Ya Boy, Glasses Malone, Juice, SKG (Suge Knight Girl) Helecia Choyce Crooked I, 40 Glocc, Slim the Mobster, Bishop Lamont and Mistah F.A.B. collaborated with big-name artists such as Dr. Dre, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, The Game, E-40 and Snoop Dogg. In the early to mid-2010s, the West Coast had also seen a resurgence with hyphy as well as a transition to an uptempo and club-oriented type of Hip-Hop. Producer DJ Mustard had pioneered the \\"ratchet\\" music movement, a production style that has snowballed into the mainstream. DJ Mustard played a role in bringing West Coast Hip-Hop back to national attention through the 2010s. He gained huge popularity throughout 2011 to 2014, producing a number of popular artists' singles, including Tyga's \\"Rack City\\", 2 Chainz's \\"I'm Different\\", Young Jeezy's \\"R.I.P.\\", B.o.B's \\"HeadBand\\", YG's \\"My Nigga\\" and \\"Who Do You Love?\\", Ty Dolla Sign's Paranoid, Kid Ink's \\"Show Me\\" and Trey Songz's \\"Na Na\\". Mustard also released his debut mixtape, Ketchup, in 2013, further solidifying his ratchet sound, which follows its G-funk and hyphy predecessors. Other more peripheral acts that achieved moderate, cult following success in the mainstream include Lil B, who built a strong fan base via social media outlets such as Twitter, YouTube and MySpace, and has recorded both solo and with The Pack. Berkeley rapper Lil B As a result, with the resurgence of hyphy and the progression of the ratchet movement through the 2010s, the West Coast has spawned commercially successful rappers such as G-Eazy, Tyga, Jay Rock, Droop-E, Sage the Gemini and Iamsu! of The HBK Gang, YG, Kid Ink, Nipsey Hussle, Dom Kennedy, Ty Dolla Sign, DJ King Assassin, Dizzy Wright and Problem. During the same time, alternative rap acts have also begun to gain traction along the West Coast Hip-Hop scene such as Tyler, the Creator and his Odd Future collective. In addition, Hip-Hop artists who are more socially conscious and focus more on the lyrical aspects of Hip-Hop have also risen from crews such as solo acts Hopsin and group acts such as Black Hippy, entering the mainstream and releasing a number of critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums. Odd Future achieved success with their album in 2012 called, The OF Tape Vol. 2, which peaked at #5 on the US Billboard 200 and #1 on both the US Billboard Independent Albums and Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Artists from the group such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt and Frank Ocean also achieved solo success with their own albums with Tyler, The Creator and Frank Ocean getting nominated for multiple Grammys. Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar That same year, Black Hippy's own Kendrick Lamar 2012 release, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, was met with rave reviews and was featured on many critics' end-of-year lists. The album was nominated Album of the Year at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, marking the first time any West Coast Hip-Hop was nominated for award. In 2014, Schoolboy Q debuted at no.1 on the Billboard 200 with 139,000 copies sold. YG's My Krazy Life debuted at #2 on the US Billboard 200 with 61,000 copies sold. In 2018, a multiple Grammy nominated artist under Aftermath named Anderson .Paak, released his third studio album called, Oxnard, which achieved success and peaked at #11 on the US Billboard 200 and #6 on the US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums charts.

Life Crantor moved to Athens in order to study philosophy, where he became a pupil of Xenocrates and a friend of Polemon, and one of the most distinguished supporters of the philosophy of the older Academy. As Xenocrates died 314/3 BC, Crantor must have come to Athens prior to that year, although the date of his birth is not known. He died before Polemon and Crates. Dropsy was the cause of his death. He left his fortune, which amounted to twelve talents, to Arcesilaus who succeeded him as scholarch of the Academy. Writings Crantor was the first of Plato's followers who wrote commentaries on the works of his master. He also made some attempts at poetry; and Diogenes La√´rtius relates, that, after sealing up a collection of his poems, he deposited them in the temple of Athena in his native city, Soli. He is accordingly called by the poet Theaetetus, in an epitaph which he composed upon him, the friend of the Muses; and that his chief favourites among the poets were Homer and Euripides. His works were very numerous. Diogenes La√´rtius says that he left behind Commentaries, which consisted of 30,000 lines; but of these only fragments have been preserved. They appear to have related principally to moral subjects, and, accordingly, HoraceHorace, Ep. i. 2. 4 classes him with Chrysippus as a moral philosopher, and speaks of him in a manner which proves that the writings of Crantor were much read and generally known in Rome at that time. The most popular of Crantor's works in Rome seems to have been that \\"On Grief\\" (, ), which was addressed to his friend Hippocles on the death of his son, and from which Cicero seems to have heavily relied upon in his Tusculan Disputations.Marcus Tullius Cicero and Margaret Graver Cicero on the Emotions: Tusculan Disputations 3 and 4 2009 p188 The Stoic philosopher Panaetius called it a \\"golden\\" work, which deserved to be learnt by heart word for word.Cicero, Acad, ii. 44. Cicero also made great use of it while writing his celebrated Consolatio on the death of his daughter, Tullia. Several extracts from it are preserved in Pseudo-Plutarch's treatise on Consolation addressed to Apollonius, which has come down to us. Crantor paid special attention to ethics, and arranged \\"good\\" things in the following order - virtue, health, pleasure, riches.

Originally a boxer, he came to Athens where he took up philosophy, listening to Zeno's lectures. He supported himself by working as a water-carrier at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno's doctrines. He originated new ideas in Stoic physics, and developed Stoicism in accordance with the principles of materialism and pantheism. Among the fragments of Cleanthes' writings which have come down to us, the largest is a Hymn to Zeus. His pupil was Chrysippus who became one of the most important Stoic thinkers. Life Cleanthes was born in Assos in the Troad about 330 BC. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, he was the son of Phanias, and early in life he was a boxer. With but four drachmae in his possession he came to Athens, where he took up philosophy, listening first to the lectures of Crates the Cynic,Suda, Cleanthes and then to those of Zeno, the Stoic. In order to support himself, he worked all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his nickname the Well-Water-Collector, ). As he spent the whole day in studying philosophy with no visible means of support, he was summoned before the Areopagus to account for his way of living. The judges were so delighted by the evidence of work which he produced, that they voted him ten minae, though Zeno would not permit him to accept them. His power of patient endurance, or perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of \\"the Ass\\" from his fellow students, a name which he was said to have rejoiced in, as it implied that his back was strong enough to bear whatever Zeno put upon it. Such was the esteem awakened by his high moral qualities that, on the death of Zeno in 262 BC, he became the leader of the school. He continued, however, to support himself by the labour of his own hands. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus, and Antigonus II Gonatas, from whom he accepted 3000 minae. He died at the age of 99, c. 230 BC. We are told that a dangerous ulcer had compelled him to fast for a time. Subsequently he continued his abstinence, saying that, as he was already half- way on the road to death, he would not trouble to retrace his steps. Simplicius, writing in the 6th century AD, mentions that a statue of Cleanthes was still visible at Assos, which had been erected by the Roman Senate.Simplicius, Commentary on the Enchiridion of Epictetus. Philosophy Cleanthes was an important figure in the development of Stoicism, and stamped his personality on the physical speculations of the school, and by his materialism gave a unity to the Stoic system. He wrote some fifty works, of which only fragments have survived preserved by writers such as Diogenes La√´rtius, Stobaeus, Cicero, Seneca and Plutarch. =Physics= Cleanthes revolutionized Stoic physics by the theory of tension (tonos) which distinguished Stoic materialism from all conception of matter as dead and inert. He developed Stoic pantheism, and applied his materialistic views to logic and ethics. Thus he argued that the soul was a material substance, and that this was proved (a) by the circumstance that not only bodily qualities, but also mental capacity, are transmitted by ordinary generation from parent to child; and (b) by the sympathy of the soul with the body seen in the fact that, when the body is struck or cut, the soul is pained; and when the soul is torn by anxiety or depressed by care, the body is correspondingly affected. Cleanthes also taught that souls live on after death, but that the intensity of its existence would vary according to the strength or weakness of the particular soul.Plutarch, Plac. Phil. iv. 7. Cleanthes regarded the Sun as being divine;Cicero, De Natura Deorum, ii. 15. because the Sun sustains all living things, it resembled the divine fire which (in Stoic physics) animated all living beings, hence it too must be part of the vivifying fire or aether of the universe. Some maintain that he accused Aristarchus of impiety for daring to put into motion \\"the hearth of the universe\\" (i.e. the Earth); this interpretation depends on an emendation of the received text,Plutarch, On the face of the orb of the Moon, 922F‚Äì923A since in the manuscripts it is Aristarchus that did the accusing. The largest surviving fragment of Cleanthes is the portion of the Hymn to Zeus,; which has been preserved in Stobaeus, in which he declares praise and honour of Zeus to be the highest privilege of all rational beings. =Ethics= Cleanthes maintained that pleasure is not only not a good, but is \\"contrary to nature\\" and \\"worthless.\\" It was his opinion that the passions (love, fear, grief) are weaknesses: they lack the strain or tension which he persistently emphasized, and on which the strength of the soul, no less than that of the body, depends, and which constitutes in human beings self-control, and moral strength, and also conditions every virtue. He said in a striking passage: \\"People walk in wickedness all their lives or, at any rate, for the greater part of it. If they ever attain to virtue, it is late and at the very sunset of their days.\\" Zeno had said that the goal of life was \\"to live consistently,\\" the implication being that no life but the passionless life of reason could ultimately be consistent with itself. Cleanthes is credited with having added the words \\"with nature,\\" thus completing the well-known Stoic formula that the goal is \\"to live consistently with nature.\\" For Cleanthes, this meant, in the first place, living conformably to the course of the universe; for the universe is under the governance of reason, and everyone has it as their privilege to know or become acquainted with the world-course, to recognize it as rational and cheerfully to conform to it. This, according to him, is true freedom of will not acting without motive, or apart from set purpose, or capriciously, but humbly acquiescing in the universal order, and, therefore, in everything that befalls one. The direction to follow Universal Nature can be traced in his famous prayer: Modern influence Most notably, a fictionalized version of Cleanthes appears as one of the three main interlocutors in David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, where he defends the view that a posteriori knowledge of the existence and nature of God is possible for us. Cleanthes also appears in Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥'s essay Ariel, in which he is depicted as meditating on the teachings of Zeno as he carried water all through the night.

The music was a reaction to the 1980s flow of hip hop culture from New York City and the Los Angeles area and can be considered a third major American hip hop genre, after East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop. Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on mixtapes after encountering difficulty securing record-label contracts in the 1990s.[ allmusic] By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had attained national success, and as the decade went on, both mainstream and underground varieties of Southern hip-hop became among the most popular and influential of the entire genre. History Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the American hip hop music market was primarily dominated by artists from the East Coast and West Coast. Los Angeles and New York City were the two main cities where hip hop was receiving widespread attention. The West Coast was mainly represented by groups like N.W.A., Death Row Records, and the East Coast had people like The Notorious B.I.G. and groups like the Wu-Tang Clan. In the late 1980s, cities throughout the Southern United States began to catch on to the hip hop music movement. The Geto Boys, a hip hop group from Houston, were among the first hip hop artists from the Southern United States to gain widespread popularity. Southern hip hop's roots can be traced to the success of Geto Boys' Grip It! On That Other Level in 1989, the Rick Rubin produced The Geto Boys in 1990, and We Can't Be Stopped in 1991. After the Geto Boys rose to stardom, Houston became the center for Southern hip hop. Miami also played a major role in the rise of Southern hip hop during this time frame with successful acts like 2 Live Crew (originally formed in California but fully relocated to Miami around 1987) and other artists who relied heavily on the Miami bass sound. In the early 1990s, other rising rap groups such as PKO from San Antonio, Texas, UGK from Port Arthur, Texas, and 8Ball & MJG from Memphis, moved to Houston to further their musical careers. By the mid-1990s, Atlanta had become a controlling city in southern hip hop music. LaFace Records had given Atlanta a reputation as \\"the Motown of the South\\" with acts like TLC, Usher, and Kriss Kross. Local production crews such as Organized Noize that represented hip hop groups such as OutKast and Goodie Mob played a huge part in helping the South become a center for hip hop music. OutKast became the first Southern artists to generate album sales like the powerhouse rappers on the East and West coasts. A defining moment for Southern rap was at the 1995 Source Awards. The duo Outkast had just been awarded Best New Artist, and within the tension that was the East Coast‚ÄìWest Coast feud, member Andr√© came up on stage followed by boos and said, \\"But it's like this though, I'm tired of them closed minded folks, it's like we gotta demo tape but don't nobody want to hear it. But it's like this: the South got something to say, that's all I got to say.\\" As stated by rapper T.I., \\"Outkast, period. Outkast. That's when it changed. That was the first time when people began to take Southern rap seriously.\\" The most successful Southern independent labels during the mid-to-late 90s came out of the cities of Memphis and New Orleans. Both scenes borrowed heavily from a production style first introduced by way of the obscure late-1980s New York rap group The Showboys, heavily sampling the beats from their song \\"Drag Rap (Trigger Man).\\" By the turn of the century these scenes found mainstream success through Cash Money Records and No Limit Records out of New Orleans and Hypnotize Minds out of Memphis, revolutionizing financial structures and strategies for independent Southern rap labels. According to hiphopdx, \\"Not only is the South on the radar, but now the region that was an underdog is the barometer for rap music and HipHop culture.‚Äù By the early to mid-2000s, artists from all over the South had begun to develop mainstream popularity with artists like T.I., Ludacris, Lil Jon, Young Jeezy from Atlanta, Trick Daddy and Rick Ross from Miami, Lil Wayne and Juvenile from New Orleans, and Three 6 Mafia from Memphis all becoming major label stars during this time.Grem, Darren E. \\"The South Got Something to Say\\": Atlanta's Dirty South and the Southernization of Hip-Hop America.\\" Southern Cultures 12.4 (2006): 55‚Äì73.

Sep 14, 2011 In 2004, OutKast won six Grammy awards for their album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, including Best Album, while in 2006 the members of Three 6 Mafia won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp\\" from Hustle and Flow, a Hollywood film about a fictional Southern rap artist. In 2005, the Houston rap scene saw a revival in mainstream popularity, and many Houston rappers started to get nationwide and worldwide audiences such as Paul Wall, Mike Jones, Chamillionaire, Lil' Flip, Slim Thug, Z-Ro, Trae, and many members of the Screwed Up Click. The height of Southern hip-hop was reached from 2002 through 2004. In 2002, Southern hip-hop artists accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the singles on hip-hop music charts. On the week of December 13, 2003, Southern urban artists, labels and producers accounted for six of the top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100: OutKast had two singles, Ludacris, Kelis (produced by The Neptunes), Beyonc√© and Chingy (on Ludacris' Disturbing Tha Peace label). In addition to this, from October 2003 through December 2004, the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart was held by a Southern urban artist for 58 out of 62 weeks. This was capped by the week of December 11, 2004 when seven out of the top ten songs on the chart were held by or featured Southern urban artists. In 2004, Vibe magazine reported that Southern artists accounted for 43.6% of the airplay on urban radio stations (compared to 29.7% for the Midwest, 24.1% for the East Coast and 2.5% for the West coast).Roni Sarig \\"Third Coast: OutKast, Timbaland, & How Hip-Hop Became A Southern Thing.\\" pg xiv‚Äìxv Rich Boy from Mobile, Alabama was successful in 2007 with his debut album. Since the early 2010s, many contemporary hip hop artists have become mainstream. Georgia In 2009, the New York Times called Atlanta \\"hip-hop's center of gravity\\", and the city is home to many famous hip-hop, R&B; and neo soul musicians. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Atlanta's hip hop scene was characterized by a local variant of Miami's electro-driven bass music, with stars like Kilo Ali, MC Shy-D, Raheem the Dream and DJ Smurf (later Mr. Collipark). MC Shy-D is credited with bringing authentic Bronx- style hip-hop to Atlanta (and Miami), such as 1988's Shake it produced by DJ Toomp; Jones was signed to controversial southern rap label Luke Records, run by Luther Campbell aka \\"Uncle Luke\\". Arrested Development won the Grammy in 1992 with \\"Tennessee\\", while \\"Mr. Wendal\\" and \\"People Everyday\\" and Kris Kross won with their hit song \\"Jump\\". By the mid-1990s, the rise of OutKast, Goodie Mob and the production collective Organized Noize, let to the development of the Dirty South style of hip-hop and of Atlanta gaining a reputation for \\"soul-minded hip-hop eccentrics\\", contrasting with other regional styles. August 3, 1995 Outkast received the award for best new artist in New York City at the Source Awards. At the time the primary hip hop heard nationally was from artists on the East and West Coasts, due at least in part to high profile disputes between rappers from each coast. It was groups such as Outkast who were determined to let the world know that the South had something to say. From the late 1990s to early 2000s, producer Lil Jon was a driving force behind the party-oriented style known as crunk. Record producers L.A. Reid and Babyface founded LaFace Records in Atlanta in the late-1980s; the label eventually became the home to multi-platinum selling artists such as Toni Braxton, TLC, Ciara. It is also the home of So So Def Records, a label founded by Jermaine Dupri in the mid-1990s, that signed acts such as Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Xscape and Dem Franchise Boyz. The success of LaFace and SoSo Def led to Atlanta as an established scene for record labels such as LaFace parent company Arista Records to set up satellite offices. Besides Crunk, at the start of the 2000s, independent southern hip hop raised some eyebrows with Cunninlynguists. A group from Atlanta, Georgia and Lexington, Kentucky, though did not achieve as much commercial success as other southern rap acts, found much critical acclaim for their 5 records released between 2001 and 2011. Especially their magnum opus, A Piece of Strange (2006) and its follow up Dirty Acres (2007). In 2009, the New York Times noted that after 2000, Atlanta moved \\"from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South.\\" This had a lot to due with the massive popularity of Waka Flocka Flame's 2009 debut mixtape. Producer Drumma Boy called Atlanta \\"the melting pot of the South\\". Producer Fatboi called the Roland TR-808 (\\"808\\") synthesizer \\"central\\" to Atlanta music's versatility, used for snap, crunk, trap, and pop rap styles. The same article named Drumma Boy, Fatboi, Shawty Redd, Lex Luger and Zaytoven the five \\"hottest producers driving the city\\". Texas Hip Hop artist Z-Ro from Houston Texas In the late 1980s, the Geto Boys were Houston's first rap group to gain mainstream popularity. In the early 1990s, Texas rap groups such as PKO and UGK also gained popularity. Before the early 1990s, most Southern hip hop was upbeat and fast, like Miami bass and crunk. In Texas the music was generally slower. In the early 1990s DJ Screw created \\"chopped and screwed\\" music. Although people associated with Screw have indicated any time between 1987 and 1991, Screw said he started slowing music down in 1990. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Dj Dinero And Dj Z-Nasty helped popularize Chopped And Screwed music in the Mid South.\\"Givin It To Ya Slow: DJ Screw interview from RapPages (1995)\\", Press Rewind If I Haven't. There is no debate, however, that DJ Screw invented the music style.\\"Music \\", Frieze magazine, Archive, Issue 135 November‚ÄìDecember 2010. He discovered that dramatically reducing the pitch of a record gave a mellow, heavy sound that emphasized lyrics to the point of almost storytelling. After experimenting with the sound for a while Screw started making full length \\"Screw Tapes\\". Between 1991 and 1992, there was increased abuse of purple drank in East Texas. Purple drank has been considered to be a major influence in the making of and listening to chopped and screwed music due to its effect of slowing down perception. DJ Screw said that purple drank is not required to enjoy screwed and chopped music. Screw, a known user of purple drank, said he came up with chopped and screwed music when high on marijuana. As the spread of Southern hip hop continued, its mainstream breakthrough occurred in 2000. Rap duo UGK made a high-profile guest appearance on Jay-Z's smash hit \\"Big Pimpin'\\" and also appeared on Three 6 Mafia's hit \\"Sippin' on Some Syrup.\\" Both of these collaborations greatly increased their reputation and helped fuel anticipation for their next project.The Hip Hop world was ready for the next adventure but unfortunately the UGK rapper Pimp C died from a sudden heart attack after overdosing on purple drank on December 4, 2007 at the age of 33. A song that originally appeared on the compilation album The Day Hell Broke Loose 2, Mike Jones' \\"Still Tippin'\\", which achieved mainstream success in 2004 leading to local Houston rap label Swishahouse signing a national distribution deal with Asylum Records. Jones released his major label debut, Who Is Mike Jones?, on Swishahouse/Warner Bros. in April 2005; the album Who is Mike Jones? went certified platinum that June.RIAA certification database (search \\"mike jones\\") Paul Wall's major label debut, The Peoples Champ, on Swishahouse/Atlantic, was released in September 2005, eventually topping the Billboard 200.The People's Champ (Billboard 200 chart), Billboard, June 24, 2006. Before embarking on his rap career and while still at school, Wall was also working in the Swishahouse office. Louisiana In the late 1990s \\"bounce\\" music was born in New Orleans. In 1992, Cash Money Records was founded, releasing bounce and gangster rap music. Crunk The term crunk is used as a blanket term to denote any style of southern hip hop, it is mainly used to denote a musical style that was originated by Three Six Mafia in Memphis, Tennessee, in the mid-to-late 1990s.

This Coca-Cola advertisement from 1943 is still displayed in Minden, Louisiana Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. The word nostalgia is learned formation of a Greek compound, consisting of (n√≥stos), meaning \\"homecoming\\", a Homeric word, and (√°lgos), meaning \\"pain\\" or \\"ache\\", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home. Described as a medical condition‚Äîa form of melancholy‚Äîin the Early Modern period, it became an important trope in Romanticism. Nostalgia is associated with a yearning for the past, its personalities, possibilities, and events, especially the \\"good old days\\" or a \\"warm childhood\\". The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding the personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia induced during the studies. Smell and touch are strong evokers of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time. Music and weather can also be strong triggers of nostalgia. Functions Nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time. Consistent with its Greek word roots meaning \\"homecoming\\" and \\"pain,\\" nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition expressing extreme homesickness. The modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often. Occasional nostalgia has been found to have many functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning. Many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them. Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of \\"nostalgia proneness.\\"Vanessa K√∂neke: More bitter than sweet - Are nostalgic people rather sad than happy after all? GRIN Verlag GmbH, M√ºnchen 2010, . Nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation. =Improve mood= Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one's happiness. Batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages‚Äîplanning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times.Batcho, K. I. (2013). \\"Nostalgia: Retreat or support in difficult times?\\" The American Journal of Psychology, =Increase social connectedness= Tweed run, 2013 Nostalgia also sometimes involves memories of people you were close to, and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections. Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships. According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness. =Enhance positive self- regard= Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed a greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences. Additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not. The researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes. Vess et al. (2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection. =Provide existential meaning= Nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life. The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one's nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia, though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning, but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one's well being. Follow-up studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat. =Promote psychological growth= Nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented people. Baldwin & Landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like \\"I am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places.\\" Nostalgia also increased interest in growth-related behavior such as \\"I would like to explore someplace that I have never been before.\\" In the first study, these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced positive affect‚Äîthe extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good. In the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced self-esteem. =As a deception= One recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts.Hook, D.(2012) \\"Screened history: Nostalgia as defensive formation.\\" Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, Vol 18(3), Aug, 2012. Special issue: Of Narratives and Nostalgia. pp. 225‚Äì239 This study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in South Africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways,Boym, S. (2001). The future of nostalgia. New York, NY: Basic Books 'restorative nostalgia' a wish to return to that past, and 'reflective nostalgia' which is more critically aware. =As a comfort= Reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health. One notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past 'good' memories can have. They found that thinking about the past 'fondly' actually increased perceptions of physical warmth. =As a political tool= In a 2014 study conducted by Routledge, he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives, the more they nostalgically longed for the past. Routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive‚Äîand effective‚Äîas a tool of political persuasion. Other aspects=As a medical condition= The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669‚Äì1752) in his Basel dissertation. Hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays \\"homesickness\\" for the condition also known as mal du Suisse \\"Swiss illness\\" or Schweizerheimweh \\"Swiss homesickness\\", because of its frequent occurrence in Swiss mercenaries who in the plains of lowlands France or Italy were pining for their native mountain landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death. Military physicians hypothesized that the malady was due to damage to the victims' brain cells and ear drums by the constant clanging of cowbells in the pastures of Switzerland. English homesickness is a loan translation of nostalgia. Sir Joseph Banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of Captain Cook. On 3 September 1770 he stated that the sailors \\"were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia\\", but his journal was not published in his lifetime (see Beaglehole, J. C. (ed.). The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768‚Äì1771, Public Library of New South Wales/Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1962, vol. ii, p. 145). Cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home. Receiving a diagnosis was, however, generally regarded as an insult. In 1787 Robert Hamilton (1749‚Äì1830, physician of Ipswich) described a case of a soldier suffering from nostalgia, who received sensitive and successful treatment: In the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia, a nostalgic bone. By the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process. It was considered as a form of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides. Nostalgia was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the American Civil War.Wisconsin Public Radio, To the Best of Our Knowledge, \\"Svetlana Boym on Nostalgia\\", 2002 November 3 By the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished. Nostalgia was still being recognized in both the First and Second World Wars, especially by the American armed forces. Great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves (see the BBC documentary Century of the Self). Nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past. The resulting emotion can vary from happiness to sorrow. The term of \\"feeling nostalgic\\" is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with and/or a longing to go back to a particular period of time, although the former may also be true. =Romanticism= Swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of Kuhreihen, which were forbidden to Swiss mercenaries because they led to nostalgia to the point of desertion, illness or death. The 1767 Dictionnaire de Musique by Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that Swiss mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their Swiss songs. It became somewhat of a topos in Romantic literature, and figures in the poem Der Schweizer by Achim von Arnim (1805) and in Clemens Brentano's Des Knaben Wunderhorn (1809) as well as in the opera Le Chalet by Adolphe Charles Adam (1834) which was performed for Queen Victoria under the title The Swiss Cottage. The Romantic connection of nostalgia, the Kuhreihen and the Swiss Alps was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for Switzerland, the development of early tourism in Switzerland and Alpinism that took hold of the European cultural elite in the 19th century. German Romanticism coined an opposite to Heimweh, Fernweh \\"far-sickness,\\" \\"longing to be far away,\\" like wanderlust expressing the Romantic desire to travel and explore. =Music= Hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person. A song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events which occurred then. However, if it is heard throughout life, it may lose its association with any specific period or experience. =Books= A person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to familiar music, looking at old photos, or visiting comforting environments of the past.https://www.neurologytimes.com/blog/brain-and-nostalgia With this knowledge widely available, many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of nostalgia. Books are just one of many mediums used in the monetization of nostalgiaNostalgia industry. Do You Remember? The Book That Takes You Back = As an advertising tool = In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised products. Modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an advertisement. The feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more reminiscent of reality. Due to efficient advertising schemes, consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as vicarious nostalgia. Vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one's memory, but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated exposure to it. The constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way consumers use their purchasing power. Examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include nostalgia-themed websites including The Nostalgia Machine and DoYouRemember?, revamps of old movies, TV shows, and books. Vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as Coca-Cola and Levi Strauss & Co. use.

In 1922 he was employed by the BBC (British Broadcasting Company Ltd.) as its general manager; in 1923 he became its managing director and in 1927 he was employed as the Director-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation created under a royal charter. His concept of broadcasting as a way of educating the masses marked for a long time the BBC and similar organisations around the world. An engineer by trade, and standing at tall, he was a larger than life figure who was a pioneer in his field. Early life 6 Barton St, London SW1 Reith's home 1924‚Äì30 Born at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire,At the time of his birth Stonehaven was in Kincardineshire Reith was the fifth son and the youngest, by ten years, of the seven children of the Rev. George Reith, a Scottish Presbyterian minister of the College Church at Glasgow and later Moderator of the United Free Church of Scotland. He was to carry strict Presbyterian religious convictions forward into his adult life. Reith was educated at the Glasgow Academy then at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk.I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School by S.G.G. Benson and Martin Crossley Evans (James & James, London, 2002) He spent two years at the Royal Technical College at Glasgow (later the University of Strathclyde) followed by an apprenticeship as an engineer at the North British Locomotive Company. In 1913, he moved to London after obtaining a post with a firm at the Royal Albert Dock, but was soon sent to France during the First World War. Reith, who stood a towering tall, joined the 5th Scottish Rifles early in the war and was quickly transferred to the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant. In October 1915, while fighting in France, he was severely wounded by a sniper's bullet through his cheek, which nearly cost him his life and left him with a noticeable scar. While laying wounded on a stretcher after the shot, he is reported to have muttered \\"I'm very angry and I've spoilt a new tunic\\". He spent the next two years in the United States, supervising armament contracts, and became attracted to the country. He was promoted to captain in 1917, before being transferred to the Royal Marine Engineers in 1918 as a major. He returned to the Royal Engineers as a captain in 1919. Reith resigned his Territorial Army commission in 1921. The end of the war found Reith returning to Glasgow as general manager of an engineering firm. In 1922, he returned to London, where he started working as secretary to the London Conservative group of MPs in the 1922 United Kingdom general election. That election's results were the first to be broadcast on the radio. The BBC Reith had no broadcasting experience when he replied to an advertisement in The Morning Post for a general manager for an as-yet unformed British Broadcasting Company in 1922. He later admitted that he felt he possessed the credentials necessary to \\"manage any company\\". He managed to retrieve his original application from the post box after re-thinking his approach, guessing that his Aberdonian background would curry more favour with Sir William Noble, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Committee. In his new role, he was, in his own words, \\"confronted with problems of which I had no experience: Copyright and performing rights; Marconi patents; associations of concert artists, authors, playwrights, composers, music publishers, theatre managers, wireless manufacturers.\\" =The general strike= In 1926, Reith came into conflict with the Government during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. The BBC bulletins reported, without comment, all sides in the dispute, including the Trades Union Congress's and of union leaders. Reith attempted to arrange a broadcast by the opposition Labour Party but it was vetoed by the government, and he had to refuse a request to allow a representative Labour or Trade Union leader to put the case for the miners and other workers. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin made a national broadcast about the strike from Reith‚Äôs house and coached by Reith. When Ramsay MacDonald, the leader of the Labour Party, asked to make a broadcast in reply, Reith supported the request. However, Baldwin was \\"quite against MacDonald broadcasting\\" and Reith unhappily refused the request. MacDonald complained that the BBC was \\"biased\\" and was \\"misleading the public\\" while other Labour Party figures were just as critical. Philip Snowden, the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, was one of those who wrote to the Radio Times to complain. Reith's reply also appeared in the Radio Times, admitting the BBC had not had complete liberty to do as it wanted. He recognised that at a time of emergency the government was never going to give the company complete independence, and he appealed to Snowden to understand the constraints he had been under. :\\"We do not believe that any other Government, even one of which Mr Snowden was a member, would have allowed the broadcasting authority under its control greater freedom than was enjoyed by the BBC during the crisis.\\"Radio Times, 10 May 1926 The Labour leadership was not the only high-profile body denied a chance to comment on the strike. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, wanted to broadcast a \\"peace appeal\\" drawn up by church leaders which called for an immediate end to the strike, renewal of government subsidies to the coal industry and no cuts in miners' wages. Davidson telephoned Reith about his idea on 7 May, saying he had spoken to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, who had said he would not stop the broadcast, but would prefer it not to happen. Reith later wrote: \\"A nice position for me to be in between Premier and Primate, bound mightily to vex one or other.\\" Reith asked for the government view and was advised not to allow the broadcast because, it was suspected, that would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, an excuse to commandeer the BBC. Churchill had already lobbied Baldwin to that effect. Reith contacted the Archbishop to turn him down and explain that he feared if the talk went ahead, the government might take the company over. Although Churchill wanted to commander the BBC to use it \\"to the best possible advantage\\", Reith wrote that Baldwin's government wanted to be able to say \\"that they did not commandeer [the BBC], but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial\\". Reith admitted to his staff that he regretted the lack of TUC and Labour voices on the airwaves. Many commentators have seen Reith's stance during that period as pivotal in establishing the state broadcaster's enduring reputation for impartiality. After the strike ended, the BBC's Programme Correspondence Department analysed the reaction to the coverage, and reported that some 3,696 people complimented the BBC and 176 were critical.Governing the BBC accessed 21 April 2007 =British Broadcasting Corporation= The British Broadcasting Company was part-share owned by a committee of members of the wireless industry, including British Thomson-Houston, The General Electric Company, Marconi and Metropolitan-Vickers. However, Reith had been in favour of the company being taken into public ownership, as he felt that despite the boards under which he had served so far, allowing him a high degree of latitude on all matters, not all future members might do so. Although opposed by some, including members of the Government, the BBC became a corporation in 1927. Reith was knighted the same year. Reith's autocratic approach became the stuff of BBC legend. His preferred approach was one of benevolent dictator, but with built-in checks to his power. Throughout his life, Reith remained convinced that that approach was the best way to run an organisation. Later Director- General Greg Dyke, profiling Reith in 2007, noted that the term Reithian has entered the dictionary to denote a style of management, particularly with relation to broadcasting.Greg Dyke on Reith, BBC Television (2007) Reith summarised the BBC's purpose in three words: inform, educate, entertain; this remains part of the organisation's mission statement to this day. It has also been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world, notably the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States. Reith earned a reputation for prudishness in sexual matters. There is an old BBC legend that he once caught an announcer kissing a secretary and decreed that in future the announcer must not read the late-night religious programme The Epilogue. In fact, this may have been inspired by his catching the Chief Engineer, Peter Eckersley, not just kissing but being in flagrante with an actress on a studio table. He was to be somewhat embarrassed when one of his staff ran off with the quite new wife of the then rising young writer Evelyn Waugh. Reith also had to deal with Eckersley after the BBC Chief Engineer had a rather public affair with a married woman on the staff. Up to the Second World War any member of BBC staff involved in a divorce could lose their job. Under Reith, the BBC did not broadcast on Sunday before 12:30 PM, to give listeners time to attend church, and for the rest of the day broadcast only religious services, classical music and other non-frivolous programming. European commercial stations Radio Normandie and Radio Luxembourg competed with the BBC on \\"Reith Sunday\\" and other days of the week by broadcasting more popular music. =Abdication broadcast= In 1936, Reith directly oversaw the abdication broadcast of Edward VIII. By then his style had become well-established in the public eye. He personally introduced the ex-King (as 'Prince Edward'), before standing aside to allow Edward to take the chair. Doing so, Edward accidentally knocked the table leg with his foot, which was picked up by the microphone. Reith later noted in an interview with Malcolm Muggeridge that some headlines interpreted that as Reith \\"slamming the door\\" in disgust before Edward began broadcasting.Lord Reith Looks Back, BBC 1967 =Departure= By 1938, Reith had become discontented with his role as Director-General, asserting in his autobiography that the organisational structure of the BBC, which he had created, had left him with insufficient work to do. He was invited by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to become chairman of Imperial Airways, the country's most important airline and one which had fallen into public disfavour because of its inefficiency. Some commentatorsBoyle, Andrew (1972) Only the Wind will Listen, Hutchinson have suggested a conspiracy amongst the Board of Governors to remove Reith, but that has never been proved, and there is no record of such a thing in Reith's own memoir. He left Broadcasting House with no ceremony (at his request) but in tears. That evening, he attended a dinner party before driving out to Droitwich to close down a transmitter personally. He signed the visitor's book \\"J.C.W. Reith, late BBC.\\"Lord Reith Looks Back, BBC 1967 John Gunther wrote that Reith's \\"modernist citadel on Portland Place was more important in the life of Britain than most government offices [and] rules the B.B.C. with a hand of granite\\". He \\"made the B.B.C. an expression of his nonconformist conscience, and also what is probably the finest broadcasting organization in the world\\"; Gunther predicted that he \\"is almost certain to have a big political job some day\\". =\\"Reithianism\\"= The term \\"Reithianism\\" describes certain principles of broadcasting associated with Lord Reith. These include an equal consideration of all viewpoints, probity, universality and a commitment to public service. Audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC, a government agency which had a monopoly on broadcasting. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, \\"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\\"Charles Mowat, Britain between the Wars 1918-1940 (1955) p 242. Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it.David Hendy, \\"Painting with Sound: The Kaleidoscopic World of Lance Sieveking, a British Radio Modernist,\\" Twentieth Century British History (2013) 24#2 pp 169-200. At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.Mike Huggins, \\"BBC Radio and Sport 1922-39,\\" Contemporary British History (2007) 21#4 pp 491-515. online Second World War In 1940, Reith was appointed Minister of Information in Chamberlain's government. So as to perform his full duties, he became a member of parliament (MP) for Southampton. When Chamberlain fell, Churchill became Prime Minister and moved Reith to the Ministry of Transport. Reith was subsequently moved to become First Commissioner of Works which he held for the next two years, through two restructurings of the job, and was also transferred to the House of Lords by being created Baron Reith. During that period, the city centres of Coventry, Plymouth and Portsmouth were destroyed by German bombing. Reith urged the local authorities to begin planning postwar reconstruction. He was dismissed from his government post at a very difficult time for Churchill in 1942, following the loss of Singapore. Pressured by Tory backbenchers who wanted a Conservative in the Information role, Reith was replaced by Duff Cooper. It has been claimed that the sacking was due to Reith being difficult to work with. However, given the absence of direct contact between the two men during Reith's period in several ministerial positions, this is unlikely to be the true reason. More plausible, is the explanation given above, and the cleavage between Reithian management methods: energetic, thorough and highly organised, and the established style of the British civil service at that time: at best, calm and deliberative; at worst, ponderously slow. Reith also frequently references in his autobiography departmental jealousies resulting from his ministerial activities, reported to him by colleagues such as Sir John Anderson, wartime Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Churchill coalition. Complaints to the latter from fellow ministers and MPs would appear to be the more likely cause of his fall. This came at a crucial stage in Reith's career. After the outbreak of war, several major figures had told Reith that he would soon join the War Cabinet itself, not least Beaverbrook, one of the Prime Minister's closest associates. Reith's animosity towards Churchill continued. When offered the post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (a position he had long coveted), he could not bring himself to accept it, noting in his diary: \\"Invitation from that bloody shit Churchill to be Lord High Commissioner.\\" He took a naval commission as a lieutenant of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) on the staff of the Rear-Admiral Coastal Services. In 1943, he was promoted to captain (RNVR), and appointed Director of the Combined Operations Material Department at the Admiralty, a post he held until early 1945. Post- war In 1946, he was appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, a post he held until 1950. He was then appointed chairman of the Colonial Development Corporation which he held until 1959. In 1948, he was also appointed the chairman of the National Film Finance Corporation, an office he held until 1951. The BBC's Reith Lectures were instituted in 1948 in his honour. These annual radio talks, with the aim of advancing \\"public understanding and debate about significant issues of contemporary interest\\" have been held every year since, with the exception of 1992. The Independent Television Authority was created on 30 July 1954 ending the BBC's broadcasting monopoly. Lord Reith did not approve of its creation. Speaking at the Opposition despatch box in the House of Lords, he stated: Later years In 1960, Reith returned to the BBC for an interview with John Freeman in the television series Face to Face. When he visited the BBC to record the programme, work was being undertaken, and Reith noticed with dismay the \\"girlie\\" pin-ups of the workmen. However, one picture was of a Henry Moore sculpture. \\"A Third Programme carpenter, forsooth,\\" he growled. In the interview, he expressed his disappointment at not being \\"fully stretched\\" in his life, especially after leaving the BBC. He claimed that he could have done more than Churchill gave him to do during the war. He also disclosed an abiding dissatisfaction with his life in general. He admitted not realising soon enough that \\"life is for living,\\" and suggested he perhaps still did not acknowledge that fact. He also stated that since his departure as Director- General, he had watched almost no television and listened to virtually no radio. \\"When I leave a thing, I leave it,\\" he said. In his later years, he also held directorships at the Phoenix Assurance Company, Tube Investments Ltd, the State Building Society (1960‚Äì1964) and was the vice-chairman of the British Oxygen Company (1964‚Äì1966). He took a personal interest in the preservation of the early 19th-century frigate HMS Unicorn in 1962. Reith was appointed Lord Rector of Glasgow University from 1965 to 1968. In 1967, he finally accepted the much-cherished post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. His final television appearance was in a three-part documentary series entitled Lord Reith Looks Back in 1967, filmed at Glasgow University. He died in Edinburgh after a fall, at the age of 81. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were buried at the ancient, ruined chapel of Rothiemurchus in Inverness-shire. =Biographical works= Reith wrote two volumes of autobiography: Into The Wind in 1956 and Wearing Spurs in 1966. Two biographical volumes appeared shortly after his death: Only the Wind Will Listen by Andrew Boyle (1972), and a volume of his diaries edited by the Oxford academic Charles Stuart (1975). It was not until The Expense of Glory (1993) by Ian McIntyre that Reith's unexpurgated diaries and letters were published. =Attitude to fascism= In 1975, excerpts from Reith's diary were published which showed he had, during the 1930s, harboured pro-fascist views. On 9 March 1933, he wrote: \\"I am pretty certain ... that the Nazis will clean things up and put Germany on the way to being a real power in Europe again. They are being ruthless and most determined.\\" After the July 1934 Night of the Long Knives, in which the Nazis ruthlessly exterminated their internal dissidents, Reith wrote: \\"I really admire the way Hitler has cleaned up what looked like an incipient revolt. I really admire the drastic actions taken, which were obviously badly needed.\\" After Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Nazis in 1939 he wrote: \\"Hitler continues his magnificent efficiency.\\" Reith also expressed admiration for Benito Mussolini. Reith's daughter, Marista Leishman, wrote that in the 1930s her father did everything possible to keep Winston Churchill and other anti-appeasement Conservatives off the airwaves.

The term is first attested in 1980, when it was used as a fairly neutral demographic label, but by the mid-to-late 1980s, when a \\"yuppie backlash\\" developed due to concerns over issues such as gentrification, some writers began using the term pejoratively. History The first printed appearance of the word was in a May 1980 Chicago magazine article by Dan Rottenberg. Rottenberg reported in 2015 that he didn't invent the term, he had heard other people using it, and at the time he understood it as a rather neutral demographic term. Nonetheless, his article did note the issues of socioeconomic displacement which might occur as a result of the rise of this inner-city population cohort. Joseph Epstein was credited for coining the term in 1982, although this is contested. The term gained currency in the United States in 1983 when syndicated newspaper columnist Bob Greene published a story about a business networking group founded in 1982 by the former radical leader Jerry Rubin, formerly of the Youth International Party (whose members were called \\"yippies\\"); Greene said he had heard people at the networking group (which met at Studio 54 to soft classical music) joke that Rubin had \\"gone from being a yippie to being a yuppie\\". The headline of Greene's story was \\"From Yippie to Yuppie\\".Hadden-Guest, Anthony (1997). The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night. New York: William Morrow. p. 116. East Bay Express humorist Alice Kahn claimed to have coined the word in a 1983 column. This claim is disputed. The proliferation of the word was affected by the publication of The Yuppie Handbook in January 1983 (a tongue-in-cheek take on The Official Preppy Handbook), followed by Senator Gary Hart's 1984 candidacy as a \\"yuppie candidate\\" for President of the United States. The term was then used to describe a political demographic group of socially liberal but fiscally conservative voters favoring his candidacy. Newsweek magazine declared 1984 \\"The Year of the Yuppie\\", characterizing the salary range, occupations, and politics of \\"yuppies\\" as \\"demographically hazy\\". The alternative acronym yumpie, for young upwardly mobile professional, was also current in the 1980s but failed to catch on. In a 1985 issue of The Wall Street Journal, Theressa Kersten at SRI International described a \\"yuppie backlash\\" by people who fit the demographic profile yet express resentment of the label: \\"You're talking about a class of people who put off having families so they can make payments on the SAABs ... To be a Yuppie is to be a loathsome undesirable creature\\". Leo Shapiro, a market researcher in Chicago, responded, \\"Stereotyping always winds up being derogatory. It doesn't matter whether you are trying to advertise to farmers, Hispanics or Yuppies, no one likes to be neatly lumped into some group.\\" The word lost most of its political connotations and, particularly after the 1987 stock market crash, gained the negative socio-economic connotations that it sports today. On April 8, 1991, Time magazine proclaimed the death of the \\"yuppie\\" in a mock obituary. An anti-yuppie sentiment expressed in graffiti criticizes gentrification. The term has experienced a resurgence in usage during the 2000s and 2010s. In October 2000, David Brooks remarked in a Weekly Standard article that Benjamin Franklin ‚Äì due to his extreme wealth, cosmopolitanism, and adventurous social life ‚Äì is \\"Our Founding Yuppie\\". A recent article in Details proclaimed \\"The Return of the Yuppie\\", stating that \\"the yuppie of 1986 and the yuppie of 2006 are so similar as to be indistinguishable\\" and that \\"the yup\\" is \\"a shape- shifter... he finds ways to reenter the American psyche.\\" In 2010, right-wing political commentator Victor Davis Hanson wrote in National Review very critically of \\"yuppies\\".. Usage outside the United States \\"Yuppie\\" was in common use in Britain from the early 1980s onward (the premiership of Margaret Thatcher) and by 1987 had spawned subsidiary terms used in newspapers such as \\"yuppiedom\\", \\"yuppification\\", \\"yuppify\\" and \\"yuppie-bashing\\". A September 2010 article in The Standard described the items on a typical Hong Kong resident's \\"yuppie wish list\\" based on a survey of 28- to 35-year-olds. About 58% wanted to own their own home, 40% wanted to professionally invest, and 28% wanted to become a boss. A September 2010 article in The New York Times defined as a hallmark of Russian \\"yuppie life\\" adoption of yoga and other elements of Indian culture such as their clothes, food, and furniture.

Biography Van Riebeeck was born in Culemborg, as the son of a surgeon. He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year-old Maria de la Queillerie on 28 March 1649. She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35. The couple had eight or nine children, most of whom did not survive infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Joining the Vereenigde Oost- Indische Compagnie (VOC) (Dutch East India Company) in 1639, he served in a number of posts, including that of an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He was head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Indochina. After being dismissed from that position in 1645, he began to advocate a refreshment station in the Cape of Good Hope after staying 18 days there during his return voyage. Two years later, support increased after a marooned VOC ship was able to survive in a temporary fortress. The Heeren XVII requested a report from Leendert Jansz and Mathys Proot, which recommended a Dutch presence. In 1643, Riebeeck travelled with Jan van Elseracq to the VOC outpost at Dejima in Japan. Seven years later in 1650, he proposed selling hides of South African wild animals to Japan.Osada, Masako. (2002). Sanctions and Honorary Whites: Diplomatic Policies and Economic Realities in Relations Between Japan and South Africa, p. 28. He volunteered to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa and departed from Texel on 24 December 1651. He landed two ships (The Drommedaris and Goede Hoope) at the future Cape Town site on 6 April 1652 and the Reijger on 7 April 1652 and then commenced to fortify it as a way station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The primary purpose of this way station was to provide fresh provisions for the VOC fleets sailing between the Dutch Republic and Batavia, as deaths en route were very high. The Walvisch and the Oliphant arrived on 7 May 1652, having had 130 burials at sea. Jan van Riebeeck arrives in Table Bay in April 1652, painted by Charles Davidson Bell Van Riebeeck was Commander of the Cape from 1652 to 1662; he was charged with building a fort, with improving the natural anchorage at Table Bay, planting cereals, fruit, and vegetables, and obtaining livestock from the indigenous Khoi people. In the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town, a few wild almond trees still survive. The initial fort, named Fort de Goede Hoop ('Fort of Good Hope') was made of mud, clay, and timber, and had four corners or bastions. This fort was replaced by the Castle of Good Hope, built between 1666 and 1679 after van Riebeeck had left the Cape. Van Riebeeck was joined at the Cape by a fellow Culemborger Roelof de Man (1634-1663), who arrived in January 1654 on board the ship Naerden. Roelof came as the colony bookkeeper and was later promoted to second-in-charge. Van Riebeeck established a vineyard in the Colony to produce red wine in order to combat scurvy. Van Riebeeck reported the first comet discovered from South Africa, C/1652 Y1, which was spotted on 17 December 1652. In his time at the Cape, Van Riebeeck oversaw a sustained, systematic effort to establish an impressive range of useful plants in the novel conditions on the Cape Peninsula ‚Äì in the process changing the natural environment forever. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples, and citrus, had an important and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region. The daily diary entries kept throughout his time at the Cape (VOC policy) provided the basis for future exploration of the natural environment and its natural resources. Careful reading of his diaries indicate that some of his knowledge was learned from the indigenous peoples inhabiting the region.S. Pooley, 'Jan van Riebeeck as Pioneering Explorer and Conservator of Natural Resources at the Cape of Good Hope (1652‚Äì62)', Environment and History 15 (2009): 3‚Äì33. He died in Batavia (now renamed Jakarta) on Java in 1677. Legacy in South Africa Jan van Riebeeck's coat of arms The painting of Bartholomeus Vermuyden, thought to be of van Riebeeck instead, which was used on banknotes and coins. Jan van Riebeeck is of cultural and historical significance to South Africa. Many of the Afrikaner population view him as the founding father of their nation. This regard was also prevalent in that his image appeared ubiquitously on stamps. An image used on currency notes after South Africa became a republic in 1961 was thought to be that of Van Riebeeck, but was instead of Bartholomeus Vermuyden. 6 April used to be known as Van Riebeeck's Day, and later as Founders' Day, but the holiday was abolished by the African National Congress government after the elections of 1994. His image no longer features on any official currency or stamps, but statues of him and his wife remain in Adderley Street, Cape Town. The coat of arms of the city of Cape Town is based on the Van Riebeeck family coat of arms. Many South African towns and villages have streets named after him. Riebeek-Kasteel is one of the oldest towns in South Africa, situated 75 km from Cape Town in the Riebeek Valley together with its sister town Riebeek West. Ho√´rskool Jan van Riebeeck is an Afrikaans high school in Cape Town. See also *Ho√´rskool Jan van Riebeeck NotesReferences * Kirby, Robert. The secret letters of Jan van Riebeeck.

IV, 1961, National Gallery of Scotland Frank Helmut Auerbach (born 29 April 1931) is a German-British painter. Born in Germany, he has been a naturalised British citizen since 1947.Richard Morphet, The hard-won image (London: Tate Gallery Publications, 1984), p. 54 Life and career Auerbach was born in Berlin, the son of Max Auerbach, a patent lawyer, and Charlotte Nora Borchardt, who had trained as an artist. Under the influence of the British writer Iris Origo, his parents sent him to Britain in 1939 under the Kindertransport scheme (although he has stated it was by private arrangement),BBC Radio 4 Front Row interview dated 4 October 2013 which brought almost 10,000 mainly Jewish children to Britain to escape from Nazi persecution. Aged seven, Auerbach left Germany via Hamburg on 4 April 1939 and arrived at Southampton on 7 April. Left behind in Germany, Auerbach's parents died in a concentration camp in 1942.Eric L. Santner, On creaturely life: Rilke, Benjamin, Sebald (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), p. 100, note 2Jonathan Jones, \\"Frank Auerbach: a painter's painter of horrors and joy\\", The Guardian, 29 August 2014. In Britain, Auerbach became a pupil at Bunce Court School, near Faversham in Kent, where he excelled in not only art but also drama classes. Indeed, he almost became an actor, even taking a small role in Peter Ustinov's play House of Regrets at the Unity Theatre in St Pancras, at the age of 17. But his interest in art proved a stronger draw and he began studying in London, first at St Martin's School of Art from 1948 to 1952, and at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1955. Yet, perhaps the clearest influence on his art training came from a series of additional art classes he took at London's Borough Polytechnic, where he and fellow St Martin's student Leon Kossoff were taught by David Bomberg from 1947 until 1953.Catherine Lampert and Norman Rosenthal, Frank Auerbach: Paintings and Drawings 1954‚Äì2001 (London: Royal Academy of Arts, 2001), p. 20 From 1955, he began teaching in secondary schools, but quickly moved into the visiting tutor circuit at numerous art schools, including Ravensbourne, Ealing, Sidcup and the Slade School of Art. However, he was most frequently to be found teaching at Camberwell School of Art, where he taught from 1958 to 1965.Geoff Hassell, Camberwell School of Arts & Crafts: Its Students and Teachers 1943‚Äì1960 (Woodbridge: The Antique Collectors' Club, 1998), p. 31 Auerbach's first solo exhibition was at the Beaux Arts Gallery in London in 1956, followed by further solo shows at the Beaux Arts Gallery in 1959, 1961, 1962 and 1963, and then at Marlborough Fine Art in London at regular intervals after 1965; at Marlborough Gallery, New York, in 1969, 1982, 1994, 1998 and 2006; and at Marlborough Graphics in 1990.Barnaby Wright et al., Frank Auerbach: The London Building Sites 1952‚Äì1962 (London: Paul Holberton Publishing, 2010), p. 80 In 1978, he was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, London, and in 1986 he represented Britain in the Venice Biennale, sharing the biennale's main prize, the Golden Lion, with Sigmar Polke. Further exhibitions have included Eight Figurative Painters, held at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, USA, in 1981, alongside Michael Andrews, Francis Bacon, William Coldstream, Lucian Freud, Patrick George, Leon Kossoff and Euan Uglow; and a retrospective at the Kunstverein, Hamburg, in 1986, comprising paintings and drawings made between 1977 and 1985 originally shown at the 42nd Venice Biennale, also in 1986. This show then toured, with some additional works, to the Museum Folkwang, Essen, and the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, in 1987. Exhibitions were also held at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in 1989; the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, in 1991; and the National Gallery, London, in 1995.Colin Wiggins, Frank Auerbach and the National Gallery (London: National Gallery Publications, 1995) He was included in the exhibition A New Spirit in Painting at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1981 and a solo exhibition of his paintings and drawings 1954 to 2001 was held there in 2001; and held a solo show entitled Frank Auerbach Etchings and Drypoints 1954‚Äì2006 at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, which toured to the Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, during 2007‚Äì08; and another solo show at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, in 2009.Barnaby Wright et al., Frank Auerbach: The London Building Sites 1952‚Äì1962 (London: Paul Holberton Publishing, 2010), p. 80 Auerbach was the subject of a television film entitled Frank Auerbach: To the Studio (2001), directed by Hannah Rothschild and produced by Jake Auerbach (Jake Auerbach Films Ltd). This was first broadcast on the arts programme Omnibus on 10 November 2001. David Bowie bought and owned Auerbach's \\"Head of Gerda Boehm\\" as part of his private collection. After Bowie's death in 2016, this piece was among many put up for auction in November 2016, where it was sold for ¬£3.8 million (US$4.7 million). London's Tate Britain, in association with the Kunstmuseum Bonn, organized a major retrospective of Auerbach's work in 2015 and 2016. The exhibit was curated by Catherine Lampert together with the artist.T.J. Clark and Catherine Lampert, \\"Frank Auerbach\\" (London: Tate Publishing, 2015). Style and influences Auerbach is a figurative painter, who focuses on portraits and city scenes in and around the area of London in which he lives, Camden Town.\\"Art View\\" in The Economist, 3 February 2007 Although sometimes described as expressionistic,Ben Lewis, \\"Exuberant unpredictability\\", in The Daily Telegraph (London), 30 April 2006. Also see John Gruen, \\"Too Many Spooks\\", in New York, 13 October 1969, p. 54 Auerbach is not an expressionist painter. His work is not concerned with finding a visual equivalent to an emotional or spiritual state that characterised the expressionist movement, rather it deals with the attempt to resolve the experience of being in the world in paint. In this the experience of the world is seen as essentially chaotic with the role of the artist being to impose an order upon that chaos and record that order in the painting.Richard Dorment, \\"Heads above the rest\\", in The Daily Telegraph (London), 19 September 2001. This ambition with the paintings results in Auerbach developing intense relationships with particular subjects, particularly the people he paints, but also the location of his cityscape subjects. Speaking on this in 2001 he stated: \\"If you pass something every day and it has a little character, it begins to intrigue you.\\"John O'Mahony, \\"Surfaces and depths\\", in The Guardian (London), 15 September 2001 This simple statement belies the intensity of the relationship that develops between Auerbach and his subjects, which results in an astonishing desire to produce an image the artist considers 'right'. This leads Auerbach to paint an image and then scrape it off the canvas at the end of each day, repeating this process time and again, not primarily to create a layering of images but because of a sense of dissatisfaction with the image leading him to try to paint it again.Ben Lewis, \\"Exuberant unpredictability\\", in The Daily Telegraph (London), 30 April 2006 This also indicates that the thick paint in Auerbach's work, which led to some of Auerbach's paintings in the 1950s being considered difficult to hang, partly due to their weight and according to some newspaper reports in case the paint fell off,Moira Jeffrey, \\"Still laying it on thick\\", in The Herald (Glasgow) 1 February 2002, p. 21 is not primarily the result of building up a lot of paint over time. It is in fact applied in a very short space of time, and may well be scraped off very soon after application. This technique has not always been considered positively, with the Manchester Guardian newspaper commenting in 1956 that: \\"The technique is so fantastically obtrusive that it is some time before one penetrates to the intentions that should justify this grotesque method.\\"Unsigned review, \\"Large paintings in narrow confines\\", in The Manchester Guardian, 11 January 1956 This intensity of approach and handling has also not always sat well with the art world that developed in Britain from the late 1980s onwards, with one critic at that time, Stuart Morgan, denouncing Auerbach for espousing \\"conservatism as if it were a religion\\" on the basis that he applies paint without a sense of irony.Stuart Morgan, \\"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\\", in frieze, issue 21, March‚ÄìApril 1995 As well as painting street scenes close to his London home, Auerbach tends to paint a small number of people repeatedly, including Estella Olive West (indicated in painting titles as EOW), Juliet Yardley Mills (or JYM)Hannah Rothschild, \\"Man of Many Layers\\", in Telegraph Magazine, 28 September 2013 and Auerbach's wife Julia Auerbach (n√©e Wolstenholme). He has been painting art historian and curator Catherine Lampert regularly since 1978 when she organized his retrospective at the Hayward Gallery.Catherine Lampert, \\"Frank Auerbach: Speaking and Painting\\" (Thames & Hudson, 2015). Again, a similar obsession with specific subjects, and a desire to return to them to \\"try again\\" is discernable in this use of the same models. A strong emphasis in Auerbach's work is its relationship to the history of art. Showing at the National Gallery in London in 1994 he made direct reference to the gallery's collection of paintings by Rembrandt, Titian and Rubens. Unlike the National Gallery's Associate Artist Scheme, however, Auerbach's work after historic artists was not the result of a short residency at the National Gallery, it has a long history, and in this exhibition he showed paintings made after Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne, from the 1970s to Rubens's Samson and Delilah made in 1993.Tom Lubbock, \\"After you, master, after you\\", The Independent (London), 1 August 1995 Auerbach's personal history, and his painting style, are the basis for the character \\"Max Ferber\\" in W. G. Sebald's award-winning novel The Emigrants (1992 in Germany, 1996 in Britain). Bibliography *Frank Auerbach, T.J.

Countercurrent exchange is a mechanism occurring in nature and mimicked in industry and engineering, in which there is a crossover of some property, usually heat or some chemical, between two flowing bodies flowing in opposite directions to each other. The flowing bodies can be liquids, gases, or even solid powders, or any combination of those. For example, in a distillation column, the vapors bubble up through the downward flowing liquid while exchanging both heat and mass. The maximum amount of heat or mass transfer that can be obtained is higher with countercurrent than co-current (parallel) exchange because countercurrent maintains a slowly declining difference or gradient (usually temperature or concentration difference). In cocurrent exchange the initial gradient is higher but falls off quickly, leading to wasted potential. For example, in the adjacent diagram, the fluid being heated (exiting top) has a higher exiting temperature than the cooled fluid (exiting bottom) that was used for heating. With cocurrent or parallel exchange the heated and cooled fluids can only approach one another. The result is that countercurrent exchange can achieve a greater amount of heat or mass transfer than parallel under otherwise similar conditions. See: flow arrangement. Countercurrent exchange when set up in a circuit or loop can be used for building up concentrations, heat, or other properties of flowing liquids. Specifically when set up in a loop with a buffering liquid between the incoming and outgoing fluid running in a circuit, and with active transport pumps on the outgoing fluid's tubes, the system is called a countercurrent multiplier, enabling a multiplied effect of many small pumps to gradually build up a large concentration in the buffer liquid. Other countercurrent exchange circuits where the incoming and outgoing fluids touch each other are used for retaining a high concentration of a dissolved substance or for retaining heat, or for allowing the external buildup of the heat or concentration at one point in the system. Countercurrent exchange circuits or loops are found extensively in nature, specifically in biologic systems. In vertebrates, they are called a rete mirabile, originally the name of an organ in fish gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. It is mimicked in industrial systems. Countercurrent exchange is a key concept in chemical engineering thermodynamics and manufacturing processes, for example in extracting sucrose from sugar beet roots. Countercurrent multiplication is a similar but different concept where liquid moves in a loop followed by a long length of movement in opposite directions with an intermediate zone. The tube leading to the loop passively building up a gradient of heat (or cooling) or solvent concentration while the returning tube has a constant small pumping action all along it, so that a gradual intensification of the heat or concentration is created towards the loop. Countercurrent multiplication has been found in the kidneysBoth countercurrent exchange and countercurrent multiplication systems have been found in the kidneys. The latter in the loop of Henle, the first in the vasa recta as well as in many other biological organs.  Three current exchange systems  Three topologies of countercurrent exchange systems Countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them. The property transferred could be heat, concentration of a chemical substance, or other properties of the flow. When heat is transferred, a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes, and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used. = Cocurrent flow‚Äîhalf transfer = A comparison between the operations and effects of a cocurrent and a countercurrent flow exchange system is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams respectively. In both it is assumed (and indicated) that red has a higher value (e.g. of temperature) than blue and that the property being transported in the channels therefore flows from red to blue. Note that channels are contiguous if effective exchange is to occur (i.e. there can be no gap between the channels). In the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism, the two fluids flow in the same direction. As the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed, a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger. With equal flows in the two tubes, this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other, no matter how long the exchanger is. If each stream changes its property to be 50% closer to that of the opposite stream's inlet condition, exchange will stop when the point of equilibrium is reached, and the gradient has declined to zero. In the case of unequal flows, the equilibrium condition will occur somewhat closer to the conditions of the stream with the higher flow. Cocurrent flow examples Cocurrent and Countercurrent heat exchange A cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism. Two tubes have a liquid flowing in the same direction. One starts off hot at 60 ¬∞C, the second cold at 20 ¬∞C. A thermoconductive membrane or an open section allows heat transfer between the two flows. The hot fluid heats the cold one, and the cold fluid cools down the warm one. The result is thermal equilibrium: Both fluids end up at around the same temperature: 40 ¬∞C, almost exactly between the two original temperatures (20 and 60 ¬∞C). At the input end, there is a large temperature difference of 40 ¬∞C and much heat transfer; at the output end, there is a very small temperature difference (both are at the same temperature of 40 ¬∞C or close to it), and very little heat transfer if any at all. If the equilibrium‚Äîwhere both tubes are at the same temperature‚Äîis reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes, no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes. A similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange. The system consists of two tubes, one with brine (concentrated saltwater), the other with freshwater (which has a low concentration of salt in it), and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two, in an osmotic process. Many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine, while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows (since the salt is not leaving this flow, while water is). This will continue, until both flows reach a similar dilution, with a concentration somewhere close to midway between the two original dilutions. Once that happens, there will be no more flow between the two tubes, since both are at a similar dilution and there is no more osmotic pressure. = Countercurrent flow‚Äîalmost full transfer = Spiral counter-current heat exchange schematic In countercurrent flow, the two flows move in opposite directions. Two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions, transferring a property from one tube to the other. For example, this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one, or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow. The counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact. With a sufficiently long length and a sufficiently low flow rate this can result in almost all of the property transferred. So, for example, in the case of heat exchange, the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid's heat.  Countercurrent flow examples  Classic flat pipe cocurrent and counter-current exchange shown again In a countercurrent heat exchanger, the hot fluid becomes cold, and the cold fluid becomes hot. In this example, hot water at 60 ¬∞C enters the top pipe. It warms water in the bottom pipe which has been warmed up along the way, to almost 60 ¬∞C. A minute but existing heat difference still exists, and a small amount of heat is transferred, so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to 60 ¬∞C. Because the hot input is at its maximum temperature of 60 ¬∞C, and the exiting water at the bottom pipe is nearly at that temperature but not quite, the water in the top pipe can warm the one in the bottom pipe to nearly its own temperature. At the cold end‚Äîthe water exit from the top pipe, because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 ¬∞C, it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe, bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid (21 ¬∞C). The result is that the top pipe which received hot water, now has cold water leaving it at 20 ¬∞C, while the bottom pipe which received cold water, is now emitting hot water at close to 60 ¬∞C. In effect, most of the heat was transferred.  Conditions for higher transfer results  Nearly complete transfer in systems implementing countercurrent exchange, is only possible if the two flows are, in some sense, \\"equal\\". For a maximum transfer of substance concentration, an equal flowrate of solvents and solutions is required. For maximum heat transfer, the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream. If the two flows are not equal, for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa, then, similar to cocurrent exchange systems, a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly.The specific heat capacity should be calculated on a mass basis, averaged over the temperature range involved. This is in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics Countercurrent exchange in biological systems Rete mirabile = RM Countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by Werner Kuhn. Countercurrent exchange is used extensively in biological systems for a wide variety of purposes. For example, fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood, and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies. In vertebrates, this type of organ is referred to as a rete mirabile (originally the name of the organ in the fish gills). Mammalian kidneys use countercurrent exchange to remove water from urine so the body can retain water used to move the nitrogenous waste products (see countercurrent multiplier). = Countercurrent multiplication loop = Counter current multiplication loop diagram A countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance. A buffer liquid between the incoming and outgoing tubes receives the concentrated substance. The incoming and outgoing tubes do not touch each other. The system allows the buildup of a high concentration gradually, by allowing a natural buildup of concentration towards the tip inside the in-going tube, (for example using osmosis of water out of the input pipe and into the buffer fluid), and the use of many active transport pumps each pumping only against a very small gradient, during the exit from the loop, returning the concentration inside the output pipe to its original concentration. The incoming flow starting at a low concentration has a semipermeable membrane with water passing to the buffer liquid via osmosis at a small gradient. There is a gradual buildup of concentration inside the loop until the loop tip where it reaches its maximum. Theoretically a similar system could exist or be constructed for heat exchange. In the example shown in the image, water enters at 299 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Water passes because of a small osmotic pressure to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer, gradually raising the concentration of NaCl in the tube until it reaches 1199 mg/L at the tip. The buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration, always a bit over the incoming fluid, in this example reaching 1200 mg/L. This is regulated by the pumping action on the returning tube as will be explained immediately. The tip of the loop has the highest concentration of salt (NaCl) in the incoming tube‚Äîin the example 1199 mg/L, and in the buffer 1200 mg/L. The returning tube has active transport pumps, pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 mg/L more than in the tube. Thus when opposite the 1000 mg/L in the buffer liquid, the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 mg/L are needed to be pumped out. But the same is true anywhere along the line, so that at exit of the loop also only 200 mg/L need to be pumped. In effect, this can be seen as a gradually multiplying effect‚Äîhence the name of the phenomena: a 'countercurrent multiplier' or the mechanism: Countercurrent multiplication, but in current engineering terms, countercurrent multiplication is any process where only slight pumping is needed, due to the constant small difference of concentration or heat along the process, gradually raising to its maximum. There is no need for a buffer liquid, if the desired effect is receiving a high concentration at the output pipe.  In the kidney  Nephron Ion flow diagram Loop of Henle (Gray's Anatomy book) A circuit of fluid in the Loop of Henle‚Äîan important part of the kidneys allows for gradual buildup of the concentration of urine in the kidneys, by using active transport on the exiting nephrons (tubules carrying liquid in the process of gradually concentrating the urea). The active transport pumps need only to overcome a constant and low gradient of concentration, because of the countercurrent multiplier mechanismSee the countercurrent multiplier animation at the Colorado University website. Various substances are passed from the liquid entering the nephrons until exiting the loop (See the nephron flow diagram). The sequence of flow is as follows: * Renal corpuscle: Liquid enters the nephron system at the Bowman's capsule.Beginning with the afferent arteriole, a blood vessel leading to the Glomerulus, filtered blood is passed to the nephrons in the Bowman's capsule which surrounds the Glomerulus. (The blood leaves the Glomerulus in the efferent arteriole). * Proximal convoluted tubule: It then may reabsorb urea in the thick descending limb.The liquid from the Bowman's capsule reaches the thick descending limb. Urea may be reabsorbed into the low (300 mOsm) osmotic concentration in the limb nephrons. The urea absorption in the thick descending limb is inhibited by Sartans and catalyzed by lactates and ketones. Water is removed from the nephrons by osmosis (and glucose and other ions are pumped out with active transport), gradually raising the concentration in the nephrons.Glucose, amino acids, various ions and organic material leave the limb, gradually raising the concentration in the nephrons. Dopamin inhibits the secretion from the thick descending limb, and Angiotensin II catalyzes it * Loop of Henle Descending: The liquid passes from the thin descending limb to the thick ascending limb. Water is constantly released via osmosis.The semipermeable membrane of the thin descending limb does not permit passage of ions or large dissolved molecules Gradually there is a buildup of osmotic concentration, until 1200 mOsm is reached at the loop tip, but the difference across the membrane is kept small and constant. :For example, the liquid at one section inside the thin descending limb is at 400 mOsm while outside it is 401. Further down the descending limb, the inside concentration is 500 while outside it is 501, so a constant difference of 1 mOsm is kept all across the membrane, although the concentration inside and outside are gradually increasing. * Loop of Henle Ascending: after the tip (or 'bend') of the loop, the liquid flows in the thin ascending limb.The thin ascending limb's membrane does not permit free passage of any substance including water. Salt‚Äìsodium Na+ and chloride Cl‚àí ions are pumped out of the liquidFurosemide inhibits salt secretion from the thin ascending limb, while aldosterone catalyzes the secretion. gradually lowering the concentration in the exiting liquid, but, using the countercurrent multiplier mechanism, always pumping against a constant and small osmotic difference. :For example, the pumps at a section close to the bend, pump out from 1000 mOsm inside the ascending limb to 1200 mOsm outside it, with a 200 mOsm across. Pumps further up the thin ascending limb, pump out from 400 mOsm into liquid at 600 mOsm, so again the difference is retained at 200 mOsm from the inside to the outside, while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances. :The liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mOsm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick oneWater or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the Peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood. * Distal convoluted tubule: Once leaving the loop of Henle the thick ascending limb can optionally reabsorb and re increase the concentration in the nephrons.Reabsorbing and increasing the concentration is done by optionally absorbing potassium (K+) and hydrogen (H+) cations, while releasing water and the continued pumping out of calcium (Ca+) and salt (Na+ and Cl‚àí ions). The repeated concentration by secretion of calcium and salt ions is inhibited by thiazides and catalyzed by Aantidiuretic hormone and aldosterone * Collecting duct: The collecting duct receives liquid between 100 mOsm if no re-absorption is done, to 300 or above if re-absorption was used. The collecting duct may continue raising the concentration if required, by gradually pumping out the same ions as the Distal convoluted tubule, using the same gradient as the ascending limbs in the loop of Henle, and reaching the same concentration.Atrial natriuretic peptide and urodilatin inhibit water salt and calcium secretion from the collecting duct, while antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone catalyze it. * Ureter: The liquid urine leaves to the Ureter. * Same principle is used in hemodialysis within artificial kidney machines.  History  Initially the countercurrent exchange mechanism and its properties were proposed in 1951 by professor Werner Kuhn and two of his former students who called the mechanism found in the Loop of Henle in mammalian kidneys a Countercurrent multiplierThe original lecture was published in 1951 in German. According to a book on Jewish scientists under the Reich Kuhn theorized and studied this mechanism already in the early 1940s. This was confirmed in 2001 in the translation to the original lecture published with remarks by Professor Bart Hargitay, then one of the two former student aids. Harbitay says: Before settling in Basel, Kuhn did some very fundamental work in Kiel, separating isotopes in a centrifuge. This caused him to be fascinated with the effect of countercurrents in multiplying a very small single effect to significant separations. (Journal of the American Society of Nephrology website) and confirmed by laboratory findings in 1958 by Professor Carl W. Gottschalk.. The theory was acknowledged a year later after a meticulous study showed that there is almost no osmotic difference between liquids on both sides of nephrons.. See also History of the urinary concentrating mechanism an article in 'Kidney'‚Äîthe Journal of International Society of Nephrology, where Prof. Gottschalk points to the heated debate prior to the acceptance of the theory of the countercurrent multiplier action of the kidney Homer Smith, a considerable contemporary authority on renal physiology, opposed the model countercurrent concentration for 8 years, until conceding ground in 1959.Smith, Homer W., The fate of sodium and water in the renal tubules, Bull. New York Academy of Medicine 35:293‚Äì316, 1959. Ever since, many similar mechanisms have been found in biologic systems, the most notable of these: the Rete mirabile in fish. = Countercurrent exchange of heat in organisms = The arterial and deep vein blood supply to the human arm. The superficial (subcutaneous) veins are not shown. The deep veins are wrapped round the arteries, and the consequent counter-current flow allows the hand to be cooled down considerably without loss of body heat, which is short- circuited by the counter current flow. In cold weather the blood flow to the limbs of birds and mammals is reduced on exposure to cold environmental conditions, and returned to the trunk via the deep veins which lie alongside the arteries (forming venae comitantes). This acts as a counter-current exchange system which short-circuits the warmth from the arterial blood directly into the venous blood returning into the trunk, causing minimal heat loss from the extremities in cold weather. The subcutaneous limb veins are tightly constricted, thereby reducing heat loss via this route, and forcing the blood returning from the extremities into the counter-current blood flow systems in the centers of the limbs. Birds and mammals that regularly immerse their limbs in cold or icy water have particularly well developed counter- current blood flow systems to their limbs, allowing prolonged exposure of the extremities to the cold without significant loss of body heat, even when the limbs are as thin as the lower legs, or tarsi, of a bird, for instance. When animals like the leatherback turtle and dolphins are in colder water to which they are not acclimatized, they use this CCHE mechanism to prevent heat loss from their flippers, tail flukes, and dorsal fins. Such CCHE systems are made up of a complex network of peri-arterial venous plexuses, or venae comitantes, that run through the blubber from their minimally insulated limbs and thin streamlined protuberances. Each plexus consists of a central artery containing warm blood from the heart surrounded by a bundle of veins containing cool blood from the body surface. As these fluids flow past each other, they create a heat gradient in which heat is transferred and retained inside the body. The warm arterial blood transfers most of its heat to the cool venous blood now coming in from the outside. This conserves heat by recirculating it back to the body core. Since the arteries give up a good deal of their heat in this exchange, there is less heat lost through convection at the periphery surface. Another example is found in the legs of an Arctic fox treading on snow. The paws are necessarily cold, but blood can circulate to bring nutrients to the paws without losing much heat from the body. Proximity of arteries and veins in the leg results in heat exchange, so that as the blood flows down it becomes cooler, and doesn't lose much heat to the snow. As the (cold) blood flows back up from the paws through the veins, it picks up heat from the blood flowing in the opposite direction, so that it returns to the torso in a warm state, allowing the fox to maintain a comfortable temperature, without losing it to the snow. This system is so efficient that the Arctic fox does not begin to shiver until the temperature drops to . = Countercurrent exchange in sea and desert birds to conserve water = Sea and desert birds have been found to have a salt gland near the nostrils which concentrates brine, later to be \\"sneezed\\" out to the sea, in effect allowing these birds to drink seawater without the need to find freshwater resources. It also enables the seabirds to remove the excess salt entering the body when eating, swimming or diving in the sea for food. The kidney cannot remove these quantities and concentrations of salt. The salt secreting gland has been found in seabirds like pelicans, petrels, albatrosses, gulls, and terns. It has also been found in Namibian ostriches and other desert birds, where a buildup of salt concentration is due to dehydration and scarcity of drinking water. In seabirds the salt gland is above the beak, leading to a main canal above the beak, and water is blown from two small nostrils on the beak, to empty it. The salt gland has two countercurrent mechanisms working in it: a. A salt extraction system with a countercurrent multiplication mechanism, where salt is actively pumped from the blood 'venules' (small veins) into the gland tubules. Although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood, the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange, so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal. Thus, all along the gland, there is only a small gradient to climb, in order to push the salt from the blood to the salty fluid with active transport powered by ATP. b. The blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland's blood, so that it doesn't leave back to the blood system. The glands remove the salt efficiently and thus allow the birds to drink the salty water from their environment while they are hundreds of miles away from land.  Countercurrent exchange in industry and scientific research  Hardendale Lime Works in the UK using countercurrent kilns to reach high temperatures Countercurrent Chromatography is a method of separation, that is based on the differential partitioning of analytes between two immiscible liquids using countercurrent or cocurrent flow. Evolving from Craig's Countercurrent Distribution (CCD), the most widely used term and abbreviation is CounterCurrent Chromatography or CCC, in particular when using hydrodynamic CCC instruments. The term partition chromatography is largely a synonymous and predominantly used for hydrostatic CCC instruments. * Distillation of chemicals such as in petroleum refining is done in towers or columns with perforated trays. Vapor from the low boiling fractions bubbles upward through the holes in the trays in contact with the down flowing high boiling fractions. The concentration of low boiling fraction increases in each tray up the tower as it is \\"stripped\\". The low boiling fraction is drawn off the top of the tower and the high boiling fraction drawn from the bottom. The process in the trays is a combination of heat transfer and mass transfer. Heat is supplied at the bottom, known as a \\"reboiler\\" and cooling is done with a condenser at the top. Counter flow in liquid-liquid extraction * Liquid-liquid extraction (also called 'solvent extraction' or 'partitioning') is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different 'phase' (such as \\"slurry\\"). This method, which implements a countercurrent mechanism, is used in nuclear reprocessing, ore processing, the production of fine organic compounds, the processing of perfumes, the production of vegetable oils and biodiesel, and other industries. * Gold can be separated from a cyanide solution with the Merrill-Crowe process using Counter Current Decantation (CCD). In some mines, Nickel and Cobalt are treated with CCD, after the original ore was treated with concentrated Sulfuric acid and steam in Titanium covered autoclaves, producing nickel cobalt slurry. The nickel and cobalt in the slurry are removed from it almost completely using a CCD system exchanging the cobalt and nickel with flash steam heated water. Countercurrent furnace (kiln) heat exchange * Lime can be manufactured in countercurrent furnaces allowing the heat to reach high temperatures using low cost, low temperature burning fuel. Historically this was developed by the Japanese in certain types of the Anagama kiln. The kiln is built in stages, where fresh air coming to the fuel is passed downwards while the smoke and heat is pushed up and out. The heat does not leave the kiln, but is transferred back to the incoming air, and thus slowly builds up to 3000 ¬∞C and more. Cement counter-current rotary kiln * Cement may be created using a countercurrent kiln where the heat is passed in the cement and the exhaust combined, while the incoming air draft is passed along the two, absorbing the heat and retaining it inside the furnace, finally reaching high temperatures. * Gasification: the process of creating methane and carbon monoxide from organic or fossil matter, can be done using a Counter-current fixed bed (\\"up draft\\") gasifier which is built in a similar way to the Anagama kiln, and must therefore withstand more harsh conditions, but reaches better efficiency. * In nuclear power plants, water leaving the plant must not contain even trace particles of Uranium. Counter Current Decantation (CCD) is used in some facilities to extract water, totally clear of Uranium. Exchange current decantation depicted in centrifugal extractors as 1st stage * Zippe- type centrifuges use countercurrent multiplication between rising and falling convection currents to reduce the number of stages needed in a cascade. * Some Centrifugal extractors use counter current exchange mechanisms for extracting high rates of the desired material. * Some protein skimmers: a device to clean saltwater pools and fish ponds of organic matter‚Äîuse counter current technologies. * Countercurrent processes have also been used to study the behavior of small animals and isolate individuals with altered behaviors due to genetic mutations.

Air bubbles floating upwards meet water in a down current, causing more of the air to dissolve.According to the company, almost half of the electricity in the US is used to aerate sewage and wastewater. The countercurrent exchange method saves up to 50% of the electricity  References  Category:Chemical process engineering Category:Industrial processes Category:Animal anatomy Category:Renal physiology Category:Heat transfer ","title":"Countercurrent exchange"},{"id":"171318","text":"In 1983, David H. D. Warren designed an abstract machine for the execution of Prolog consisting of a memory architecture and an instruction set. This design became known as the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) and has become the de facto standard target for Prolog compilers. Purpose The purpose of compiling Prolog code to the more low-level WAM code is to make subsequent interpretation of the Prolog program more efficient. Prolog code is reasonably easy to translate to WAM instructions, which can be more efficiently interpreted. Also, subsequent code improvements and compilations to native code are often easier to perform on the more low-level representation. In order to write efficient Prolog programs, a basic understanding of how the WAM works can be advantageous. Some of the most important WAM concepts are first argument indexing and its relation to choice-points, tail call optimization, and memory reclamation on failure. Memory areas The WAM has the following memory areas: * The global stack or heap, used to store compound terms * The local stack for environment frames and choice-points * The trail to record which variables bindings ought to be undone on backtracking Example Here is a piece of Prolog code: girl(sally). girl(jane). boy(B) :- \\\\\\\\+ girl(B). A WAM-based Prolog compiler will compile this into WAM instructions similar to the following: predicate(girl/1): switch_on_term(2,1,fail,fail,fail), label(1): switch_on_atom([(sally,3),(jane,5)]) label(2): try_me_else(4) label(3): get_atom(sally,0) proceed label(4): trust_me_else_fail label(5): get_atom(jane,0) proceed predicate(boy/1): get_variable(x(1),0) put_structure(girl/1,0) unify_local_value(x(1)) execute((\\\\\\\\+)/1)]) An important characteristic of this code is its ability to cope with the various modes in which the predicates can be evoked: any argument might be a variable, a ground term, or a partly instantiated term.

The bandwagon effect is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion of others who have already done so. As more people come to believe in something, others also \\"hop on the bandwagon\\" regardless of the underlying evidence. The tendency to follow the actions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to conform, or because individuals derive information from others. Both explanations have been used for evidence of conformity in psychological experiments. For example, social pressure has been used to explain Asch's conformity experiments, and information has been used to explain Sherif's autokinetic experiment. According to this concept, the increasing popularity of a product or phenomenon encourages more people to \\"get on the bandwagon\\", too. The bandwagon effect explains why there are fashion trends. When individuals make rational choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that information cascades can quickly form in which people decide to ignore their personal information signals and follow the behavior of others. Cascades explain why behavior is fragile‚Äîpeople understand that they are based on very limited information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. Such informational effects have been used to explain political bandwagons. Origin The definition of a bandwagon is a wagon which carries a band during the course of a parade, circus or other entertainment event. The phrase \\"jump on the bandwagon\\" first appeared in American politics in 1848 when Dan Rice, a famous and popular circus clown of the time, used his bandwagon and its music to gain attention for his political campaign appearances. As his campaign became more successful, other politicians strove for a seat on the bandwagon, hoping to be associated with his success. Later, during the time of William Jennings Bryan's 1900 presidential campaign, bandwagons had become standard in campaigns, and the phrase \\"jump on the bandwagon\\" was used as a derogatory term, implying that people were associating themselves with success without considering that with which they associated themselves. In politics The bandwagon effect occurs in voting: some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the \\"winner's side\\" in the end. The bandwagon effect has been applied to situations involving majority opinion, such as political outcomes, where people alter their opinions to the majority view. Such a shift in opinion can occur because individuals draw inferences from the decisions of others, as in an informational cascade. Because of time zones, election results are broadcast in the eastern parts of the United States while polls are still open in the west. This difference has led to research on how the behavior of voters in western United States is influenced by news about the decisions of voters in other time zones. In 1980, NBC News declared Ronald Reagan to be the winner of the presidential race on the basis of the exit polls several hours before the voting booths closed in the west. It is also said to be important in the American presidential primary elections. States all vote at different times, spread over some months, rather than all on one day. Some states (Iowa, New Hampshire) have special precedence to go early while others choose to wait until a certain date. This is often said to give undue influence to these states, a win in these early states is said to give a candidate the \\"Big Mo\\" (momentum) and has propelled many candidates to win the nomination. Because of this, other states often try front loading (going as early as possible) to make their say as influential as they can. In the 2008 presidential primaries two states had all or some of their delegates banned from the convention by the central party organizations for voting too early.(2007, October 22). 5 States May Use Half Of GOP [Supplemental Material]. USA Today. Retrieved from https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-10-22-gop- delegates_N.htm Several studies have tested this theory of the bandwagon effect in political decision making. In the 1994 study of Robert K. Goidel and Todd G. Shields in The Journal of Politics, 180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios. About 70% of subjects received information about the expected winner. Independents, which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral, were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win. Expectations played a significant role throughout the study. It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win. From the results, it was also found that when the Democrat was expected to win, independent Republicans and weak Republicans were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate. A study by Albert Mehrabian, reported in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology (1998), tested the relative importance of the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the underdog (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the bandwagon effect to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% of the variance in the vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate \\"is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin\\". Thus, as poll results are repeatedly reported, the bandwagon effect will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates. During the 1992 U.S. presidential election, Vicki G. Morwitz and Carol Pluzinski conducted a study, which was published in The Journal of Consumer Research (1996). At a large northeastern university, some of 214 volunteer business students were given the results of student and national polls indicating that Bill Clinton was in the lead. Others were not exposed to the results of the polls. Several students who had intended to vote for Bush changed their minds after seeing the poll results. Additionally, British polls have shown an increase to public exposure. Sixty-eight percent of voters had heard of the general election campaign results of the opinion poll in 1979. In 1987, this number of voters aware of the results increased to 74%. According to British studies, there is a consistent pattern of apparent bandwagon effects for the leading party. In a study published in the European Economic Review (2015), Morton and co-authors, used the large number of time zones across French overseas territories, to study the bandwagon effect. Before 2002, all territories were voting on Sunday in the presidential elections. For that reason, voters in territories located to the West of mainland France (e.g. French Guyana) could observe the exit polls from mainland France before the close of their local polling booths. After 2002, a law was passed for these territories to vote on Saturday, in order to avoid this situation. The authors observed a bandwagon effect: when voters from Western territories could observe the winner in mainland France, this candidate was doing much better locally. After 2002, when voting in these territories took place before mainland France, this bandwagon voting disappeared. In microeconomics In microeconomics, bandwagon effects may play out in interactions of demand and preference. The bandwagon effect arises when people's preference for a commodity increases as the number of people buying it increases. This interaction potentially disturbs the normal results of the theory of supply and demand, which assumes that consumers make buying decisions solely based on price and their own personal preference. Gary Becker has argued that bandwagon effects could be so strong as to make the demand curve slope upward.  In medicine  Medical bandwagons have been identified as \\"the overwhelming acceptance of unproved but popular ideas\\". They have led to inappropriate therapies for numerous patients, and have impeded the development of more appropriate treatment. In Lawrence Cohen and Henry Rothschild's exposition The Bandwagons of Medicine (1979) several of these therapeutic misadventures, some of which persisted for centuries before they were abandoned, substituted by another bandwagon, or replaced by a scientifically valid alternative. The ancient serpent cult of Aesculapius, in which sacred snakes licked the afflicted as treatment of their diseases, is an example of a bandwagon gathering momentum based on a strong personality, in this case a Roman god.  In sports  NBA MVP (2014/15 - 2015/16) One who supports a particular sports team, despite having shown no interest in that team until it started gaining success, can be considered a \\"bandwagon fan\\". One recent example in the United States is the Golden State Warriors, who rose to prominence by winning the 2015 NBA Finals, followed by a record-breaking 73‚Äì9 record the following year.

It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west. The battle was the culmination of the Retreat from Mons and pursuit of the Franco‚ÄìBritish armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and reached the eastern outskirts of Paris. Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), began to plan for a full British retreat to port cities on the English Channel for an immediate evacuation. The military governor of Paris, Joseph Simon Gallieni, wanted the Franco‚ÄìBritish units to counter-attack the Germans along the Marne River and halt the German advance. Allied reserves would restore the ranks and attack the German flanks. On 5 September, the counter-offensive by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) began. By 9 September, the success of the Franco‚ÄìBritish counteroffensive left the German 1st and 2nd Armies at risk of encirclement, and they were ordered to retreat to the Aisne River. The retreating armies were pursued by the French and British, although the pace of the Allied advance was slow: in one day. The German armies ceased their retreat after on a line north of the Aisne River, where they dug in on the heights and fought the First Battle of the Aisne. The German retreat between 9 September and 13 September marked the end of the attempt to defeat France by crushing the French armies with an invasion from the north through Belgium and in the south over the common border. Both sides commenced reciprocal operations to envelop the northern flank of their opponent, in what became known as the Race to the Sea which culminated in the First Battle of Ypres. Background=Battle of the Frontiers= The Battle of the Frontiers is a general name for all the operations of the French armies from A series of encounter battles began between the German, French and Belgian armies on the German-French frontier and in southern Belgium on 4 August. Li√®ge was occupied by the Germans on 7 August. The first units of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) landed in France and French troops crossed the German frontier. The Battle of Mulhouse (Battle of Alsace ) was the first French offensive of World War I. The French captured Mulhouse, until forced out by a German counter-attack on 11 August, and fell back toward Belfort. On 12 August, the Battle of Haelen was fought by German and Belgian cavalry and infantry, resulting in a Belgian defensive success. The BEF completed its move of four divisions and a cavalry division to France on 16 August, as the last Belgian fort of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge () surrendered. The Belgian government withdrew from Brussels on 18 August. The main French offensive, the Battle of Lorraine , began with the Battles of Morhange and Sarrebourg () advances by the First Army on Sarrebourg and the Second Army towards Morhange. Ch√¢teau-Salins near Morhange was captured on 17 August and Sarrebourg the next day. The German 6th and 7th Armies counter-attacked on 20 August, and the Second Army was forced back from Morhange and the First Army was repulsed at Sarrebourg. The German armies crossed the border and advanced on Nancy, but were stopped to the east of the city. The Belgian 4th Division, the solitary part of the Belgian army not to retreat to the defensive lines around Antwerp, dug in to defend Namur, which was besieged on 20 August. Further west, the French Fifth Army had concentrated on the Sambre by 20 August, facing north on either side of Charleroi and east towards Namur and Dinant. Additional support was given to the Belgians at Namur by the French 45th Infantry Brigade. On the left, the Cavalry Corps of General Sordet linked up with the BEF at Mons. To the south, the French retook Mulhouse on 19 August and then withdrew. By 20 August, a German counter-offensive in Lorraine had begun and the German 4th and 5th Armies advanced through the Ardennes on 19 August towards Neufch√¢teau. An offensive by the French Third and Fourth Armies through the Ardennes began on 20 August in support of the French invasion of Lorraine. The opposing armies met in thick fog; the French mistook the German troops for screening forces. On 22 August, the Battle of the Ardennes began with French attacks, which were costly to both sides and forced the French into a disorderly retreat late on 23 August. The Third Army recoiled towards Verdun, pursued by the 5th Army, and the Fourth Army retreated to Sedan and Stenay. Mulhouse was recaptured again by German forces and the Battle of the Meuse caused a temporary halt of the German advance. =Great Retreat= The Great Retreat took place from the French Fifth Army fell back about from the Sambre during the Battle of Charleroi (22 August) and began a greater withdrawal from the area south of the Sambre on 23 August. That evening, the troops at Namur withdrew into French-held territory and at Dinant, 674 men, women and children were summarily executed by Saxon troops of the German 3rd Army; the first of several civilian massacres committed by the Germans in 1914. German and Allied positions, 23 August ‚Äì 5 September 1914 At the Battle of Mons (23 August), the BEF attempted to hold the line of the Mons‚ÄìCond√© Canal against the advancing German 1st Army. The British were eventually forced to withdraw due to being outnumbered by the Germans and the sudden retreat of the French Fifth Army, which exposed the British right flank. Though planned as a simple tactical withdrawal and executed in good order, the British retreat from Mons lasted for two weeks, and covered . During the retreat, BEF commander Sir John French began to make contingency plans for a full retreat to the ports on the English Channel followed by an immediate British evacuation. On 1 September Lord Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War, met with French (and French Prime Minister Viviani and War Minister Millerand), and ordered him not to withdraw to the Channel. The BEF retreated to the outskirts of Paris, before it counter-attacked in concert with the French, in the Battle of the Marne. The French First and Second Armies had been pushed back, by attacks of the German 7th and 6th Armies between St. Di√© and Nancy. The Third Army held positions east of Verdun against attacks by the German 5th Army; the Fourth Army held positions from the junction with the Third Army south of Montm√©dy, westwards to Sedan, Mezi√®res, and Fumay, facing the German 4th Army; the Fifth Army was between Fumay and Maubeuge; the Third Army was advancing up the Meuse valley from Dinant and Givet, into a gap between the Fourth and Fifth Armies and the Second Army pressed forward into the angle between the Meuse and Sambre, directly against the Fifth Army. On the far west flank of the French, the BEF prolonged the line from Maubeuge to Valenciennes against the German 1st Army and Army Detachment von Beseler masked the Belgian army at Antwerp. On 26 August, German forces captured Valenciennes and began the Siege of Maubeuge Leuven, (Louvain) was sacked by German troops and the Battle of Le Cateau was fought by the BEF and the First Army. Longwy was surrendered by its garrison and next day, British marines and a party of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) landed at Ostend; German troops occupied Lille and Mezi√®res. Arras was occupied on 27 August and a French counter-offensive began at the Battle of St. Quentin (Battle of Guise On 29 August, the Fifth Army counter- attacked the German 2nd Army south of the Oise, from Vervins to Mont-d'Origny and west of the river from Mont-d'Origny to Moy towards St. Quentin on the Somme, while the British held the line of the Oise west of La F√®re. German troops captured Laon, La F√®re, and Roye on 30 August and Amiens the next day. On 1 September, the Germans entered Craonne and Soissons. On 5 September German troops reached Claye-Souilly, from Paris, captured Reims, and withdrew from Lille, and the BEF ended its retreat from Mons. Also on that day French troops counterattacked in the Battle of the Ourcq , marking the end of the Great Retreat of the western flank of the Franco-British armies. In the east, the Second Army had withdrawn its left flank, to face north between Nancy and Toul; the First and Second Armies had slowed the advance of the German 7th and 6th Armies west of St. Di√© and east of Nancy by 4 September. There was a gap between the left of the Second Army and the right of the Third Army at Verdun, which faced north-west, on a line towards Revigny, against the Fifth Army advance west of the Meuse between Varennes and Sainte-Menehould. The Fourth Army had withdrawn to Sermaize, westwards to the Marne at Vitry-le-Fran√ßois and crossed the river to Sompons, against the German 4th Army, which had advanced from Rethel to Suippes and the west of Ch√¢lons. The new French Ninth Army held a line from Mailly against the German 3rd Army, which had advanced from M√©zi√®res, over the Vesle and the Marne west of Chalons. The Second Army had advanced from Marle on the Serre, across the Aisne and the Vesle, between Reims and Fismes to Montmort, north of the junction of the French 9th and 5th Armies at S√©zanne. The Fifth Army and the BEF had withdrawn south of the Oise, Serre, Aisne, and Ourq, pursued by the German 2nd Army on a line from Guise to Laon, Vailly, and Dormans and by the 1st Army from Montdidier, towards Compi√®gne and then south-east towards Montmirail. French garrisons were besieged at Metz, Thionville, Longwy, Montm√©dy, and Maubeuge. The Belgian army was invested at Antwerp in the National Redoubt and Belgian fortress troops continued the defence of the Li√®ge forts. The Military governor of Paris, General Joseph Gallieni, was tasked with the defence of the city. =Plans= In the first days of September the final decisions were made that were to directly create the circumstances for the Battle of the Marne. On 2 September Moltke issued a Grand Directive changing the order of battle for the German attack. Moltke ordered that Paris would now be bypassed and the sweep intended to encircle the city would now seek to entrap the French forces between Paris and Verdun.Herwig 220 To accomplish this, the 2nd Army would become the primary striking force with the 1st Army (Alexander von Kluck) following in echelon to protect the flank.Herwig 221 At the time of this Grand Directive, Moltke based his decision on an intercepted radio transmission from the 2nd Army to the 1st Army describing the Entente retreating across the Marne. On the eve of this most important battle, Moltke had requested situation reports from the 1st Army on 1 September but received none. Both armies on the western flank had been depleted by the March and August battles. Moltke chose to reinforce the opposite wing that was attacking fortifications in the region near Verdun and Nancy. Kluck, whose army on the western flank had formerly been the force that would deliver the decisive blow, disregarded these orders. Together with his Chief of Staff General Kuhl, Kluck ordered his armies to continue south-east rather than turning to the west to face possible reinforcements that could endanger the German flank. They would seek to remain the wing of the German attack and to find and destroy the French Fifth Army's flank.Herwig 223 After setting this order in action on 2 September, Kluck did not transmit word to Moltke and OHL until the morning of 4 September, which Moltke ignored. Though in keeping with the pre-war tradition of decentralised command (), Kluck disregarded the threat from the west. On 31 August, 1 September and 3 September, German aviators reported columns of French troops west of the 1st Army. These reports were dismissed and not passed to the IV Reserve Corps. Joffre sacked General Charles Lanrezac, the commander of the Fifth Army and replaced him with I Corps commander Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey.Tuchman, 496 D'Esperey became one of the originators of the Entente plan during the Battle of the Marne.Herwig, 229 On 4 September, while meeting with the British General Henry Wilson, d'Esperey outlined a French and British counter-attack on the German 1st Army.Tuchman, 505 The counter-attack would come from the south by d'Esperey's Fifth Army, the west from the BEF and at the Ourq River from Gallieni's new Sixth Army.Herwig 228 Gallieni had come to the same conclusion on 3 September and had started marching the Sixth Army east.Herwig, 226 Joffre spent much of this afternoon in silent contemplation under an ash tree.Tuchman, 503 At dinner that night he received word of d‚ÄôEsperey's plan for the counter-attack. That night he issued commands to halt the French retreat in his Instruction General No. 5, to start on 6 September. The BEF was under no obligation to follow orders of the French. Joffre first attempted to use diplomatic channels to convince the British government to apply pressure on French. Later in the day he arrived at the BEF HQ for discussions which ended with Joffre banging his hand dramatically on a table while shouting \\"Monsieur le Marechal, the honour of England is at stake!\\" Following this meeting French agreed to the operational plan to commence the following day.Herwig, 230 Battle=Western flank= French infantry charge, 1914 The battle of Meaux September 1914 Late on 4 September, Joffre ordered the Sixth Army to attack eastwards over the Ourcq towards Ch√¢teau Thierry as the BEF advanced towards Montmirail, and the Fifth Army attacked northwards with its right flank protected by the Ninth Army along the St. Gond marshes. On 5 September, the Battle of the Ourcq commenced when the Sixth Army advanced eastwards from Paris. That morning it came into contact with cavalry patrols of the IV Reserve Corps of General Hans von Gronau, on the right flank of the 1st Army west of the Ourcq River. Seizing the initiative in the early afternoon, the two divisions of IV Reserve Corps attacked with field artillery and infantry into the gathering Sixth Army and pushed it back. Overnight, the IV Reserve Corps withdrew to a better position east, while von Kluck, alerted to the approach of the Allied forces, began to wheel his army to face west. French soldiers rest in a forest during the battle of the Marne. Autochrome colour photograph. Gronau ordered the II Corps to move back to the north bank of the Marne, which began a redeployment of all four 1st Army corps to the north bank which continued until 8 September. The swift move to the north bank prevented the Sixth Army from crossing the Ourcq. In this move against the French threat from the west, von Kluck ignored the Franco-British forces advancing from the south against his left flank and opened a gap in the German lines between the 1st Army and the 2nd Army on its left (east). Allied air reconnaissance observed German forces moving north to face the Sixth Army and discovered the gap. The lack of the coordination between von Kluck and B√ºlow caused the gap to widen further. On the night of September 7, B√ºlow ordered two of his corps to withdraw to favorable positions just hours before von Kluck ordered these same two corps to march to reinforce 1st Army on the Ourcq River.Herwig, 248 At exactly the same time, von Kluck and his influential staff officer Hermann von Kuhl had decided to break the French Sixth Army on the 1st Army's right flank while B√ºlow shifted an attack to the 2nd Army's left wing, the opposite side from where the gap had opened.Herwig 249 The Allies were prompt in exploiting the break in the German lines, sending the BEF and the Fifth Army into the gap between the two German armies. The right wing of the Fifth Army attacked on 6 September and pinned the 2nd Army in the Battle of the Two Morins, named for the two rivers in the area, the Grand Morin and Petit Morin. The BEF advanced on , crossed the Petit Morin, captured bridges over the Marne, and established a bridgehead deep. The slow pace of the BEF's advance enraged d'Esperey and other French commanders. On 6 September Haig's forces moved so slowly they finished the day 12 km behind their objectives and lost only seven men.Herwig, 253 The BEF, though outnumbering Germans in the gap ten to one, advanced only forty kilometers in three days.Herwig, 254 The Fifth Army by 8 September crossed the Petit Morin, which forced B√ºlow to withdraw the right flank of the 2nd Army. Next day the Fifth Army recrossed the Marne, and the German 1st and 2nd Armies began to retire. The Germans had still hoped to smash the Sixth Army between 6 and 8 September, but the Sixth Army was reinforced on the night of 7/8 September by reserve infantry ferried from Paris. This included about 3,000 men from the Seventh Division who were transported in a fleet of Paris taxicabs requisitioned by General Gallieni. During the critical period of 6 to 7 September von Moltke issued no orders to either von Kluck or B√ºlow, and received no reports from them between 7 and 9 September. On 6 September, General Gallieni gathered about six hundred taxicabs at Les Invalides in central Paris to carry soldiers to the front at Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, fifty kilometres away. In the night of 6-7, two groups set off: the first, comprising 350 vehicles, departed at 10 PM, and another of 250 an hour later. Each taxi carried five soldiers, four in the back and one next to the driver. Only the back lights of the taxis were lit; the drivers were instructed to follow the lights of the taxi ahead. Most of the taxis were demobilised on 8 September but some remained longer to carry the wounded and refugees. The taxis, following city regulations, dutifully ran their meters. The French treasury reimbursed the total fare of 70,012 francs. The arrival of six thousand soldiers by taxi has traditionally been described as critical in stopping a possible German breakthrough against the 6th Army. However, in General Gallieni's memoirs, he notes how some had \\"exaggerated somewhat the importance of the taxis.\\" In 2001, Strachan described the course of the battle without mentioning taxis and in 2009, Herwig called the matter a legend: he wrote that many French soldiers travelled in lorries and all the artillery left Paris by train. The impact on morale was undeniable, the were perceived as a manifestation of the of the French civilian population and its soldiers at the front, reminiscent of the people in arms who had saved the French Republic Campaign of 1794: a symbol of unity and national solidarity beyond their strategical role in the battle. It was also the first large-scale use of motorised infantry in battle; a Marne taxicab is prominently displayed in the exhibit on the battle at the Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e at Les Invalides in Paris. The reinforced Sixth Army held its ground. The following night, on 8 September, the Fifth Army launched a surprise attack against the 2nd Army, further widening the gap between the 1st and 2nd Armies. Moltke, at OHL in Luxembourg, was effectively out of communication with the German army HQs. He sent his intelligence officer, Oberstleutnant Richard Hentsch to visit the HQs. On 8 September, Hentsch met with B√ºlow, and they agreed that the 2nd Army was in danger of encirclement and would retreat immediately. On 9 September, Hentsch reached the 1st Army's HQ, met with von Kluck's chief of staff, and issued orders for the 1st Army to retreat to the Aisne River. von Kluck and von Kuhl vigorously objected to this order as they believed their army was on the verge of breaking the Sixth Army. However, Hentsch reminded them he had the full power of the OHL behind him, and that 2nd Army was already in retreat. Von Kluck reluctantly ordered his troops to pull back.Herwig 283 Moltke suffered a nervous breakdown upon hearing of the danger. His subordinates took over and ordered a general retreat to the Aisne, to regroup for another offensive. The Germans were pursued by the French and British, although the pace of the exhausted Allied forces was slow and averaged only per day. The Germans ceased their retreat after , at a point north of the Aisne River, where they dug in, preparing trenches. By 10 September the German armies west of Verdun were retreating towards the Aisne. Joffre ordered Allied troops to pursue, leading to the First Battle of the Aisne (see below). The German retreat from 9‚Äì13 September marked the end of the Schlieffen Plan. Moltke is said to have reported to the Kaiser: \\"Your Majesty, we have lost the war.\\" (). =Eastern flank= The German 3rd, 4th and 5th Armies attacked the French Second, Third, Fourth and Ninth Armies in the vicinity of Verdun beginning 5‚Äì6 September. German attacks against the Second Army south of Verdun from 5 September almost forced the French to retreat. South-east of Verdun, the Third Army was forced back to the west of Verdun by German attacks on the Meuse Heights, but maintained contact with Verdun and the Fourth Army to the west. Other fighting included the capture of the village of Revigny in the Battle of Revigny (), the Battle of Vitry () around Vitry-le-Fran√ßois, and the Battle of the Marshes of Saint-Gond around S√©zanne. On 7 September German advances created a salient south of Verdun at St. Mihiel, which threatened to separate the Second and Third Armies. General Castelnau prepared to abandon the French position around Nancy, but his staff contacted Joffre, who ordered Castelnau to hold for another German attacks continued through 8 September but soon began to taper off as Moltke began shifting troops to the west. By 10 September the Germans had received orders to stop attacking and withdrawal towards the frontier became general. Aftermath=Analysis= At the start of the war both sides had plans that they counted on to deliver a short war. The Battle of the Marne was the second great battle on the Western Front, after the Battle of the Frontiers, and one of the most important events of the war. While the German invasion failed decisively to defeat the Entente in France, the German army occupied a good portion of northern France as well as most of Belgium and it was the failure of the French Plan 17 that caused that situation. It is generally agreed among historians that the battle was an Allied victory that saved Paris and kept France in the war but there is considerable disagreement as to the extent of the victory. Joffre, whose planning had led to the disastrous Battle of the Frontiers, was able to bring the Entente to a tactical victory. He used interior lines to move troops from his right wing to the critical left wing and sacked generals. Due to the redistribution of French troops, the German 1st Army had 128 battalions facing 191 battalions of the French and BEF. The 2nd and 3rd German armies had 134 battalions facing 268 battalions of the French Fifth and new Ninth Army.Herwig 231. It was his orders that prevented Castelnau from abandoning Nancy on 6 September or reinforcing that army when the pivotal battle was unfolding on the other side of the battlefield.Herwig 211 He resisted counter-attacking until the time was right then put his full force behind it. D'Esperey should also receive credit as the author of the main stroke. As Joffre says in his memoirs: \\"it was he who made the Battle of the Marne possible\\".Joffre, 381 After the Battle of the Marne the Germans retreated for up to and lost 11,717 prisoners, 30 field guns and 100 machine-guns to the French and 3,500 prisoners to the British before reaching the Aisne. The German retreat ended their hope of pushing the French beyond the Verdun‚ÄìMarne‚ÄìParis line and winning a quick victory. Following the battle and the failures by both sides to turn the opponent's northern flank during the Race to the Sea, the war of movement ended with the Germans and the Allied Powers facing each other across a stationary front line. Both sides were faced with the prospect of costly siege warfare operations, if they chose to continue an offensive strategy in France. Historians' interpretations characterise the Allied advance as a success. John Terraine wrote that \\"nowhere, and at no time, did it present the traditional aspect of victory\\", he stated that the French and British stroke into the breach between the 1st and 2nd German Armies \\"made the battle of the Marne the decisive battle of the war\\".John Terraine 1991, Mons: The Retreat to Victory, 2d ed. London: Leo Cooper, 215. Barbara W. Tuchman and Robert Doughty wrote that Joffre's victory at the Marne was far from decisive, Tuchman calling it an \\"‚Ä¶incomplete victory of the Marne‚Ä¶\\" and Doughty [the] \\"‚Ä¶opportunity for a decisive victory had slipped from his hands\\". Ian Sumner called it a flawed victory and that it proved impossible to deal the German armies \\"a decisive blow\\". Tuchman wrote that Kluck explained the German failure at the Marne as Richard Brooks in 2000, wrote that the significance of the battle centres on its undermining of the Schlieffen Plan, which forced Germany to fight a two-front war against France and Russia‚Äîthe scenario that its strategists had long feared. Brooks claimed that, \\"By frustrating the Schlieffen Plan, Joffre had won the decisive battle of the war, and perhaps of the century\\". The Battle of the Marne was also one of the first battles in which reconnaissance aircraft played a decisive role, by discovering weak points in the German lines, which the Entente armies were able to exploit. =Casualties= Over two million men fought in the First Battle of the Marne and although there are no exact official casualty counts for the battle, estimates for the actions of September along the Marne front for all armies are often given as or wounded. French casualties totalled of whom 80 000 were killed. Some notable people died in the battle, such as Charles P√©guy, who was killed while leading his platoon during an attack at the beginning of the battle. Tuchman gave French casualties for August as 206 515 from and Herwig gave French casualties for September as 213 445, also from for a total of just under 420 000 in the first two months of the war. According to Roger Chickering, German casualties for the 1914 campaigns on the Western Front were 500 000. British casualties were with The Germans suffered No future battle on the Western Front would average so many casualties per day.The First World War: Part 2: Under the Eagle (1914) TV mini-series 2003. In 2009, Herwig re-estimated the casualties for the battle. He wrote that the French official history, , gave casualties in September and assumed that during the Battle of the Marne. Using the German , Herwig recorded that from the 1st Army had the 2nd Army had the 3rd Army had the 4th Army had the 5th Army had the 6th Army had and the 7th Army had Herwig estimated that the five German Armies from Verdun to Paris had during the battle and assumed for the French. Herwig wrote that there were casualties (the British Official History noted that these losses were incurred from . Herwig estimated for all sides at the Marne but questioned whether isolating the battle was justified. In 2010, Ian Sumner wrote that there were casualties, including Sumner cites the same overall casualty figure for the French for September as Herwig from , which includes the losses at the battle of the Aisne, as 213 445 but provides a further breakdown: 18 073 killed, 111 963 wounded and 83 409 missing. =Subsequent operations=First Battle of the Aisne, 13‚Äì28 September Opposing positions: 5 September (dashed line) 13 September (black line) On 10 September, Joffre ordered the French armies and the BEF to advance and for four days, the Armies on the left flank moved forward and gathered up German stragglers, wounded and equipment, opposed only by rearguards. On Joffre ordered outflanking manoeuvres by the armies on the left flank but the advance was too slow to catch the Germans, who ended their withdrawal on 14 September, on high ground on the north bank of the Aisne and began to dig in. Frontal attacks by the Ninth, Fifth, and Sixth Armies were repulsed from This led Joffre to transfer the Second Army west to the left flank of the Sixth Army, the first phase of Allied attempts to outflank the German armies in \\"The Race to the Sea\\". French troops had begun to move westwards on 2 September, using the undamaged railways behind the French front, which were able to move a corps to the left flank in On 17 September, the French Sixth Army attacked from Soissons to Noyon, at the westernmost point of the French flank, with the XIII and IV corps, which were supported by the 61st and 62nd divisions of the 6th Group of Reserve Divisions. After this the fighting moved north to Lassigny and the French dug in around Nampcel. The French Second Army completed a move from Lorraine and took over command of the left-hand corps of the Sixth Army, as indications appeared that German troops were also being moved from the eastern flank. The German IX Reserve Corps arrived from Belgium by 15 September and next day joined the 1st Army for an attack to the south-west, with the IV Corps and the 4th and 7th cavalry divisions, against the attempted French envelopment. The attack was cancelled and the IX Reserve Corps was ordered to withdraw behind the right flank of the 1st Army. The 2nd and 9th Cavalry divisions were dispatched as reinforcements next day but before the retirement began, the French attack reached Carlepont and Noyon, before being contained on 18 September. The German armies attacked from Verdun westwards to Reims and the Aisne at the Battle of Flirey ‚Äì cut the main railway from Verdun to Paris and created the St. Mihiel salient, south of the Verdun fortress zone. The main German effort remained on the western flank, which was revealed to the French by intercepted wireless messages. By 28 September, the Aisne front had stabilised and the BEF began to withdraw on the night of with the first troops arriving in the Abbeville on the Somme on the night of The BEF prepared to commence operations in French Flanders and Flanders in Belgium, joining with the British forces that had been in Belgium since August. Race to the Sea German and Allied operations, Artois and Flanders, September‚ÄìNovember 1914 From ‚Äì the belligerents made reciprocal attempts to turn the northern flank of their opponent. Joffre ordered the French Second Army to move to the north of the French Sixth Army, by moving from eastern France from and Falkenhayn who had replaced Moltke on 14 September, ordered the German 6th Army to move from the German-French border to the northern flank on 17 September. By the next day, French attacks north of the Aisne led Falkenhayn to order the 6th Army to repulse the French and secure the flank. The French advance at the First Battle of Picardy met a German attack rather than an open flank and by the end of the Battle of Albert the Second Army had been reinforced to eight Corps but was still opposed by German forces at the Battle of Arras rather than advancing around the German northern flank. The German 6th Army had also found that on arrival in the north, it was forced to oppose the French attack rather than advance around the flank and that the secondary objective, to protect the northern flank of the German Armies in France, had become the main task. By 6 October, the French needed British reinforcements to withstand German attacks around Lille. The BEF had begun to move from the Aisne to Flanders on 5 October and reinforcements from England assembled on the left flank of the Tenth Army, which had been formed from the left flank units of the 2nd Army on 4 October. The Allied Powers and the Germans attempted to take more ground after the \\"open\\" northern flank had disappeared. The Franco-British attacks towards Lille in October at the battles of La Bass√©e, Messines and Armenti√®res (October‚ÄìNovember) were followed up by attempts to advance between the BEF and the Belgian army by a new French Eighth Army. The moves of the 7th and then the 6th Army from Alsace and Lorraine had been intended to secure German lines of communication through Belgium, where the Belgian army had sortied several times, during the period between the Great Retreat and the Battle of the Marne; in August, British marines had landed at Dunkirk. In October, a new 4th Army was assembled from the III Reserve Corps, the siege artillery used against Antwerp, and four of the new reserve corps training in Germany. A German offensive began by 21 October but the 4th and 6th Armies were only able to take small amounts of ground, at great cost to both sides at the Battle of the Yser and further south in the First Battle of Ypres ( ‚Äì ). Falkenhayn then attempted to achieve a limited goal of capturing Ypres and Mont Kemmel.

Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.Mendoza, C., Granados-Aguilar, X., Donad√≠o, S., Salazar, G., Flores-Cruz, M., H√°gsater, E., Starr, J., Ibarra-Manr√≠quez, G., Fragoso-Mart√≠nez, I., Magall√≥n, S. March 2017. Geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of Tillandsia (Bromeliaceae). They are also commonly known as airplants because of their natural propensity to cling wherever conditions permit: telephone wires, tree branches, barks, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate this spread. Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes ‚Äì which translates to 'upon a plant'.Benzing, D. 2012. Air Plants: Epiphytes and Aerial Gardens. Ithaca: Comstock Publishing Associates. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life these plants will not grow in soil, but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long.Gal√°n de Mera, A., M. A. Hagen & J. A. Vicente Orellana (1999) Aerophyte, a New Life Form in Raunkiaer's Classification? Journal of Vegetation Science 10 (1): 65‚Äì68 Description Tillandsia stricta They are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus. Having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous, species have certain adaptations, such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates, and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake. Some of the species, like the majority of bromeliaceae, grow as funnel bromeliads, with a compressed stem axis. The leaves are then close together in rosettes, and cover the lower areas of the leaves, forming a funnel for collecting water.Mendoza, C., Granados-Aguilar, X., Donad√≠o, S., Salazar, G., Flores-Cruz, M., H√°gsater, E., Starr, J., Ibarra-Manr√≠quez, G., Fragoso-Mart√≠nez, I., Magall√≥n, S. March 2017. Geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of Tillandsia (Bromeliaceae). These leaf rosettes, a common physical characteristic in Tillandsia species, collect nutrients and water. The flowers typically involve bright, vibrant colors, with blooms or inflorescences produced on a stalk or several stalks.Steens Andrew (2003); Bromeliads for the contemporary garden , Timber Press, Portland, USA. () The flower's color varies greatly; red, yellow, purple and pink flowers exist in this genus, and multicolored flowers are known. The bright colors attract pollinators. An air plant's foliage may also change color when it blooms, also attracting pollinators. The hermaphrodite flowers are threefold with double perianth. The three free sepals are symmetrical and pointed. The seeds have a \\"parachute\\" similar to the dandelion.Lyman B. Smith , RJ Downs: Tillandsioideae (Bromeliaceae). In: Flora Neotropica , vol. 14, 2, 1979, p. 665. Common pollinators of this genera include moths, hummingbirds and, more recently recognized, bats.Aguilar-Rodr√≠guez, P., Macswiney, C., Kr√∂mer, T., Garc√≠a-Franco, J., Knauer, A., Kessler, M.

Range They have naturally been established in diverse environments such as equatorial tropical rain forests, high elevation Andes mountains, rock dwelling (saxicolous) regions, and Louisiana swamps, such as Spanish moss (T. usneoides), a species that grows atop tree limbs. But there are also species that live lithophytic, so on rocks (but also roofs and even telephone wires). The green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests.Rauh Werner (1970 vol.1, 1973, vol.2); Bromelien , Verlag Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart. / Bromeliads (English translation, 1979), Blandford Press. ( ) In contrast, almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity. They prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods, on rocks or (rarely) on the ground. Many of the gray species are epiphytes. Some species are more or less xeromorphic.Elvira Gro√ü : Beautiful Tillandsien. Ulmer, Stuttgart 1992, Cultivation Tillandsia argentea Tillandsias, like other bromeliads, can multiply through pollination and seed formation. Since Tillandsia are not self-fertile, the pollen must come from another plant of the same species. Tillandsia, depending on the species, may take months or years to flower. After flowering, the plant forms offsets and dies. Elvira Gro√ü : Tillandsia for room and conservatory. Ulmer, Stuttgart 2001, Generally, the thinner- leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes.Steens Andrew (2007); Bromeliads connoisseur's guide , Random House, London. ( ) Air plants are growing rapidly in popularity as a low maintenance household plant. Due to their minimal root system and other adaptations, they generally do not require frequent watering, no more than four times a week, allowing the plant to completely dry before watering again.Wolfgang Kawollek: Tillandsien ‚Äì species and culture. Publisher Naturbuch Verlag ¬© 1992 Weltbildverlag GmbH Augsburg The amount of light required depends on the species; overall, air plants with silver dusting and stiff foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage. They generally need a strong light. In summer outside, however, they prefer the light shade of a tree at the hottest hours. Plants are commonly seen mounted, placed in a terrarium, or simply placed in seashells as decorative pieces.Cuzenic Stephan & L√©v√™que Daniel (2005); Tillandsias and other Bromeliads , Eugen Ulmer, Paris. () For so-called \\"aerial\\" species (the majority of the common species in culture except Tillandsia cyanea), that is to say those whose roots are transformed into crampons without any power of absorption, watering is done by the leaves in the form of frequent sprays, or brief soaking of the plant in a container full of water. It is imperative to use non-calcareous water. Rainwater recovered from the flow of a mossy or green roof is best for this purpose, if available.Instructions: Care for Air Plants (Tillandsia). Wedgewood Gardens. Available from: http://www.wedgewoodgardens.com/Care_Sheet_-_Air_Plants.pdf Ecology Species of Tillandsia photosynthesize through a process called CAM cycle, where they close their stomata during the day to prevent water loss and open them at night to fix carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This allows them to preserve water, necessary because they are epiphytes. They do not have a functional root system and instead absorb water in small amounts through their leaves via small structures called trichomes. Species of Tillandsia also absorb their nutrients from debris and dust in the air. Any root system found on Tillandsia has grown to act as a fragile stabilizing scaffold to grip the surface they grow on. As soon as they have been soaked with water, the green assimilation tissue below the suction scales becomes visible again, the plant is therefore \\"greened\\". Now the plant can absorb more light. When the sun dries the plants, they turn white. Thanks to this special survival trick, plants without roots can absorb fog droplets as well as rainwater and thus cover their water needs.Klaus Labude: Tillandsien. Tetra publishing house, Bissendorf Wulften, 2002, Temperature is not critical, the range being from to . Frost hardiness depends on the species. T. usneoides, for example, can tolerate night-time frosts down to about . For most species, the ideal growth temperature is between 20 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C, with a minimum of 10 ¬∞C and a maximum of 30 ¬∞C. Few are resistant to ‚àí10 ¬∞C, but some, usually from higher elevation areas, are hardy enough to withstand light and brief freezes and live outdoors year round in areas with mild winters. Taxonomy The genus Tillandsia was named by Carl Linnaeus after the Swedish physician and botanist Dr. Elias Tillandz (originally Tillander) (1640‚Äì1693). Some common types of Tillandsia include ball moss (T. recurvata) and Spanish moss (T. usneoides). The genus contains around 650 species, where 635 are considered epiphyticMendoza, C., Granados-Aguilar, X., Donad√≠o, S., Salazar, G., Flores-Cruz, M., H√°gsater, E., Starr, J., Ibarra-Manr√≠quez, G., Fragoso-Mart√≠nez, I., Magall√≥n, S.

Variations of the optical mouse have largely replaced the older mechanical mouse design, which uses moving parts to sense motion. The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces. Modern optical mice work on most opaque diffusely reflective surfaces like paper, but most of them do not work properly on specularly reflective surfaces like polished stone or transparent surfaces like glass. Optical mice that use dark field illumination can function reliably even on such surfaces.  Mechanical mice  Though not commonly referred to as optical mice, nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using LEDs and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and didn't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels (one for left/right, another for forward/back), driven by a rubberized ball. Thus, the primary distinction of ‚Äúoptical mice‚Äù is not their use of optics, but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement, instead employing an entirely solid-state system.  Early optical mice  An early Xerox optical mouse chip, before the development of the inverted packaging design of Williams and Cherry The first two optical mice, first demonstrated by two independent inventors in December 1980, had different basic designs: One of these, invented by Steve Kirsch of MIT and Mouse Systems Corporation, used an infrared LED and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface. Predictive algorithms in the CPU of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid. The other type, invented by Richard F. Lyon of Xerox, used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype (5¬µm) MOS integrated circuit chip, and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad. The Kirsch and Lyon mouse types had very different behaviors, as the Kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad, and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated, while the Lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body, as mechanical mice do. The optical sensor from a Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer (v. 1.0A) The optical mouse ultimately sold with the Xerox STAR office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by Lisa M. Williams and Robert S. Cherry of the Xerox Microelectronics Center.Lisa M. Williams (aka L&LL;) and Robert (Bob) S. Cherry, U.S. Patent 4,751,505 Optical Mouse.  Modern optical mice  Microscope photograph of the IntelliMouse Explorer sensor silicon die Modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor (essentially, a tiny low-resolution video camera) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates. As computing power grew cheaper, it became possible to embed more powerful special-purpose image-processing chips in the mouse itself. This advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces, translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad. A surface-independent coherent light optical mouse design was patented by Stephen B. Jackson at Xerox in 1988.Stephen B. Jackson, U.S. Patent 4,794,384 Optical Translator Device. The first commercially available, modern optical computer mice were the Microsoft IntelliMouse with IntelliEye and IntelliMouse Explorer, introduced in 1999 using technology developed by Hewlett-Packard. It worked on almost any surface, and represented a welcome improvement over mechanical mice, which would pick up dirt, track capriciously, invite rough handling, and need to be taken apart and cleaned frequently. Other manufacturers soon followed Microsoft's lead using components manufactured by the HP spin-off Agilent Technologies, and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete. S5085 optical sensor IC die (CMOS sensor + driver) The technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation, a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets. A simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 Lyon optical mouse. Optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood, cloth, mouse pads and Formica. These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved. To understand how optical flow is used in optical mice, imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other. Place both photographs on a light table to make them transparent, and slide one across the other until their images line up. The amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images, and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved. Optical mice capture one thousand successive images or more per second. Depending on how fast the mouse is moving, each image will be offset from the previous one by a fraction of a pixel or as many as several pixels. Optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one. An optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 √ó 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels. Its sensor would normally share the same ASIC as that used for storing and processing the images. One refinement would be accelerating the correlation process by using information from previous motions, and another refinement would be preventing deadbands when moving slowly by adding interpolation or frame-skipping. The development of the modern optical mouse at Hewlett-Packard Co. was supported by a succession of related projects during the 1990s at HP Laboratories. In 1992 William Holland was awarded US Patent 5,089,712 and John Ertel, William Holland, Kent Vincent, Rueiming Jamp, and Richard Baldwin were awarded US Patent 5,149,980 for measuring linear paper advance in a printer by correlating images of paper fibers. Ross R. Allen, David Beard, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis were awarded US Patents 5,578,813 (1996) and 5,644,139 (1997) for 2-dimensional optical navigational (i.e., position measurement) principles based on detecting and correlating microscopic, inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled, and using position measurements of each end of a linear (document) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document. This is the freehand scanning concept used in the HP CapShare 920 handheld scanner. By describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels, balls, and rollers used in contemporary computer mice, the optical mouse was anticipated. These patents formed the basis for US Patent 5,729,008 (1998) awarded to Travis N. Blalock, Richard A. Baumgartner, Thomas Hornak, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis, where surface feature image sensing, image processing, and image correlation was realized by an integrated circuit to produce a position measurement. Improved precision of 2D optical navigation, needed for application of optical navigation to precise 2D measurement of media (paper) advance in HP DesignJet large format printers, was further refined in US Patent 6,195,475 awarded in 2001 to Raymond G. Beausoleil, Jr., and Ross R. Allen. While the reconstruction of the image in the document scanning application (Allen et al.) required resolution by the optical navigators on the order of 1/600th of an inch, implementation of optical position measurement in computer mice not only benefit from the cost reductions inherent in navigating at lower resolution, but also enjoy the advantage of visual feedback to the user of the cursor position on the computer display. In 2002, Gary Gordon, Derek Knee, Rajeev Badyal and Jason Hartlove were awarded US Patent 6,433,780 for an optical computer mouse that measured position using image correlation. Some small trackpads work like an optical mouse.  Light source = LED mice = The blue-LED-based V-Mouse VM-101 Optical mice often used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination when first popularized. The color of the optical mouse's LEDs can vary, but red is most common, as red diodes are inexpensive and silicon photodetectors are very sensitive to red light. IR LEDs are also widely used. Other colors are sometimes used, such as the blue LED of the V-Mouse VM-101 illustrated at right. = Laser mice = Although invisible to the naked eye, the light produced by this laser mouse is captured as the color purple because CCDs are sensitive to a broader light wavelength range than the human eye. The laser mouse uses an infrared laser diode instead of an LED to illuminate the surface beneath their sensor. As early as 1998, Sun Microsystems provided a laser mouse with their Sun SPARCstation servers and workstations.Computer Engineering Tips ‚Äì Mouse . Retrieved 31 December 2006. However, laser mice did not enter the mainstream consumer market until 2004, following the development by a team at Agilent Laboratories, Palo Alto, led by Doug Baney of a laser-based mouse based on a 850 nm VCSEL (laser) that offered 20X improvement in tracking performance. Tong Xie, Marshall T. Depue, and Douglas M. Baney were awarded US patents 7,116,427 and 7,321,359 for their work on low power consumption broad navigability VCSEL-based consumer mice. Paul Machin at Logitech, in partnership with Agilent Technologies introduced the new technology as the MX 1000 laser mouse. This mouse uses a small infrared laser (VCSEL) instead of an LED and has significantly increased the resolution of the image taken by the mouse. The laser illumination enables superior surface tracking compared to LED-illuminated optical mice. Glass laser (or glaser) mice have the same capability of a laser mouse but work far better on mirror or transparent glass surfaces than other optical mice on those surfaces.Comparison of optical, laser, and glass laser mouse. Glass laser mouse by A4Tech. In 2008, Avago Technologies introduced laser navigation sensors whose emitter was integrated into the IC using VCSEL technology. In August 2009, Logitech introduced mice with two lasers, to track on glass and glossy surfaces better; they dubbed them a \\"Darkfield\\" laser sensor.  Power  Manufacturers often engineer their optical mice‚Äîespecially battery-powered wireless models‚Äîto save power when possible. To do this, the mouse dims or blinks the laser or LED when in standby mode (each mouse has a different standby time). A typical implementation (by Logitech) has four power states, where the sensor is pulsed at different rates per second: * 11500: full on, for accurate response while moving, illumination appears bright. * 1100: fallback active condition while not moving, illumination appears dull. * 110: standby * 12: sleep state Movement can be detected in any of these states; some mice turn the sensor fully off in the sleep state, requiring a button click to wake.Certain models of Targus mice work this way. Optical mice utilizing infrared elements (LEDs or lasers) offer substantial increases in battery life over visible spectrum illumination. Some mice, such as the Logitech V450 848 nm laser mouse, are capable of functioning on two AA batteries for a full year, due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser. Mice designed for use where low latency and high responsiveness are important, such as in playing video games, may omit power-saving features and require a wired connection to improve performance. Examples of mice which sacrifice power-saving in favor of performance are the Logitech G5 and the Razer Copperhead.  Optical versus mechanical mice  The Logitech iFeel optical mouse uses a red LED to project light onto the tracking surface. Unlike mechanical mice, whose tracking mechanisms can become clogged with lint, optical mice have no moving parts (besides buttons and scroll wheels); therefore, they do not require maintenance other than removing debris that might collect under the light emitter. However, they generally cannot track on glossy and transparent surfaces, including some mouse-pads, causing the cursor to drift unpredictably during operation. Mice with less image-processing power also have problems tracking fast movement, whereas some high-quality mice can track faster than 2 m/s. Some models of laser mouse can track on glossy and transparent surfaces, and have a much higher sensitivity. mechanical mice had lower average power requirements than their optical counterparts; the power used by mice is relatively small, and only an important consideration when the power is derived from batteries, with their limited capacity. Optical models outperform mechanical mice on uneven, slick, soft, sticky, or loose surfaces, and generally in mobile situations lacking mouse pads. Because optical mice render movement based on an image which the LED (or infrared diode) illuminates, use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance; however, laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces.

He also played tenor saxophone. Biography Bigard was born in New Orleans to a family of Creoles. The son of Alexander and Emanuella Bigard, he had two brothers, Alexander Jr. and Sidney. His uncle, Emile Bigard, was a jazz violinist. He attended local schools and studied music and clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. In the early 1920s he moved to Chicago, where he worked with King Oliver and others. During this period, much of his recording, including with clarinetist Johnny Dodds, was on tenor saxophone, which he played often with great lyricism, as on Oliver's \\"Someday Sweetheart\\". In 1927 Bigard joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in New York, where he was part of the Harlem Renaissance. He played with Ellington until 1942. They played primarily at the Cotton Club until 1931, then toured almost nonstop for over a decade. With Ellington, he was the featured clarinet soloist, while also doing section work on tenor saxophone. After leaving Ellington's orchestra, Bigard moved to Los Angeles, California. He did soundtrack work for Hollywood film studios and had an onscreen featured role with an all-star band led by Louis Armstrong in the film New Orleans (1947). He began working with trombonist Kid Ory's group during the late 1940s. He later worked with Armstrong's touring band, the All Stars, and others. Bigard appeared and played in the movie St. Louis Blues (1958), with Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Eartha Kitt. Bigard wrote an autobiography entitled With Louis and The Duke. He is credited as composer or co-composer on several numbers, notably the Ellington standard \\"Mood Indigo\\". Barney Bigard and His Jazzopaters From left: Jack Teagarden, Sandy DeSantis, Velma Middleton, Fraser MacPherson, Cozy Cole, Arvell Shaw, Earl Hines, and Barney Bigard at the Palomar Supper Club, Vancouver, March 17, 1951 The first version of the song \\"Caravan\\" (composed by Juan Tizol and later rearranged by Duke Ellington) was recorded in Hollywood, 18 December 1936, and performed as an instrumental by Barney Bigard and His Jazzopaters. Two takes were recorded and were issued, although L-0373-2 is by far the more commonly found take. The band members were Cootie Williams (trumpet), Juan Tizol (trombone), Barney Bigard (clarinet), Harry Carney (baritone sax), Duke Ellington (piano), Billy Taylor (bass), and Sonny Greer (drums). All of the players were members of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, which was often drawn upon to record small-group sides. Even though Ellington was present at the recording date, the session leader was Bigard. \\"Caravan\\" on Variety In keeping with Ellington's formation of small groups featuring his primary soloists, Bigard continued to be featured under his own name on Variety and subsequently Vocalion Records and OKeh through 1940. When Ellington signed with Victor in 1940, Bigard (and other Ellingtonians) recorded for Bluebird under his own name. He sat in with the Glenn Miller Orchestra for some of their biggest hits, such as \\"Moonlight Serenade\\", \\"Little Brown Jug\\", and \\"Tuxedo Junction\\". Bigard was also a member of Louis Armstrong's All Stars before and after Edmond Hall joined. Bigard can be seen with the All Stars in the movie The Glenn Miller Story. Bigard performed with Louis Armstrong and his All Stars with Velma Middleton singing vocals for the famed ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The concert was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 7, 1953. Also featured that day were Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Earl Bostic, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, and Shorty Rogers and his Orchestra.‚ÄúMore Big Names in Cavalcade‚Äù Article Los Angeles Sentinel May 21, 1953. ‚ÄúSatchmo Band Spice To Open Air Show‚Äù Article Los Angeles Sentinel May 28, 1953.

He was captured at Lough Swilly, near Buncrana, County Donegal on 3 November 1798, and was sentenced to death on 12 November by hanging. He died seven days later in unclear circumstances. It has since been theorised and agreed upon by most Irish scholars that he committed suicide while in prison. Early life Wolfe Tone was born on 20 June 1763. His family were descended from a French Protestant family who fled to England from Gascony in the 16th century to escape religious persecution. A branch of the family settled in Dublin in the 17th century. Theobald's father, Peter Tone, was a coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins, County Kildare and belonged to the Church of Ireland. His mother came from a Catholic merchant family who converted to Protestantism after Theobald was born.McGarry,S.,Irish Brigades Abroad (Dublin 2013) p.175 His maternal grandfather was captain of a vessel in the West India trade.Tone, Theobald Wolfe.

However, it was widely believed that Tone was the son of Theobald Wolfe, which, if true, made him a half-brother of the poet Charles Wolfe. After his death, he was widely referred to as Wolfe Tone. In 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of Richard Martin MP of Galway, a prominent supporter of Catholic emancipation, at Dangan, the Martin family home. Tone fell in love with Martin's wife, but later wrote that it came to nothing. During this period he briefly considered a career in the theatre as an actor.Herr p.26 He studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where he became an active member in the College Historical Society debating club and was elected its auditor in 1785. He graduated BA in February 1786. He qualified as a barrister in King's Inns at the age of 26 after keeping the requisite terms as a student member of the Middle Temple in London. As a student, he eloped with Martha Witherington, daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (n√©e Fanning) of Dublin.Webb, Alfred. \\"Tone, Theobald Wolfe\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, MH Gill & Sons, Dublin, 1878 She would go on to change her name to Matilda, at Tone's request. When they married, Tone was 22, and Matilda was about 16. In 1796, while he was in France and she in Hamburg he wrote in his journal: \\"She is the delight of my eyes, the joy of my heart, the only object for which I wish to live. I doat upon her to distraction.\\" Disappointed at finding no support for a plan that he had submitted to William Pitt the Younger, to found a military colony in Hawaii, Tone initially planned to enlist as a soldier in the East India Company, but applied too late in the year, when no more ships would be sent out until the following spring. Politician One of the inscribed flagstones on the steps leading to the grave of Theobald Wolfe Tone In September 1791, Tone published An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland, signed \\"A Northern Whig\\".Milligan, Alice L, Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone, JW Boyd, Belfast, 1898 It displayed the growing breach between Whig patriots like Henry Flood and Henry Grattan, who sought Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform without severing the tie to England. Tone expressed contempt for the constitution Grattan obtained from the British government in 1782. Himself an Anglican, Tone urged co-operation between the religions in Ireland as the only means of obtaining redress of Irish grievances. The British government had just passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, but the Dublin parliament was in no hurry to do so. In October 1791 Tone converted these ideas into practical policy by founding, in conjunction with Thomas Russell (1767‚Äì1803), Napper Tandy and others, the Society of the United Irishmen. Until 1794, this society aimed at no more than the formation of a political union between Catholics and Protestants, with a view to obtaining a liberal measure of parliamentary reform.zHull, Eleanor. A History of Ireland and Her People, Vol.2, 1931 In 1792 he was appointed an assistant secretary of the Catholic Committee. The Catholics involved were not united regarding the steps they were to take, and in December 1791, sixty- eight members withdrew, led by Lord Kenmare, with the support of the higher clergy. When the British government questioned the legality of the Catholic Convention called in December 1792, Tone drew up for the committee a statement of the case on which a favourable opinion of counsel was obtained. A petition was made to King George III early in 1793, and that year the re- enfranchisement of Catholics was enacted ‚Äì if they owned property as \\"forty- shilling freeholders\\". They could again be called as barristers and serve as army officers. They could not, however, enter parliament or be made state officials above grand jurors. The Convention voted to Tone a sum of ¬£1,500 with a gold medal and voted to dissolve. In this new climate of goodwill the Maynooth College Act 1795 was passed. Sectarian animosity threatened to undermine the United Irishmen movement: two secret societies in Ulster fought against each other: the agrarian Protestant Peep o' Day Boys and their Catholic opponents the Defenders. Tone's aim was to unite both into a revolutionary army of Irish \\"men of no property\\". Tone himself admitted that with him hatred of England had always been \\"rather an instinct than a principle,\\" though until his views should become more generally accepted in Ireland he was prepared to work for reform as distinguished from revolution. But he desired to root out the popular respect for the names of Charlemont and Grattan, and to transfer to more violent leaders the conduct of the national movement. Wolfe Tone's principles were drawn from the French Convention, and he was a disciple of Georges Danton and Thomas Paine. Revolutionary in exile Statue of Tone, Bantry, County Cork In 1794 the Society of United Irishmen became a sworn association, using oaths that aimed at the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ireland. Given that France and Britain had been at war since early 1793, administering or making such oaths turned a reformist republican society that had wanted to extend the franchise within the existing system into a republican revolutionary one. Affiliating more closely with the new French Republic also associated Tone with its evolving policy of \\"Dechristianization\\", which was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church in Ireland. Although he was seen as a Catholic champion in the early 1790s, most of his wealthier Catholic supporters fell away in 1794. Also in 1794, the United Irishmen, persuaded that no party in the Dublin parliament (where being an MP was limited to Anglicans) seemed likely to accept their scheme of universal manhood suffrage and equal electoral districts, began to recast their hopes on a French invasion. An Irish clergyman living in England, the Reverend William Jackson, who had taken in revolutionary opinions during his long stay in France, came to Ireland to ascertain to what extent the Irish people were ready to support a French invasion. Tone drew up a memorandum for Jackson on the state of Ireland, which he described as ripe for revolution. An attorney named Cockayne, to whom Jackson had imprudently disclosed his mission, betrayed the memorandum to the government. In April 1794 Jackson was arrested on a charge of treason and dramatically committed suicide during his trial. Several of the leading United Irishmen, including Archibald Hamilton Rowan, fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized by the Dublin administration, and for a time the organisation was broken up. Tone, who had not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson and was advised to leave Ireland in April 1795. Having friends among the government party, including members of the Beresford family, he succeeded in making terms with the government and emigrated to the United States, where he arrived in May 1795. Before leaving, he and his family travelled to Belfast, and it was at the summit of Cavehill that Tone made the Cavehill Compact with fellow Irish radicals, including Russell and McCracken, promising \\"never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence.\\" The United Irishmen reformed in 1796. The Society began seriously to look to France to support a rising with troops. Living in Philadelphia, Tone wrote a few months later to Thomas Russell expressing unqualified dislike of the American people, whom he imagined to be no more truly democratic in sentiment and no less attached to authority than the British; he described George Washington as a \\"high-flying aristocrat\\", and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in America still less to his liking than the European aristocracy of birth. Tone also lived briefly in West Chester and in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Finding himself at Philadelphia in the company of Reynolds, Rowan, and Tandy, Tone went to Paris to persuade the French government to send an expedition to invade Ireland. In February 1796 he arrived in Paris and had interviews with De La Croix and Carnot, who were impressed by his energy, sincerity, and ability. A commission was given him as adjutant-general in the French army, which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the British; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the United Irishmen, enjoining that all Irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the British service should be instantly shot; and he supported a project for landing La Legion Noire in England, who were to burn Bristol. A sympathizer wrote of him, in French, saying: > Wolf Tone was sent to France to claim the support of the Directory, under > the express condition that the French should come to Ireland as allies, and > should act under direction of the new government, as Rochambeau had done in > America. With this view, Tone had frequently conferences at Paris with > Hoche; and the Directory finally determined to send from Brest a fleet of > forty-five sail, with an army of fifteen thousand men, under the charge of > this able general, December 15, 1796. England was saved by a violent > tempest. Hoche's Expedition and the 1798 Rebellion In End of the Irish Invasion ; ‚Äî or ‚Äì the Destruction of the French Armada (1797), James Gillray caricatured the failure of Hoche's expedition. The French Directory planned a military landing in Ireland in support of the coming revolution foretold by Tone. The Directory possessed information from Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor confirming Tone, and prepared to despatch an expedition under Louis Lazare Hoche. On 15 December 1796, the expedition, consisting of forty-three sail and carrying about 14,450 men with a large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed from Brest.Ian McBride, Eighteenth century Ireland, (Dublin: Gill & Macmillan, 2009) p.367 Tone accompanied it as \\"Adjutant-general Smith\\" and had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the French sailors, who were unable to land due to severe gales. They waited for days off Bantry Bay, waiting for the winds to ease, but eventually returned to France. Tone served for some months in the French army under Hoche, who had become the French Republic's minister of war after his victory against the Austrians at the Battle of Neuwied on the Rhine in April 1797. In June 1797 Tone took part in preparations for a military expedition to Ireland from the Batavian Republic, a puppet state created during the Batavian Revolution in the Low Countries in January 1795. However, the Batavian fleet under Dutch Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter was delayed in the harbour of Texel island that summer by unfavourable easterly winds and from mid-August by a British North-Sea fleet blockade. It eventually put to sea in the first week of October only to be immediately crushed by Admiral Adam Duncan in the Battle of Camperdown on October 11, 1797. Tone then returned to Paris. General Hoche, once tasked with an Irish expeditionary force, died of tuberculosis on 19 September 1797 at Wetzlar after returning to his command on France's Rhine frontier. In Ireland the membership of the United Irish had reached 300,000, about 6% of the population, but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without French aid. More importantly, in a largely devoutly Catholic country, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was completely opposed to the United Irish, as they were allied to the French who had just invaded Rome and set up the anti- clerical \\"Roman Republic\\" in early 1798. Napoleon Bonaparte, with whom Tone had several interviews at this time, was less disposed than Hoche had been to undertake in earnest an Irish expedition; and when the Rising broke out in Ireland in 1798 he had started for Egypt. When Tone urged the Directory to send effective assistance to the Irish rebels, all that could be promised was a number of raids to descend simultaneously around the Irish coast. One of these under General Humbert succeeded in landing a force near Killala, County Mayo, and gained some success in Connacht (particularly at Castlebar) before it was subdued by General Lake and Charles Cornwallis. Wolfe Tone's brother Matthew was captured, tried by court-martial, and hanged; a second raid, accompanied by Napper Tandy, came to disaster on the coast of Donegal; while Wolfe Tone took part in a third, under Admiral Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart, with General Jean Hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men. This encountered a British squadron at Buncrana on Lough Swilly on 12 October 1798. Tone, on board the ship Hoche, refused Bompart's offer of escape in a frigate before the battle of Tory Island, and was taken prisoner when the Hoche surrendered. Tone was brought ashore at Letterkenny Port and all French forces of the Hoche were taken to Lord Cavan in Letterkenny's home where he faced arrest. Death Grave of Wolfe Tone, Bodenstown (coordinates 53¬∞15'45.3\\"N 6¬∞39'57.3\\"W) When the prisoners were landed a fortnight later, Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavan's privy-quarters at Letterkenny.Memoirs of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Vol. II, p1829 At his trial by court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798 Tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to England and his intention \\"by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries\\". Recognising that the court was certain to convict him, he asked that \\"the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier, and that I may be shot\\". Reading from a prepared speech, he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgeling United States), he explained his motives: A commentary on the trial continues: \\"After a long silence, interrupted by some expressions of admiration, he was told that his request should be submitted to the Lord-lieutenant. Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison. With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim‚Ä¶\\"The Criminal History of the English Government from the First Massacre of the Irish, to the Poisoning of the Chinese, Translated from the French, with Notes by an American He also lamented the outbreak of mass violence, saying: \\"Such are my principles such has been my conduct; if in consequence of the measures in which I have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country, I heartily lament it, but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since I have quit Ireland and consequently I have been personally concerned in none of them; if I am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides, but that does not at all diminish my regret; for a fair and open war I was prepared; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder I do again most sincerely lament it, and those few who know me personally will give me I am sure credit for the assertion.\\"cited by Marianne Eliot, p. 393 To the people, he had the following to say from the dock: Earlier version of Tone's headstone (1945) His eloquence was in vain, and his request to be shot was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded him. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying \\"I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?\\". Military surgeon Benjamin Lentaigne treated Tone just hours before he was due to be hanged. A pamphlet published in Latin by the doctor some years after Tone's official \\"suicide\\" refers to an unusual neck wound suffered by an unnamed patient which indicated that \\"a bullet passed through his throat\\". This has led to speculation that Tone may have been shot. Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in Provost's Prison, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in Bodenstown, Co. Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the National Graves Association. Support from Lord Kilwarden Wolfe Tone (1967) statue on St. Stephen's Green, Dublin by Edward Delaney His godfather Theobald Wolfe was Tone's natural father, according to several sources. A cousin, Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, had warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when Tone was arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for Habeas Corpus for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed at the beginning of Emmet's revolt in 1803. The Wolfes knew that Tone was their cousin. As a pillar of the Protestant Ascendancy and, as Attorney-General for Ireland the prosecutor of the case against United Irishman William Orr, Kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone.C Costello, A Class Apart The Gentry Families of County Kildare (Nonesuch, Dublin 2005) p98. Maud Wolfe (1892‚Äì1980), the last of the Wolfes to live in Kildare, continued her family tradition of annually laying flowers at Tone's grave until her death.W. Nolan (ed), Kildare History and Society (Geography, Dublin 2006) p395. .Leinster Leader obituary of Ms Wolfe, 21 June 1980 The historian A. T. Q. Stewart has commented (2001) on Tone's long obsession with the heroism and death in battle of James Wolfe in 1759, seeing him as a cousin to be emulated. In this sense \\"Wolfe Tone\\" becomes a surname reflecting his true paternity.Stewart A., The Shape of Irish History; Belfast, Blackstaff Press, 2001. Legacy \\"[Tone] rises\\", said William Lecky, the 19th-century historian, \\"far above the dreary level of commonplace which Irish conspiracy in general presents‚Ä¶ His judgement of men and things was keen, lucid and masculine, and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action.\\"History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Centuryvol 5, by WEH Lecky, Longmans, Greens and Co (London), P79 (cabinet ed, 5 vols, London, 1892) His journals, which were written for his family and intimate friends were published in Washington DC in 1821 by his son, William Theobald Wolfe Tone. They were republished in 1910 by Richard Barry O'Brien. Tone was adopted by the Young Ireland movement of the 1840s as an iconic figure, as the father of Irish republicanism and above religious divisions. Its leader Thomas Davis found and publicised the location of Tone's grave in 1843. Modern republicans quote his ideals: In 1898 a series of centenary commemorations of the 1798 rebellion were held by the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Catholic Church in Ireland, that to a large extent sidelined Tone and the other Protestant Nationalist leaders. This \\"Faith and Fatherland\\" approach mythologised Tone and recast the rebellion as Church-sanctioned, the exact opposite of its policy in 1798.History Ireland essay, 1998, vol.6; accessed 4 August 2019 Every summer, Irish Republicans hold commemorations at Tone's grave in Bodenstown. In 1912 an annual commemoration march from Naas to Bodenstown was started by Tom Clarke, who was to be executed after the 1916 Rising. The march became a part of the folklore of Irish republican groups, with a new headstone placed in the 1940s. An attempt on 17 June 1934 by Protestant Republican Congress members from Belfast to join in the commemoration march was prevented by IRA stewards. The marchers were stoned and \\"scuffles broke out\\".Durney, J (2001) On the one road, Naas, p. 176. This was portrayed by some commentators as sectarianism, that republicans had abandoned Tone's aim to unite Irishmen by ignoring their religious differences, paying tribute only to his anti-British republicanism.Irish Times 28 February 2006, p16. IrishTimes.com However, Brian Hanley's history of the IRA from 1926 to 1936 concludes that the trouble arose because they were seen as \\"communist\\", and not for sectarian reasons.FourCourtsPress.ie From the 1960s the Wolfe Tone Societies were founded, but failed to have an impact on mainstream Irish politics. Some members were also affiliated with the IRA. As a result, Tone's grave was bombed at night by the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1971, and was then rebuilt. Descendants Of Tone's four children, three died prematurely. His eldest child, Maria Tone (1786‚Äì1803; died in Paris) and his youngest child, Francis Rawdon Tone (1793‚Äì1806) both died of tuberculosis. Another son, Richard Tone (born between 1787 and 1789) died in infancy. Only his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone survived to adulthood. Raised in France by his mother after Tone's death, William was appointed a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was a naturalised French citizen on 4 May 1812. In January 1813 he was made sub-lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs and joined the Grand Army in Germany. His nom de guerre was the punning le petit loup ‚Äì the little wolf. He was at the battles of L√∂wenberg, Goldberg, Dresden, Bauthen, M√ºhlberg, Aachen, and Leipzig. He received six lance wounds at the Battle of Leipzig, was promoted to lieutenant and aide-de-camp of General Bagneres and was decorated with the Legion of Honour. After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, he emigrated to the United States, where he was commissioned a Captain in the United States Army and died there on 11 October 1828 at the age of 37. Matilda Tone also emigrated to the United States, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. William Tone was survived by his only child, his daughter Grace Georgina. In popular culture Wolfe Tone Square in Dublin, beside the Jervis Shopping Centre. Several Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Ireland are named in honour of Wolfe Tone. These include, in Armagh, Wolfe Tone GAC, Derrymacash; in Derry, Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC; in Meath, Wolfe Tones GAA, and in Tyrone, Drumquin Wolfe Tones GAC and Kildress Wolfe Tones GAC. In North America, there is the Chicago Wolfe Tones GFC in Illinois, and the Edmonton Wolfe Tones in Alberta, Canada. In 1963, Brian Warfield, Noel Nagle, Tommy Byrne, and Derek Warfield formed The Wolfe Tones, an Irish rebel music band. They play Irish rebel music and are strong supporters of Irish independence. Several streets, plazas and a bridge have been named in honour of Tone, including Wolfe Tone Square in Dublin. A documentary by Kenneth Griffith on the life of Wolfe Tone was completed but not released.

In the paper, Wigner observed that the mathematical structure of a physical theory often points the way to further advances in that theory and even to empirical predictions.  The miracle of mathematics in the natural sciences  Wigner begins his paper with the belief, common among those familiar with mathematics, that mathematical concepts have applicability far beyond the context in which they were originally developed. Based on his experience, he says \\"it is important to point out that the mathematical formulation of the physicist's often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of cases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of phenomena\\". He then invokes the fundamental law of gravitation as an example. Originally used to model freely falling bodies on the surface of the earth, this law was extended on the basis of what Wigner terms \\"very scanty observations\\" to describe the motion of the planets, where it \\"has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectations\\". Another oft-cited example is Maxwell's equations, derived to model the elementary electrical and magnetic phenomena known as of the mid 19th century. These equations also describe radio waves, discovered by David Edward Hughes in 1879, around the time of James Clerk Maxwell's death. Wigner sums up his argument by saying that \\"the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it\\". He concludes his paper with the same question with which he began: > The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the > formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither > understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will > remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for > worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide > branches of learning.  The deep connection between science and mathematics  Wigner's work provided a fresh insight into both physics and the philosophy of mathematics, and has been fairly often cited in the academic literature on the philosophy of physics and of mathematics. Wigner speculated on the relationship between the philosophy of science and the foundations of mathematics as follows: > It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, > quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the human mind > can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into > contradictions, or to the two miracles of laws of nature and of the human > mind's capacity to divine them. Later, Hilary Putnam (1975) explained these \\"two miracles\\" as being necessary consequences of a realist (but not Platonist) view of the philosophy of mathematics. Reprinted in However, in a passage discussing cognitive bias Wigner cautiously labeled as \\"not reliable\\", he went further: > The writer is convinced that it is useful, in epistemological discussions, > to abandon the idealization that the level of human intelligence has a > singular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be useful > to consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the > intelligence of some other species. Whether humans checking the results of humans can be considered an objective basis for observation of the known (to humans) universe is an interesting question, one followed up in both cosmology and the philosophy of mathematics. Wigner also laid out the challenge of a cognitive approach to integrating the sciences: > A much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could, some > day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of biology, > which would be as coherent and convincing as our present theories of the > inanimate world. He further proposed that arguments could be found that might > put a heavy strain on our faith in our theories and on our belief in the > reality of the concepts which we form. It would give us a deep sense of > frustration in our search for what I called 'the ultimate truth'. The reason > that such a situation is conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know > why our theories work so well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their > truth and consistency. Indeed, it is this writer's belief that something > rather akin to the situation which was described above exists if the present > laws of heredity and of physics are confronted.  Responses to Wigner's original paper  Wigner's original paper has provoked and inspired many responses across a wide range of disciplines. These include Richard Hamming in computer science, Arthur Lesk in molecular biology, Peter Norvig in data mining, Max Tegmark in physics, Ivor Grattan-Guinness in mathematics and Vela Velupillai in economics. =Richard Hamming= Richard Hamming, an applied mathematician and a founder of computer science, reflected on and extended Wigner's Unreasonable Effectiveness in 1980, mulling over four \\"partial explanations\\" for it. Hamming concluded that the four explanations he gave were unsatisfactory. They were: 1\\\\. Humans see what they look for. The belief that science is experimentally grounded is only partially true. Rather, our intellectual apparatus is such that much of what we see comes from the glasses we put on. Eddington went so far as to claim that a sufficiently wise mind could deduce all of physics, illustrating his point with the following joke: \\"Some men went fishing in the sea with a net, and upon examining what they caught they concluded that there was a minimum size to the fish in the sea.\\" Hamming gives four examples of nontrivial physical phenomena he believes arose from the mathematical tools employed and not from the intrinsic properties of physical reality. * Hamming proposes that Galileo discovered the law of falling bodies not by experimenting, but by simple, though careful, thinking. Hamming imagines Galileo as having engaged in the following thought experiment (the experiment, which Hamming calls \\"scholastic reasoning\\", is described in Galileo's book On Motion. ): : > Suppose that a falling body broke into two pieces. Of course the two pieces > would immediately slow down to their appropriate speeds. But suppose further > that one piece happened to touch the other one. Would they now be one piece > and both speed up? Suppose I tie the two pieces together. How tightly must I > do it to make them one piece? A light string? A rope? Glue? When are two > pieces one? :There is simply no way a falling body can \\"answer\\" such hypothetical \\"questions.\\" Hence Galileo would have concluded that \\"falling bodies need not know anything if they all fall with the same velocity, unless interfered with by another force.\\" After coming up with this argument, Hamming found a related discussion in P√≥lya (1963: 83-85). Hamming's account does not reveal an awareness of the 20th century scholarly debate over just what Galileo did. *The inverse square law of universal gravitation necessarily follows from the conservation of energy and of space having three dimensions. Measuring the exponent in the law of universal gravitation is more a test of whether space is Euclidean than a test of the properties of the gravitational field. *The inequality at the heart of the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics follows from the properties of Fourier integrals and from assuming time invariance. *Hamming argues that Albert Einstein's pioneering work on special relativity was largely \\"scholastic\\" in its approach. He knew from the outset what the theory should look like (although he only knew this because of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment), and explored candidate theories with mathematical tools, not actual experiments. Hamming alleges that Einstein was so confident that his relativity theories were correct that the outcomes of observations designed to test them did not much interest him. If the observations were inconsistent with his theories, it would be the observations that were at fault. 2\\\\. Humans create and select the mathematics that fit a situation. The mathematics at hand does not always work. For example, when mere scalars proved awkward for understanding forces, first vectors, then tensors, were invented. 3\\\\. Mathematics addresses only a part of human experience. Much of human experience does not fall under science or mathematics but under the philosophy of value, including ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. To assert that the world can be explained via mathematics amounts to an act of faith. 4\\\\. Evolution has primed humans to think mathematically. The earliest lifeforms must have contained the seeds of the human ability to create and follow long chains of close reasoning. =Max Tegmark= A different response, advocated by physicist Max Tegmark, is that physics is so successfully described by mathematics because the physical world is completely mathematical, isomorphic to a mathematical structure, and that we are simply uncovering this bit by bit. The same interpretation had been advanced some years previously by Peter Atkins. In this interpretation, the various approximations that constitute our current physics theories are successful because simple mathematical structures can provide good approximations of certain aspects of more complex mathematical structures. In other words, our successful theories are not mathematics approximating physics, but mathematics approximating mathematics. Most of Tegmark's propositions are highly speculative, and some of them even far-out by strict scientific standards, and they raise one basic question: can one make precise sense of a notion of isomorphism (rather than hand-waving \\"correspondence\\") between the universe ‚Äì the concrete world of \\"stuff\\" and events ‚Äì on the one hand, and mathematical structures as they are understood by mathematicians, within mathematics? Unless ‚Äì or optimistically, until ‚Äì this is achieved, the often-heard proposition that ‚Äòthe world/universe is mathematical‚Äô may be nothing but a category mistake. =Ivor Grattan-Guinness= Ivor Grattan- Guinness finds the effectiveness in question eminently reasonable and explicable in terms of concepts such as analogy, generalisation and metaphor.

The system was built starting in 1963, based on the Army's existing Switch Communications Automated Network (SCAN) system. In June 1966 the Air Defense Command voice network was cut over to the new service.AT&T; (1974) Events in Telephone History In 1969, AUTOVON switching centers opened in the United Kingdom, and later in other European countries, Asia, the Middle East, and Panama. It was a major part of the Defense Communications System (DCS), providing non-secure switched voice services. The system was replaced in the early 1990s by the Defense Switched Network. Circuits AUTOVON used a combination of its own constructed circuits and other lines operated by AT&T; Corporation and smaller independent telephone companies, connected by high-speed switching centers produced by Automatic Electric Company to exchanges located far from other civilian or military targets. In the US the cables were predominantly L-carrier coaxial multiplex built by AT&T;, who also used them to carry about one third of all civilian long-distance calls, as their capacity was much higher than the military needed. Although unused, some of the cables remain today and the routes are visible on satellite photos. The system's traffic was transported over many media other than underground cable, including microwave links, open wire and, near the end of the system's life, fiber optic. Contrary to stories of underground concrete cable ducts, most of the cable was directly buried without added concrete, relying instead on the natural protection of soil. In some areas, however, cables from the AUTOSEVOCOM network were laid in parallel. These were often concrete-encased when the traffic they were carrying was not encrypted. Most of the cable repeater huts have been sold to private interests, to round out existing parcels, or as possible build-to-suit tower sites, etc. AT&T; has been filling the small underground portion before sale, unless they sell to a major company. The junctions for AUTOVON are also being sold into private ownership, with a few exceptions. Most are stripped of all the equipment, although the AUTOVON junction in Mounds, Oklahoma was sold with all the old equipment in place. The telephone switches used were initially a 4 wire version of Number Five Crossbar Switching System, replaced in the early 1970s after the more versatile 1ESS switch had shown its reliability. (Note that this paragraph disagrees in part with an earlier paragraph regarding the manufacturer of switching equipment. In general, switches in Bell operating territories were made by AT&T;, and most others by Automatic Electric; see the Autovon switch location map cited in External Links, below, for a snapshot listing of locations (some of the names in the map have been anonymized) and equipment manufacturer.) Multilevel precedence and preemption The AUTOVON system provided a facility for placing calls with multilevel precedence and preemption (MLPP). If in the public switched telephone network a caller encounters congestion because no circuits are available, the caller typically receives the reorder tone (\\"fast-busy\\" signal) and is unable to reach the called party. In military networks such an event was not acceptable, as some calls must always be completed. AUTOVON included four message precedence levels: Routine, Priority, Immediate and Flash, and had an additional capability called Flash Override. These levels were activated using the buttons in an additional column of the keypad, which produced the dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals A, B, C, and D: *A (697/1633 Hz): Flash Override (FO) *B (770/1633 Hz): Flash (F) *C (852/1633 Hz): Immediate (I) *D (941/1633 Hz): Priority (P) Routine was the level of calls without priority and required no special signaling; the user would only dial the telephone number. Calls with precedence required preceding the telephone number with the desired precedence signal. Calls of increasing precedence could preempt calls of lower priority, giving them a special tone, if need be. For example, if a call was placed with Flash precedence and the route had no available trunks, the switch would preempt a Routine call, and if none in progress, would search for Priority and Immediate type calls. Only when all lines of a switch were already used with Flash or Flash Override precedence would the caller receive a reorder signal. The authority of a caller to use the precedence levels was granted by complex regulations.Copy of a 1971 \\"Official Global Autovon Telephone Directory\\" Flash Override was not designated as a precedence level, but a capability designed to allow the President of the United States or other National Command Authority to preempt any other traffic in the network in an emergency. The International Telecommunications Union accepted the MLPP specification as recommendation Q.955.3 in March 1993. Numbering plan AUTOVON used a numbering scheme similar to the North American Numbering Plan. The network had its own three- digit area codes for various geographic regions around the world. Each area code covered several three-digit exchange codes, usually corresponding to the central office telephone switches serving each installation. Thus, almost any telephone on a military base could be direct-dialed via AUTOVON. A selected set of telephones were four-wire AUTOVON phones, wired directly into the AUTOVON network. Others could initiate AUTOVON calls with operator assistance. Though the numbering plan was similar to the U.S. civilian scheme, the routing structure was a very complex polygrid system unlike the civilian office classification scheme, which used a 5-level hierarchical system in which longer-distance traffic, in general, was handled by higher-level switches. It was barely within the information processing capabilities of the Number Five Crossbar switching system which implemented it. The non-hierarchical routing structure was intended to get around any number of nodes destroyed in war. This system inspired similarly survivable ones for message networks, including in future decades the Internet. Local base switches would be connected to a few AUTOVON trunks, which the user would access by dialing 8 (or in some cases, 88) before the telephone number. To dial locally a user would dial 9, and to dial using commercial long-distance, 1 (where this was supported). The United States Department of Defense (DoD) charged access to AUTOVON according to a complex billing system, and each base budgeted according to local practice.

Iraqi News Agency/AP. The Iraqi Republican Guard ( ·∏§aras al- øIrƒÅq al-Jamh≈´rƒ´y) was a branch of the Iraqi military from 1964 to 2003, primarily during the presidency of Saddam Hussein. It later became the Republican Guard Corps, and then the Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) with its expansion into two corps. The Republican Guard was disbanded in 2003, after the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition. The Republican Guard were the elite troops of the Iraqi army directly reporting to Saddam Hussein, unlike the paramilitary force Fedayeen Saddam, and the ordinary Iraqi Army. They were better trained, disciplined, equipped, and paid more than ordinary Iraqi soldiers, receiving bonuses, new cars, and subsidized housing. History Formed in 1969, it was originally created to be a Presidential Guard. Its primary objective was to maintain the stability of the regime and provide protection against internal and external enemies. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, it was expanded into a large military force. It was disbanded along with the rest of Iraqi military after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the Coalition Provisional Authority of the administering U.S. and British forces. The force's last commander was Qusay Hussein, the younger son of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was so confident about the capability of the guard that he had said: \\"In history when they write about Napoleon's Guard, they will arrange them next to the Republican Guard of Iraq.\\" Because of their elite status Republican Guards received better equipment and uniforms than their regular Army counterparts, and could often be identified by distinctive markings or items of head dress. Members of the regular Republican Guards conventionally wore a scarlet-colored triangle insignia on both shoulders of their uniforms (sometimes backed with white material to form a white border around the edge of the triangle); they also wore black berets as did some Army personnel, but as a distinctive marking a scarlet ribbon was often sewn to the right of the National cap badge to distinguish bravery in combat and/or loyalty to the Hussein regime. The Special Republican Guards wore a maroon beret with the national eagle device, and a special variation of the triangle shoulder insignia in maroon with green Arabic lettering. The bright red qardoon (shoulder cord) distinguished Republican Guards as well. A similar cord with green and red bands was also worn by the Special Republican Guards. Iran‚ÄìIraq War Initially, the Guard had limited capabilities; however, during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, it was expanded to five brigades, which was initially being mostly used in counterattacks, notably in Operation Dawn 4. By 1986 the war had exhausted Iraq with both Iran and Iraq suffering heavy casualties. Iran had by then captured Al Faw Peninsula and generally pushed Iraqi forces beyond the pre-war border and captured territory inside Iraq, repulsing counterattacks by the Republican Guard. This, coupled with another defeat at the Battle of Mehran, caused the Iraqi Ba'ath Party to convene the Ba'ath Extraordinary Congress of July 1986. During this Congress the Ba'ath Party decided on a new strategy to overhaul the Iraqi military and utilize Iraq's manpower capability. The government closed all colleges and universities and began a mass mobilization program to force draft dodgers into the Iraqi Popular Army. This decision allowed for the drafting of thousands of university students, who were sent to military summer camps. In addition, the military began accepting volunteers from throughout Iraq. With this massive influx of manpower the Republican Guard expanded to over 25 brigades which were led by loyal officers drawn from the Iraqi military. This force then conducted the Tawakalna ala Allah Operations which, allowed for the eviction of the Iranians out of occupied Iraqi territory including the liberation of Al-Faw, as well as allowing for renewed major offensives into Iran. =1980‚Äì1988 Order of Battle= The order of battle according to Iranian sources was as follows: *1st Mechanized Brigade *2nd, 10th Armored Brigades *3rd Special Forces Brigade *4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th, 17th Infantry Brigades (sometimes as mechanized units) *11th Commando Brigade There are some claims of units with names that are unknown. Persian Gulf War See Operation Desert Shield Type 69-QM2 tank captured during the Persian Gulf War at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum, Puckapunyal, Australia Between the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War (\\"Operation Desert Storm\\"), the number of Republican Guard formations was expanded and the Guard was reorganized. The Republican Guard Forces Command was also created during this period. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, it consisted of the following units: * Republican Guard, CO Lieutenant General Iyad Futayyih Khalifah al-Rawi ** 1st Republican Guard Corps, deployed in southern Iraq and northern Kuwait, consisted of: *** 1st Hammurabi Armoured Division, CO Major General Qais Abd al-Razaq. *** 2nd al-Medinah al-Munawera Armoured Division *** 3rd Tawakalna ala-Allah Mechanised Division\\"In God we Trust\\" *** 4th Al Faw Motorized Infantry Division ** 2d Republican Guard Corps deployed south of Baghdad consisted of: *** 5th Baghdad Mechanised Division, a square division of four brigades, was able to be split into two small half-divisions *** 6th Nebuchadnezzar Motorized Infantry Division *** 7th Adnan Motorized Infantry DivisionNamed after a cousin of Saddam Hussein Deployed outside of the corps structure were various other units including: :* 8th As Saiqa Special Forces Division - contained a marine brigade, a parachute brigade, and a special forces brigade. The marine brigade was deployed on Kuwait's nine islands, all of which with the exception of Failaka Island are uninhabited. The brigade was headquartered on Bubiyan Island The Republican Guard also included two Corps Headquarters, the Allah Akbar Republican Guard Operations Command, and the Fat'h al-Mubayyin Republican Guard Operations Command, separate artillery detachments and numerous field support units. Between the invasion of Kuwait and the start of the war on 17 January 1991, four more RGFC internal security divisions had been formed which remained behind in Iraq. All of these units were motorised infantry. The names of only three of them were identified: the Al-Abed, Al-Mustafa ('The Elect') and Al-Nida Divisions ('The Call'). They may have conducted operations against Kurdish forces in the north. =Invasion of Kuwait= By 1 August 1990, there were more than 100,000 Iraqi troops with up to 700 tanks on the Kuwaiti border. On 2 August 1990, the Republican Guard units commenced the invasion of Kuwait, which lasted two days. The Kuwait army strength was 16,000, so on paper Iraqi forces outnumbered the Kuwaitis 7 to 1. However, the actual ratio was far worse; the initial attack was so quick, and the Kuwaiti units so unprepared, that many of Kuwait's armed forces were on leave and unable to report in time. The attack was conducted by eight RGFC divisions (two armoured, two mechanized, three motorised infantry and one special forces). The main thrust was conducted from the north down the main Iraq-Kuwait road, later famous as the Highway of Death, by the 1st Hammurabi Armoured Division, with the Nebuchadnezzar Infantry division following; the Tawakalna Mechanised and Al Faw Infantry Divisions advanced on the flanks. The supporting attack from the west was led by the Medina Armoured Division, followed by the Adnan Infantry Division and the Baghdad Mechanised Division. Commandos deployed by helicopters joined the attack on Kuwait City. After the invasion, the Republican Guard was withdrawn and redeployed into strategic reserve positions in northern Kuwait and southern and central Iraq. =Desert Storm= During the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. VII Corps assembled in full strength and launched an armoured attack into Iraq early Sunday, 24 February, just to the west of Kuwait, taking Iraqi forces by surprise. Prior to the ground offensive, the Iraqi Republican Guard had been attacked relentlessly by US warplanes but managed to shoot down and damage a number of the attackers. On 15 February, the Iraqi Republican Guard shot down two A-10 Warthogs and damaged another and this alarmed USAF General Charles Albert Horner, who was forced to call off further A-10 attacks on these divisions.\\"On 15 February, when the Republican Guard shot down two A-1Os and damaged another, Horner pulled the Warthogs off the Republican Guard.\\" Airpower advantage: planning the Gulf War air campaign, 1989-1991, Diane Therese Putney, p. 253, Air Force History and Museums Program, U.S. Air Force, 2004 Simultaneously, the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping \\"left-hook\\" attack across the largely undefended desert of southern Iraq, led by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the Republican Guard. Both sides exchanged fire, but the Republican guard divisions, worn down by weeks of aerial bombardment, proved unable to withstand the Allied advance. The Republican Guard participated in some of the largest tank battles in history including the Battle of Medina Ridge, Battle of Norfolk, and the Battle of 73 Easting against the U.S. VII Corps.VUA Citation During the latter battle, US veterans admit coming under heavy small- arms fire with bullets bouncing off their vehicles, which proves that several dismounted detachments of the Tawakalna Division had stayed and fought.\\"At 73 Easting, for example, 2nd ACR crews reported large volumes of small arms fire rattling off their vehicles during the assault, which means that Iraqi troops stayed at their weapons, returning fire, even as U.S. tanks passed within a few hundred meters of their positions (i.e., within small-arms range). In fact, some Republican Guard infantry are known to have remained at their posts, concealed, until U.S. attackers had actually driven through their positions, only then emerging to fire short range antitank rockets at the vehicles from behind. Heavy weapons fire was also received. Although large- caliber hits were rare, multiple Iraqi tank gun rounds were observed falling near U.S. vehicles.\\" Victory Misunderstood Several rifle companies of the Tawakalna Division counterattacked under the cover of darkness, in an attempt to recover lost positions.\\"Perhaps most important, the Tawakalna division not only defended itself when attacked, but also counterattacked the 2nd ACR after being driven from its positions.

The remaining formations led the suppression of the 1991 uprisings in northern and southern Iraq - the Kurdish insurgency in the north and the Shi'ite uprising in the east. During these times, there were numerous accusations of the use of poison gas, rape and torture. The Hammurabi and Medina divisions surrounded Karbala with tanks and artillery and shelled the city for one week killing thousands and destroying entire neighborhoods. Though it was reduced to a strength of seven or eight divisions, the RGFC was reconstituted, taking equipment from Army heavy divisions. Journalist Sean Boyle wrote a number of articles for Jane's Intelligence Review, including on the Republican Guard, during the 1990s. In September 1997 he wrote that the Northern Corps had four divisions - Adnan Mechanised Division (Headquarters (HQ) Mosul) with the 11, 12, 21 Brigades; Baghdad Infantry Division (HQ Maqloob Maontin, Mosul Governate) 4, 5, 6 Brigades; Al Madina Al Munawara Armoured Division (Al Rashedia Camp/Al Taji Camp) 2, 10, 14, 17 Brigades; and the Al Abed Infantry Division (Khaled Camp, Kirkuk) with the 38, 39, and 40 Brigades.Sean Boyle, article in Jane's Intelligence Review, September 1997. The Southern Corps had three divisions including the Hammurabi Division. 2003 Iraq War See article: Iraq War An Iraqi Republican Guard FROG-7 captured by U.S. Marines. The Republican Guard was subordinate to the \\"Special Security Apparatus of the State\\" and not to the Ministry of Defense (Iraq) as was the regular Iraqi army. It was split into two Corps, one for the defense and control of northern Iraq, called \\"Allah Akbar Operations Command\\", composed of infantry and armoured units, and the \\"Fat'h al-Mubayyin Operations Command\\" composed primarily of mechanized units, which was located in the southern part of the country. In 2002, it was reported that the Republican Guard and the Fedayeen Saddam were both training in urban warfare and in guerrilla warfare. The Republican Guard then consisted of between 50,000 and 60,000 men (although some sources indicate up to 80,000), all volunteers, and some 750 Soviet T-72 and Asad Babil tanks and scores of T-55 and T-62 tanks, along with other mechanized vehicles. A further 90-100 T-72 tanks were operated by the Special Republican Guard. These forces were intentionally away from the capital to avert a possible rebellion against the regime. The members of this body of the army were better paid, equipped, armed and trained. They formed a special corps that were given the ability to buy houses and given other privileges to ensure loyalty to the regime. Nevertheless, the Medina Republican Guard Division and Nebuchadnezzar Republican Guard Division tasked with defending the Karbala Gap fought well, 23 March 2003, disrupting a strong attack conducted by the 11th Aviation Group (\\"11th Attack Helicopter Regiment\\"), damaging thirty Apaches and shooting down one\\"On 23 March 2003, three days after the onset of the Iraq war, 31 Apache helicopters of the 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment (some organic, some attached) set out to deplete the armour and air defenses of the Iraqi Medina Division near Karbala. As was doctrine, they flew low in packs toward their objective. However, en route they became ensnared in 'flak traps' - storms of small arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and man-portable missiles, originating from rooftops. This ad hoc air defense effort, which was remniscent of Somali tactics ten years earlier, had probably been triggered by Iraqi pickets equipped with either cell phones or low-power radios. The fire brought down one of the Apaches and damaged all the others sufficiently to compel their return to base. The experience dampened command interest in attempting helicopter deep attack thereafter.\\" Military Intervention and Common Sense: Focus on Land Forces, Lutz Unterseher, Carl Conetta, pp. 94-95, Commonwealth Institute, 2009 and capturing the crew, David Williams and Ronald Young, both chief warrant officers.

The Republican Guard was officially dissolved on 23 May 2003 per Order Number 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Paul Bremer. In early 2004, British journalist Sean Langan confirmed that one of the local commanders of the guerrilla stronghold of Ramadi was a former Republican Guard officer.Mission Accomplished, Sean Langan, BBC, 2007 In late April 2004, a Pentagon report claimed that members of the Special Republican Guard had regrouped in the guerrilla stronghold of Fallujah.\\"A Pentagon intelligence report has concluded that many bombings against Americans and their allies in Iraq, and the more sophisticated of the guerrilla attacks in Fallujah, are organized and often carried out by members of Saddam Hussein's secret service ... in Fallujah, which is currently encircled by U.S. Marines, an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 hard-core insurgents, including members of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard who melted away under the U.S.-led offensive, are receiving tactical guidance and inspiration from these former intelligence operatives.\\" Saddam agents blamed for plots Many members of the Republican Guard joined several of the insurgent groups currently operating in Iraq such as the Return and ISIS.

It is responsible for providing guards of honour for the state and security in the Paris area. Its missions include guarding important public buildings in Paris such as the √âlys√©e Palace (the residence of the President of the French Republic), the H√¥tel Matignon (the residence of the Prime Minister of France), the Palais du Luxembourg (the Senate), the Palais Bourbon (the National Assembly), the Palais de Justice, as well as keeping public order in Paris. Honour and security services for the highest national personalities and important foreign guests, military ceremonies and guards of honour for fallen soldiers, support of other law enforcement forces with intervention teams and staffing horseback patrol stations, particularly for the forests of the √éle-de-France region, also are part of its duties. The close physical protection of the President of the Republic is entrusted to the Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic (GSPR) a mixed police‚Äìgendarmerie unit which is not part of the Republican Guard. The guard, however provides counter-sniper teams (observateurs-contre-tireurs) and intervention platoons (pelotons d'intervention). The Republican Guard also represents France at international events at home or abroad. History John Kerry and Jean-Marc Ayrault leaving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, surrounded by the Republican Guard Cavalry officer The Republican Guard is the heir of the various bodies that preceded it in the course of French and Parisian history and whose task was to honor and protect the high authorities of the State and the capital city: Gardes Fran√ßaises of the Kings, Consular and Imperial Guard of Napoleon, etc.. Its name derives from the Municipal Guard of Paris, established on 12 Vend√©miaire XI (October 4, 1802) by Napoleon Bonaparte. This unit distinguished itself in battles of historical significance, including Danzig and Friedland in 1807, Alcolea in 1808 and Burgos in 1812. In 1813 the Municipal Guard was dissolved following the attempted coup of General Malet and replaced by the Imperial Gendarmerie of Paris and then, under the Restoration, the Royal Guard of Paris and the Royal Mounted Police of Paris. In 1830, it was recreated, and again removed after the Revolution of 1848 in favor of the Civic Guard (which proved to be a transient institution). June 1848 saw the creation of the Republican Guard of Paris, including an infantry regiment and a regiment of cavalry. On February, 1 1849, a Napoleon III decree made the Guard a part of the French National Gendarmerie. It received its insignia July 14, 1880. It didn't take part in the First World War as a unit but more than one third of its personnel were seconded to Army regiments for the duration of the conflict. As a consequence, its flag and banner decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Legion of Honour. During the Second World War, it reported to the police headquarters and took the name of Guard of Paris. Part of its staff rallied to General de Gaulle and the Guard was involved in the fighting alongside the FFI during the liberation of Paris. From 1947 to 1954, the Republican Guard took part in the Indochina War by sending three \\"Legions of March\\" which were mainly assigned to the training of allied indigenous troops and to the defense of certain places. The 3 legions, comprising a constant workforce of nearly 3,000 men, will deplore heavy losses (more than 600 dead and 1,500 wounded during the conflict), which earned it the Croix de Guerre TOE. In 1954, the Republican Guard split into two distinct branches, the Mobile Gendarmerie and the Republican Guard of Paris. In 1978, the guard took its current name of \\"Republican Guard.\\" President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing gave it, on 11 November 1979, its new insignia. Mich√®le Alliot-Marie, Minister of Defence, said in October 2002: \\"The Republican Guard has a popularity that transcends borders,\\" it contributes \\"to the splendour of the French military and France.\\":fr:Garde r√©publicaine (France)#Histoire The Republican Guard is twinned with the Red Guard of Senegal.  Missions = Ceremonial duties = Brazilian President Lula reviewing the Republican Guard in 2005. These ceremonial functions are performed mainly by the first infantry regiment, the cavalry regiment and occasionally by the second infantry regiment. Detachments from the cavalry regiment reinforce the two infantry regiments in carrying out ceremonial and security duties in and around state buildings. These include the lining of both sides of the entry stairs of the Elys√©e or Matignon Palaces (and other buildings) by dismounted cavalry on special occasions. These Republican Guards belong to the Cavalry Regiment and not to the infantry units whose mission is to ensure the security of these palaces and of senior government figures. Certain ceremonial duties in the form of honour guards are performed during state visits to the Paris museums or the Opera, as well as during other ceremonies (for example at the French Academy).Citizens could even hire Republican Guards for private fashionable evenings but this option was terminated by President Giscard d'Estaing in the mid 1970s. = Security missions = Although the ceremonial duties attract more public attention, more than 80% of the missions assigned to the Garde are security missions. These include missions performed for the state such as protection of state buildings but also missions performed for the benefit of the population (for example patrols in the parks and streets).

Organization The Republican Guard belongs to the French National Gendarmerie. It is made up of approx. 2,800 men and women (drawn from an overall body of 100,000 gendarmes). As a historically Parisian organization, the guards wear the armorial bearings of the city on their uniforms. It consists of two infantry regiments (one includes a motorcycle squadron) and a horse cavalry regiment. It also has four musical formations, as well as display teams demonstrating prowess in horseback or motorcycle maneuvers. The Guard is commanded by a general de division (major general). It is headquartered in the Quartier des C√©lestins,Quartier is used for barracks housing cavalry and other mounted troops while caserne is used for infantry, engineers and non-mounted troops.

Headquartered in the Quartier des C√©lestins, and Quartier Carnot barracks the cavalry regiment is made up of approx. 480 gendarmes and civilians of which a little more than 10% are women. It has approximately 550 horses (11% mares) and remains the last mounted regiment in the French armed forces. The regiment is composed of: * Three squadronsA French escadron is equivalent to a US troop or a British squadron. of cavalry (the first is based at Quartier des C√©lestins, in Paris, and two others based at Quartier Carnot, also in Paris at the fringe of Bois de Vincennes), * Reserve squadron * A squadron hors rang (based at Les C√©lestins) and composed of: ** mounted band ** horse-shoeing (farriers), ** veterinary service. * The training centre (centre d'instruction) at Quartier Goupil Saint-Germain-en-Laye) * Hunting Horns Platoon (Trompes de Chasse de la Garde) This unit has a section of high level sportsmen, in particular Hubert Perring, dressage champion of France in 2005, and member of the French team for the World Equestrian Games of 2006.

Each of the seven security and honor companies is composed of three regular sections (i.e., platoons) and one peloton d'intervention (intervention platoon). The regular sections perform ceremonial duties and guards. The intervention platoons provide special security in the government buildings and palaces protected by the Guard. They are also tasked with police missions in support of the Gendarmerie in the Paris area (home arrests, escorts etc.). One of the seven intervention platoons is permanently deployed on a rotational basis to either French Guiana in support of forces combating illegal gold mining or to another French oversea territory (typically Guadeloupe or Saint Martin).

On 7 August 1999, Islamist fighters from Chechnya infiltrated Russia's Dagestan region, declaring it an independent state and calling for Holy war. On 1 October, Russian troops entered Chechnya. The campaign ended the de facto independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and restored Russian federal control over the territory. During the initial campaign, Russian military and pro-Russian Chechen paramilitary forces faced Chechen separatists in open combat, and seized the Chechen capital Grozny after a winter siege that lasted from late 1999 until February 2000. Russia established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000 and after the full-scale offensive, Chechen militant resistance throughout the North Caucasus region continued to inflict heavy Russian casualties and challenge Russian political control over Chechnya for several more years. Some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. These attacks, as well as widespread human rights violations by Russian and separatist forces, drew international condemnation. In mid-2000, the Russian government transferred certain military operations to pro-Russian Chechen forces. The military phase of operations was terminated in April 2002, and the coordination of the field operations were given first to the Federal Security Service and then to the MVD in the summer of 2003. By 2009, Russia had severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement and large-scale fighting ceased. Russian army and interior ministry troops no longer occupied the streets. Grozny underwent reconstruction efforts and much of the city and surrounding areas were rebuilt quickly. Sporadic violence continues throughout the North Caucasus; occasional bombings and ambushes targeting federal troops and forces of the regional governments in the area still occur.It's over, and Putin won The Guardian Retrieved on 23 February 2009 On 16 April 2009, the government operation in Chechnya was officially over. As the main bulk of the army was withdrawn, the responsibility of dealing with the low-level insurgency became mainly shouldered by the local police force. Three months later the exiled leader of the separatist government, Akhmed Zakayev, called for a halt to armed resistance against the Chechen police force starting on 1 August and said he hoped that \\"starting with this day Chechens will never shoot at each other\\".Chechen self-proclaimed government-in-exile lays down weapons Russia Today Retrieved on 29 July 2009 This marked the complete end of the Chechen conflict. The exact death toll from this conflict is unknown. Russian casualties are around 7,500 (official Russian casualty figures) 4,572 servicemen of all security agencies killed by December 2002, 680 Russian Armed Forces soldiers killed in 2003‚Äì2007 or about 14,000 according to the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers. Unofficial sources estimate a range from 25,000 to 50,000 dead or missing, mostly civilians in Chechnya.Chechnya War , Reuters, 11 April 2007 Historical basis of the conflict=Russian Empire= Chechnya and the Caucasus region Chechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. The Russian Terek Cossack Host was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks who were resettled from the Volga to the Terek River. In 1783, Russia and the Georgian kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, under which Kartl-Kakheti became a Russian protectorate. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the Caucasus War in 1817. Russian forces first moved into highland Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under General Baryatinsky broke down the highlanders' resistance. Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì78. =Soviet Union= Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chechens established a short-lived Caucasian Imamate which included parts of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus.Armstrong, Patrick. \\"Conflict in Chechnya: A Background Perspective.\\" Journal of Conflict Studies. November 1999; Evangelista, Matthew. The Chechen Wars: Will Russia Go the Way of the Soviet Union? Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 2003. ; Dunlop, John B.

Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2000. . The Chechen states were opposed by both sides of the Russian Civil War and most of the resistance was crushed by Bolshevik troops by 1922. Then, months before the creation of the Soviet Union, the Chechen Autonomous Oblast of the Russian SFSR was established. It annexed a part of territory of the former Terek Cossack Host. Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the Chechen‚ÄìIngush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936. In 1941, during World War II, a Chechen revolt broke out, led by Khasan Israilov. Chechens were accused by Joseph Stalin of aiding Nazi forces. In February 1944 Stalin deported all the Chechens and Ingush to the Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs. Up to a quarter of these people died during the \\"resettlement.\\"In one estimate, based on a report by Lavrenti Beria to Joseph Stalin, 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. . Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from NKVD records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001. . A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929‚Äì1953. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. . However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C. Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party. Edison, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006. Conquest, Robert. The Nation Killers. New York: Macmillan, 1970.

Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2005. . In 1957, after the death of Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev allowed the Chechens to return, and the Chechen republic was reinstated in 1958. Afterwards, the authority of the Soviet government gradually eroded. =First Chechen War= A Russian helicopter downed by Chechen militants near the capital Grozny, during the First Chechen War During the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chechnya declared independence. In 1992, Chechen and Ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint Chechen‚ÄìIngush republic in two, with Ingushetia joining the Russian Federation and Chechnya remaining independent. The debate over independence ultimately led to a small-scale civil war since 1992, in which the Russians covertly tried to oust the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev. The First Chechen War began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya to \\"restore constitutional order\\". Following nearly two years of brutal fighting, in which an estimated tens of thousands to more than 100,000 people died, and the 1996 Khasavyurt ceasefire agreement, the Russian troops were withdrawn from the republic.Campana, Aurelie.\\"The Effects of War on the Chechen National Identity Construction.\\"Article 8.2(2006):129‚Äì148 Prelude to the Second Chechen War=Chaos in Chechnya= Cadets of the Ichkeria Chechen National Guard, 1999 Following the first war, the government's grip on the chaotic republic was weak, especially outside the ruined capital Grozny. The areas controlled by separatist groups grew larger and the country became increasingly lawless. The war ravages and lack of economic opportunities left large numbers of heavily armed and brutalized former separatist fighters with no occupation but further violence. The authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev and Salman Raduyev. Abductions and raids into other parts of the Northern Caucasus by various Chechen warlords had been steadily increasing.Lajos F. Sz√°szdi, Russian Civil‚ÄìMilitary Relations and the Origins of the Second Chechen War, page 155, University Press of America, 2008. In place of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over $200 million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state.Tishkov, Valery. Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004. Page 114. It has been estimated that up to 1,300 people were kidnapped in Chechnya between 1996 and 1999, and in 1998 a group of four Western hostages were murdered. In 1998, a state of emergency was declared by the authorities in Grozny. Tensions led to open clashes like the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes in which some 50 people died in fighting between Chechen National Guard troops and the Islamist militias. =Russian‚ÄìChechen relations 1996‚Äì1999= Political tensions were fueled in part by allegedly Chechen or pro-Chechen terrorist and criminal activity in Russia, as well as by border clashes. On 16 November 1996, in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), a bomb destroyed an apartment building housing Russian border guards, killing 68 people. The cause of the blast was never determined, but many in Russia blamed Chechen separatists. Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Armavir (Krasnodar Krai), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Krai). On 22 December 1997, forces of Dagestani militants and Chechnya-based Arab warlord Ibn al-Khattab raided the base of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Army in Buynaksk, Dagestan, inflicting severe losses on the men and equipment of the unit. The 1997 election brought to power the separatist president Aslan Maskhadov. In 1998 and 1999, President Maskhadov survived several assassination attempts,Aslan Maskhadov - Telegraph, \\"Aslan Maskhadov.\\" The Telegraph. Telegraph Media Group, 9 March 2005. Web. Retrieved 7 May 2017. blamed on the Russian intelligence services. In March 1999, General Gennady Shpigun, the Kremlin's envoy to Chechnya, was kidnapped at the airport in Grozny and ultimately found dead in 2000 during the war. On 7 March 1999, in response to the abduction of General Shpigun, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin called for an invasion of Chechnya. However, Stepashin's plan was overridden by the prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Stepashin later said:from the Russian original of interview given by Stepashin: –í –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ß–µ—á–Ω–∏ –º–æ–≥—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–µ. –ü–ª–∞–Ω –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–π –≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—è —Å –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞. –ò –º—ã –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –≤—ã–π—Ç–∏ –∫ –¢–µ—Ä–µ–∫—É –≤ –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–µ-—Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä–µ. –¢–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–æ –±—ã, –¥–∞–∂–µ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±—ã –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –≤–∑—Ä—ã–≤–æ–≤ –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ. –Ø –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ –≤–µ–ª —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É –ø–æ —É–∫—Ä–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü —Å –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ–π, –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤—è—Å—å –∫ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–º—É –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é. –¢–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–ª. –û–± —ç—Ç–æ–º –≤—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å –µ–≥–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–≥–æ. –û–Ω –±—ã–ª –≤ —Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –§–°–ë –∏ –≤–ª–∞–¥–µ–ª –≤—Å–µ–π –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π. According to Robert Bruce Ware, these plans should be regarded as contingency plans. However, Stepashin did actively call for a military campaign against Chechen separatists in August 1999 when he was the prime minister of Russia. But shortly after his televised interview where he talked about plans to restore constitutional order in Chechnya, he was replaced in the PM's position by Vladimir Putin. In late May 1999, Russia announced that it was closing the Russian-Chechnya border in an attempt to combat attacks and criminal activity; border guards were ordered to shoot suspects on sight. On 18 June 1999, seven servicemen were killed when Russian border guard posts were attacked in Dagestan. On 29 July 1999, the Russian Interior Ministry troops destroyed a Chechen border post and captured an 800-meter section of strategic road. On 22 August 1999, 10 Russian policemen were killed by an anti-tank mine blast in North Ossetia, and, on 9 August 1999, six servicemen were kidnapped in the Ossetian capital Vladikavkaz. =Invasion of Dagestan= The Invasion of Dagestan was the trigger for the Second Chechen War. In August and September 1999, Shamil Basayev (in association with the Saudi-born Ibn al-Khattab, Commander of the Mujahedeen) led two armies of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab and international mujahideen and Wahhabist militants from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan. This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use of aerial-delivered fuel air explosives (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably in the village of Tando. By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages they had captured and pushed back into Chechnya. At least several hundred militants were killed in the fighting; the Federal side reported 275 servicemen killed and approximately 900 wounded. =Bombings in Russia= Before the wake of the Dagestani invasion had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow and in Volgodonsk) and in the Dagestani town of Buynaksk. On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers. Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total over 350 people were killed. A criminal investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. However, Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents were caught by local police for planting one of the bombs, but were later released on orders from Moscow. Many observers, including State Duma deputies Yuri Shchekochikhin, Sergei Kovalev and Sergei Yushenkov, cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including David Satter, Yury Felshtinsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya, which boosted the popularity of Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin, brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma in the 1999 parliamentary election, and secured Putin as president within a few months.The Age of Assassins.

Brookings Institution Press, 2002, , 1999‚Äì2000 Russian offensive=Air war= In late August and September 1999, Russia mounted a massive air campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan the previous month. On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya., CNN, 26 August 1999 The Russian air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees.Russia launches more air strikes against Chechnya , RT√â news, 27 September 1999 On 2 October 1999, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations admitted that 78,000 people had fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them went to Ingushetia, where they were arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day. As of 22 September 1999, Deputy Interior Minister Igor Zubov said that Russian troops had surrounded Chechnya and were prepared to retake the region, but the military planners were advising against a ground invasion because of the likelihood of heavy Russian casualties. =Land war= mass grave in Chechnya The Chechen conflict entered a new phase on 1 October 1999, when Russia's new Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate. At this time, Putin announced that Russian troops would initiate a land invasion but progress only as far as the Terek River, which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic. Putin's stated intention was to take control of Chechnya's northern plain and establish a cordon sanitaire against further Chechen aggression; he later recalled that the cordon alone was \\"pointless and technically impossible,\\" apparently because of Chechnya's rugged terrain. According to Russian accounts, Putin accelerated a plan for a major crackdown against Chechnya that had been drawn up months earlier.David Hoffman Miscalculations Paved Path to Chechen War Washington Post, 20 March 2000 The Russian army moved with ease in the wide open spaces of northern Chechnya and reached the Terek River on 5 October 1999. On this day, a bus filled with refugees was reportedly hit by a Russian tank shell, killing at least 11 civilians;Refugee bus reportedly shelled by Russian tank CNN, 7 October 1999 two days later, Russian Su-24 fighter bombers dropped cluster bombs on the village of Elistanzhi, killing some 35 people.Russian warplanes kill dozens of villagers The Independent, 11 October 1999 On 10 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords; the offer was rejected by the Russian side. He also appealed to NATO to help end fighting between his forces and Russian troops, without effect.Russia to 'display' truth on Chechnya , Reuters, 9 October 1999 On 12 October 1999, the Russian forces crossed the Terek and began a two-pronged advance on the capital Grozny to the south. Hoping to avoid the significant casualties that plagued the first Chechen War, the Russians advanced slowly and in force, making extensive use of artillery and air power in an attempt to soften Chechen defences. Many thousands of civilians fled the Russian advance, leaving Chechnya for neighbouring Russian republics. Their numbers were later estimated to reach 200,000 to 350,000, out of the approximately 800,000 residents of the Chechen Republic. The Russians appeared to be taking no chances with the Chechen population in its rear areas, setting up \\"filtration camps\\" in October in northern Chechnya for detaining suspected members of bandformirovaniya militant formations (literally: \\"bandit formations\\"). On 15 October 1999, Russian forces took control of a strategic ridge within artillery range of the Chechen capital Grozny after mounting an intense tank and artillery barrage against Chechen fighters. In response, President Maskhadov declared a gazavat (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. Martial law was declared in Ichkeria and reservists were called, but no martial law or state of emergency had been declared in Chechnya or Russia by the Russian government.CHAMBER JUDGMENTS IN SIX APPLICATIONS AGAINST RUSSIA European Court of Human Rights, 24 February 2005 The next day, Russian forces captured the strategic Tersky Heights, within sight of Grozny, dislodging 200 entrenched Chechen fighters. After heavy fighting, Russia seized the Chechen base in the village of Goragorsky, west of the city.Europe: Russians 'within sight' of Grozny BBC News, 16 October 1999 On 21 October 1999, a Russian Scud short- range ballistic missile strike on the central Grozny marketplace killed more than 140 people, including many women and children, and left hundreds more wounded. A Russian spokesman said the busy market was targeted because it was used by separatists as an arms bazaar.Phase Two ‚Äì The Ground Campaign ‚Äì October‚ÄìNovember 1999 Globalsecurity.org Eight days later Russian aircraft carried out a rocket attack on a large convoy of refugees heading into Ingushetia, killing at least 25 civilians including Red Cross workers and journalists. Two days later Russian forces conducted a heavy artillery and rocket attack on Samashki; some claimed that civilians were killed in Samashki in revenge for the heavy casualties suffered there by Russian forces during the first war. On 12 November 1999, the Russian flag was raised over Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes, when the local Chechen commanders, the Yamadayev brothers, defected to the federal side; the Russians also entered the bombed-out former Cossack village of Assinovskaya. The fighting in and around Kulary continued until January 2000. On 17 November 1999, Russian soldiers dislodged separatists in Bamut, the symbolic separatist stronghold in the first war; dozens of Chechen fighters and many civilians were reported killed, and the village was levelled in the FAE bombing. Two days later, after a failed attempt five days earlier, Russian forces managed to capture the village of Achkhoy-Martan. On 26 November 1999, Deputy Army Chief of Staff Valery Manilov said that phase two of the Chechnya campaign was just about complete, and a final third phase was about to begin. According to Manilov, the aim of the third phase was to destroy \\"bandit groups\\" in the mountains. A few days later Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russian forces might need up to three more months to complete their military campaign in Chechnya, while some generals said the offensive could be over by New Year's Day. The next day the Chechens briefly recaptured the town of Novogroznensky.Can Russia win the Chechen war? BBC News, 10 January 2000 On 1 December 1999, after weeks of heavy fighting, Russian forces under Major General Vladimir Shamanov took control of Alkhan-Yurt, a village just south of Grozny. The Chechen and foreign fighters inflicted heavy losses on the Russian forces, reportedly killing more than 70 Russian soldiers before retreating, suffering heavy losses of their own. On the same day, Chechen separatist forces began carrying out a series of counter-attacks against federal troops in several villages as well as in the outskirts of Gudermes. Chechen fighters in Argun, a small town five kilometres east of Grozny, put up some of the strongest resistance to federal troops since the start of Moscow's military offensive. The separatists in the town of Urus-Martan also offered fierce resistance, employing guerilla tactics Russia had been anxious to avoid; by 9 December 1999, Russian forces were still bombarding Urus-Martan, although Chechen commanders said their fighters had already pulled out. On 4 December 1999, the commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, General Viktor Kazantsev, claimed that Grozny was fully blockaded by Russian troops. The Russian military's next task was the seizure of the town of Shali, 20 kilometres south-east of the capital, one of the last remaining separatist- held towns apart from Grozny. Russian troops started by capturing two bridges that link Shali to the capital, and by 11 December 1999, Russian troops had encircled Shali and were slowly forcing separatists out. By mid-December the Russian military was concentrating attacks in southern parts of Chechnya and preparing to launch another offensive from Dagestan. =Siege of Grozny= A destroyed house in Grozny The Russian assault on Grozny began in early December, accompanied by a struggle for neighbouring settlements. The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000. According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny. The separatist forces also suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that 2,700 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny. The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the mine field at Alkhan-Kala. The siege and fighting devastated the capital like no other European city since World War II. In 2003 the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth. The Russians also suffered heavy losses as they advanced elsewhere, and from Chechen counterattacks and convoy ambushes. On 26 January 2000, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since October, more than double the 544 killed reported just 19 days earlier. =Battle for the mountains= Heavy fighting accompanied by massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, Vedeno and Shatoy, where fighting involving Russian paratroopers had raged since 1999. On 9 February 2000, a Russian tactical missile hit a crowd of people who had come to the local administration building in Shali, a town previously declared as one of the \\"safe areas\\", to collect their pensions. The attack was a response to a report that a group of fighters had entered the town. The missile is estimated to have killed some 150 civilians, and was followed by an attack by combat helicopters causing further casualties. Human Rights Watch called on the Russian military to stop using FAE, known in Russia as \\"vacuum bombs\\", in Chechnya, concerned about the large number of civilian casualties caused by what it called \\"widespread and often indiscriminate bombing and shelling by Russian forces\\". On 18 February 2000, a Russian army transport helicopter was shot down in the south, killing 15 men aboard, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo announced in a rare admission by Moscow of losses in the war. Zhani-Vedeno ambush, March 2000 On 29 February 2000, United Army Group commander Gennady Troshev said that \\"the counter- terrorism operation in Chechnya is over. It will take a couple of weeks longer to pick up splinter groups now.\\" Russia's Defense Minister, Marshal of the Russian Federation Igor Sergeyev, evaluated the numerical strength of the separatists at between 2,000 and 2,500 men, \\"scattered all over Chechnya.\\" On the same day, a Russian VDV paratroop company from Pskov was attacked by Chechen and Arab fighters near the village of Ulus-Kert in Chechnya's southern lowlands; at least 84 Russian soldiers were killed in the especially heavy fighting. The official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 659 separatists were killed, including 200 from the Middle East, figures which they said were based on radio-intercept data, intelligence reports, eyewitnesses, local residents and captured Chechens. On 2 March 2000, an OMON unit from Podolsk opened fire on a unit from Sergiyev Posad in Grozny; at least 24 Russian servicemen were killed in the incident. Fallen Russian soldiers in the Zhani-Vedeno ambush In March a large group of more than 1,000 Chechen fighters, led by field commander Ruslan Gelayev, pursued since their withdrawal from Grozny, entered the village of Komsomolskoye in the Chechen foothills and held off a full-scale Russian attack on the town for over two weeks; they suffered hundreds of casualties, while the Russians admitted to more than 50 killed. On 29 March 2000, about 23 Russian soldiers were killed in a separatist ambush on an OMON convoy from Perm in Zhani-Vedeno. On 23 April 2000, a 22-vehicle convoy carrying ammunition and other supplies to an airborne unit was ambushed near Serzhen-Yurt in the Vedeno Gorge by an estimated 80 to 100 \\"bandits\\", according to General Troshev. In the ensuing four-hour battle the federal side lost 15 government soldiers, according to the Russian defence minister. General Troshev told the press that the bodies of four separatist fighters were found. The Russian Airborne Troops headquarters later stated that 20 separatists were killed and two taken prisoner. Soon, the Russian forces seized the last populated centres of the organized resistance. (Another offensive against the remaining mountain strongholds was launched by Russian forces in December 2000.) =Restoration of federal government= Russian President Vladimir Putin established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000. The following month, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the pro-Moscow government. This development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm. On 23 March 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum. The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of autonomy, but still tied it firmly to Russia and Moscow's rule, and went into force on 2 April 2003. The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists; many citizens chose to boycott the ballot. Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast in 2004. Since December 2005, his son Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the pro-Moscow militia known as kadyrovtsy, has been functioning as the Chechnya's de facto ruler. Kadyrov has become Chechnya's most powerful leader and, in February 2007, with support from Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as president. Insurgency=Guerrilla war in Chechnya= :Guerrilla phase by year: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 Although large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established. Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles. The separatist units employed IEDs and sometimes combined for larger raids. Russian forces retaliated with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations. Most soldiers in Chechnya were kontraktniki (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts. While Russia continued to maintain a military presence within Chechnya, federal forces played less of a direct role. Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the kadyrovtsy, dominated law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who had defected since 1999. Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units, North and South (Sever and Yug). Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, East and West (Vostok and Zapad), were commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (Vostok) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (Zapad) and their men. On 16 April 2009, the head of the Federal Security Service, Alexander Bortnikov, announced that Russia had ended its \\"anti-terror operation\\" in Chechnya, claiming that stability had been restored to the territory. \\"The decision is aimed at creating the conditions for the future normalisation of the situation in the republic, its reconstruction and development of its socio-economic sphere,\\" Bortnikov stated. While Chechnya had largely stabilised, there were still clashes with militants in the nearby regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia. =Suicide attacks= Between June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added suicide attacks to their tactics. During this period, there were 23 Chechen-related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya, notably the hostage taking at an elementary school in Beslan, in which at least 334 people died. =Assassinations= Both sides of the war carried out multiple assassinations. The most prominent of these included the 13 February 2004 killing of exiled former separatist Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, and the 9 May 2004 killing of pro- Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov during a parade in Grozny. =Caucasus Front= While anti-Russian local insurgencies in the North Caucasus started even before the war, in May 2005, two months after Maskahdov's death, Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of \\"reforming the system of military‚Äìpolitical power.\\" Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush \\"sectors,\\" the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai-Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe jamaats were included. This meant that practically all the regions of Russia's south were involved in the hostilities. The Chechen separatist movement took on a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus.Beslan's unanswered questions, International Herald Tribune, 30 May 2006, Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continued in Dagestan, while sporadic fighting erupted in the other southern Russia regions, such as Ingushetia, and notably in Nalchik on 13 October 2005. Human rights and terrorism=Human rights and war crimes= Russian officials and Chechen separatists have regularly and repeatedly accused the opposing side of committing various war crimes including kidnapping, murder, hostage taking, looting, rape, and assorted other breaches of the laws of war. International and humanitarian organizations, including the Council of Europe and Amnesty International, have criticized both sides of the conflict for \\"blatant and sustained\\" violations of international humanitarian law. Western European rights groups estimate there have been about 5,000 forced disappearances in Chechnya since 1999. American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright noted in her 24 March 2000, speech to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights: :We cannot ignore the fact that thousands of Chechen civilians have died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners.... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.U.S. Response to Human Rights Commission Resolution on Chechnya U.S. Mission Geneva According to the 2001 annual report by Amnesty International: :There were frequent reports that Russian forces indiscriminately bombed and shelled civilian areas. Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, continued to be the target of military attacks by Russian forces. Hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war were extra judicially executed. Journalists and independent monitors continued to be refused access to Chechnya. According to reports, Chechen fighters frequently threatened, and in some cases killed, members of the Russian-appointed civilian administration and executed Russian captured soldiers.Russian Federation 2001 Report Amnesty International The Russian government failed to pursue any accountability process for human rights abuses committed during the course of the conflict in Chechnya. Unable to secure justice domestically, hundreds of victims of abuse have filed applications with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In March 2005 the court issued the first rulings on Chechnya, finding the Russian government guilty of violating the right to life and even the prohibition of torture with respect to civilians who had died or forcibly disappeared at the hands of Russia's federal troops.European Court Rules Against Moscow Institute for War and Peace Reporting, 2 March 2005M Many similar claims were ruled since against Russia. Dozens of mass graves containing hundreds of corpses have been uncovered since the beginning of the First Chechen War in 1994. As of June 2008, there were 57 registered locations of mass graves in Chechnya. According to Amnesty International, thousands may be buried in unmarked graves including up to 5,000 civilians who disappeared since the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999.Amnesty International Issues Reports on Disappearances , The Jamestown Foundation, 24 May 2007 In 2008, the largest mass grave found to date was uncovered in Grozny, containing some 800 bodies from the First Chechen War in 1995.Russia: Chechen Mass Grave Found , Agence France-Presse, 21 June 2008 Russia's general policy to the Chechen mass graves is to not exhume them.A vexing reminder of war in Chechnya's booming capital , International Herald Tribune, 29 April 2008 =Terrorist attacks= 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis Between May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly answering to Shamil Basayev, launched a campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia. About 200 people were killed in a series of bombings (most of them suicide attacks), most of them in the 2003 Stavropol train bombing (46), the 2004 Moscow metro bombing (40), and the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings (89). Two large-scale hostage takings, the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and the 2004 Beslan school siege, resulted in the deaths of multiple civilians. In the Moscow stand-off, FSB Spetsnaz forces stormed the building on the third day using an unknown incapacitating chemical agent that proved to be lethal without sufficient medical care, resulting in deaths of 133 out of 916 hostages. In Beslan, some 20 hostages had been executed by their captors before the assault, and the ill-prepared assault itself (started hastily after explosions in the gym that had been rigged with explosives by the terrorists) resulted in 294 more casualties among the 1128 hostages, as well as heavy losses among the special forces. Other issues=Pankisi crisis= Russian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia. In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating \\"criminal elements\\" as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism. Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control.Georgia says gorge 'under control' BBC News, 2 September 2002 In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed. On 8 October 2001, a UNOMIG helicopter was shot down in Georgia in Kodori Valley gorge near Abkhazia, amid fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians, killing nine including five UN observers.UN helicopter shot down in Georgia BBC News, 8 October 2001 Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, who was speculated to have been hired by the Georgian government to wage proxy war against separatist Abkhazia. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev was killed in a clash with Russian border guards while trying to get back from Dagestan into Georgia. =Unilateral ceasefire of 2005= On 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a ceasefire lasting until at least 22 February (the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen population). The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of goodwill. On 8 March 2005, Maskhadov was killed in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of Tolstoy-Yurt, northeast of Grozny. Shortly following Maskhadov's death, the Chechen separatist council announced that Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev had assumed the leadership, a move that was quickly endorsed by Shamil Basayev (Basayev himself died in July 2006). On 2 February 2006, Sadulayev made large- scale changes in his government, ordering all its members to move into Chechen territory. Among other things, he removed First Vice-Premier Akhmed Zakayev from his post (although later Zakayev was appointed a Foreign Minister–£–∫–∞–∑—ã –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –ß–†–ò –ê-–•. –°–∞–¥—É–ª–∞–µ–≤–∞, Chechenpress, 27.05.06 ). Sadulayev was killed in June 2006, after which he was succeeded as the separatist leader by the veteran terrorist commander Doku Umarov. =Amnesties= As of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war. The first one was announced in 1999 when about 400 Chechen switched sides. (However, according to Putin's advisor and aide Aslambek Aslakhanov most of them were since killed, both by their former comrades and by the Russians, who by then perceived them as a potential \\"fifth column\\".\\"–£–±–∏–≤–∞–ª ‚Äì –Ω–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–ª, –ø–æ–ø–∞–ª ‚Äì –Ω–µ –ø–æ–ø–∞–ª\\", Kommersant, 07.08.2006) Some of the other amnesties included one during September 2003 in connection with the adoption of the republic's new constitution, and then another between mid-2006 and January 2007. According to Ramzan Kadyrov, himself former separatist, more than 7,000 separatist fighters defected to the federal side (\\"returned to the peaceful life\\") by 2005. In 2006 more than 600 militants in Chechnya and adjacent provinces reportedly surrendered their arms in response to a six-month amnesty \\"for those not involved in any serious crimes\\".Law enforcers killed 72 militants in Chechnya in 2007 , RIA Novosti, 16/ 01/ 2008 In 2007, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights published a report entitled Amnestied People as Targets for Persecution in Chechnya, which documents the fate of several persons who have been amnestied and subsequently abducted, tortured and killed. =Government censorship of the media coverage= The first war, with its extensive and largely unrestricted coverage (despite deaths of many journalists), convinced the Kremlin more than any other event that it needed to control national television channels, which most Russians rely on for news, to successfully undertake any major national policy. By the time the second war began, federal authorities had designed and introduced a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage.Smokescreen Around Chechnya The Moscow Times, 18 March 2005 The Russian government's control of all Russian television stations and its use of repressive rules, harassment, censorship, intimidationRussian TV accuses military of censorship , BBC News, 23 January 2000 and attacks on journalists almost completely deprived the Russian public of the independent information on the conflict. Practically all the local Chechen media are under total control of the pro-Moscow government, Russian journalists in Chechnya face intense harassment and obstruction leading to widespread self-censorship, while foreign journalists and media outlets too are pressured into censoring their reports on the conflict.Silencing Chechnya Moscow Times, 27 January 2005 In some cases Russian journalists reporting on Chechnya were jailed (Boris Stomakhin) or kidnapped (Andrei Babitsky), and foreign media outlets (American Broadcasting Company) banned from Russia. Russia's step came in retaliation for ABC's broadcast of an interview with Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel leader who ordered and/or carried out some of the worst terrorist acts in the country's history, including the school siege in Beslan that left 330 people dead.Russia Bars ABC News for Interview With Separatist, The New York Times, 2 August 2005 The Russian-Chechen Friendship Society was shut down on \\"extremism and national hatred\\" charges. According to a 2007 poll only 11 percent of Russians said they were happy with media coverage of Chechnya. Effects=Civilian losses= A Russian soldier stands on a mass grave of Chechens in Komsomolskoye, 2000 In the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed. Civilian casualty estimates vary widely. According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000‚Äì40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians;Chechen official puts death toll for 2 wars at up to 160,000 International Herald Tribune, 16 August 2005Russia: Chechen Official Puts War Death Toll At 160,000 RFE/RL, 16 August 2005 while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts.Death Toll Put at 160,000 in Chechnya The Moscow Times, 16 August 2005 As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified. According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999.Chechnya war , Reuters AlertNet, 11 April 2007 According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing.Amnesty International Issues Reports on Disappearances Jamestown Foundation, 24 May 2007 However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians. =Environmental damage= Environmental agencies warn that the Russian republic of Chechnya, devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster. A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an \\"environmental wasteland.\\" There is a special concern over widespread oil spills and pollution from sewers damaged by war (the water is polluted to a depth of 250 mChechen Republic // GENERAL INFORMATION , Kommersant, 10 March 2004), and chemical and radioactive pollution, as a result of the bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict. Chechnya's wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground.Military operations greatly alter Chechen mountain life , Prague Watchdog, 4 May 2003 In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a \\"zone of ecological disaster\\" and another 40% \\"a zone of extreme environmental distress\\".'In the Caucasus, you can buy anything' , Al-Ahram Weekly, 2004 =Land mines= Chechnya is the most land mine-affected region worldwide.Chechnya: Land Mines Seen As Continuing Scourge RFE/RL, 19 October 2004 Since 1994 there have been widespread use of mines, by both sides (Russia is a party to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices). The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continue to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic.Chechnya , LM Report 2004, 8 February 2005 No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted by Russia in December 1999. In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region. UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003. =Military losses= Military casualty figures from both sides are impossible to verify and are generally believed to be higher. In September 2000, the National Endowment for Democracy compiled the list of casualties officially announced in the first year of the conflict, which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide a minimum insight in the information war. According to the figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defence on in August 2005, at least 1,250 Russian Armed Forces soldiers have been killed in action 1999‚Äì2005. This death toll did not include losses of Internal Troops, the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, of whom all at least 1,720 were killed by October 2003.Civil and military casualties of the wars in Chechnya Russian-Chechen Friendship Society The independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia for instance estimated about 2,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003. =Political radicalization of the separatist movement= The Chechens had become increasingly radicalized. Former Soviet Armed Forces officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov have been succeeded by people who rely more on Islamist, rather than the secular nationalistic feelings of the population. While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups. In April 2006, asked whether negotiations with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander Doku Umarov answered: \\"We offered them many times. But it turned out that we constantly press for negotiations and it's as if we are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more.\\" In the same month, the new separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: \\"Today, we have a different task on our hands ‚Äì total war, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia.\\" Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist \\"North Caucasian Emirate\\". Flag of the Caucasian Emirate This trend ultimately resulted in the October 2007 declaration of Caucasus Emirate by Doku Umarov where he also urged for a global Jihad, and the political schism between the moderates and the radical Islamists fighting in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions with ties in the Middle East.The battle for the soul of Chechnya , The Guardian, 22 November 2007 Some commanders, still fighting along with Doku Umarov, like Anzor Astemirov, have publicly denounced the idea of a global Jihad, but keep fighting for the independence of Caucasus states. The struggle has garnered support from Muslim sympathizers around the world nonetheless, and some of them have been willing to take up arms. Many commentators think it is likely that Chechen fighters have links with international Islamist separatist groups. The BBC said in an online Q&A; on the conflict: \\"It has been known for years that Muslim volunteers have traveled to Chechnya to join the fight, reportedly after attending training camps in Afghanistan or Pakistan.\\" Projecting back from the post-9/11 period, some have linked Chechen resistance to Russia to the al-Qaida global jihad movement. However, the number of foreign jihad fighters in Chechnya was at most in the hundreds. Graeme Gill, Professor Department of Government Graeme Gill, James Young. 2013. , page 239 Most Western observers prior to September 11th regarded the alleged al-Qaida links claimed by Russian government with skepticism. The Clinton and Bush administrations, as well as other NATO governments, uniformly dismissed Moscow's rhetoric concerning the existence of Chechens in Afghanistan and Afghans in Chechnya as Soviet-style \\"agitprop\\" (agitation-propaganda) until September 11th occurred. Islamic radicalisation process has also affected on Chechen separatist movement's support abroad. In 2013, the Tsarnaev brothers launched a suicide attack in Boston in claim of jihad, accusing the United States for killing Muslims of Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, weakened sympathy for Chechen resistance from Russia globally and increased xenophobia against Chechens and Muslims in the United States. Rampant Islamic terrorism in Europe and the exclusive role of the Chechens on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, most notably Abu Omar al-Shishani, also dragged Chechen separatist movement in jeopardy due to increasing anti- Islamic sentiment on the rise in Europe, even in some of the most Russophobic countries in Europe like Poland. =Impact on the Chechen population= According to a 2006 report by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, \\"the majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty.\\" A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from \\"discernible symptoms of psychological distress\\".[MSF Activity Reports on The Russian Federation: 2006 ], Doctors Without Borders As of 2008, the infant mortality rate stood at 17 per 1,000, the highest in Russia;Russian demographic statistics 2008 Rosstat Retrieved on Oct-05-2009 There are reports of growing a number of genetic disorders in babies and unexplained illnesses among school children.Chechnya habitat 'ravaged by war' , BBC News, 22 June 2006 One child in 10 is born with some kind of anomaly that requires treatment.

However ongoing reconstruction efforts have been rebuilding the region at a quick pace over the past few years, including new housing, facilities, paved roads and traffic lights, a new mosque, and restoration of electricity to much of the region. Governmental, social and commercial life remain hobbled by bribery, kidnapping, extortion and other criminal activity; reports by the Russian government estimate that the organized crime sector is twice the Russian average and the government is widely perceived to be corrupt and unresponsive.The Crisis in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus at a Glance , IRC, 31 January 2006 Hundreds of thousands of Chechens were displaced by the conflict, including 300,000 at the height of the conflict in 2000. Most of them were displaced internally in Chechnya and in neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, but thousands of refugees also went into exile, with, as of 2008, most of them residing in the European Union countries. =Impact on the Russian population= The start of the war bolstered the domestic popularity of Vladimir Putin as the campaign was started one month after he had become Russian prime minister.POLL FINDS A PLURALITY OF RUSSIANS DISTRUST RAMZAN The Jamestown Foundation, 27 March 2007 The conflict greatly contributed to the deep changes in the Russian politics and society.The warlord and the spook The Economist, 31 March 2007 Since the Chechen conflict began in 1994, cases of young veterans returning embittered and traumatized to their home towns have been reported all across Russia. Psychiatrists, law-enforcement officials, and journalists have started calling the condition of psychologically scarred soldiers \\"Chechen syndrome\\" (CS), drawing a parallel with the post-traumatic stress disorders suffered by Soviet soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. According to Yuri Alexandrovsky, deputy director of the Moscow Serbsky Institute in 2003, at least 70% of the estimated 1.5 million Chechnya veterans suffered CS.Chechnya's Walking Wounded Time (magazine)/CNN, 28 September 2003 Many of the veterans came back alcoholic, unemployable and antisocial.

According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that have been to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% of respondents said they didn't trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence.For Russians, Police Rampage Fuels Fear Washington Post, 27 March 2005Russia: Police Brutality Shows Traces Of Chechnya RFE/RL, 20 June 2005 According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now endemic. Since 2007, police officers from outside Caucasus are now not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region's republics. The wars in Chechnya, and the associated Caucasian terrorism in Russia, were a major factor in the growth of intolerance, xenophobia, and racist violence in Russia, directed in a great part against the people from Caucasus. The Russian authorities were unlikely to label random attacks on people of non-Russian ethnicity as racist, preferring calling it \\"hooliganism\\". The number of murders officially classified as racist more than doubled in Russia between 2003 and 2004. The violence included acts of terrorism such as the 2006 Moscow market bombing which killed 13 people.Political turmoil erupts again in deadly protests IHT, 2 November 2005Migrants flee town after racial violence People's Daily, 14 September 2006 In 2007, 18-year-old Artur Ryno claimed responsibility for 37 racially motivated murders in the course of one year, saying that \\"since school [he] hated people from the Caucasus.\\"Teenager Admits to Over 30 Murders The Moscow Times, 29 May 2007 On 5 June 2007, an anti- Chechen riot involving hundreds of people took place in the town of Stavropol in southern Russia.

The event revived memories of a recent clash between Chechens and local Russians in Kondopoga over an unpaid bill, when two Russians were killed.Nationalists rally in Russian town near Chechnya Reuters, 5 June 2007 The Caucasians also face ethnic-related violence in the ranks of Russian Army.Racist Violence Plagues Russian Army IWPR, 15-Sep-00 Status In 2005, there were about 60,000 Federal troops in Chechnya, but that number has since decreased significantly. Tony Wood, a journalist and author who has written extensively about Chechnya, estimated there were about 8,000 local security forces remaining in the region . Independent analysts say there are no more than 2,000 armed terrorists combatants still fighting, while Russia says only a few hundred remain. There is still some sporadic fighting in the mountains and south of the republic, but Russia has scaled down its presence significantly leaving the local government to stabilize things further. In February 2008 the President of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov, spoke of \\"thousands of fighters\\" when he addressed a speech to all his fighters in the mountains. Akhmad Kadyrov, formerly a leading separatist mufti, had switched sides in 2000 Most of the more prominent past Chechen separatist leaders have died or have been killed, including former president Aslan Maskhadov and leading warlord and terrorist attack mastermind Shamil Basayev. Meanwhile, the fortunes of the Chechen independence movement sagged, plagued by the internal disunity between Chechen moderates and Islamist radicals and the changing global political climate after 11 September 2001, as well as the general war-weariness of the Chechen population. Large- scale fighting has been replaced by guerrilla warfare and bombings targeting federal troops and forces of the regional government, with the violence often spilling over into adjacent regions. Since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of Chechnya proper and into the nearby Russian territories, such as Ingushetia and Dagestan; the Russian government, for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the North Caucasus. Throughout the years Russian officials have often announced that the war is over. In April 2002, President Vladimir Putin's declared that the war in Chechnya was over. The Russian government maintains the conflict officially ended in April 2002, and since then has continued largely as a peacekeeping operation. In a 10 July 2006, interview with the BBC, Sergei Ivanov, Russia's then‚Äìprime minister and former minister of defense, said that \\"the war is over,\\" and that \\"the military campaign lasted only 2 years.\\" Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov Ramzan Kadyrov, the current president of the Chechnya, has also stated the war is over. Others believe the war ended in 2003 with the passage of a Moscow-backed constitutional referendum and the election of pro-Moscow president Akhmad Kadyrov, while some consider the conflict on-going. Some independent observers, including √Ålvaro Gil-Robles, the human rights envoy for the Council of Europe, and Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have said that the war has largely concluded as of 2006. The separatists deny that the war is over, and guerrilla warfare continues throughout the North Caucasus. Colonel Sulim Yamadayev, Chechnya's second most powerful loyalist warlord after Kadyrov, also denied that the war is over. In March 2007, Yamadayev claimed there were well over 1,000 separatists and foreign Islamic militants entrenched in the mountains of Chechnya alone: \\"The war is not over, the war is far from being over. What we are facing now is basically a classic partisan war and my prognosis is that it will last two, three, maybe even five more years.\\" According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating \\"while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues.\\" The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists. An estimation, based on the war reports, shows that in the past three years Federal casualties are higher than the number of coalition casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent). With the abolition of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the proclamation of the Caucasus Emirate by the president of the separatist movement Dokka Umarov, the conflict in Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus is often referred to as the \\"War in the North Caucasus\\". The Russian government has given no new name to the conflict while most international observers still refer to it as a continuation of the Second Chechen War.Articles ‚Äì Containing Russia .

The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot. Zone refining was invented by John Desmond Bernal and further developed by William Gardner Pfann in Bell Labs as a method to prepare high purity materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors. Its first commercial use was in germanium, refined to one atom of impurity per ten billion,‚ÄùZone melting‚Äù, entry in The World Book Encyclopedia, Volume 21, W-X- Y-Z, 1973, page 501. but the process can be extended to virtually any solute- solvent system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid phases at equilibrium.Float Zone Crystal Growth This process is also known as the float zone process, particularly in semiconductor materials processing. A diagram of the vertical zone refining process used to grow single-crystal ice from an initially polycrystalline material. The convection in the melt is a result of water's density maximum at 4 ¬∞C. Silicon crystal in the beginning of the growth process Growing silicon crystal 5N) tantalum single crystal, made by the floating-zone process (cylindrical object in the center) Process details The principle is that the segregation coefficient k (the ratio of an impurity in the solid phase to that in the liquid phase) is usually less than one. Therefore, at the solid/liquid boundary, the impurity atoms will diffuse to the liquid region. Thus, by passing a crystal boule through a thin section of furnace very slowly, such that only a small region of the boule is molten at any time, the impurities will be segregated at the end of the crystal. Because of the lack of impurities in the leftover regions which solidify, the boule can grow as a perfect single crystal if a seed crystal is placed at the base to initiate a chosen direction of crystal growth. When high purity is required, such as in semiconductor industry, the impure end of the boule is cut off, and the refining is repeated. In zone refining, solutes are segregated at one end of the ingot in order to purify the remainder, or to concentrate the impurities. In zone leveling, the objective is to distribute solute evenly throughout the purified material, which may be sought in the form of a single crystal. For example, in the preparation of a transistor or diode semiconductor, an ingot of germanium is first purified by zone refining. Then a small amount of antimony is placed in the molten zone, which is passed through the pure germanium. With the proper choice of rate of heating and other variables, the antimony can be spread evenly through the germanium. This technique is also used for the preparation of silicon for use in computer chips. =Heaters= A variety of heaters can be used for zone melting, with their most important characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly and uniformly through the ingot. Induction coils, ring-wound resistance heaters, or gas flames are common methods. Another method is to pass an electric current directly through the ingot while it is in a magnetic field, with the resulting magnetomotive force carefully set to be just equal to the weight in order to hold the liquid suspended. Optical heaters using high powered halogen or xenon lamps are used extensively in research facilities particularly for the production of insulators, but their use in industry is limited by the relatively low power of the lamps, which limits the size of crystals produced by this method. Zone melting can be done as a batch process, or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually added at one end and purer material being removed from the other, with impure zone melt being removed at whatever rate is dictated by the impurity of the feed stock. Indirect-heating floating zone methods use an induction-heated tungsten ring to heat the ingot radiatively, and are useful when the ingot is of a high-resistivity semiconductor on which classical induction heating is ineffective. =Mathematical expression of impurity concentration= When the liquid zone moves by a distance dx, the number of impurities in the liquid change. Impurities are incorporated in the melting liquid and freezing solid.James D. Plummer, Michael D. Deal, and Peter B.

The bulk charge carrier lifetime in float-zone silicon is the highest among various manufacturing processes. Float-zone carrier lifetimes are around 1000 microseconds compared to 20-200 microseconds with Czochralski process, and 1‚Äì30 microseconds with cast polycrystalline silicon. A longer bulk lifetime increases the efficiency of solar cells significantly. Related processes=Zone remelting= Another related process is zone remelting, in which two solutes are distributed through a pure metal. This is important in the manufacture of semiconductors, where two solutes of opposite conductivity type are used. For example, in germanium, pentavalent elements of group V such as antimony and arsenic produce negative (n-type) conduction and the trivalent elements of group III such as aluminum and boron produce positive (p-type) conduction. By melting a portion of such an ingot and slowly refreezing it, solutes in the molten region become distributed to form the desired n-p and p-n junctions.

It may also refer to Northern Catalonia () or French Catalonia, the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees) save Fenouill√®des. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it. History Its name is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day Perpignan where Gaulish chieftains met to consider Hannibal's request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of Septimania to the Visigoth Theodoric II. His successor, Amalaric, on his defeat by Childebert I in 531, retired to Hispania, leaving a governor in Septimania. In 719, the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by Pepin the Short, who went on to occupy Roussillon after conquering Narbonne. Roussillon was occupied by the Carolingians in 760. Upon the invasion of Hispania in 778, Charlemagne found the Marca Hispanica wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from Moorish Hispania and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count Guillaume of Toulouse ‚Äì regent of the child Louis the Pious, King of Aquitaine ‚Äì whose hegemony extended into Catalonia. The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into Allodial fiefs and, in 893, Sunyer II became the first hereditary count of Roussillon. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the Cerdanya (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by Mir√≥ as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or Besal√∫. The counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the counts of Emp√∫ries in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count Girard I participated in the First Crusade in the following of Raymond IV of Toulouse, and was one of the first to set foot in Jerusalem when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the Counts of Barcelona began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them. In 1111, Ramon Berenguer III, count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besal√∫, to which was added in 1117 Cerdanya. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, Girard II, was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to Alfonso II of Aragon, who took possession in 1172. Under the Aragonese monarchs, economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and Collioure (), the port of Perpignan, became an important locus of Mediterranean trade. As the French and Spanish crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), Louis IX of France formally surrendered sovereignty over Roussillon and his claim to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality. James I of Aragon had wrested the Balearic Isles from the Moors and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the Kingdom of Majorca, with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became James II. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother Peter III were exploited by Philip III of France in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the Two Sicilies. Philip III espoused James II's cause and led an army into Aragon but, retreating, died at Perpignan in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son San√ß I, or Sancho I, who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, James III of Majorca, refused to do homage to Philip VI of France for the seigneury of Montpellier, and applied to Peter IV of Aragon for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized Majorca and Roussillon in 1344. The province was now reunited to the Crown of Aragon, and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between John II of Aragon and his son over the Crown of Navarre spurred Louis XI of France to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when Charles VIII evacuated the region as part of a settlement with the Catholic Monarchs (Isabel I of the Crown of Castile and Ferdinand II of the Crown of Aragon, who were second cousins and members of the Trastamara dynasty that ruled over the two Crowns). During a subsequent war between France and the Trastamara dynasty (1496‚Äì1498), the people suffered equally from the Castilian garrisons and the French invaders. The Habsburg dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs. The dislike caused by the Castilians during the Trastamara rule was effaced in the pride of sharing the glory of the Emperor Charles I of Spain. When Perpignan was besieged by the forces of Henry, Dauphin of France in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of \\"Fedelissima\\" (\\"Most Faithful City\\"). When the Catalans rose against the Spanish Crown in 1641, Louis XIII of France entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) secured Roussillon and part of the Cerdanya (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon. The next fifty years saw a concerted effort by Louis XIV both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity. He was successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of Perpignan, Roussillon remained distinctly Catalan in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French. During the French Revolution, the Ancien R√©gime province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the comarca of Fenouill√®des. Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French r√©gion of Languedoc- Roussillon.

He is the son of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Over the course of his career, he has been a member of the bands Cibo Matto, the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, the Claypool Lennon Delirium and his parents' group the Plastic Ono Band. He has released two solo albums: Into the Sun (1998) and Friendly Fire (2006). He has produced numerous albums for various artists, including Black Lips, and the Plastic Ono Band. Early life and education Sean Lennon was born at New York‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital in New York City on October 9, 1975, his father's 35th birthday. He is of Japanese descent on his mother's side and English, Welsh and Irish descent on his father's side. Julian Lennon is his half-brother. Elton John is his godfather. After Sean's birth, John Lennon became a house husband, caring for his young son until his murder on December 8, 1980. Sean attended kindergarten in Tokyo and, at his request, was educated at the exclusive private boarding school Institut Le Rosey in Rolle, Switzerland, and earlier at New York's private Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Dalton School. He attended Columbia University for three semesters, majoring in anthropology before dropping out to focus on his music and tour with his mother. In January 1984, when Steve Jobs was visiting Manhattan, he attended a party that Sean's mother (Yoko Ono) was throwing for Lennon and Jobs gave him one of the first Macintosh computers. That same year, he sang \\"It's Alright\\" on the Ono tribute album \\"Every Man Has A Woman\\" for his mother. His parents kick-started his musical career: his debut into the music world came at age five, when he recited a story on his mother's 1981 album, Season of Glass. From childhood into his teen years, Lennon continued to collaborate with his mother, contributing vocals and receiving production credit on her solo albums It's Alright, Starpeace and Onobox. At 16 Lennon co- wrote the song \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" with Lenny Kravitz for his 1991 album Mama Said, and worked with Kravitz on a cover of his father's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" in protest of the Gulf War. By 1995 Lennon had formed the band IMA (with Sam Koppelman and Timo Ellis) to play alongside his mother on her album Rising. Lennon also made appearances in film, featured in the cast of Michael Jackson's 1988 Moonwalker and portraying a teenager experiencing visions of various M. C. Escher prints in Sony's 1990 promotional short-film Infinite Escher. Lennon holds dual citizenship with the United States and United Kingdom. Professional career=Performance= Lennon at a Free Tibet event in 1998 In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto were invited by Ono to remix the song \\"Talking to the Universe\\" for a Rising remix EP Rising Mixes. They met Lennon and invited him to join them on tour as a bass player. This eventually led to Lennon's contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming a member of the group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP Super Relax. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Lennon has said: > I think I found the only label on the planet who doesn't care who my parents > are and what my name is. It's a good feeling to know that I wouldn't have > gotten the offer if they wouldn't have liked my songs. That's pretty rare in > the music business! Lennon's solo debut Into the Sun, was released in 1998. A music video for \\"Home\\", a single from the album, was directed by Spike Jonze and enjoyed extended airplay on MTV. The album was produced by fellow Cibo Matto member Yuka Honda, who Lennon claimed was his inspiration for the album, who he had begun dating at the time. He went on to tour (often backed by Cibo Matto) supporting Into the Sun. During this period he appeared on radio programs such as The Howard Stern Show and KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. He later recalled promoting the album as a bitter experience due to the media focus on his family rather than his own music. In 1999, Lennon's EP Half Horse, Half Musician was released featuring new tracks such as \\"Heart & Lung\\" and \\"Happiness\\" as well as remixes of songs from Into the Sun. Along with Half Horse Half Musician, 1999 saw the release of Cibo Matto's second album Stereo ‚òÖ Type A. Lennon stepped out of his traditional role as the group's bass player, this time playing a much wider range of instruments (such as drums, guitars and synthesizers). Despite being well received, Stereo ‚òÖ Type A was followed by an extended Cibo Matto hiatus. In 2000, Lennon contributed vocals to Del tha Funkee Homosapien (a single stanza on the Deltron 3030 track 'Memory Loss'), Handsome Boy Modeling School and Jurassic 5. In 2001 on national television, Lennon performed several classics by the Beatles, \\"This Boy\\", \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"Julia\\" alongside Robert Schwartzman, Rufus Wainwright and Moby for Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music. In the following years Lennon faded out of the spotlight to focus more on his role as a producer. Lennon performing April 29, 2007 After the folding of Grand Royal Records in 2001, Lennon signed with Capitol Records, yet no solo material surfaced until February 2006, when \\"Dead Meat\\" was released as the first single from his new album, Friendly Fire. A promotional trailer for the CD/DVD package of Friendly Fire was leaked online in early 2006. The trailer featured scenes from the film version of the album, a DVD of music videos comprised into a film. The videos were actually screen tests for Coin Locker Babies, another project on which Lennon is working which became a cinematic counterpart to his new album. Friendly Fire was released in October 2006. The theme of the album is love and betrayal, and it is dedicated to the memory of a close friend who died. The night the album was released, Lennon made his first major television appearance in five years, performing \\"Dead Meat\\" live on the Late Show with David Letterman. Lennon has since appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Sharon Osbourne Show. When questioned about the eight-year gap between solo albums in interviews, Lennon said that he did not feel like a solo artist during those years and that he wanted to experience music anonymously without the spotlight on him and his girlfriend. Since the release of Friendly Fire, Lennon has toured extensively around the world and while in France, he remixed his song \\"Parachute\\" in collaboration with French artist -M-. The remix is titled \\"L'√©clipse\\" and was featured as a bonus track on the French release of Friendly Fire, while the single \\"Dead Meat\\" was featured in an episode of the TV drama True Blood. With the release of new material and subsequent touring Lennon launched a website featuring music, videos and a forum for his fans. Various members of the forum have created a fan-made cover album titled Truth Mask Replica. Muhl and Lennon premiered the band the Ghost of a Saber Tooth TigerThe Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger .

Lennon has also collaborated with Muhl with a group called \\"Kemp and Eden\\" who premiered at The Living Room in the spring of 2012. On April 29, 2014, the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger released their most successful album to date, titled \\"Midnight Sun\\". The album was selected as one of the Top 50 best albums of 2014 by Rolling Stone. The album's release was followed by tours with the Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, Beck, Florence and the Machine, Dinosaur Jr., and Primus. At the end of 2018, Lennon collaborated with Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson for a cover of Yoko Ono and John Lennon's original Christmas song \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over).\\" The trio additionally performed the song at the Winter finale of Saturday Night Live. In 2015, Lennon formed the Claypool Lennon Delirium with Primus' lead vocalist and bassist Les Claypool. The following year, the new group released their debut LP \\"Monolith of Phobos\\", which reached the Top 10 of three Billboard charts, followed by a covers EP titled \\"Lime and Limpid Green\\" in 2017. Their second LP, \\"South of Reality\\", was released on February 22, 2019. =Production and other contributions= While reestablishing himself as a solo artist, Lennon continued his work as a session musician and producer, lending his talent to the likes of Dopo Yume, Albert Hammond, Jr. (of the Strokes) and model/singer Irina LƒÉzƒÉreanu., The New York Observer Lennon first appeared on the Soulfly album Primitive, released in 2000, while in October 2007, Lennon joined Mark Ronson in the BBC Electric Proms where he sang \\"Sail on, Sailor\\", as well as \\"We Can Work It Out\\" alongside Daniel Merriweather, and Tawiah. The year prior, he wrote and directed his first film, Friendly Fire, starring Carrie Fisher, Lindsay Lohan and others. His eponymous second studio LP served as the movie's soundtrack as well. In 2009 Lennon produced a second album for his mother on his record label Chimera Music, \\"Between My Head and the Sky,\\" by Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band. Lennon further worked with Ono as a producer for John Malkovich's 2016 remix EP \\"Illuminated\\". Lennon co-produced Fat White Family's 2016 LP \\"Songs for Our Mothers, which was recorded in his New York City recording studio. Lennon also lent his production and songwriting talents to Lana Del Rey's Grammy-nominated fourth studio album Lust For Life, where he featured on the track \\"Tomorrow Never Came.\\" Lennon entered the field of film scores in 2009 with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead, directed by long- time friend and school mate Jordan Galland.Goldstein, Greg. ‚ÄúLennon to Score Undead‚Äù, Hollywood Reporter, February 21, 2008. Lennon again collaborated with Galland as he contributed the score to the 2012 film Alter Egos, and appeared as the character \\"Electric Death.\\" The soundtrack premiered on Rolling Stone's website following the film's release. In 2014, Lennon contributed the song \\"Animals\\" for the Zombeavers' soundtrack, while he additionally wrote and recorded \\"Heart Grenade\\" for the Japanese TV series Ghost in the Shell: Arise. Lennon also created the film score for the 2015 comedy horror film Ava's Possessions, a project which took over two years to create. The lead single from the soundtrack \\"Demon Daughter\\" premiered alongside the movie's DVD release. Along with girlfriend Charlotte Kemp Muhl, Lennon started a record label, Chimera Music, which has signed a number of his collaborators including the Moonlandingz, Cibo Matto and Yoko Ono.  Activism and beliefs  From 1996 to 1999, Lennon performed in and was involved in organizing the Tibetan Freedom Concerts with the Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch. The series advocated for the independence of Tibet from China. On October 19, 2011, Lennon was asked by Josh Sigurdson over Twitter what his opinion on the Occupy Wall Street protests was. He replied: \\"I'm heading down there this weekend,\\" as he did. On October 22, 2011, Lennon showed up on Wall Street with Rufus Wainwright and Josh Fox. The three played music throughout the day to protesters and others joined in. Lennon has not yet spoken to the media or press about the event. On August 28, 2012, Lennon's opposition to hydraulic fracking was published as an editorial, \\"Destroying Precious Land for Gas,\\" by The New York Times. Of Artists Against Fracking, in 2014 he said, > we can make more people aware of the damage fracking poses to our water > supply, global warming, and climate change. Methane is 100 times more > powerful of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and most people don't > realize how climate change will be triggered by a globalized fracking > industry. Two days later on August 30, 2012, Lennon unveiled \\"Artists Against Fracking\\", a campaign aimed at preventing the expansion of fracking in the United States. Over 200 artists have signed onto the initiative, including Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, as well as Beatles' members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. Asked by the Dallas Observer for his view of religion and spirituality, Lennon said, > I'm not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society > and it can be helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is > mythology. ... I do think we all have a spirit, and I think there's a lot > more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. But I prefer > looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously > logical. On October 16, 2013 Lennon, along with Spacehog and Liv Tyler, played \\"Live on Earth\\" ‚Äì an Internet-only performance ‚Äì to benefit the David Lynch Foundation which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation. Of his own practice of Transcendental Meditation, in 2014 Lennon said: \\"for me, it's like a scientific method to calm my brain down and making my frontal lobe more active. It's an exercise, really. It helps me to have about 10 percent more conscious thinking.\\" Lennon once described himself as a pacifist and anarchist; on February 6, 2016, he tweeted, \\"AnCap is the only logical result of the non aggression [principle]. I am a pacifist so therefore an anarchist.\\" Personal life Lennon is in a relationship with Charlotte Kemp Muhl, whom he met at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2005. Lennon, 29 at the time, thought she was too young at 17. They remained friends before falling in love. In an interview, Lennon states he stumbled upon Muhl's musical talents over a year after they had started dating, and formed The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger around 2008 . Since, Muhl and Lennon are involved in a number of musical endeavours, and much of their work is written at their home-based studio in Greenwich Village.

It is a variant of German Rummy dating to the early 20th century.Carlisle, Rodney P (editor). Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society, Volume 1 Thousand Oaks: Sage (2009), p. 615. Being derived from normal rummy, it emphasises arrangement of cards based on card matching rules (generally simplified, but thereby no less challenging), while abandoning the notions of card discards and scoring entirely.  Description  In Robbers' Rummy, not only are players allowed to lay off to existing melds as in basic Rummy, but they may also completely recombine the cards contained in the melds. In other words, players may 'rob' cards from already-made melds to make new ones. This makes it \\"much more exciting and engaging than any other [Rummy] variant...\\".How to Play Robbers Rummy? at www.rummymania.com. Retrieved 2 Jul 2018. Danyliuk describes it as \\"a fun, but difficult, variant of Rummy.\\" Object The aim of Robber's Rummy is to be the first player to discard all the cards in hand by forming melds and placing them on table.  Cards  Robbers' rummy is played using two standard 52-card French decks, and 2 to 6 jokers. Play Initially, each player is dealt 11 to 13Romm√© at www.ludomax.de. Retrieved on 2 Jul 2018. cards from the shuffled deck, whose remainder, called the stock is placed face-down on the table. The goal of each player is to reduce the number of cards held in hand by placing them on the table, face-up, forming melds. A meld is: *Either any sequence by rank of three or more cards of the same suit (where the King may be followed by Ace, and 2, and so on), *Any three or four cards of equal rank, but of distinct suits. Any one Joker card used within a meld must be identified as one card of appropriate rank and suit. At each turn, a player may place one or more cards from their own hand on the table, such that melds are formed (or extended). For this purpose, each player may rearrange any or all melds on the table, including, if necessary, by reassigning the identification of Joker cards; provided all cards on the table form melds eventually, in completion of the placement. All cards which were on the table, before the placement of the own cards from hand, must remain on the table. An essential point to recognize is that any meld consisting of four cards may be reduced to an equally regular three-card meld by removing or robbing one card, which in turn may be used to form other melds. The name Robbers' rummy reflects the characterization, by proponents of normal rummy, of such liberty in playing this game as excessive, or even \\"offensive.\\"Robbers‚Äô Rummy Online at www.jungleerummy.com. Retrieved 2 Jul 2018. Examples * On the table are ‚ô£5‚Äì‚ô£6‚Äì‚ô£7‚Äì‚ô£8‚Äì‚ô£9; a player holds the second ‚ô£7 in his hand.

Any jokers on the table may be re-used to represent a different card without having to be exchanged as in German Rummy, for example. A player who was unable or disinclined to place at least one card from their own hand on the table accordingly, must draw one card from the stock into the hand. Alternatively, a player who did place one or more own cards on the table may draw one card from the stock, or must otherwise yield to the next player right away. After having drawn one card, the player at turn may still place any one or more cards on the table, and must then yield to the next player without drawing another card. Danyliuk includes 2 additional rules: * The top card of the discard pile may only be used if it is immediately laid off or melded; it must not be added to the hand. * The player's first meld must score 40 points; cards may be laid off to existing melds in order to reach this total. To do this card values are assigned as follows: A = 1 or 11 depending on position, KQJ = 10 each, pips = 2-9 depending on face value.  Ending  The first player to meld or lay off all held cards is the winner.

A common use is to specify the geometry necessary for the construction of a component and is called a detail drawing. Usually, a number of drawings are necessary to completely specify even a simple component. The drawings are linked together by a master drawing or assembly drawing which gives the drawing numbers of the subsequent detailed components, quantities required, construction materials and possibly 3D images that can be used to locate individual items. Although mostly consisting of pictographic representations, abbreviations and symbols are used for brevity and additional textual explanations may also be provided to convey the necessary information. The process of producing engineering drawings is often referred to as technical drawing or drafting (draughting). Drawings typically contain multiple views of a component, although additional scratch views may be added of details for further explanation. Only the information that is a requirement is typically specified. Key information such as dimensions is usually only specified in one place on a drawing, avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency. Suitable tolerances are given for critical dimensions to allow the component to be manufactured and function. More detailed production drawings may be produced based on the information given in an engineering drawing. Drawings have an information box or title block containing who drew the drawing, who approved it, units of dimensions, meaning of views, the title of the drawing and the drawing number. History Technical drawing has existed since ancient times. Complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times, such as the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci. Modern engineering drawing, with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale, arose in France at a time when the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy. L. T. C. Rolt's biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. says of his father, Marc Isambard Brunel, that \\"It seems fairly certain that Marc's drawings of his block-making machinery (in 1799) made a contribution to British engineering technique much greater than the machines they represented. For it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing. It had been evolved by Gaspard Monge of Mezieres in 1765 but had remained a military secret until 1794 and was therefore unknown in England.\\" Standardization and disambiguation Engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated. Standards provide rules for their specification and interpretation. Standardization also aids internationalization, because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing, and interpret it the same way. One major set of engineering drawing standards is ASME Y14.5 and Y14.5M (most recently revised in 2009). These apply widely in the United States, although ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) ‚Äî Fundamentals ‚Äî Concepts, principles and rules) is now also important. In 2011, a new revision of ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) ‚Äî Fundamentals ‚Äî Concepts, principles and rules) was published containing the Invocation Principle. This states that, \\"Once a portion of the ISO geometric product specification (GPS) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation, the entire ISO GPS system is invoked.\\" It also goes on to state that marking a drawing \\"Tolerancing ISO 8015\\" is optional. The implication of this is that any drawing using ISO symbols can only be interpreted to ISO GPS rules. The only way not to invoke the ISO GPS system is to invoke a national or other standard. Britain, BS 8888 (Technical Product Specification) has undergone important updates in the 2010s. Media For centuries, until the post-World War II era, all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate (e.g., vellum, mylar). Since the advent of computer-aided design (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared. Some of the tools of manual drafting include pencils, pens and their ink, straightedges, T-squares, French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. (Slide rules used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom \\"to go back to the drawing board\\", which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. Drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents. Producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced, generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor, vendors, company archives, and so on. The classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances (whether white-on-blue or blue-on-white), which is why engineering drawings were long called, and even today are still often called, \\"blueprints\\" or \\"bluelines\\", even though those terms are anachronistic from a literal perspective, since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods (often inkjet or laser printing) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper. The more generic term \\"print\\" is now in common usage in the U.S. to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing. In the case of CAD drawings, the original is the CAD file, and the printouts of that file are the \\"prints\\".  Systems of dimensioning and tolerancing  Almost all engineering drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate not only geometry (shape and location) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed interchangeable manufacture, these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. Coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T;), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only tolerance zones, tolerance stacking) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form [shapes/locations] and sizes).  Common features  Drawings convey the following critical information: * Geometry ‚Äì the shape of the object; represented as views; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles, such as front, top, side, etc. * Dimensions ‚Äì the size of the object is captured in accepted units. * Tolerances ‚Äì the allowable variations for each dimension. * Material ‚Äì represents what the item is made of. * Finish ‚Äì specifies the surface quality of the item, functional or cosmetic. For example, a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than, say, a component that goes inside industrial machinery. = Line styles and types = Standard engineering drawing line types A variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects. Types of lines include the following: * visible ‚Äì are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle. * hidden ‚Äì are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible. * center ‚Äì are alternately long- and short- dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features. * cutting plane ‚Äì are thin, medium-dashed lines, or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for section views. * section ‚Äì are thin lines in a pattern (pattern determined by the material being \\"cut\\" or \\"sectioned\\") used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from \\"cutting\\". Section lines are commonly referred to as \\"cross- hatching\\". * phantom ‚Äì (not shown) are alternately long- and double short- dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly. E.g. billet ends that may be used for testing, or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing. Lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter. * Type A lines show the outline of the feature of an object. They are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than HB. * Type B lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning, projecting, extending, or leaders. A harder pencil should be used, such as a 2H pencil. * Type C lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown. These are freehand drawn and only for short breaks. 2H pencil * Type D lines are similar to Type C, except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks. 2H pencil * Type E lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object. These are dotted lines. 2H pencil * Type F lines are Type E lines, except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology. 2H pencil * Type G lines are used for centre lines. These are dotted lines, but a long line of 10‚Äì20 mm, then a 1 mm gap, then a small line of 2 mm. 2H pencil * Type H lines are the same as type G, except that every second long line is thicker. These indicate the cutting plane of an object. 2H pencil * Type K lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object. These are drawn with a long line of 10‚Äì20 mm, then a small gap, then a small line of 2 mm, then a gap, then another small line. 2H pencil. =Multiple views and projections= Image of a part represented in first-angle projection Symbols used to define whether a projection is either first-angle (left) or third-angle (right). Several types of graphical projection compared Various projections and how they are produced below. In most cases, a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features, and several views are used. Types of views include the following:  Multiview projection  A multiview projection is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front, right, left, top, bottom, or back (e.g. the primary views), and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either first-angle or third-angle projection. The origin and vector direction of the projectors (also called projection lines) differs, as explained below. * In first-angle projection, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from behind the viewer and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane behind it. The 3D object is projected into 2D \\"paper\\" space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object: the top view is under the front view, the right view is at the left of the front view. First-angle projection is the ISO standard and is primarily used in Europe. * In third- angle projection, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from the far side of the object and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing. Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third- angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to ASME standard ASME Y14.3M. Until the late 19th century, first-angle projection was the norm in North America as well as Europe;, p. 78. but circa the 1890s, third-angle projection spread throughout the North American engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention, and it was an ASA standard by the 1950s. Circa World War I, British practice was frequently mixing the use of both projection methods. As shown above, the determination of what surface constitutes the front, back, top, and bottom varies depending on the projection method used. Not all views are necessarily used. Generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically. The front, top, and right-side views are commonly considered the core group of views included by default,. but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design. In addition to the six principal views (front, back, top, bottom, right side, left side), any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication. View lines or section lines (lines with arrows marked \\"A-A\\", \\"B-B\\", etc.) define the direction and location of viewing or sectioning. Sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone(s) of the drawing to find the view or section.  Auxiliary views  An auxiliary view is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six primary views.Bertoline, Gary R. Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.). New York, NY. 2009 These views are typically used when an object contains some sort of inclined plane. Using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane (and any other significant features) to be projected in their true size and shape. The true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the Line of Sight (LOS) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced. It is shown like a three-dimensional object. Auxiliary views tend to make use of axonometric projection. When existing all by themselves, auxiliary views are sometimes known as pictorials.  Isometric projection  An isometric projection shows the object from angles in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal. Isometric projection corresponds to rotation of the object by ¬± 45¬∞ about the vertical axis, followed by rotation of approximately ¬± 35.264¬∞ [= arcsin(tan(30¬∞))] about the horizontal axis starting from an orthographic projection view. \\"Isometric\\" comes from the Greek for \\"same measure\\". One of the things that makes isometric drawings so attractive is the ease with which 60¬∞ angles can be constructed with only a compass and straightedge. Isometric projection is a type of axonometric projection. The other two types of axonometric projection are: * Dimetric projection * Trimetric projection  Oblique projection  An oblique projection is a simple type of graphical projection used for producing pictorial, two- dimensional images of three-dimensional objects: * it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors) * from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plan). In both oblique projection and orthographic projection, parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image.  Perspective projection  Perspective is an approximate representation on a flat surface, of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn: * Smaller as their distance from the observer increases * Foreshortened: the size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight.  Section Views  Projected views (either Auxiliary or Multiview) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane. These views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than may be available using regular projections or hidden lines. In assembly drawings, hardware components (e.g. nuts, screws, washers) are typically not sectioned. Section view is a half side view of object. = Scale = Plans are usually \\"scale drawings\\", meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 (1:48 or ‚Ä≥ = 1‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 (1:24 or ‚Ä≥ = 1‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥). Site plans are often drawn at 1:200 or 1:100. Scale is a nuanced subject in the use of engineering drawings. On one hand, it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized, mathematically certain projection methods and rules. Thus, great effort is put into having an engineering drawing accurately depict size, shape, form, aspect ratios between features, and so on. And yet, on the other hand, there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent‚Äîthat is, the principle that users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled. This stern admonition is often repeated on drawings, via a boilerplate note in the title block telling the user, \\"DO NOT SCALE DRAWING.\\" The explanation for why these two nearly opposite principles can coexist is as follows. The first principle‚Äîthat drawings will be made so carefully and accurately‚Äîserves the prime goal of why engineering drawing even exists, which is successfully communicating part definition and acceptance criteria‚Äîincluding \\"what the part should look like if you've made it correctly.\\" The service of this goal is what creates a drawing that one even could scale and get an accurate dimension thereby. And thus the great temptation to do so, when a dimension is wanted but was not labeled. The second principle‚Äîthat even though scaling the drawing will usually work, one should nevertheless never do it‚Äîserves several goals, such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent, and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with (which is typically labeled \\"drawing not to scale\\" or \\"scale: NTS\\"). When a user is forbidden from scaling the drawing, s/he must turn instead to the engineer (for the answers that the scaling would seek), and s/he will never erroneously scale something that is inherently unable to be accurately scaled. But in some ways, the advent of the CAD and MBD era challenges these assumptions that were formed many decades ago. When part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model, the assertion that one cannot interrogate the model‚Äîthe direct analog of \\"scaling the drawing\\"‚Äîbecomes ridiculous; because when part definition is defined this way, it is not possible for a drawing or model to be \\"not to scale\\". A 2D pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed (and thus not to scale), yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used, and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs. This is because what the drawing and labels convey is in reality a symbol of what is wanted, rather than a true replica of it. (For example, a sketch of a hole that is clearly not round still accurately defines the part as having a true round hole, as long as the label says \\"10mm DIA\\", because the \\"DIA\\" implicitly but objectively tells the user that the skewed drawn circle is a symbol representing a perfect circle.) But if a mathematical model‚Äîessentially, a vector graphic‚Äîis declared to be the official definition of the part, then any amount of \\"scaling the drawing\\" can make sense; there may still be an error in the model, in the sense that what was intended is not depicted (modeled); but there can be no error of the \\"not to scale\\" type‚Äîbecause the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas, not symbols, of the part features. Even in dealing with 2D drawings, the manufacturing world has changed since the days when people paid attention to the scale ratio claimed on the print, or counted on its accuracy. In the past, prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios, and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15mm long corresponded to a 30mm part dimension because the drawing said \\"1:2\\" in the \\"scale\\" box of the title block. Today, in the era of ubiquitous desktop printing, where original drawings or scaled prints are often scanned on a scanner and saved as a PDF file, which is then printed at any percent magnification that the user deems handy (such as \\"fit to paper size\\"), users have pretty much given up caring what scale ratio is claimed in the \\"scale\\" box of the title block. Which, under the rule of \\"do not scale drawing\\", never really did that much for them anyway. = Showing dimensions  Sizes of drawings = ISO paper sizes ANSI paper sizes Sizes of drawings typically comply with either of two different standards, ISO (World Standard) or ANSI/ASME Y14.1 (American). The metric drawing sizes correspond to international paper sizes. These developed further refinements in the second half of the twentieth century, when photocopying became cheap. Engineering drawings could be readily doubled (or halved) in size and put on the next larger (or, respectively, smaller) size of paper with no waste of space. And the metric technical pens were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the square root of 2. A full set of pens would have the following nib sizes: 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm. However, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each: 0.25 (white), 0.35 (yellow), 0.5 (brown), 0.7 (blue); these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the ISO paper sizes. All ISO paper sizes have the same aspect ratio, one to the square root of 2, meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly. Given this ease of changing sizes, it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different sizes of paper, especially within a series, e.g. a drawing on A3 may be enlarged to A2 or reduced to A4. The U.S. customary \\"A-size\\" corresponds to \\"letter\\" size, and \\"B-size\\" corresponds to \\"ledger\\" or \\"tabloid\\" size. There were also once British paper sizes, which went by names rather than alphanumeric designations. American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ANSI/ASME Y14.1, Y14.2, Y14.3, and Y14.5 are commonly referenced standards in the U.S. = Technical lettering = Technical lettering is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &c;). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf. Conventional parts (areas)=Title block= The title block (T/B, TB) is an area of the drawing that conveys header-type information about the drawing, such as: * Drawing title (hence the name \\"title block\\") * Drawing number * Part number(s) * Name of the design activity (corporation, government agency, etc.) * Identifying code of the design activity (such as a CAGE code) * Address of the design activity (such as city, state/province, country) * Measurement units of the drawing (for example, inches, millimeters) * Default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified * Boilerplate callouts of general specs * Intellectual property rights warning Traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right (most commonly) or the top right or center. =Revisions block= The revisions block (rev block) is a tabulated list of the revisions (versions) of the drawing, documenting the revision control. Traditional locations for the revisions block are the top right (most commonly) or adjoining the title block in some way. =Next assembly= The next assembly block, often also referred to as \\"where used\\" or sometimes \\"effectivity block\\", is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used. This block is commonly found adjacent to the title block. =Notes list= The notes list provides notes to the user of the drawing, conveying any information that the callouts within the field of the drawing did not. It may include general notes, flagnotes, or a mixture of both. Traditional locations for the notes list are anywhere along the edges of the field of the drawing. General notes General notes (G/N, GN) apply generally to the contents of the drawing, as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features. Flagnotes Flagnotes or flag notes (FL, F/N) are notes that apply only where a flagged callout points, such as to particular surfaces, features, or part numbers. Typically the callout includes a flag icon. Some companies call such notes \\"delta notes\\", and the note number is enclosed inside a triangular symbol (similar to capital letter delta, Œî). \\"FL5\\" (flagnote 5) and \\"D5\\" (delta note 5) are typical ways to abbreviate in ASCII-only contexts. =Field of the drawing= The field of the drawing (F/D, FD) is the main body or main area of the drawing, excluding the title block, rev block, P/L and so on =List of materials, bill of materials, parts list= The list of materials (L/M, LM, LoM), bill of materials (B/M, BM, BoM), or parts list (P/L, PL) is a (usually tabular) list of the materials used to make a part, and/or the parts used to make an assembly. It may contain instructions for heat treatment, finishing, and other processes, for each part number. Sometimes such LoMs or PLs are separate documents from the drawing itself. Traditional locations for the LoM/BoM are above the title block, or in a separate document. =Parameter tabulations= Some drawings call out dimensions with parameter names (that is, variables, such a \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\"), then tabulate rows of parameter values for each part number. Traditional locations for parameter tables, when such tables are used, are floating near the edges of the field of the drawing, either near the title block or elsewhere along the edges of the field. =Views and sections= Each view or section is a separate set of projections, occupying a contiguous portion of the field of the drawing. Usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field. =Zones= Often a drawing is divided into zones by a grid, with zone labels along the margins, such as A, B, C, D up the sides and 1,2,3,4,5,6 along the top and bottom. Names of zones are thus, for example, A5, D2, or B1. This feature greatly eases discussion of, and reference to, particular areas of the drawing. Abbreviations and symbols As in many technical fields, a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries. For example, cold rolled steel is often abbreviated as CRS, and diameter is often abbreviated as DIA, D, or ‚åÄ. With the advent of computer generated drawings for manufacturing and machining, many symbols have fallen out of common use. This poses a problem when attempting to interpret an older hand-drawn document that contains obscure elements that cannot be readily referenced in standard teaching text or control documents such as ASME and ANSI standards. For example, ASME Y14.5M 1994 excludes a few elements that convey critical information as contained in older US Navy drawings and aircraft manufacturing drawings of World War 2 vintage. Researching the intent and meaning of some symbols can prove difficult.  Example  Example mechanical drawing Here is an example of an engineering drawing (an isometric view of the same object is shown above). The different line types are colored for clarity. *Black = object line and hatching *Red = hidden line *Blue = center line of piece or opening *Magenta = phantom line or cutting plane line Sectional views are indicated by the direction of arrows, as in the example right side. Legal instruments An engineering drawing is a legal document (that is, a legal instrument), because it communicates all the needed information about \\"what is wanted\\" to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality. It is thus a part of a contract; the purchase order and the drawing together, as well as any ancillary documents (engineering change orders [ECOs], called-out specs), constitute the contract. Thus, if the resulting product is wrong, the worker or manufacturer are protected from liability as long as they have faithfully executed the instructions conveyed by the drawing. If those instructions were wrong, it is the fault of the engineer. Because manufacturing and construction are typically very expensive processes (involving large amounts of capital and payroll), the question of liability for errors has legal implications. Relationship to model-based definition (MBD/DPD) For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into manufacture. In recent decades another method has arisen, called model-based definition (MBD) or digital product definition (DPD). In MBD, the information captured by the CAD software app is fed automatically into a CAM app (computer-aided manufacturing), which (with or without postprocessing apps) creates code in other languages such as G-code to be executed by a CNC machine tool (computer numerical control), 3D printer, or (increasingly) a hybrid machine tool that uses both. Thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing. In MBD, the dataset, not a drawing, is the legal instrument. The term \\"technical data package\\" (TDP) is now used to refer to the complete package of information (in one medium or another) that communicates information from design to production (such as 3D-model datasets, engineering drawings, engineering change orders (ECOs), spec revisions and addenda, and so on). It still takes CAD/CAM programmers, CNC setup workers, and CNC operators to do manufacturing, as well as other people such as quality assurance staff (inspectors) and logistics staff (for materials handling, shipping-and-receiving, and front office functions). These workers often use drawings in the course of their work that have been produced from the MBD dataset. When proper procedures are being followed, a clear chain of precedence is always documented, such that when a person looks at a drawing, s/he is told by a note thereon that this drawing is not the governing instrument (because the MBD dataset is). In these cases, the drawing is still a useful document, although legally it is classified as \\"for reference only\\", meaning that if any controversies or discrepancies arise, it is the MBD dataset, not the drawing, that governs.

Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W. Nevinson and Dora Carrington. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.Jean Moorcroft Wilson ‚Äî Isaac Rosenberg (2008) Whether because his faith in the machine age had been shattered by his experiences as a private soldier in the trenches or because of the pervasive retrogressive attitude towards modernism in Britain Bomberg moved to a more figurative style in the 1920s and his work became increasingly dominated by portraits and landscapes drawn from nature. Gradually developing a more expressionist technique, he travelled widely through the Middle East and Europe. From 1945 to 1953, he worked as a teacher at Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in London, where his pupils included Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Philip Holmes,[Frank Auerbach by Robert Hughes, page 30 . Philip Holmes' website] Cliff Holden, Edna Mann, Dorothy Mead, Gustav Metzger, Dennis Creffield, Cecil Bailey and Miles Richmond.Miles Richmond's website David Bomberg House, one of the student halls of residences at London South Bank University, is named in his honour. He was married to landscape painter Lilian Holt. Early years Self-Portrait (1931), charcoal and wash. Bomberg was born in the Lee Bank area of Birmingham on 5 December 1890.\\"David Bomberg\\" Retrieved January 29, 2014. He was the seventh of eleven children of a Polish Jewish immigrant leatherworker, Abraham, and his wife Rebecca. He was Orthodox but she less so and supported David's painting ambitions.\\"David Bomberg: an East End childhood\\" In 1895, his family moved to Whitechapel in the East End of London where he was to spend the rest of his childhood. After studying art at City and Guilds, Bomberg returned to Birmingham to train as a lithographer but quit to study under Walter Sickert at Westminster School of Art from 1908 to 1910. Sickert's emphasis on the study of form and the representation of the \\"gross material facts\\" of urban life were an important early influence on Bomberg, alongside Roger Fry's 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, where he first saw the work of Paul C√©zanne. Bomberg's artistic studies had involved considerable financial hardship but in 1911, with the help of John Singer Sargent and the Jewish Education Aid Society, he was able to attain a place at the Slade School of Art.  The Slade  Vision of Ezekiel, 1912, oil on canvas. Tate Gallery. At the Slade School of Fine Art Bomberg was one of the remarkable generation of artists described by their drawing master Henry Tonks as the School's second and last \\"crisis of brilliance\\" and which included Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Ben Nicholson, Mark Gertler and Isaac Rosenberg. (The \\"first crisis of brilliance\\" had occurred in the 1890s, with Augustus John, William Orpen and others.) Bomberg and Rosenberg, from similar backgrounds, had met some years earlier and became close friends as a result of their mutual interests. The emphasis in teaching at the Slade was on technique and draughtsmanship, to which Bomberg was well suited ‚Äî winning the Tonks Prize for his drawing of fellow student Rosenberg in 1911. His own style was rapidly moving away from these traditional methods, however, particularly under the influence of the March 1912 London exhibition of Italian Futurists that exposed him to the dynamic abstraction of Francis Picabia and Gino Severini, and Fry's second Post Impressionist exhibition in October of the same year, which displayed the works of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and the Fauvists alongside those of Wyndham Lewis, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Bomberg's response to this became clear in paintings such as Vision of Ezekiel (1912), in which he proved \\"he could absorb the most experimental European ideas, fuse these with Jewish influences and come up with a robust alternative of his own.\\" His dynamic, angular representations of the human form, combining the geometrical abstraction of cubism with the energy of the Futurists, established his reputation as a forceful member of the avant-garde and the most audacious of his contemporaries; bringing him to the attention of Wyndham Lewis (who visited him in 1912) and Filippo Marinetti. In 1913, the year in which he was expelled from the Slade because of the radicalism of his approach, he travelled to France with Jacob Epstein, where among others he met Amedeo Modigliani, Andr√© Derain and Pablo Picasso. Pre-war avant-garde The Mud Bath (1914; Tate Gallery). Expelled from the Slade in the Summer of 1913, Bomberg formed a series of loose affiliations with several groups involved with the contemporary English avant-garde, embarking on a brief and acrimonious association with the Bloomsbury Group's Omega Workshops before exhibiting with the Camden Town Group in December 1913. His enthusiasm for the dynamism and aesthetics of the machine age gave him a natural affinity with Wyndham Lewis's emerging vorticist movement, and five of his works featured in the founding exhibition of the London Group in 1914. Still, Bomberg was staunchly independent and despite Lewis' attempts he never officially joined Vorticism. In July 1914 he refused involvement with the Vorticist literary magazine BLAST and in June of the following year his work featured only in the \\"Invited to show\\" section of the vorticist exhibition at London's Dore Gallery. In 1914 he met his first wife Alice Mayes a resourceful and practical woman about ten years older than him who had worked with Kosslov's Ballet Company. Their mutual interest in experimental dance and the Russian ballet may have helped bring them together. Alice helped Bomberg in the early part of his career both with financial support and in influencing his appearance and charecter. 1914 saw the highpoint of his early career ‚Äî a solo exhibition at the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea which attracted positive reviews from Roger Fry and T. E. Hulme and attracted favourable attention from experimental artists nationally and internationally. The exhibition featured several of Bomberg's early masterpieces, most notably The Mud Bath (1914), which was hung on an outside wall surrounded by Union Flags ‚Äî causing \\"the horses drawing the 29 bus... to shy at it as they came round the corner of King's Road.\\" > \\"I look upon Nature while I live in a steel city\\" he explained in the > exhibition catalogue \\"I APPEAL to a Sense of Form ... My object is the > construction of Pure Form. I reject everything in painting that is not Pure > Form.\\" With the help of Augustus John, Bomberg sold two paintings from this exhibition to the influential American collector John Quinn. Alice and David enjoyed a trip to Paris with the proceeds of the sale of several pictures in 1914 which led to them marrying in 1916 after Bomberg had enlisted in the Royal Engineers in November 1915. World War I and after Sappers at Work: A Canadian Tunnelling Company, Hill 60, St Eloi by David Bomberg, which bears a reference to 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company. Photograph of David Bomberg, taken in Jerusalem, 1924. Despite the success of his Chenil Gallery exhibition Bomberg continued to be dogged by financial problems. In 1915, he enlisted in the Royal Engineers, transferring in 1916 to the King's Royal Rifle Corps and in March of that year, shortly after marrying his first wife, being sent to the Western Front. World War I was to bring a profound change to Bomberg's outlook. His experiences of its mechanized slaughter and the death of his brother in the trenches ‚Äî as well as those of his friend Isaac Rosenberg and his supporter T. E. Hulme ‚Äî permanently destroyed his faith in the aesthetics of the machine age. This can be seen most clearly in his commission for the Canadian War Memorials Fund, Sappers at Work (1918‚Äì1919): his first version of the painting was dismissed as a \\"futurist abortion\\" and was replaced by a second far more representational version. The artist's book Russian Ballet, 1919, was the last work to use the pre-war vorticist idiom. Bomberg self- published this work whilst waiting for the Canadian Government's verdict on Sappers At Work; the next few years was to see him 'experimenting with ways of making his stark pre-war style more rounded and organic'. In radical opposition to the prevailing currents in avant-garde art, stimulated as these were by the enthusiasm for mechanization in Constructivism in Russia following the Revolution, Bomberg went to paint and draw in Palestine between 1923 and 1927, with the assistance of the Zionist Organization. There he brought together the geometric energies of his pre-war work as an \\"English cubist\\" with the tradition of figurative observation of the English landscape school of Turner, Constable, Girtin and John Sell Cotman. The return to order Tregor and Tregoff, Cornwall, 1947, Tate Gallery From there followed Bomberg's great period of painting and drawing in landscape, in Spain at Toledo (1928), Ronda (1934‚Äì35 and 1954‚Äì57) and Asturias (1935), in Cyprus (1948) and intermittently in Britain, perhaps most powerfully in Cornwall. A six-month stay at Odessa in the Soviet Union in the second half of 1933, following Hitler's seizure of power in Germany, led Bomberg on his return to London to immediate resignation from the Communist Party. During World War II, he painted Evening in the City of London (1944), showing the blitzed city viewed rising up to a triumphant, surviving St Paul's Cathedral on the horizon, since described as the \\"most moving of all paintings of wartime Britain\\" (Martin Harrison); a series of flower paintings saturated with turbulent feeling; and his single commission as a war artist, a series of \\"Bomb Store\\" paintings (1942) expressing Bomberg's expanded first-hand sense of the destructive powers of modern technology in warfare. These \\"Bomb Store\\" paintings convey a premonitory sense of the massive explosion that destroyed the underground store two years later, killing 68 people, and bear comparison with Piranesi's Carceri etchings. Bomberg's superb draughtsmanship was expressed also in a lifelong series of portraits, from the early period of his Botticelli-like \\"Head of a Poet\\" (1913), a pencil portrait of his friend the poet Isaac Rosenberg for which he won the Henry Tonks Prize at the Slade, to his \\"Last Self-Portrait\\" (1956), painted at Ronda, a meditation also on Rembrandt. Unable to get a teaching position after World War II in any of the most prestigious London art schools, Bomberg became the most exemplary teacher of the immediate post-war period in Britain, working part-time in a bakery school at the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in the working- class borough of Southwark. Though his students received no grant and were awarded no diploma, he attracted devoted and highly energetic pupils, with whom he exhibited on an equal basis in London, Oxford, and Cambridge in two important artists' groupings in which he was the leading light, the Borough Group (1946‚Äì51) and the Borough Bottega (1953‚Äì55). He developed a deeply considered philosophy of art, set out in several pieces of writing, which he summed up in the phrase, \\"The Spirit in the Mass\\". Following a collapse in Ronda, Bomberg died in London in 1957, his critical stock rising sharply thereafter. One of Bomberg's admirers, the painter Patrick Swift, unearthed and edited Bomberg‚Äôs pens√©es, and was later to publish them, along with images of Bomberg's work, as 'The Bomberg Papers' in his ‚ÄòX‚Äô magazine (June 1960).David Bomberg, 'The Bomberg papers', X, Vol. I, No. 3 (June 1960); An Anthology from X, Oxford University Press (1988) After his early success before the First World War, he was in his lifetime the most brutally excluded artist in Britain. Having lived for years on the earnings of his second wife, fellow artist Lilian Holt and remittances from his sister Kitty, he died in absolute poverty.

A vision is something seen in a dream, trance, or religious ecstasy, especially a supernatural appearance that usually conveys a revelation. Visions generally have more clarity than dreams, but traditionally fewer psychological connotations. Visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality. Prophecy is often associated with visions.  About  Evelyn Underhill distinguishes and categorizes three types of visions: # Intellectual Visions - The Catholic dictionary defines these as supernatural knowledge in which the mind receives an extraordinary grasp of some revealed truth without the aid of sensible impressions and mystics describe them as intuitions that leave a deep impression. # Imaginary - In Teresa of Avila's The Interior Castle, an imaginary vision is defined as one where nothing is seen or heard by the senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression is received that would be produced upon the imagination by the senses if some real object were perceived by them. Niels Christian Hvidt refers to them as visions recognized through mechanisms of the human psyche that are made up of things a soul has acquired through contact with reality. # Corporeal - A supernatural manifestation of an object to the eyes of the body. It may take place in two ways: either a figure really present strikes the retina and there determines the physical phenomenon of the vision, or an agent superior to man directly modifies the visual organ and produces in the composite a sensation equivalent to that which an external object would produce. Underhill refers to this vision type as \\"little else than an uncontrolled externalization of inward memories, thoughts, or intuitions\\"  Examples  Visions are listed in approximately chronological order whenever possible, although some dates may be in dispute. * Vision of God in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel (6th century BC) * Vision of a heavenly figure \\"like a son of man\\" in Daniel 7:13 (6th century / 2nd century BC) * Post-resurrection appearances of Jesus * St Paul's vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus (1st century) * Marian apparitions (visions or visitations of Mary, mother of Jesus) (1st century AD ‚Äì present) * Visions of the afterlife in the martyr accounts of Perpetua and Felicity (2nd century AD) * Constantine's vision of Christ's sign (312 AD) * Jakob B√∂hme's vision (1600 AD), in which he observed the beauty of a beam of sunlight in a pewter dish * Ren√© Descartes' series of dreams on the night of 11 November 1619, which set the course of his life in science * Blaise Pascal's vision of 23 November 1654, which reinvigorated his spiritual commitment * Emanuel Swedenborg's visions, which formed the basis of a newly revealed doctrine (beginning in 1740s) * Joseph Smith's First Vision (1820), including Throne-Theophany of Lehi in the First Book of Nephi in (6th century BC) * The Three Witnesses: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris claimed that they were shown the Book of Mormon's golden plates by an angel on 28 June 1829. They also stated that they heard a voice from heaven declaring that they were translated miraculously. With over 150 documented statements, it is the most well-documented vision in history. * Ramakrishna had several visions of religious figures including Kali, Sita, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammed.

The creature is generally a flightless bird, though certain highly specialized breeds in some titles retain the ability to fly. It bears a resemblance to casuariiformes and ratites, capable of being ridden and otherwise used by player characters during gameplay. Chocobos first appeared in Final Fantasy II and have been featured in almost all subsequent Final Fantasy games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. A spin-off Chocobo series featuring chocobos has also been created. Character design The chocobo was created and designed by Koichi Ishii, a video game director who worked on various Final Fantasy titles. The chocobo appears remarkably similar to and was likely inspired by the prehistoric bird Gastornis. Hiromichi Tanaka has speculated that the chocobo concept may have come from Kyorochan, a character in television advertisements for Morinaga & Company's chocolate candy, which is also a bird with the call of \\"kweh\\". Morinaga has also released a tie-in product, . Another likely inspiration was Hayao Miyazaki's Horseclaws, which appear in the manga Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind and the anime film of the same name, which Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi once cited as an influence on his series. In turn, Miyazaki's Horseclaws were inspired by the extinct Gastornis species. Chocobos are typically portrayed with yellow feathers, but there are rare Chocobo breeds that are capable of giving birth to different-colored chicks. Appearances=Final Fantasy series= Most chocobos dwell in forests (although those from Final Fantasy VII live in grasslands and snowfields). While timid in the wild and vicious if threatened, they tame rather easily and act as vehicles, as well as quick and effective cavalry. In this role they tend to be capable of crossing shallow water and are noted for their high speeds. Most often they can be caught in the wild and ridden without fear of random encounters, escaping after the player dismounts. A common food for chocobos, usually used to help tame the bird, are Gysahl Greens, named after a town in Final Fantasy III. Final Fantasy II was the first installment to have chocobos play a role in the plot. Boko (sometimes translated as Boco) went on to become a recurring chocobo name in later installments. In Final Fantasy IV, the party also encounters a black species of chocobo which is capable of flight. In Final Fantasy XIII, the character Sazh Katzroy has a baby chocobo for a pet. Within Final Fantasy XI, the raising and breeding of chocobos was a long-requested activity, and was enabled in the Summer 2006 update. Chocobo racing began in March 2007. Players were allowed to race player-raised chocobos against non-player characters. Winning racers earn \\"Chocobucks\\", which can be used to buy items that assist chocobo breeding. Chocobos have appeared in all numbered installments except the first, in addition to the Final Fantasy Tactics series. Chocobos appear as a summon in Final Fantasy III, IV, V, VII, and VIII. A Fat Chocobo appears in Final Fantasy III, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and XV. The chocobo Boko appears in Final Fantasy V and VIII, and Final Fantasy Tactics. Black Chocobos, which sometimes possess the ability to fly, are found in Final Fantasy IV, V, VII, XI, XII, XIV, Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest features several chocobo-shaped weather vanes in the town of Windia. In Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles one can obtain the Chocobo Shield and the Chocobo Pocket items, and are included in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers. In the animated sequel to Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals, one of the main characters can summon pink, featherless chocobos. In addition, Final Fantasy Adventure featured a chocobo egg which hatched to aid the player. Chocobos are common in the anime series Final Fantasy: Unlimited, and one named Chobi joins the cast in their adventure. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children both have chocobo-related easter eggs. =Chocobo series= The Chocobo series is a spin-off series of games first developed by Square Co., and later by Square Enix, featuring a chibi version of the Final Fantasy series mascot, the Chocobo, as the protagonist. These games include Mystery Dungeon installments and a variety of minigame collections, over a wide variety of video game consoles. =Other games= Chocobos appear frequently in other Square and Square Enix games, notably in the Mana series. A chocobo serves as a mount in Seiken Densetsu (Final Fantasy Adventure), and is later changed into a 'Chocobot'. It was removed from the 2003 remake Sword of Mana in favor of the 'Cannon Ball Travel' which originated in Secret of Mana; however, a chocobo can be seen in Sword of Mana by waiting for a certain period of time after the completion of the game. Wild black chocobos appear as monsters in Legend of Mana, while tame yellow chocobos can be hatched by the player from eggs to assist in battle. There is a chocobo courier in Dota 2, which came with the purchase of FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0‚Ñ¢ HD in 2015 In Secret of Evermore, a Chocobo Egg is a rare item. In Kingdom Hearts, there is a Keyblade/keychain (\\"Metal Chocobo\\") and a Gummi Ship design that are both named and modeled after a chocobo; there is also a drawing of a chocobo in the cave on the Destiny Islands. In Parasite Eve, a banner depicting a chocobo hangs over the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History, while a chocobo skeleton can be found nearby. In Tobal 2, a chocobo is obtainable as a combatant. Web-based minigames starring chocobos are also featured on Square Enix's member site. An undead creature appears in The Battle for Wesnoth, described as \\"ostrich-like large birds once used as mounts by a lost civilization\\". A Minecraft mod exists called \\"ChocoCraft\\" which adds various breeds of chocobos and various breeding mechanisms, and is a part of several adventure/exploration-oriented modpacks, like Hexxit. A Stardew Valley texture mod exists which replaces the horse sprite with a Chocobo. It was made by Chucklefish user Kitsutsune. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U it appears as a costume for the Mii fighters. Assassin's Creed: Origins features a \\"kweh\\" mount which is a camel outfitted to look like a Chocobo. =Other media= The chocobo signature theme is an upbeat ditty that is present in one form or another in all Final Fantasy games since their introduction in Final Fantasy II, frequently as variants or remixes: for instance, the Final Fantasy VII chocobo races have a frantic version, while the futuristic Final Fantasy VIII has a more modern one. These songs are titled with the suffix \\"de Chocobo\\" and prefixed by the name of the style in which they are played. For example, \\"Techno de Chocobo\\" from Final Fantasy VI features a dance remix inspired by Yellow Magic Orchestra's \\"Technopolis\\", while \\"Cinco de Chocobo\\" from Final Fantasy VII features a jazz remix (in 5/4 time, cinco being Spanish and Portuguese for the number five). A newer version of the theme, titled \\"Swing de Chocobo\\", was created by Nobuo Uematsu for the concerts VOICES and Play!. It has been performed by a number of different orchestras between 2005 and today. Music composed for chocobo appearances in the Final Fantasy games was used in the Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy concert tour. Chocobos are found in the anime series Dog Days as the main form of transportation in the fantasy world of Flonyard. These giant birds are called chocobos in the series though there appears to be no relation to the chocobos in Final Fantasy or Square Enix. Cultural impact=Merchandise= Chocobo merchandise has been released, including a rubber duck, a plush baby Chocobo,\\"PlayStation: The Official Magazine Holiday Gift Guide '08,\\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine 13 (Holiday 2008): 37. and coffee mugs. Square Enix designed a chocobo character costume for the release of Chocobo Tales. =Reception= In 2008, Boko the Chocobo from Final Fantasy V was voted by Joystiq as the 20th most desired character to be placed in the Final Fantasy fighting game Dissidia: Final Fantasy. In 2007, the Chocobo was listed by IGN as one of the most likely Square Enix characters that could appear in the Super Smash Bros. series, comparing them to the Slime from Dragon Quest and saying that \\"the Chocobo could be an excellent enemy for Yoshi\\". That same year, UGO.com ranked them at number seven on the list of the best video game companions. For Final Fantasy VII, the site Anime News Network regarded the caring for chocobos as an appealing sidequest due to the benefits that come from it and thus wanted the remake to have it.

The band's second album, it reached #6 on Billboard's \\"Top R&B; Albums\\" chart and #64 on Billboard's \\"Top Albums\\" chart, launching four hit singles. First released on record by Motown's Soul label in the US and Tamla/Motown internationally, it has been multiply reissued on cassette and compact disc. It has also been remastered and reissued in conjunction with the band's preceding record, Home Cookin, as Road Runner & Home Cookin. Songs Among the album's notable songs were four charting singles. Peak among them at #3 on the R&B; Singles, #18 on the Pop Singles charts and #22 on the UK Singles was the Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland song \\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\\", which had previously hit for Marvin Gaye in 1964. Not far behind, \\"(I'm a) Road Runner\\", by the same songwriters, reached #4 on Black Singles and #20 on Pop Singles, while surpassing \\"How Sweet It Is\\" to reach #12 in the UK. \\"Pucker Up Buttercup\\" did not crack the top 10, but reached #11 Black Singles and #31 Pop Singles. A distant fourth, Junior Walker & the Allstar's cover of the 1959 Barrett Strong hit \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" reached #35 Black Singles and #52 Pop Singles. The album is titled for \\"(I'm a) Road Runner\\", which had been previously released on Junior Walker & The All-Star's 1965 debut album, Shotgun. It proved so successful in its March 1966 single that it was included and singled out on the band's follow-up. Although \\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\\" surpassed it in two out of three charts, \\"(I'm a) Road Runner\\" is regarded as a superior offering from Junior Walker & The All-Stars, one of three songs by the band (along with \\"Way Back Home\\" and \\"Shotgun\\" included in 1999's Da Capo Press publication The heart of rock & soul: the 1001 greatest singles ever made.

A clich√©d plot device may annoy the reader and a contrived or arbitrary device may confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief. However, a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.  Stories using plot devices  Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great magical power, such as a crown, sword, or jewel. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the Indiana Jones film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, he is trying to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant; in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Jones is on a search for the Holy Grail. This plot device is also used in the Arabian Nights tale of \\"The City of Brass,\\" in which a group of travelers on an archaeological expedition journeys across the Sahara to find a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn. Several books in the Harry Potter series orient around a search for a special object. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry believes there is a magical stone in Hogwarts with special powers. Lord Voldemort needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return. The One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, The Lord of the Rings has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as British Classical scholar Nick Lowe puts it: \\"Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa.\\"  Examples = MacGuffin = A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by film director Alfred Hitchcock, referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance. Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, \\"In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.\\" This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings, whose very nature is essential to the entire story. MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as plot coupons (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to \\"collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a d√©nouement\\". The term was coined by Nick Lowe.In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously. = Deus ex machina = The term deus ex machina is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion. The Latin phrase \\"deus ex machina\\" has its origins in the conventions of Greek tragedy, and refers to situations in which a mechane (crane) was used to lower actors playing a god or gods onto the stage at the end of a play. The Greek tragedian Euripides is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play Alcestis, the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, Admetus grows to regret his choice, realizing the grief of her passing would never leave him. Admetus is seized by guilt and sadness, wishing to keep her or die alongside her, but held by his obligations to raise their children. In the end, though, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the grief that consumed him. Another example of a deus ex machina is Gandalf in The Hobbit. With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was Aristotle in his Poetics, where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play. = Shoulder angel = A shoulder angel is a plot device used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see Negative associations of left-handedness in language). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the id, ego and super- ego in Psychoanalysis, with the person in the center of the dispute being the ego between the super-ego Angel and the id Devil. = Red herring = The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in whodunits, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character. = Plot voucher = A plot voucher, as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet. =Love triangle= A frequently used plot mechanism in romances and dramas is a \\"love triangle, where two men try to get the same woman.\\" from *\\"Janine functions largely as a plot mechanism: as a foil for the two lovers, as a voyeur, and finally as an unwitting trigger of disaster when she leads in the Gestapo.\\" from  See also  * Dangler * Literary technique * Plot twist * Premise (narrative) * Stock character * Theme (narrative)  References  External links  Category:Plot (narrative) Category:Narratology Category:Fiction ","title":"Plot device"},{"id":"171446","text":"Henry Pelham (25 September 1694 ‚Äì 6 March 1754) was a British Whig statesman, who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 27 August 1743 until his death. He was the younger brother of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who served in Pelham's government and succeeded him as Prime Minister. Pelham is generally considered to have been Britain's third Prime Minister after Sir Robert Walpole and the Earl of Wilmington. Pelham's premiership was relatively uneventful in terms of domestic affairs, although it was during his premiership that Great Britain experienced the tumult of the 1745 Jacobite uprising. In foreign affairs, Great Britain fought in several wars. Upon Pelham's death, his brother Newcastle took full control of the ministry. Early life Pelham, Newcastle's younger brother, was a younger son of Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham and his wife, the former Grace Pelham, Baroness Pelham of Laughton, the daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare and Grace Pierrepont. He was educated at Westminster School, and matriculated at King's College, Cambridge at Easter 1709, then migrated to Hart Hall, Oxford (the present-day Hertford College), matriculating on 6 September 1710. As a volunteer he served in Dormer's regiment at the Battle of Preston in 1715 and spent some time on the Continent. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Seaford in Sussex by his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, at a by-election on 28 February 1717 and represented it until 1722. Pelham, c. 1720 Career=Government= Through strong family influence, and the recommendation of Robert Walpole, he was chosen in 1721 as Lord of the Treasury. At the 1722 general election he was returned as MP for Sussex county. In 1724 he entered the ministry as Secretary at War, but this office he exchanged in 1730 for the more lucrative one of Paymaster of the Forces. He made himself conspicuous by his support of Walpole on the question of the excise. He, Newcastle, and the Prime Minister would often meet at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, where they would draw up much of the country's policy. These meetings became known as the Norfolk Congress. With Walpole, he served as a founding governor of the popular charity the Foundling Hospital when it opened its doors in 1739. Like his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, Pelham was an active freemason of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, active alongside John Theophilus Desaguliers. In 1742 a union of parties resulted in the formation of an administration in which Pelham became Prime Minister the following year, succeeding the Earl of Wilmington after his death. =Prime Minister= The first year of Pelham's premiership is regarded as a continuation of the Carteret ministry, with Lord Carteret continuing as Secretary of State for the Northern Department with responsibility for foreign affairs; Carteret was close to King George II. Pelham served as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. In November 1744, the Pelhams forced Lord Carteret out of the ministry: Pelham bluntly told the king that either Carteret step down, or the Pelhamites would, leaving His Majesty without a government. Thereafter Pelham shared power with his brother, the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. Pelham was regarded as the leading figure, but rank and influence made his brother very powerful in the Cabinet. In spite of a genuine attachment, there were occasional disputes between them, which sometimes led to further difficulties. = The Broad Bottomed Administration = Being strongly in favour of peace, Pelham carried on the War of the Austrian Succession with languor and indifferent success, but the country, wearied of the interminable struggle, was disposed to acquiesce in his foreign policy almost without a murmur. King George II, thwarted in his own favourite schemes, made overtures in February 1746 to Lord Bath, but his purpose was upset by the resignation of the two Pelhams (Henry and Newcastle), who, after a two-day hiatus in which Bath and Carteret (now earl Granville) proved unable to form a ministry, resumed office at the king's request. One of their terms was to insist that the king should have 'total confidence' in a ministry; rather than partial grudging acceptance of the Whigs. Pelham The Augustan era was essential to the development of prime ministerial power as being entirely dependent on a Commons majority, rather than royal prerogative interventions. While the king struggled with his headstrong son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, his son's uncertain constitutional position was high in the Leicester House party set. In 1748 Frederick, a Tory, planned to bring down the Pelhamites at a general election due the following year. The Prime Minister called an early poll in 1748 by asking the king to dissolve parliament in 1747. The prince and his father, the king grew to hate one another with unspeakable animosity. But one consequence was a closer relationship between Henry Pelham and the Sovereign. When he finally died in 1754, the King remarked \\"Now I shall have no more peace.\\" The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had been signed in 1748 leading inexorably to a number of cost-cutting budgetary measures. The Army and Navy spending shrunk from ¬£12 m to ¬£7 million per annum. Pelham promised to reduce interest rates through introduction of a balancing act measure from 4% to 3% by 1757. He also assisted a fund to reduce the National Debt. In 1749, the Consolidation Act was passed, reorganising the Royal Navy. On 20 March 1751, the British calendar was reorganised as well (New Year's Day became 1 January); Britain would adopt the Gregorian calendar one year later. In 1752 he was able to reduce the land tax from 4 s. to 2 s in the pound (an effective reduction from 20% to 10%). One social consequence of the press gangs going to sea in an expansive navy fleet was to the growth of industrial processes necessary for warfare. In the ports the distillation of gin demonstrated clearly by engravers such as Hogarth in \\"Gin Lane\\" the depravity issuing forth from the demon drink. Preachers \\"fire and brimstone\\" in favour of temperance, and drunken soldiers and sailors persuaded the administration to introduce the Gin Acts. The 1751 act was the last of four that had largely failed to prevent serious social unrest, including riots in London, reduced the number licensed dealers and sellers of liquor. By restricting supply the consumption dropped and price fell helping to manage the problem.Brumwell, p.159 Two of Pelham's final acts were the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalized by application to Parliament, and the Marriage Act of 1753, which enumerated the minimum age of consent for marriage. Upon his death, his brother (the aforementioned Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne) took over government. =Achievements= His very defects were among the chief elements of Pelham's success, for one with a strong personality, moderate amount self-respect, or haughty conceptions of statesmanship could not have restrained the discordant elements of the cabinet for any length of time the way he did. Moreover, he possessed tact and a thorough acquaintance with the forms of the House of Commons. Whatever quarrels or insubordination might have existed within the cabinet, they never broke out into open revolt. His foreign policy followed Walpole's model of emphasizing peace and ending wars. His financial policy was a major success once peace had been signed in 1748 to end the War of the Austrian Succession.Basil Williams, Whig Supremacy: 1714-1760 (1962) pp 259-70. He demobilized the armed forces, and reduced government spending from ¬£12 million to ¬£7 million. He refinanced the national debt dropping the interest from 4% to 3%. In 1752 he reduced the land tax from four shillings to two shillings in the pound; that is, from 20% to 10%.Stephen Brumwell and W.A. Speck, Cassell's Companion to Eighteenth Century Britain (2002) p 288.Dorothy Marshall, Eighteenth Century England (1974) pp 221-27. According to historians Stephen Brumwell and W.A. Speck, his: :subdued manner concealed a shrewd and calculating politician. He was reserved and cautious, but behind the reserve was steel. All agreed on his integrity, which was remarkable in a venal age; unlike Walpole, he died relatively poor.\\"Brumwell and Speck, Cassell's Companion to Eighteenth Century Britain (2002) p 288. Personal life Pelham had married Lady Catherine Manners, daughter of the John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland, in 1726. They had four daughters: * Catherine Pelham-Clinton, Countess of Clinton (1727‚Äì1760), married 1744 Henry Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln, who by this marriage subsequently became the 2nd Duke of Newcastle- under-Lyme * Frances (1728‚Äì1824), died unmarried * Grace Watson, Baroness Sondes (1735‚Äì1777), married 1752 the Hon. Lewis Watson, who in 1760 was created Baron Sondes * Mary (1739‚Äì1???), died unmarried When Pelham was elevated to Prime Minister, he began construction of a house located at 22 Arlington Street in St. James's, a district of the City of Westminster in central London. He hired the architect William Kent to build the structure in two phases. Kent died in 1748 and the work was completed by Stephen Wright in 1754. Pelham was buried in All Saints' Church, Laughton, East Sussex.PelODNB. Pelham's personal papers were inherited by his son-in-law and now form part of the Newcastle (Clumber) Collection held at the department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham. Pelham was the first British Prime Minister who never acceded to the peerage in his lifetime.

The Origins of the Creche. Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 30 (1946), p. 251. While the term \\"nativity scene\\" may be used of any representation of the very common subject of the Nativity of Jesus in art, it has a more specialized sense referring to seasonal displays, either using model figures in a setting or reenactments called \\"living nativity scenes\\" (tableau vivant) in which real humans and animals participate. Nativity scenes exhibit figures representing the infant Jesus, his mother, Mary, and her husband, Joseph. Other characters from the nativity story, such as shepherds, sheep, and angels may be displayed near the manger in a barn (or cave) intended to accommodate farm animals, as described in the Gospel of Luke. A donkey and an ox are typically depicted in the scene, and the Magi and their camels, described in the Gospel of Matthew, are also included. Several cultures add other characters and objects that may or may not be Biblical. Saint Francis of Assisi is credited with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. He himself had recently been inspired by his visit to the Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes. Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world, and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy, and in the United States of America their inclusion on public lands or in public buildings has provoked court challenges.

The Birth of the Messiah. Doubleday, 1997.Vermes, Geza. The Nativity: History and Legend. Penguin, 2006 Luke's narrative describes an angel announcing the birth of Jesus to shepherds who then visit the humble site where Jesus is found lying in a manger, a trough for cattle feed.() Matthew's narrative tells of \\"wise men\\" ( ) who follow a star to the house where Jesus dwelt, and indicates that the Magi found Jesus some time later, less than two years after his birth, rather than on the exact day.() Matthew's account does not mention the angels and shepherds, while Luke's narrative is silent on the Magi and the star.

All Around the Year: Holidays and Celebrations in American Life. University of Illinois Press, 1995. . Pope Honorius III gave his blessing to the exhibit. Such reenactment pantomimes became hugely popular and spread throughout Christendom. Within a hundred years every church in Italy was expected to have a nativity scene at Christmastime. Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings. Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged others to do the same. The scene's popularity inspired much imitation in Catholic countries, and in the Early modern period sculpted cribs, often exported from Italy, were set up in Catholic churches and homes. These elaborate scenes reached their artistic apogee in the Papal state, in Emilia, in the Kingdom of Naples and in Genoa. By the end of the 19th century nativity scenes became popular beyond Catholic settings, and many versions in various sizes and made of various materials, such as terracotta, paper, wood, wax, and ivory, were marketed, often with a backdrop setting of a stable. Different traditions of nativity scenes emerged in different countries. Hand-painted santons are popular in Provence. In southern Germany, Austria and Trentino-Alto Adige the wood figurines are handcut. Colorful szopka are typical in Poland. A tradition in England involved baking a mince pie in the shape of a manger which would hold the Christ child until dinnertime, when the pie was eaten. When the Puritans banned Christmas celebrations in the 17th century, they also passed specific legislation to outlaw such pies, calling them \\"Idolaterie in crust\\". Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. The Vatican has displayed a scene in St. Peter's Square near its Christmas tree since 1982 and the Pope has for many years blessed the mangers of children assembled in St. Peter's Square for a special ceremony. In the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City annually displays a Neapolitan Baroque nativity scene before a blue spruce. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy. A life-sized scene in the United Kingdom featuring waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/thefts-are-common-during-the- holidays/article_003d47ef-2341-5e23-a806-9f851f6ea12c.html?mode=jqm Components=Static nativity scenes= Exhibition of several nativity scenes Static nativity scenes may be erected indoors or outdoors during the Christmas season, and are composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph. Other figures in the scene may include angels, shepherds, and various animals. The figures may be made of any material,Dues, Greg.Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide Twenty- Third Publications, 2000. and arranged in a stable or grotto. The Magi may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem. While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord. Outdoor nativity scene of life-sized figurines in Barcelona (2009) The nativity scene may not accurately reflect gospel events. With no basis in the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. The art form can be traced back to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed ladies and gentlemen of the nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or geese, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.\\"Neapolitan Crib: The crib and 1700s Naples.\\" .

After World War I, large, lighted manger scenes in churches and public buildings grew in popularity, and, by the 1950s, many companies were selling lawn ornaments of non-fading, long-lasting, weather resistant materials telling the nativity story. =Living nativity scenes= Living nativity in Sicily, which also contains a mock rural 19th-century village Living nativity in Bascara Pantomimes similar to the scene staged by St. Francis at Greccio became an annual event throughout Christendom. Abuses and exaggerations in the presentation of mystery plays during the Middle Ages, however, forced the church to prohibit performances during the 15th century. The plays survived outside church walls, and 300 years after the prohibition, German immigrants brought simple forms of the nativity play to America. Some features of the dramas became part of both Catholic and Protestant Christmas services with children often taking the parts of characters in the nativity story. Nativity plays and pageants, culminating in living nativity scenes, eventually entered public schools. Such exhibitions have been challenged on the grounds of separation of church and state. In some countries, the nativity scene took to the streets with human performers costumed as Joseph and Mary traveling from house to house seeking shelter and being told by the houses' occupants to move on. The couple's journey culminated in an outdoor tableau vivant at a designated place with the shepherds and the Magi then traveling the streets in parade fashion looking for the Christ child. Living nativity scenes are not without their problems. In the United States in 2008, for example, vandals destroyed all eight scenes and backdrops at a drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church's 500 members were involved in the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than US$2,000.Mehta, Hemant. \\"Would You Help Restore a Nativity Scene?\\" . The Friendly Atheist, December 13, 2008. Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint. In southern Italy, living nativity scenes (presepe vivente) are extremely popular. They may be elaborate affairs, featuring not only the classic nativity scene but also a mock rural 19th-century village, complete with artisans in traditional costumes working at their trades.

The Gospels do not mention an ox and donkeyHobgood-Oster, Laura. Holy Dogs and Asses: Animals in the Christian Tradition. University of Illinois Press, 2008. . Another source for the tradition may be the extracanonical text, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew of the 7th century.

The tradition of home Nativity scenes is often traced to the 1782 ban of church and institutional cr√®ches by emperor Joseph II, officially responding to public disturbances and the resulting \\"loss of dignity\\" of such displays. As this followed the Edict of Toleration proclaimed the previous year, it reduced State support of the Catholic church in this multi-confessional land. The issue of cost arose, and paper-cut cr√®ches (pap√≠rov√Ω betl√©m), \\"the cr√®che of the poor\\", became one major expression, as well as wood-carved ones, some of them spectacular as they grew in complexity and detail. Many among the major Czech artists, sculptors and illustrators have as a significant part of their legacy the cr√®ches that they created.

More than 100 human and angelic figures, along with animals, accessories, and architectural elements, cover 250 square feet and create a depiction of the Nativity as seen through the eyes of Neapolitan artisans and collectors. The Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual musical holiday stage show presented at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, features a Living Nativity segment with live animals. In 2005, President of the United States of America, George W. Bush and his wife, First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush displayed an 18th- century Italian presepio.

She remarked, \\"Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, I begged because I said I was an expert potter‚Äîceramicist actually‚Äîand could I please make the entire nativity scene.\\" She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.\\"Martha Built Nativity Scene in Prison\\".

In Australia, it's summer season and is very hot during Christmas time. During the Christmas time, locals and visitors visit places around their towns and suburbs to view the outdoor and indoor displays. All over the towns, the places are lit with colorful and modern spectacular lighting displays. The displays of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also evident. In Melbourne, a traditional and authentic Nativity Scene is on display at St. Elizabeth's Parish, Dandenong North. This annual Australian Nativity Scene creator and artist Wilson Fernandez has been building and creating the traditional nativity scenes since 2004 at St. Elizabeth's Parish. To mark this special event, Most Reverend Denis Hart Archbishop of Melbourne celebrated the Vigil Mass and blessed the Nativity Scene on Saturday, 14 December 2013. =In Canada= Bethlehem Live is an all- volunteer living nativity produced by Gateway Christian Community Church in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The production includes a reconstruction of the ancient town of Bethlehem and seven individual vignettes. There also happens to be an annual, highly publicized nativity scene at the St. Patrick's Basilica, Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario. Associations and notable collections The Universalis Foederatio Praesepistica, World association of Friends of Cribs was founded in 1952, counting today 20 national associations dedicated to this subject. The Central office is in Austria. In the United States and Canada Friends of the Creche has over 200 members, with a major conference every two years. FotC maintains a list of permanent exhibits of Nativity scenes in the United States and a list of permanent exhibits of Nativity scenes in other parts of the world. The Bavarian National Museum displays a notable collection of Nativity scenes from the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries. Every year in Lanciano, Abruzzo (Italy), a Nativity Scene exhibition (called in Italian \\"Riscopriamo il presepe\\") takes place at Auditorium Diocleziano, usually until the 6th of January. An average of one hundred Nativity scenes are shown, coming from every region of Italy. There are also many Nativity scenes made by local kindergarten, primary, secondary and high school.

Christmas in the White House. The Westminster Press, 1983. When the ACLU claimed the government sponsorship of a distinctly Christian symbol violated separation of church and state, the sponsors of the fifty-year-old Christmas celebration, Pageant of Peace, who had an exclusive permit from the Interior Department for all events on the Ellipse, responded that the nativity scene was a reminder of America's spiritual heritage. The United States Court of Appeals ruled on December 12, 1969, that the cr√®che be allowed that year. The case continued until September 26, 1973, when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and found the involvement of the Interior Department and the National Park Service in the Pageant of Peace amounted to government support for religion. The court opined that the nativity scene should be dropped from the pageant or the government end its participation in the event in order to avoid \\"excessive entanglements\\" between government and religion. In 1973, the nativity scene vanished. Nativity scenes are permitted on public lands in the United States as long as equal time is given to non-religious symbols. In 1985, the United States Supreme Court ruled in ACLU v. Scarsdale, New York that nativity scenes on public lands violate separation of church and state statutes unless they comply with \\"The Reindeer Rule\\"‚Äîa regulation calling for equal opportunity for non-religious symbols, such as reindeer.Comfort, David. Just Say Noel: A History of Christmas from the Nativity to the Nineties. Simon and Schuster, 1995. . This principle was further clarified in 1989, when the Supreme Court in County of Allegheny v. ACLU ruled that a cr√®che placed on the grand staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, PA violated the Establishment Clause, because the \\"principal or primary effect\\" of the display was to advance religion. In 1994, at Christmas, the Park Board of San Jose, California, removed a statue of the infant Jesus from Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park and replaced it with a statue of the plumed Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl, commissioned with US$500,000 of public funds. In response, protestors staged a living nativity scene in the park. In 2006, a lawsuit by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Christian group in the United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.\\"Nonbelievers' sign at Capitol counters Nativity\\" . Seattle Times. December 2, 2008. In 2013, Gov. Rick Perry signed into Texas law the Merry Christmas bill which would allow school districts in Texas to display nativity scenes.

He served as the Governor of Rhode Island from 1866 to 1869, and as a United States Senator for Rhode Island from 1875 until his death. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he conducted successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee, as well as countering the raids of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, but suffered disastrous defeats at the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of the Crater. His distinctive style of facial hair became known as sideburns, derived from his last name. In 1871, he became the first president of the National Rifle Association, holding the office until 1872. Early life Burnside was born in Liberty, Indiana, and was the fourth of nine childrenMarvel, p. 3. of Edghill and Pamela (or Pamilia) Brown Burnside, a family of Scottish origin.Mierka, np. The original spelling of his middle name was Everts, for Dr. Sylvanus Everts, the physician who delivered him. Ambrose Everts was also the name of Edghill's and Pamela's first child, who died a few months before the future general was born. The name was misspelled as \\"Everett\\" during his enrollment at West Point, and he did not correct the record. His great-great-grandfather Robert Burnside (1725‚Äì1775) was born in Scotland and settled in the Province of South Carolina. His father was a native of South Carolina; he was a slave owner who freed his slaves when he relocated to Indiana. Ambrose attended Liberty Seminary as a young boy, but his education was interrupted when his mother died in 1841; he was apprenticed to a local tailor, eventually becoming a partner in the business.Mierka, np., describes the relationship with the tailor as indentured servitude. As a young officer before the Civil War Burnside was engaged to Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Moon, who left him at the altar. When the minister asked if she took him as her husband, Moon is said to have shouted \\"No siree Bob!\\" before running out of the church. Moon is best known for her espionage for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Later, Burnside arrested Moon, her younger sister Virginia \\"Ginnie\\" Moon, and their mother. He kept them under house arrest for months but never charged them with espionage. Early military career He obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1843 through his father's political connections and his own interest in military affairs; Caleb Blood Smith recounted Burnside's brash application to the military academy. He graduated in 1847, ranking 18th in a class of 47, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. He traveled to Veracruz for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but he arrived after hostilities had ceased and performed mostly garrison duty around Mexico City.Eicher, pp. 155‚Äì56; Sauers, pp. 327‚Äì28; Warner, pp. 57‚Äì58; Wilson, np. At the close of the war, Lt. Burnside served two years on the western frontier under Captain Braxton Bragg in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, a light artillery unit that had been converted to cavalry duty, protecting the Western mail routes through Nevada to California. In August 1849, he was wounded by an arrow in his neck during a skirmish against Apaches in Las Vegas, New Mexico. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on December 12, 1851. Mrs. Burnside, Mary Richmond Bishop In 1852, he was assigned to Fort Adams, Newport, Rhode Island, and he married Mary Richmond Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, on April 27 of that year. The marriage lasted until Mary's death in 1876, but was childless.Eicher, pp. 155‚Äì56; Mierka, np.; Warner, pp. 57‚Äì58. In October 1853, Burnside resigned his commission in the United States Army and was appointed commander of the Rhode Island state militia with the rank of major general. He held this position for two years. After leaving the Regular Army, Burnside devoted his time and energy to the manufacture of the famous firearm that bears his name: the Burnside carbine. President Buchanan's Secretary of War John B. Floyd contracted the Burnside Arms Company to equip a large portion of the Army with his carbine, mostly cavalry and induced him to establish extensive factories for its manufacture. The Bristol Rifle Works were no sooner complete than another gunmaker allegedly bribed Floyd to break his $100,000 contract with Burnside. Burnside ran as a Democrat for one of the Congressional seats in Rhode Island in 1858 and was defeated in a landslide. The burdens of the campaign and the destruction by fire of his factory contributed to his financial ruin, and he was forced to assign his firearm patents to others. He then went west in search of employment and became treasurer of the Illinois Central Railroad, where he worked for and became friendly with George B. McClellan, who later became one of his commanding officers.Eicher, pp. 155‚Äì56; Mierka, np.; Sauers, pp. 327‚Äì28; Warner, pp. 57‚Äì58. Civil War General Ambrose Burnside. =First Bull Run= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Burnside was a colonel in the Rhode Island Militia. He raised the 1st Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was appointed its colonel on May 2, 1861.Combined Military Service Record Two companies of this regiment were then armed with Burnside Carbines. Within a month, he ascended to brigade command in the Department of northeast Virginia. He commanded the brigade without distinction at the First Battle of Bull Run in July and took over division command temporarily for wounded Brig. Gen. David Hunter. His 90-day regiment was mustered out of service on August 2; he was promoted to brigadier-general of volunteers on August 6 and was assigned to train provisional brigades in the Army of the Potomac. Burnside (seated, center) and officers of the 1st Rhode Island at Camp Sprague, Rhode Island, 1861 =North Carolina= Burnside commanded the Coast Division or North Carolina Expeditionary Force from September 1861 until July 1862, three brigades assembled in Annapolis, Maryland which formed the nucleus for his future IX Corps. He conducted a successful amphibious campaign that closed more than 80% of the North Carolina sea coast to Confederate shipping for the remainder of the war. This included the Battle of Elizabeth City, fought on 10 February 1862 on the Pasquotank River near Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The participants were vessels of the United States Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet; the latter were supported by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb's Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle was a part of the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. The result was a Union victory, with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.Mierka, np. Burnside was promoted to major general of volunteers on March 18, 1862, in recognition of his successes at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern, the first significant Union victories in the Eastern Theater. In July, his forces were transported north to Newport News, Virginia and became the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside was offered command of the Army of the Potomac following Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign.Marvel, pp. 99‚Äì100. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan and the fact that he understood his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope's abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later played a significant role in Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a witness.Marvel, pp. 209‚Äì10. Burnside again declined command following Pope's debacle at Second Bull Run.Sauers, pp. 327‚Äì28; Wilson, np. =Antietam= Burnside Bridge at Antietam in 2005 Burnside was given command of the Right Wing of the Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) at the start of the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan separated the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority and acted as though the corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called Burnside's Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.Bailey, pp. 120‚Äì21. Burnside did not perform an adequate reconnaissance of the area, and he did not take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge, which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on the high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward, ordering one aide, \\"Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.\\" He further increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: \\"McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.\\"Sears, pp. 264‚Äì65. The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements, and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.Bailey, pp. 126‚Äì39. =Fredericksburg= Union General Ambrose Burnside, 1862 McClellan was removed after failing to pursue General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Antietam, and Burnside was assigned to command the Army of the Potomac on November 7, 1862. He reluctantly obeyed this order, the third such in his brief career, in part because the courier told him that, if he refused it, the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked. President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and approved his plan on November 14 to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13. His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid, but the attack was delayed by his planning in marshaling pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River, as well as his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points. This allowed Gen. Lee to concentrate along Marye's Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks. Assaults south of town were also mismanaged, which were supposed to be the main avenue of attack, and initial Union breakthroughs went unsupported. Burnside was upset by the failure of his plan and by the enormous casualties of his repeated, futile frontal assaults, and declared that he would personally lead an assault by the IX corps. His corps commanders talked him out of it, but relations were strained between the general and his subordinates. Accepting full blame, he offered to retire from the U.S. Army, but this was refused. Burnside's detractors labeled him the \\"Butcher of Fredericksburg\\".William Palmer Hopkins, The Seventh Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers in the Civil War 1862‚Äì1865. Providence, RI: The Providence Press, 1903, p. 56. In January 1863, Burnside launched a second offensive against Lee, but it bogged down in winter rains before anything was accomplished, and has derisively been called the Mud March. In its wake, he asked that several openly insubordinate officers be relieved of duty and court-martialed; he also offered to resign. Lincoln chose the latter option, and on January 26 replaced Burnside with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, one of the officers who had conspired against him.Wilson, np.; Warner, p. 58; Sauers, p. 328. =East Tennessee= Burnside offered to resign his commission altogether but Lincoln declined, stating that there could still be a place for him in the army. Thus, he was placed back at the head of the IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there. However, antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding \\"the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration\\" in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that \\"any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines\\". On May 1, 1863, Ohio Congressman Clement L. Vallandigham, a prominent opponent of the war, held a large public rally in Mount Vernon, Ohio in which he denounced President Lincoln as a \\"tyrant\\" who sought to abolish the Constitution and set up a dictatorship. Burnside had dispatched several agents to the rally who took down notes and brought back their \\"evidence\\" to the general, who then declared that it was sufficient grounds to arrest Vallandigham for treason. A military court tried him and found him guilty of violating General Order No. 38, despite his protests that he was simply expressing his opinions in public. Vallandigham was sentenced to imprisonment for the duration of the war and was turned into a martyr by antiwar Democrats. Burnside next turned his attention to Illinois, where the Chicago Times newspaper had been printing antiwar editorials for months. The general dispatched a squadron of troops to the paper's offices and ordered them to cease printing. Lincoln had not been asked or informed about either Vallandigham's arrest or the closure of the Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided that it was a good idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.McPherson, pp. 596‚Äì97. McPherson remarked that Burnside's \\"political judgment proved no more subtle than his military judgment at Fredericksburg.\\" Burnside also dealt with Confederate raiders such as John Hunt Morgan. In the Knoxville Campaign, Burnside advanced to Knoxville, Tennessee, first bypassing the Confederate-held Cumberland Gap and ultimately occupying Knoxville unopposed; he then sent troops back to the Cumberland Gap. Confederate commander Brig. Gen. John W. Frazer refused to surrender in the face of two Union brigades but Burnside arrived with a third, forcing the surrender of Frazer and 2,300 Confederates.Korn, p. 104. Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans was defeated at the Battle of Chickamauga, and Burnside was pursued by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, against whose troops he had battled at Marye's Heights. Burnside skillfully outmaneuvered Longstreet at the Battle of Campbell's Station and was able to reach his entrenchments and safety in Knoxville, where he was briefly besieged until the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Fort Sanders outside the city. Tying down Longstreet's corps at Knoxville contributed to Gen. Braxton Bragg's defeat by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Chattanooga. Troops under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman marched to Burnside's aid, but the siege had already been lifted; Longstreet withdrew, eventually returning to Virginia. =Overland Campaign= Burnside was ordered to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built it up to a strength of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland.Grimsley, p. 245, n. 43. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.Esposito, text for map 120. Burnside fought at the battles of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, where he did not perform in a distinguished manner,Grimsley, p. 230, describes Burnside's conduct as \\"inept.\\" Rhea, p. 317: \\"[Burnside's] failings were so flagrant that the Army talked about them openly. He stumbled badly in the Wilderness and worse still at Spotsylvania.\\" attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to the frontal assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took his place in the siege lines at Petersburg.Wilson, np. =The Crater= Petersburg Crater with Union soldier in 1865 As the two armies faced the stalemate of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside agreed to a plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: to dig a mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in what is known as the Battle of the Crater. Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for the assault. Instead, he was forced to use untrained white troops. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots. The division chosen by chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, who failed to brief the men on what was expected of them and was reported during the battle to be getting drunk in a bombproof shelter well behind the lines, providing no leadership. Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, became trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties. Burnside was relieved of command on August 14 and sent on \\"extended leave\\" by Grant. He was never recalled to duty for the remainder of the war. A court of inquiry later placed the blame for the Crater fiasco on Burnside and his subordinates. In December, Burnside met with President Lincoln and General Grant about his future. He was contemplating resignation, but Lincoln and Grant requested that he remain in the Army. At the end of the interview, Burnside wrote, \\"I was not informed of any duty upon which I am to be placed.\\" He finally resigned his commission on April 15, 1865, after Lee's surrender at Appomattox.Wert, pp. 385‚Äì86; Mierka, np.; Eicher, pp. 155‚Äì56. The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside and placed the blame for the Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for requiring the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) men to be withdrawn. Postbellum career Burnside's grave in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, Rhode Island After his resignation, Burnside was employed in numerous railroad and industrial directorships, including the presidencies of the Cincinnati and Martinsville Railroad, the Indianapolis and Vincennes Railroad, the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad, and the Rhode Island Locomotive Works. He was elected to three one-year terms as Governor of Rhode Island, serving from May 29, 1866, to May 25, 1869. He was nominated by the Republican Party to be their candidate for governor in March 1866, and Burnside was elected governor in a landslide on April 4, 1866. This began Burnside's political career as a Republican, as he had previously been a Democrat before the war . Burnside was a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of Union officers and their descendants, and served as the Junior Vice Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery in 1869. He was commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) veterans' association from 1871 to 1872, and also served as the Commander of the Department of Rhode Island of the GAR.Eicher, pp. 155‚Äì56. At its inception in 1871, the National Rifle Association chose him as its first president. During a visit to Europe in 1870, Burnside attempted to mediate between the French and the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War. He was registered at the offices of Drexel, Harjes & Co., Geneva, week ending November 5, 1870.\\"Americans in London\\". New York Times, December 14, 1870, p. 6c, last line. Drexel Harjes was a major lender to the new French government after the war, helping it to repay its massive war reparations. In 1876 Burnside was elected as commander of the New England Battalion of the Centennial Legion, the title of a collection of 13 militia units from the original 13 states, which participated in the parade in Philadelphia on July 4, 1876, to mark the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.New York Times March 16, 1876. In 1874 Burnside was elected by the Rhode Island Senate as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, was re-elected in 1880, and served until his death in 1881. Burnside continued his association with the Republican Party, playing a prominent role in military affairs as well as serving as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1881.Wilson, np.; Eicher, p. 156. Burnside died suddenly of \\"neuralgia of the heart\\" (Angina pectoris) at Bristol, Rhode Island, and is buried in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, Rhode Island. An equestrian statue in his honor was erected in the late 19th century in Burnside Park in Providence. Assessment and legacy Personally, Burnside was always very popular, both in the army and in politics. He made friends easily, smiled a lot, and remembered everyone's name. His professional military reputation, however, was less positive, and he was known for being obstinate, unimaginative, and unsuited both intellectually and emotionally for high command.Goolrick, p. 29. Grant stated that he was \\"unfitted\\" for the command of an army and that no one knew this better than Burnside himself. Knowing his capabilities, he twice refused command of the Army of the Potomac, accepting only the third time when the courier told him that otherwise the command would go to Joseph Hooker. Jeffry D. Wert described Burnside's relief after Fredericksburg in a passage that sums up his military career:Wert, p. 217. Bruce Catton summarized Burnside:Catton, pp. 256‚Äì57. =Sideburns= Burnside was noted for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair in front of his ears to his mustache but with the chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns. Equestrian monument in Burnside Park, Providence, Rhode Island.

Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. Hooker had served in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, receiving three brevet promotions, before resigning from the Army. At the start of the Civil War, he joined the Union side as a brigadier general, distinguishing himself at Williamsburg, Antietam and Fredericksburg, after which he was given command of the Army of the Potomac. His ambitious plan for Chancellorsville was thwarted by Lee's bold move in dividing his army and routing a Union corps, as well as by mistakes on the part of Hooker's subordinate generals and his own loss of nerve. The defeat handed Lee the initiative, which allowed him to travel north to Gettysburg. Hooker was kept in command, but when General Halleck and Lincoln declined his request for reinforcements, he resigned. George G. Meade was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac three days before Gettysburg. Hooker returned to combat in November 1863, helping to relieve the besieged Union Army at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and continuing in the Western Theater under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, but departed in protest before the end of the Atlanta Campaign when he was passed over for promotion. Hooker became known as \\"Fighting Joe\\" following a journalist's clerical error, and the nickname stuck. His personal reputation was as a hard-drinking ladies' man, and his headquarters were known for parties and gambling. Early years Hooker was born in Hadley, Massachusetts, the grandson of a captain in the American Revolutionary War. He was of entirely English ancestry, all of whom had been in New England since the early 1600s.Homes of the Massachusetts ancestors of Major General Joseph Hooker, By Isaac Paul Gragg His initial schooling was at the local Hopkins Academy. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1837, ranked 29th out of a class of 50, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery.Eicher, p. 303. His initial assignment was in Florida fighting in the second of the Seminole Wars. He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in staff positions in the campaigns of both Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. He received brevet promotions for his staff leadership and gallantry in three battles: Monterrey (to captain), National Bridge (major), and Chapultepec (lieutenant colonel). His future Army reputation as a ladies' man began in Mexico, where local girls referred to him as the \\"Handsome Captain\\".Smith, np. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (which ended in 1848), he served as assistant adjutant general of the Pacific Division, but resigned his commission in 1853; his military reputation had been damaged when he testified against his former commander, General Scott, in the court-martial for insubordination of Gideon Johnson Pillow. Hooker struggled with the tedium of peacetime life, and reportedly passed the time with liquor, ladies, and gambling. He settled in Sonoma County, California, as a farmer and land developer, and ran unsuccessfully for election to represent the region in the California legislature.Timeline of Hooker's life, Sonoma League He was obviously unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because, in 1858, he wrote to Secretary of War John B. Floyd to request that his name \\"be presented to the president Buchanan as a candidate for a lieutenant colonelcy\\", but nothing came of his request. From 1859 to 1861, he held a commission as a colonel in the California militia.Eicher, p. 304. Civil War At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Hooker requested a commission, but his first application was rejected, possibly because of the lingering resentment harbored by Winfield Scott, general-in-chief of the Army. He had to borrow money to make the trip east from California. After he witnessed the Union Army defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, he wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln that complained of military mismanagement, promoted his own qualifications, and again requested a commission. He was appointed, in August 1861, as brigadier general of volunteers to rank from May 17. He commanded a brigade and then division around Washington, D.C., as part of the effort to organize and train the new Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil- war/joseph-hooker =1862= Major General Joseph Hooker, 1862. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress. Photograph by Mathew Brady In the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, Hooker commanded the 2nd Division of the III Corps and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields. He led his division with distinction at Williamsburg and at Seven Pines. Hooker's division did not play a major role in the Seven Days Battles, although he and fellow division commander Phil Kearny tried unsuccessfully to urge McClellan to counterattack the Confederates. He chafed at the cautious generalship of McClellan and openly criticized his failure to capture Richmond. Of his commander, Hooker said, \\"He is not only not a soldier, but he does not know what soldiership is.\\" The Peninsula cemented two further reputations of Hooker's: his devotion to the welfare and morale of his men, and his hard drinking social life, even on the battlefield. On July 26, Hooker was promoted to major general, to rank from May 5. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, the III Corps was sent to reinforce John Pope's Army of Virginia. Following Second Bull Run, Hooker replaced Irvin McDowell as commander of the Army of Virginia's III Corps, soon redesignated the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. During the Maryland Campaign, Hooker led the I Corps at South Mountain and at Antietam, his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in American history, driving south into the corps of Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson, where they fought each other to a standstill. Hooker, aggressive and inspiring to his men, left the battle early in the morning with a foot wound. He asserted that the battle would have been a decisive Union victory if he had managed to stay on the field, but General McClellan's caution once again failed the Northern troops and Lee's much smaller army eluded destruction. With his patience at an end, President Lincoln replaced McClellan with Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Although Hooker had criticized McClellan persistently, the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early October, shortly before his termination, had recommended that Hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army. The War Department promptly acted on this recommendation, and Hooker received his brigadier's commission to rank from September 20. This promotion ensured that he would remain a general after the war was over and not revert to the rank of captain or lieutenant colonel. The December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg was another Union debacle. Upon recovering from his foot wound, Hooker was briefly made commander of V Corps, but was then promoted to \\"Grand Division\\" command, with a command that consisted of both III and V Corps. Hooker derided Burnside's plan to assault the fortified heights behind the city, deeming them \\"preposterous\\". His Grand Division (particularly V Corps) suffered serious losses in fourteen futile assaults ordered by Burnside over Hooker's protests. Burnside followed up this battle with the humiliating Mud March in January and Hooker's criticism of his commander bordered on formal insubordination. He described Burnside as a \\"wretch ... of blundering sacrifice.\\" Burnside planned a wholesale purge of his subordinates, including Hooker, and drafted an order for the president's approval. He stated that Hooker was \\"unfit to hold an important commission during a crisis like the present.\\" But Lincoln's patience had again run out and he removed Burnside instead. =Army of the Potomac= Major General Joseph Hooker Lincoln appointed Hooker to command of the Army of the Potomac on January 26, 1863. Some members of the army saw this move as inevitable, given Hooker's reputation for aggressive fighting, something sorely lacking in his predecessors. During the \\"Mud March\\" Hooker was quoted by a New York Times army correspondent as saying that \\"Nothing would go right until we had a dictator, and the sooner the better.\\"Sears, Chancellorsville, p. 21. Lincoln wrote a letter to the newly appointed general, part of which stated, During the spring of 1863, Hooker established a reputation as an outstanding administrator and restored the morale of his soldiers, which had plummeted to a new low under Burnside. Among his changes were fixes to the daily diet of the troops, camp sanitary changes, improvements and accountability of the quartermaster system, addition of and monitoring of company cooks, several hospital reforms, and an improved furlough system (one man per company by turn, 10 days each). He also implemented corps badges as a means of identifying units during battle or when marching and to instill unit pride in the men. Other orders addressed the need to stem rising desertion (one from Lincoln combined with incoming mail review, the ability to shoot deserters, and better camp picket lines), more and better drills, stronger officer training, and for the first time, combining the federal cavalry into a single corps.Catton, pp. 141-47. The corps badge idea was suggested by Hooker's chief of staff, Daniel Butterfield (Sears, Chancellorsville, p. 72). Hooker said of his revived army: Also during this winter Hooker made several high-level command changes, including with his corps commanders. Both \\"Left Grand Division\\" commander Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, who vowed that he would not serve under Hooker, and II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner were relieved of command, on Burnside's recommendation, in the same order appointing Hooker to command. The IX Corps was a potential source of embarrassment or friction within the army because it was Burnside's old corps, so it was detached as a separate organization and sent to the Virginia Peninsula under the command of Brig. Gen. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith, former commander of VI Corps. (Both Franklin and Smith were considered suspect by Hooker because of their previous political maneuvering against Burnside and on behalf of McClellan.)Catton, p. 147; Sears, Chancellorsville, p 61. For the important position of chief of staff, Hooker asked the War Department to send him Brig. Gen. Charles Stone, however this was denied. Stone had been relieved, arrested, and imprisoned for his role in the Battle of Ball's Bluff in the fall of 1861, despite the lack of any trial. Stone did not receive a command upon his release, mostly due to political pressures, which left him militarily exiled and disgraced. Army of the Potomac historian and author Bruce Catton termed this request by Hooker \\"a strange and seemingly uncharacteristic thing\\" and \\"one of the most interesting things he ever did.\\"Catton, pp. 147-49. Hooker never explained why he asked for Stone, but Catton believed: Despite this, Fighting Joe would set a very bad example for the conduct of generals and their staffs and subordinates. His headquarters in Falmouth, Virginia, was described by cavalry officer Charles F. Adams, Jr., as being a combination of a \\"bar-room and a brothel\\".Foote, pp. 233-34/ He built a network of loyal political cronies that included Maj. Gen. Dan Butterfield for chief of staff, and the notorious political general, Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles, for command of the III Corps. Chancellorsville General \\"Fightin' Joe\\" Hooker Union General Joseph Hooker (seated 2nd to right) and his staff, 1863 Hooker's plan for the spring and summer campaign was both elegant and promising. He first planned to send his cavalry corps deep into the enemy's rear, disrupting supply lines and distracting him from the main attack. He would pin down Robert E. Lee's much smaller army at Fredericksburg, while taking the large bulk of the Army of the Potomac on a flanking march to strike Lee in his rear. Defeating Lee, he could move on to seize Richmond. Unfortunately for Hooker and the Union, the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself. The cavalry raid was conducted cautiously by its commander, Brig. Gen. George Stoneman, and met none of its objectives. The flanking march went well enough, achieving strategic surprise, but when he attempted to advance with three columns, Stonewall Jackson's surprise attack on May 1 pushed Hooker back and caused him to withdraw his troops. From there, Hooker pulled his army back to Chancellorsville and waited for Lee to attack. Lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of Hooker's army. Then, he split again, sending Stonewall Jackson's corps on its own flanking march, striking Hooker's exposed right flank and routing the Union XI Corps. The Army of the Potomac dropped into a purely defensive mode and eventually was forced to retreat. The Battle of Chancellorsville has been called \\"Lee's perfect battle\\" because of his ability to vanquish a much larger foe through audacious tactics. Part of Hooker's failure can be attributed to an encounter with a cannonball; while he was standing on the porch of his headquarters, the missile struck a wooden column against which he was leaning, initially knocking him senseless, and then putting him out of action for the rest of the day with a concussion. Despite his incapacitation, he refused entreaties to turn over temporary command of the army to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch. Several of his subordinate generals, including Couch and Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, openly questioned Hooker's command decisions. Couch was so disgusted that he refused to ever serve under Hooker again. Political winds blew strongly in the following weeks as generals maneuvered to overthrow Hooker or to position themselves if Lincoln decided on his own to do so. Robert E. Lee once again began an invasion of the North, in June 1863, and Lincoln urged Hooker to pursue and defeat him. Hooker's initial plan was to seize Richmond instead, but Lincoln immediately vetoed that idea, so the Army of the Potomac began to march north, attempting to locate Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it slipped down the Shenandoah Valley into Pennsylvania. Hooker's mission was first to protect Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and second to intercept and defeat Lee. Unfortunately, Lincoln was losing any remaining confidence he had in Hooker. Hooker's senior officers expressed to Lincoln their lack of confidence in Hooker, as did Henry Halleck, Lincoln's General-in-chief.Sears, Stephen W.,Gettysburg, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, Boston- New York, 2003, pg 19 When Hooker got into a dispute with Army headquarters over the status of defensive forces in Harpers Ferry, he impulsively offered his resignation in protest, which was quickly accepted by Lincoln and General- in-chief Henry W. Halleck. On June 28, 1863, three days before the climactic Battle of Gettysburg, Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. George Meade. Hooker received the Thanks of Congress for his role at the start of the Gettysburg Campaign,Eicher, p. 304; Thanks of Congress partial text: \\"...to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker... for the skill, energy, and endurance which first covered Washington and Baltimore from the meditated blow of the advancing and powerful army of rebels led by General Robert E. Lee....\\" but the glory would go to Meade. Hooker's tenure as head of the Army of the Potomac had lasted 5 months. =Western Theater= Hooker and his staff at Lookout Mountain Hooker's military career was not ended by his poor performance in the summer of 1863. He went on to regain a reputation as a solid corps commander when he was transferred with the XI and XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac westward to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland around Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hooker was in command at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, playing an important role in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's decisive victory at the Battle of Chattanooga. He was brevetted to major general in the regular army for his success at Chattanooga, but he was disappointed to find that Grant's official report of the battle credited his friend William Tecumseh Sherman's contribution over Hooker's. Hooker led his corps (now designated the XX Corps) competently in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign under Sherman, but asked to be relieved before the capture of the city because of his dissatisfaction with the promotion of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard to command of the Army of the Tennessee, upon the death of Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Not only did Hooker have seniority over Howard, but he also blamed Howard in large part for his defeat at Chancellorsville (Howard had commanded the XI Corps, which had borne the brunt of Jackson's flank attack). Hooker's biographer reports that there were numerous stories indicating that Abraham Lincoln attempted to intercede with Sherman, urging that Hooker be appointed to command the Army of the Tennessee, but Sherman threatened to resign if the president insisted. However, due to \\"obvious gaps\\" in the Official Records, the story cannot be verified.Hebert, p. 285. After leaving Georgia, Hooker commanded the Northern Department (comprising the states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois), headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, from October 1, 1864, until the end of the war. While in Cincinnati he married Olivia Groesbeck, sister of Congressman William S. Groesbeck. Final years Hooker's equestrian statue at Massachusetts State House General Hooker's Quickstep, sheet music, 19th century After the war, Hooker led Lincoln's funeral procession in Springfield on May 4, 1865. He served in command of the Department of the East and Department of the Lakes following the war. His postbellum life was marred by poor health and he was partially paralyzed by a stroke. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on September 1, 1866, and retired from the U.S. Army on October 15, 1868, with the regular army rank of major general. He died on October 31, 1879, while on a visit to Garden City, New York, and is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio, his wife's home town. Legacy Hooker was popularly known as \\"Fighting Joe\\" Hooker, a nickname he regretted deeply; he said, \\"People will think I am a highwayman or a bandit.\\"\\"Hooker's Comments on Chancellorsville\\", Battles and Leaders, Vol. III, p. 217. When a newspaper dispatch arrived in New York during the Peninsula Campaign, a typographical error changed an entry \\"Fighting ‚Äî Joe Hooker Attacks Rebels\\" to remove the dash and the name stuck.Foote, p. 234. Robert E. Lee occasionally referred to him as \\"Mr. F. J. Hooker\\" in a mildly sarcastic jab at his opponent. Hooker's reputation as a hard-drinking ladies' man was established through rumors in the pre-Civil War Army and has been cited by a number of popular histories.See, for example, Catton, p. 134, \\"a profane, hard-drinking soldier\\", and Foote, p. 233. Biographer Walter H. Hebert describe the general's personal habits as the \\"subject of much debate\\"Hebert, p. 65. although there was little debate in the popular opinion of the time. His men parodied Hooker in the popular war song Marching Along. The lines were replaced by Historian Stephen W. Sears, however, states that there is no basis to the claims that Hooker was a heavy drinker or that he was ever intoxicated on the battlefield.Sears, Chancellorsville, pp. 54‚Äì55, 60, 505‚Äì506. There is a popular legend that \\"hooker\\" as a slang term for a prostitute is derived from his last nameHebert, p. vii. because of parties and a lack of military discipline at his headquarters near the Murder Bay district of Washington, DC. Some versions of the legend claim that the band of prostitutes that followed his division were derisively referred to as \\"General Hooker's Army\\" or \\"Hooker's Brigade.\\"See, for example, Loudoun County, Virginia, history website. However, the term \\"hooker\\" was used in print as early as 1845, years before Hooker was a public figure,World Wide Words website and is likely derived from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the Corlear's Hook area of Manhattan in the early to middle 19th century, who came to be referred to as \\"hookers\\".Burrows, Edwin G. & Mike Wallace. Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 484 The prevalence of the Hooker legend may have been at least partly responsible for the popularity of the term.The Word Detective website, May 20, 2003, issue . There is some evidence that an area in Washington, DC, known for prostitution during the Civil War, was referred to as \\"Hooker's Division\\". The name was shortened to \\"The Division\\" when he spent time there after First Bull Run guarding D.C. from incursion.Ghosts of D.C. website, accessed September 10, 2013. There is an equestrian statue of General Hooker outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston, and Hooker County in Nebraska is named for him.
