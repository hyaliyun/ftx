She studied art in Newark, New Jersey and New York City and then taught art in the Massachusetts towns of Charlestown and Auburndale. In the 1850s she taught at the School of Design in Worcester, Massachusetts with her friend and artist Elizabeth Gardner. In 1856 she went to Europe, where she studied art in D√ºsseldorf (where she studied with Adolf Schroedter and Wilhelm Camphausen) and Paris. In 1869 she married Colonel Abram Morrell but continued to live with Gardner. In 1879 she became a widow. In 1876 she moved to Washington, D.C. She was a very active member of the art community. While in Washington, D.C. she was a founding member of the National Academy of Fine Arts. She was the director of the National Academy of Fine arts for the next ten years.  Career  Imogene Robinson Morrell was a history painter. Her paintings were patriotic and contained images of historical figures, often with horses. Two of her most praised paintings, Washington Welcoming the Provision Trains and First Battle of the Puritans, were exhibited in 1876 at the National Academy of Design in New York City. She painted portraits of a number of famous people, including General John A. Dix,U.S. Senate: Dix, John Adams John C. Spencer,John C. Spencer (1843 ‚Äì 1844), U.S. Department of the Treasury Howell Cobb,Howell Cobb (1857 ‚Äì 1860), U.S. Department of the Treasury Mrs. Cleveland, Collis P. Huntington, W. W. Corcoran, and U. S. President Garfield. Her portrait of General John A. Dix hangs in the United States Capitol Building. In 1876, The Boston Journal said of her paintings, \\"They are spoken of in terms of the highest admiration by artists and art- critics, both home and abroad. They are the result of long years of study and labor, under the first masters in France and Germany, and show great genius, inspired by patriotic enthusiasm...The composition is strictly original in all its details: each figure and every animal was painted from a living model, after the strictest rules of genuine art.\\" That same year, the Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine wrote, \\"Mrs. Morrell's pictures have great and positive merits. They should get fame for any artist. It seems a little pitiful to say that they are wonderful for a woman. Let us rather say that they are honestly and faithfully executed works; that they are not above criticism, and that they do credit to American art.\\"  Later years and death  In 1896 more than 200 of her paintings in a Washington, D.C. warehouse were destroyed by fire, leaving her destitute. After the fire she was supported by her friend, Elizabeth Gardner Bougereau. Morrell died in Washington, D.C. in 1908.

The barriers for Korean and Japanese war brides were removed by a 1947 amendment. According to Aaron D. Horton, nearly 45,000 foreign-born women entered the United States under the act. Fianc√©s who did not marry after arriving in the United States were subject to deportation. Furthermore, most women who immigrated were of European descent. But many Asian women, especially large numbers of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino women, also entered the United States under the act, who previously were unable to immigrate due to strict quotas on Asian immigration. Under the act, women who entered the United States and married within three months of entering received permanent immigrant status.

It focused on video games and culture, but also included articles based on entertainment. The name is based on the infamous video game term of the same name. In 2009, both Warren and Dahlen were former writers for Pitchfork when they decided to found the magazine. After a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the magazine, the first issue was released in March 2010. After partnerships with Pitchfork, StoryCode and Film Society of Lincoln Center, the magazine eventually founded an annual video game conference, two5six, in 2013. The magazine's website did a redesign in January 2014 and the print magazine itself was redesigned and overhauled after a second successful Kickstarter campaign in November 2015. In 2016, two5six's name was changed to Kill Screen Festival. After 2016, Kill Screen ceased publication, and its website went defunct around the same time. As of 2020, its website belongs to an unrelated publication.  Overview  Kill Screen was a print and online magazine that specialized in literary video games journalism. The magazine originally planned to publish think pieces rather than breaking news. PSFK described the magazine's demographic as \\"25‚Äì34-year-old wealthy, urban, culturally elite males\\". Some of the magazine's authors had previously written for The New Yorker, GQ, Los Angeles Times, The Onion and The Daily Show.  History  The magazine was founded by Jamin Warren and Chris Dahlen, who both wrote for Pitchfork. In a discussion at the March 2009 Game Developers Conference, the two discussed the lack of \\"high-end, intellectual\\" magazines about video games and non-blog writers in the style of Tom Wolfe and Chuck Klosterman. Brophy- Warren and Dahlen decided to start Kill Screen. They sought for the magazine to mirror what Rolling Stone and Wired established in their respective industries. Anthony Smyrski of Swindle served as the magazine's creative director. The magazine's authors had previously written for The New Yorker, GQ, Los Angeles Times, The Onion, and The Daily Show. The magazine was originally crowdfunded through Kickstarter in late 2009. The print magazine was redesigned in 2015.  Reception  The New Yorker praised Kill Screen for its intuitiveness and described it as \\"the McSweeney's of interactive media\\". PSFK called Kill Screen a \\"novel and elegant twist on modern publishing\\" with the feel of Monocle and impressive design and writers, and compared it as \\"Rolling Stone was to rock'n'roll or what Wired was to tech\\". Time compared the magazine to Salon, but for video games and rated it among the best magazines/blogs of 2011 and praised their review of L.A. Noire, stating that it could help legitimize the video games medium. Ars Technica praised the game's layout and composition for its price, stating that \\"the dives are deeper, the writing is thoughtful, and the presentation and custom art for each story makes the experience of reading these stories about our hobby a sensual experience.\\" Engadget stated the magazine avoiding \\"the mechanical nitty-gritty that plagues game writing.\\"  References   External links  * Category:Video game magazines published in the United States Category:Kickstarter-funded publications Category:Magazines established in 2009 Category:Video game news websites Category:Magazines published in New York City ","title":"Kill Screen"},{"id":"47704404","text":"Isabel Ponce de Le√≥n (died 1367) was a Spanish noblewoman from the Ponce de Le√≥n family.

He was a member of the Institute for Reporters‚Äô Freedom and Safety (IRFS). After a football match between Cyprus and Azerbaijan, Aliyev criticized national player Javid Huseynov for being \\"ill- bred\\". Aliyev was later lured to a meeting with someone claiming to be a relative of Huseynov seeking reconciliation, where he was brutally beaten by several assailants. Aliyev died in hospital the following day, a week shy of his 31st birthday. Life Rasim Aliyev was born on 16 August 1984. He was a graduate of the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy. He began working for the Institute for Reporters‚Äô Freedom and Safety (IRFS) since 2007, becoming its chairman in October 2014. In the early stages of his career with IRFS, Aliyev was a researcher of human rights and monitored the local courts of Azerbaijan. Aliyev underwent growing pressure from IRFS opponents and in 2013, he was beaten. The incident was photographed and the image became widely known. Employed by the IRFS's television channel Objective TV as an editor in 2010. Objective TV was an independent online news source which regularly reported on issues concerning human rights. Objective TV was forcefully shut down in August 2014 by Azerbaijani law authorities. In July 2015, Aliyev published photographs of police brutality. He then received numerous death threats and blackmail. Aliyev appealed to law enforcement for protection, but none was ever granted. Death After a football match played in Cyprus between the Azeri team Gabala FK and the Cypriot team Apollon Limassol, Rasim Aliyev criticized Javid Huseynov, a national player for Azerbaijan, for waving a Turkish flag at Cypriot fans and making a crude hand gesture to a journalist who questioned the act. In a Facebook post, Aliyev demanded that Huseynov be banned from playing football. He also called Huseynov \\"immoral and ill-bred\\" for making such a gesture. In Baku, Aliyev took a phone call from a man claiming to be a relative of Huseynov, who expressed anger toward Aliyev for his criticism of the footballer. Aliyev later agreed to meet the man in a gesture of reconciliation, but at the meeting place was forcibly held down in the street by six men, kicked and beaten for about 40 seconds, and robbed. Aliyev was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with four broken ribs and ear damage but no internal injuries, and gave an interview to the media. His condition worsened overnight and his spleen was removed. He died on 9 August 2015, the day after the attack, from internal bleeding. While the attackers were allegedly football fans, colleagues of Aliyev have cautioned against this explanation, suggesting the attack may have been politically motivated. The Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety has further claimed that doctors \\"refused to objectively diagnose [Aliyev] or place him under serious medical supervision in the intensive care unit\\", which they blame on alleged pressure from Azerbaijani authorities. Police have meanwhile reportedly detained a relative of Huseynov in relation to the attack. On 31 May 2016, the court sentenced several people involved in his murder, Elshan Ismailov received 13 years of imprisonment, Arif Aliyev - 12.5, Jamal Mammadov - 11, Samir Mustafayev and Kyanan Madatov - 9 each and the player Javid Huseynov - 4 years. International condemnation The death of Rasim Aliyev sparked worldwide condemnation by numerous international organizations including European Federation of Journalists, International Federation of Journalists, International Association of Press Clubs, Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety, Sport for Rights organization, and Index for Censorship. The Director- General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, condemned the attack and demanded a thorough investigation into his death. OSCE representative Dunja Mijatoviƒá condemned the attack in a letter to Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev: \\"The latest tragic death of Rasim Aliyev is the ultimate reminder to all of us that the vicious circle has to be broken and something has to be done.\\" Natalia Nozadze, a representative of Amnesty International, has called upon Ilham Aliyev and the Azerbaijani government \\"to ensure a truly thorough, independent and impartial investigation is immediately undertaken into the death of Rasim Aliyev. Freedom of expression in Azerbaijan is already on life support. The authorities need to act now and effectively protect journalists at risk if that freedom is not to become extinct.\\" Personal life Rasim Aliyev was engaged and planned to get married. He had one sister.

Alan and his family were Syrian refugees trying to reach Europe amid the European refugee crisis (see timeline). Photographs of his body were taken by Turkish journalist Nil√ºfer Demir and quickly went viral, prompting international responses. Since the Kurdi family had reportedly been trying to reach Canada, his death and the wider refugee crisis became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Biography Kurdi is believed to have been born about 2012 in Koban√Æ, Syria. A Syrian journalist stated that the family name was Shenu; \\"Kurdi\\" was used in Turkey because of their ethnic background. After moving between various cities in northern Syria to escape the civil war and ISIL, his family settled in Turkey. The family returned to Koban√Æ at the beginning of 2015, but returned to Turkey in June 2015 when ISIL attacked Koban√Æ again. During this time, Kurdi's father arranged for an illegal passage to Kos. Kurdi smiling in a playground Kurdi's family members were hoping to join their relatives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, after his aunt Tima Kurdi filed for refugee sponsorship, but this was rejected by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada after the family members were denied an exit visa by Turkish authorities. According to the department an application by Alan's uncle, Mohammad, was rejected as it was incomplete, and no application was ever received from Abdullah Kurdi, Alan's father. Abdullah Kurdi said that the Canadian government denied his application for asylum and that they were responsible for the tragedy. Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Fin Donnelly told the media that he had hand-delivered their file to Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander earlier in the year, but the application was rejected in June 2015 because it was incomplete. The Kurdi family tried to obtain entry to Canada under a private sponsorship program whereby groups of five people may also sponsor an individual or family. They are required to demonstrate that they can provide roughly 27,000 Canadian dollars to support a family of four refugees. According to Alexandra Kotyk, project manager of Lifeline Syria, a refugee settlement group in Toronto, the program requires that people seeking to come to Canada from Turkey first be declared refugees by the Turkish government. She said that was often a difficult or impossible condition to fulfill. =Fatal accident and body recovery = In the early hours of 2 September 2015, Kurdi and his family boarded a small plastic or rubber inflatable boat, which capsized about five minutes after leaving Bodrum in Turkey. Sixteen people were in the boat, which was designed for a maximum of eight people. They were trying to reach the Greek island of Kos, about 30 minutes () from Bodrum. Kurdi's father said: \\"We had no life vests\\", but also said they were wearing life jackets, but they \\"were all fake\\". Others have stated that they believed that they were wearing lifejackets but the items were ineffective. It was later stated on Syrian radio that the Kurdi family paid $5,860 for their four spaces on the boat, which had twelve other passengers on it despite being only about five metres long. Alan Kurdi's mother joined the trip despite her fear of being on the open sea. Tima Kurdi, Alan Kurdi's aunt, had advised her sister not to go. The individuals on the boat evaded the Turkish Coastguard by setting out from an isolated beach late at night. Around 5 am, authorities started an investigation after an emergency call that a boat had capsized and bodies were coming ashore. The bodies of Kurdi and another child were discovered by two locals at around 6:30 am. The two men moved the bodies from the water, where Kurdi was later photographed by a Turkish press photographer. On 3 September 2015, Alan Kurdi along with his brother, Galib, and their mother, Rehana, were taken to Koban√Æ for burials, which took place the next day. It is Islamic tradition to bury the dead within 24 hours if possible. The Siege of Koban√Æ ended in March 2015 and Islamic State attacks on what was left of the city stopped completely in August 2015. Arrests of alleged perpetrators Turkish authorities later arrested four individuals in connection with the illegal journey, although they appeared to be low-level intermediaries. Alan Kurdi's father, Abdullah Kurdi, has stated in some of his interviews that the inflatable boat became uncontrollable as its engine had failed, with the 'captain' abandoning it and everyone else. Some Turkish sources claimed that in his first interview with the Doƒüan News Agency, he gives a different account of the event; he also states that following two unsuccessful attempts to cross into the Greek island Kos, his family provided its own boat with its own means. However, Abdullah never confirmed the Doƒüan News Agency interview. An Iraqi survivor from the same boat, Zainab Abbas, who also lost two children from the attempted crossing, told reporters that Abdullah had been presented to her as the \\"captain\\", that he was driving the overcrowded boat too fast, causing it to flip over, and that he pleaded with her while they were still both in the water not to report him to anyone in authority.. Also contains the video of Zainab Abbas' interview on Network Ten Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was angry because all the media attention was on Alan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi, and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they could escape the Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account. Abdullah denied the accusation, stating: \\"If I was a people smuggler, why would I put my family in the same boat as the other people? I paid the same amount to the people smugglers.\\" and \\"I lost my family, I lost my life, I lost everything, so let them say whatever they want.\\"\\"Account of Capsized Migrant Boat Is Disputed\\", by Ali Naban and Safa Majeed, Wall Street Journal (paywalled) According to Turkish authorities, investigations into the smuggling operations in Turkey showed that refugees were often tasked with helping smugglers sign up passengers for smuggling trips. It was also not uncommon for one of the passengers to be given the responsibility of driving the boat. No smuggler, with family in Turkey and a steady income from the lucrative smuggling trade, would want to end up illegally in Europe and risk not being able to return home, where he would be likely to face arrest anyway. The President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan offered Alan's father Turkish citizenship. Reactions =Reactions to the photos= The photograph of Kurdi's body caused a dramatic upturn in international concern over the refugee crisis. French President Fran√ßois Hollande phoned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and some European leaders after the images of Kurdi emerged in the media. He said that the picture must be a reminder of the world's responsibility regarding refugees. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he felt deeply moved by images of Kurdi. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny commented on the photographs of Kurdi and described the refugee crisis as a \\"human catastrophe\\" and found the pictures \\"absolutely shocking\\". The picture has been credited with causing a surge in donations to charities helping migrants and refugees, with one charity, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, recording a 15-fold increase in donations within 24 hours of its publication. An article in The Guardian, on 22 December 2015, outlined a collection of what it described as \\"outrageous claims\\" against Abdullah Kurdi. It was said that he was an opportunist who used his status as a Syrian refugee for personal gain. Another source said that Abdullah was profiting from the tragedy, including selling his dead son's clothes to a museum in Paris. Australian politician Cory Bernardi claimed that \\"The father sent them on that boat so he could get dental treatment\\". Some anti-immigration politicians claimed that the image of Alan on the beach had been faked. Debate on the public responses to the pictures Brendan O'Neill wrote in The Spectator on 3 September 2015 that: \\"The global spreading of this snapshot ... is justified as a way of raising awareness about the migrant crisis. Please. It's more like a snuff photo for progressives, dead- child porn, designed not to start a serious debate about migration in the 21st century but to elicit a self-satisfied feeling of sadness among Western observers.\\" In contrast, Nick Logan of Global News argued on 4 September 2015: \\"Photojournalists sometimes capture images so powerful the public and policymakers can't ignore what the pictures show.\\" He compared the images of Kurdi's body to the pictures taken during the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" event in which civil rights activists during the Civil Rights Movement were beaten by Alabama state troopers, and he said that widespread viewership of those images helped peaceful demonstrators in the passage of measures such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965. = Impact on the 2015 Canadian federal election = The death of Kurdi and reports that his family had been trying to ultimately reach Canada had an immediate impact on domestic Canadian politics. Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party Stephen Harper cancelled a photo opportunity and addressed the issue in a campaign event, saying, \\"Yesterday, Laureen and I saw on the Internet, the picture of this young boy, Alan, dead on the beach. Look, I think, our reaction to that, you know the first thing that crossed our mind was remembering our son Ben at that age, running around like that\\". Minister of National Defence and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney cancelled an important announcement on Conservative efforts to protect the integrity of Canada's immigration system and the security of Canada. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander announced he would be temporarily suspending his campaigning in the 2015 Canadian federal election to return to Ottawa to resume his ministerial duties and investigate the case of Alan Kurdi, whose uncle's application for refugee status had been rejected by his ministry. Leader of the Opposition and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said that \\"Chris Alexander has a lot to answer for, but that's not where we are right now. We're worried about how we got here, how the collective international response has been so defective, how Canada has failed so completely.\\" NDP MP Fin Donnelly was accused of using the tragic event as a means to garner votes, because he initially told reporters that he had personally handed a letter to Immigration Minister Chris Alexander urging the minister to look at the refugee application of Alan Kurdi's family, but that Canadian immigration authorities denied the family's application. However, later the aunt of Alan Kurdi revealed that the application was made only for Kurdi's uncle and was rejected because it was not complete. Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office clarified that they had not received the proper documentation to certify refugee status for the uncle's family. Mulcair later defended Donnelly, saying that no apology was warranted because the letter had mentioned both families, and stated that he \\"couldn't be prouder to have someone of the strength, integrity and hard work as Fin Donnelly\\" in caucus. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said that \\"you don't get to suddenly discover compassion in the middle of an election campaign\\" and that \\"All different stripes of governments in Canada have stepped up in times of crisis to accept people fleeing for their lives\\", he said. \\"Canadians get it. This is about doing the right thing, about living up to the values that we cherish as a country.\\" Trudeau also reiterated the Liberal promise made several months before the election to bring in 25,000 Syrian refugees. Mural of Alan Kurdi in Frankfurt am Main Green Party leader Elizabeth May criticized Stephen Harper's response to the crisis, noting the difficulty of sponsoring a refugee in Canada. On the Green Party website, May accused the government of lacking credibility on the issue, \\"having failed to honour previous [refugee] announcements\\". = Reactions in the arts = A week following his death, around 30 Moroccans recreated the discovery of Kurdi's body in tribute in the Moroccan capital. In January 2016, the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei posed like Kurdi by imitating his dead body as shown in the media pictures. The picture was published first in the Indian magazine India Today together with an interview of Ai Weiwei, and was also shown at the India Art Fair. In February 2016, Missy Higgins released a song titled \\"Oh Canada\\", dedicated to Alan Kurdi. In March 2016 a huge mural of Kurdi's dead body appeared on a wall next to the European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt. In September 2018, hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco released a song titled \\"Alan Forever\\" on his album Drogas Wave. The song presents an alternate reality where Alan survived. = Other uses = In April 2017, Mint of Finland revealed a commemorative coin celebrating the centenary of Finnish independence, using a picture of Alan Kurdi's body on the obverse side of the coin. This picture is accompanied with the text \\"Global Justice\\" (Globaali oikeudenmukaisuus). The death of Alan Kurdi is contrasted with a Finnish public library on the reverse side of the coin. In February 2019 the rescue ship ' of the German sea rescue organization was renamed to '. Following a similar conflict in early July 2019 with the German Sea-Watch organization rescue ship Sea-Watch 3 under the command of Carola Rackete, Italian authorities also denied the Alan Kurdi access to the harbour of Lampedusa on 6 July 2019. After international intervention, the refugees eventually entered Malta on 7 July 2019. Legacy A beach event was held by Defend International in memory of Alan Kurdi and other refugees, 4 September 2015. Prayer events and moments of silence were held by various organisations including those held by NGOs. President of Defend International \\"called on the international community to share equitably the responsibility for protecting, assisting and hosting refugees in accordance with principles of international solidarity and human rights\\". A host of a daily radio program wished that \\"Alan Kurdi's death would inspire us to create a world without borders\\", while a commentary published at Spiegel Online suggested that Berlin needs to \\"reform or abolish its refugee policy\\". Artists and poets from all over the world shared tributes to Alan Kurdi. Over three months later, on Christmas Eve 2015, 3 News New Zealand said \\"Pictures of his lifeless body on a beach came to symbolise the wider tragedy. Can there have been a more moving, a more powerful image than the photograph of the tiny lifeless body of Aylan Kurdi being carried from the sea?\\" On 2 January 2016, a feature article on the BBC News website opened with the words: \\"It was one of those moments when the whole world seems to care.\\" It went on to quote Alan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi: On 8 September 2015, the publication Bild removed all pictures, including those of Kurdi, from its print edition and website in response to complaints about its decision to publish images of Kurdi. The newspaper stated about \\"the power of pictures\\": \\"Only when one does not see them, one understands the magic which pictures create\\". The ISIL terrorist group incorporated Kurdi's death into their propaganda campaigns, using an image of Kurdi's corpse while claiming that God will punish those that dare to emigrate from nations with ISIL influences. The group also asserted that those who leave are likely to become apostates who will have their souls enter hell upon death. Channel 4 television in the UK presents an annual Christmas message as an alternative to the Christmas Message of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2015, their speaker was Abdullah Kurdi, who said: > If a person shuts a door in someone's face, this is very difficult. When a > door is opened they no longer feel humiliated. At this time of year I would > like to ask you all to think about the pain of fathers, mothers and children > who are seeking peace and security. We ask just for a little bit of sympathy > from you. Hopefully next year the war will end in Syria and peace will reign > all over the world.

The Royal Navy captured her in 1800 during her fourth cruise. Private owners acquired her prior to late 1801 and employed her as the whaler Vulture (English for vautour) in the South Seas whale fisheries between 1801 and 1809. A Spanish privateer captured her in 1809. French privateer Vautour was a copper-sheathed corvette that Jacques Fran√ßois commissioned in December 1797. She then cruised from December 1797 to May 1798. Her second cruise was under Joachim Barbier from January 1799 to February 1799, and the third from March 1799 to May under Jacques Moreau. Her last cruise took place under Mathurin (?) Leroy, until her capture. At daybreak on 15 January 1800, sighted a vessel that proceeded to attempt to evade closer scrutiny. After a short chase Apollo recaptured Lady Harwood, which had been part of the convoy that Apollo was escorting, but which had gotten separated on 1 January at the onset of gale. On 13 January Vautour, of 20 guns, had captured her. Capture At 11a.m. on 15 January 1800, the frigate was at when she sighted a strange vessel worth further examination as the vessel was bearing down on the brig Flora, of London, and another ship. Had Caroline not arrived on the scene they would have become prizes to the French vessel; as it was, they proceeded on their ways. Caroline gave chase and at 8p.m. was able to come alongside her quarry, which immediately struck without firing a shot. The quarry was Vulture, a privateer of Nantes, out 38 days. She was pierced for 22 guns, and carried four 12-pounder guns, two 36-pounder carronades (probably obusier de vaisseau), and sixteen 6-pounder guns, two of which she had thrown overboard to lighten her during the chase. She had a crew at capture of 137 men under the command of Citizen Bazill Aug. Ene Laray. Her captors described her as \\"a remarkably fast Sailer\\". British whaler Vulture first appeared in Lloyd's Register for 1801, where the supplement describes her as a copper-sheathed ship and French prize, and her owner as Mather & Co. Her first captain for Mather & Co. was Henry Glasspoole (or Glaspoole, or Glaspool). At that time she was valued at ¬£8,000. Vulture left Britain on 25 October 1802, bound for Chile.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Vulture. Because Glasspoole had left before the resumption of war with France and was issued a letter of marque on 27 August 1803, hence in absentia.Letter of Marque, 1793-1815; p.91. (Although Lloyd's Register (1803 and 1804) gave her owner as Mather & Co. and her trade as South Seas Fisheries, it did not describe any armament.) Vulture was reported \\"all well\\" off Chile in March 1804, and at St Helena on 9 July 1804. She left St Helena for Britain in convoy with the East Indiamen Calcutta, City of London, Ceylon, , and Wyndham, the merchant ship , which was carrying a cargo from China for the British East India Company, and Lively, another South Seas whaler. Their escort was .The Times, 12 October 1804. On the way the convoy ran into severe weather with the result that Prince of Wales foundered with the loss of all on board; this had been her maiden voyage.British Library: Prince of Wales (8). Vulture returned to Britain on 14 October 1804 with 320 casks of oil. Thomas Folger replaced Glasspoole in 1804. Folger was an American from Nantucket. He received a letter of marque dated 6 December 1804. Vulture sailed on 26 December 1804, bound for the Galapagos. In 1805 Vulture was near Lima when she encountered a Spanish vessel sailing there from Concepci√≥n, Chile. The Spanish vessel bore a comparable armament to that of Vulture and a single-ship action ensued. Vulture prevailed and Folger put a prize crew of six men on board the Spanish vessel, leaving also two Englishmen who had been on board the Spaniard, as well as the Spanish boatswain and two Spanish seamen, and instructing the men to sail to St Helena. A few days later, the Spaniards managed to take over the vessel while killing all but two of the Englishman, one of whom was the only man on the vessel who knew anything of navigation. A few weeks later, the two Englishmen killed the three Spaniards. The Englishmen wrecked the Spanish vessel by running aground as they tried to enter the harbour at Mocha Island. reported on 8 August 1805 that Vulture had gathered 500 barrels of oil. Vulture was next reported at the Galapagos Islands on 11 September 1805. From there she and Elizabeth visited New Zealand. On 22 July 1806 Vulture arrived at Port Jackson, from \\"England\\". She left Port Jackson for the \\"Fisheries\\" in September. Vulture returned to Britain on 2 July 1807 with 320 casks. In the 1808 volume of Lloyd's Register Folger remained master, but a later entry that same year gave Vultures master as Christie. There was also a modification to her armament with two 6-pounder guns replacing the two 9-pounders. This later description carried over to the 1809 Lloyd's Register. Vulture left Britain on 11 April 1808 under Joseph Christie's command, bound for the Pacific Ocean. However, in October 1808, near Valpara√≠so, the Spanish privateer Cantabria captured and Vulture.Lloyd's List, no. 4335 - accessed 15 August 2015.

Gameplay Star Wars Commander was a strategy game that combines attacks on other players with attacks against computer generated bases. The game's storyline is set in the Star Wars universe with player choosing to play for the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire. Notable Star Wars characters that appear in the game include Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa, R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker. The player can create their own base by earning coins and alloy. This game is similar to Clash of Clans in the way that the player can upgrade their buildings by attacking other players and winning defenses. If the player gets attacked or attacks, they lose or gain medals depending if they get a win or not. A win can only be obtained by gaining at least one of three stars as the battle progresses before the maximum five minutes for a battle ends or the player's troops are all destroyed. The more medals the player has, the better their opponents will be. Once the player unlocks the Squad Center, they can join a squad where they can communicate through chat and request troops, which they can either deploy in attack or automatically deploy when attacking troops come within a certain distance to the Squad Center. They can post replays of their recent battles there as well. The leader of the squad can edit the squad's name and promote members to officers. If the leader leaves the squad, the member with the most medals becomes the leader of the squad. The player can participate in Squad Wars as well which are two squads warring. There are six planets: Er'Kit, Tatooine, Hoth, Dandoran, Takodana, and Yavin 4, to which players can relocate their base. Each planet offers different rewards. The main currencies of the game are credits, alloy, and contraband, with gems being the premium currency. Credits are used to purchase troops and build and upgrade buildings that generate or store alloy or contraband. Alloy is used for all other buildings. They can be used to clear debris around the base (credits to remove junk and alloy to remove rocks), which remains the only legitimate way to obtain crystals for free other than by chance. Contraband is unlocked at Headquarters Level 6, and is also used to pay for troops. All three resources can be looted in battle if the generators (Credit Markets, Alloy Refineries, or Contraband Trade Ports) or storage facilities (Credit Vaults, Alloy Depots, or the single Contraband Safehouse) are attacked. In attack, there are six types of troops that can be deployed - soldiers, vehicles, heroes, starfighters, mercenaries, and droidekas. The latter two can only be purchased with contraband. Soldiers, recruited from the Barracks, are low-cost and take up low amounts of capacity, but are weak in battle. Vehicles are more durable, more powerful, and often faster, but take up much more space. They are built in Factories. Though vehicles and soldiers must share space, Heroes and Starfighters each have their own allotments. Starfighters, available in the Starfighter Command, are one-use vehicles that can attack buildings or defending troops, deploy their own troops (not included in the main soldier/vehicle allotment) or heal troops. They have small allotments and take up large amounts of space, so they can be deployed few times in battle. Heroes are special troops that are held in reserve in the Hero Command. Only three may be held in reserve at a maximum, and only one deployed per battle. They are either modified normal units with drastically increased health or firepower, or special, distinct characters such as Han Solo or Darth Vader. The Cantina is used to hire mercenaries with contraband. Contraband can be used to buy the Droideka Sentinel or Droideka Oppressor. One of each can be deployed in battle and in defense, but must be repaired after each of either with credits. In battle on any planet that has a 'conflict', or through chance-based rewards from 'crates', the player can obtain 'shards' - boosts to troops and buildings that can be implemented from the Armory, or unlock new troops altogether. The health and damage of unlocked troops can be increased from the Research Lab. Gems are a powerful tool, and can be used to purchase credits, alloy, contraband, or crates. They can also be used to instantly upgrade buildings with no cost in the way of the initial currency, or purchase more droids to build, upgrade, or repair more buildings at a time. However, the only legitimate way to obtain them en masse other than through crates or winning conflicts is to purchase them with real money. The Headquarters is the most important building in the base, and destroying it in battle will yield currency and a star (the other two can be won by destroying 50% and 100% of all buildings in the base, with the exception of walls). The level of the Headquarters determines the maximum level of buildings, or the availability of buildings at all - thus, secondarily, determining their defining traits. The Headquarters has unlimited storage space for purchased crates, currency obtained as bonuses, compensation, and the like, and troops. The only way to deploy shard-dependent troops without actually having the shards is to draw them from the Headquarters if they are available. Beastly troops such as rancors or krayt dragons are completely unavailable except via the Headquarters. Development After almost three years of supporting the Windows platforms, Disney ended support on June 1, 2017. Current players were given until June 30, 2017, to play with reduced functionality. On January 17, 2019, it was announced through an update that NaturalMotion would be overseeing operations of the game. Closure On March 13, 2020, it was announced that the game was to shut down, and that same day all in-game purchases were disabled. Additionally, massive boosts were dispensed to players, including the reduction of all in-game item prices to 1 of the relevant unit. The game closed completely at 11:00 GMT, June 12 2020.

That is, it is a directed graph drawn without crossings in the plane, in such a way that there are no directed cycles in the graph, exactly one graph vertex has no incoming edges, exactly one graph vertex has no outgoing edges, and these two special vertices both lie on the outer face of the graph.. Within the drawing, each face of the graph must have the same structure: there is one vertex that acts as the source of the face, one vertex that acts as the sink of the face, and all edges within the face are directed along two paths from the source to the sink. If one draws an additional edge from the sink of an st-planar graph back to the source, through the outer face, and then constructs the dual graph (oriented each dual edge clockwise with respect to its primal edge) then the result is again an st-planar graph, augmented with an extra edge in the same way. Order theory These graphs are closely related to partially ordered sets and lattices. The Hasse diagram of a partially ordered set is a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are the set elements, with an edge from x to y for each pair x, y of elements for which x ‚â§ y in the partial order but for which there does not exist z with x ‚â§ y ‚â§ z. A partially ordered set forms a complete lattice if and only if every subset of elements has a unique greatest lower bound and a unique least upper bound, and the order dimension of a partially ordered set is the least number of total orders on the same set of elements whose intersection is the given partial order. If the vertices of an st-planar graph are partially ordered by reachability, then this ordering always forms a two-dimensional complete lattice, whose Hasse diagram is the transitive reduction of the given graph. Conversely, the Hasse diagram of every two-dimensional complete lattice is always an st-planar graph.. Graph drawing Based on this two-dimensional partial order property, every st-planar graph can be given a dominance drawing, in which for every two vertices u and v there exists a path from u to v if and only if both coordinates of u are smaller than the corresponding coordinates of v., 4.7 Dominance Drawings, pp. 112‚Äì127. The coordinates of such a drawing may also be used as a data structure that can be used to test whether one vertex of an st-planar graph can reach another in constant time per query. Rotating such a drawing by 45¬∞ gives an upward planar drawing of the graph. A directed acyclic graph G has an upward planar drawing if and only if G is a subgraph of an st-planar graph..

It is the fifth largest city in Brazil, with a population of over 2.5 million people. Housing inequality has been an issue for years in Fortaleza. According to the United Nations, Fortaleza, \\"is the fifth most unequal city in the world\\" leaving the Brazilian government with an inequality crisis in their fifth largest city. \\"All over Brazil, the poor are pushed to the peripheries and ignored by both the higher classes and the government.\\"http://tyglobalist.org/onlinecontent/blogs/bridging-the-gap- housing-inequalities-in-northeastern-brazil/ Although the government is working on a solution with many non profits, the problem still exists. \\"The government continues to use other development projects, such as a tunnel and overpasses, as a way to remove community residents. Some families that were originally able to stay despite evictions are now being told they must also move.\\" The people in these low income communities rarely welcome the upper class into their homes and vice versa. \\"The local and state governments are absent from the neighborhoods and choose to funnel money into new shopping malls rather than building community centers that could help keep children and young adults off the streets.\\" The upper class almost fears lower class citizens by building walls that surround their high rise apartments that contain 24/7 security. Tourism is on the rise in Brazil, since it has hosted the FIFA World Cup and soon the 2016 Summer Olympics. With so many tourists visiting this country, room needed to be made to build many new buildings and railways. \\" The sacrifice the urban poor are making for tourist accommodations and services has resulted in an amplification of the infamous socio-economic gap of Brazil and is becoming increasingly evident in the neighborhoods of Fortaleza.\\"  Effects of tourism  = World Cup = For the World Cup, Brazil started moving their poor to the outer parts of town. The Brazilian government did not want any tourists seeing what the government considered disgraceful. 30,000 local people demonstrated against the World Cup because they did not want to be removed from their homes. The government would not have these protesters ruin their plans for the city. The demonstrators were tear gassed by the military. Some people were protesting politically asking for new spending priorities, especially for a country whose recent economic boom made global headlines. ‚ÄúBy removing the poorest people from the inner cities, Fortaleza is causing segregation and social distinction‚Äù. \\"Contrary to the government and FIFA's story, local residents argue that this project is a form of social cleansing.\\" Although not all things from the World Cup brought negative effects. There was a boys' team that will represent Brazil in the ‚ÄúStreet Child World Cup\\" during the World Cup. \\"The tournament will bring together teams of former street children from up to 20 countries for a 10-day event that aims to raise awareness of street children and give them a platform\\". Also a girls' tram from the ‚ÄúIbiss Project‚Äù in Rio de Janeiro that was also recognized that gives the girls a chance to be a part of a society where they are actually seen and can demonstrate their talents. \\"But in Forteleza, as elsewhere in Brazil, among broad swaths of the population, the enthusiasm for the real thing is ebbing away as a nation takes a hard look at the priorities of its elite.\\" = 2016 Olympics = \\"The impact of the protests against FIFA and government priorities in Brazil and in the international community remains a test for the future, particularly as the Olympics come to Brazil in 2016.\\" With the Summer Olympics, Brazil is buying back the property from the poor to build hotels, stadia, and high speed railroads \\"must be built in a short period of time to accommodate tourists, yet the amount of free space is limited.\\" The VLT project is the government's project to start building more railroads for more incoming tourists. This would allow more tourists to stay in Fortaleza and travel easily to Rio for the 2016 Olympics. The Brazilian government \\"has been using the VLT project, as a way to remove working-class residents without fair process or compensation\\". Some residents do not have government official documentation of ownership of their property, therefore the government is not giving the poor the true value of their property but much lower. \\"As part of the Movement to Fight in Defense of Housing (MLDM) in this large northeastern city, Sales and numerous other community members and activists successfully fought for the guarantee of compensation for their homes when initially none was offered.\\"  Non-profits  There are charity homes that social workers fill to make habitable with about 130,000 people living in extreme poverty. Many NGOs are trying to build high rise apartment building for those who are being evicted by the government for new nicer buildings for tourists. \\"Last year more than 350,000 people have emerged from extreme poverty-classified as living on seventy reais a month.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/brazil- favelas-frontline-world-cup The Ceara Institute of Research and Economic Strategy shows that more than 133,000 people were living in severe poverty in 2011. One third of these inhabitants live without sanitation and lack of adequate housing. = Bolsa Familia = Bolsa Familia, a social welfare program, has lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty but many of the poorest don't even qualify for assistance because their children don't attend school or they have no fixed address. Things like this have happened in the past, the children will be bussed out of the city when visitors start to arrive. ‚ÄúFor now, they exist in a twilight some of begging, stealing or working on the streets, at risk of falling into prostitution or drugs.\\" Outside a row of breezeblock houses along a dirt road in Bom Jardim, one of the most violent favelas in Fortaleza, social worker Silvana Severo rips open the parcel of flour, beans and other food that she is bringing to a family. \\"‚ÄùWe do that to stop them selling on the food for drugs,‚Äù\\" she says‚Äù. = Movement to Fight in Defense of Housing (MLDM) = The MLDM was there to help lower income families in Fortaleza. These people did not know how to take control of their homes. \\"After MLDM demanded the government make an alternative route proposal for the VLT, the number of families facing displacement was reduced from an estimated 5,000 to about 2,500, housing activists said.\\" With the help of the MLDM the people being moved from their homes were offered 400 reais instead of 200 before MLDM. \\"Another major gain for MLDM and the threatened communities was getting the government to promise alternative housing.\\" This gave these families the option to choose government housing through Minha Casa Minha Vida (a federal housing program for the poor), this promise of housing comes with proof of a regular income where many of the lower income families do not have. = Urucum = Currently, there is a project started called Urucum. \\"Urucum‚Äôs project aims to promote and defend fundamental rights to adequate housing and transparency on the allocation of public resources, strengthening community resources by building partnerships with universities, other social organizations and the justice system, thus contributing to the democratization of the rule of law.\\" http://worldjusticeproject.org/opportunity-fund/housing-rights-urban-poor- fortaleza There are five ways in which this projects aims to call for action: * Urucum intends on bringing the urban and civil communities together. * Pulling communities and their social justice system into one. * Building citizenship participation. * Creating learning centers on human rights, to education on housing. * Conduct actions to show the rest of the world how these people are truly living to have more of an impact to make sure something is done.

In the lungs, emphysema involves enlargement of the distal airspaces,page 64 in: and is a major feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pneumoperitoneum (or peritoneal emphysema) is air or gas in the abdominal cavity, and is most commonly caused by a perforated abdominal organ. Pneumatosis is also a frequent result of surgery. The term is from pneumat- + -osis. Pneumarthrosis is the presence of air in a joint, and is rarely a serious sign. By location =Lungs= Advanced centrilobular emphysema showing total lobule involvement on the left side. A large bulla and a smaller bleb illustrated. Left lung completely affected by bullae shown in contrast to a normal lung on the right. CT scan of bullous emphysema. Pulmonary emphysema, more usually called emphysema, is characterised by air- filled cavities or spaces, (pneumatoses) in the lung, that can vary in size and may be very large. The spaces are caused by the breakdown of the walls of the alveoli and they replace the spongy lung parenchyma. This reduces the total alveolar surface available for gas exchange leading to a reduction in oxygen supply for the blood. Emphysema usually affects the middle aged or older population. This is because the disease takes time to develop with the effects of smoking, and other risk factors. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic risk factor that may lead to the condition presenting earlier. It is a typical feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow. Even without COPD, the finding of pulmonary emphysema on a CT lung scan confers a higher mortality in tobacco smokers. In 2016 in the United States there were 6,977 deaths from emphysema ‚Äì 2.2 per 100,000 of the population. A study on the effects of tobacco and cannabis smoking showed that a possibly cumulative toxic effect could be a risk factor for developing emphysema, and spontaneous pneumothorax. There is an association between emphysema and osteoporosis. There are three subtypes of pulmonary emphysema ‚Äì centrilobular or centriacinar, panlobular or panacinar, and paraseptal or distal acinar emphysema, related to the anatomy of the lobules of the lung. These are not associated with fibrosis (scarring). A fourth type known as irregular emphysema involves the acinus irregularly and is associated with fibrosis. Though the subtypes can be seen on imaging they are not well-defined clinically. Only the first two types of emphysema ‚Äì centrilobular, and panlobular are associated with significant airflow obstruction, with that of centrilobular emphysema around 20 times more common than panlobular. Centrilobular emphysema Centrilobular emphysema also called centriacinar emphysema, affects the centrilobular portion of the lung, the area around the terminal bronchiole, and the first respiratory bronchiole, and can be seen on imaging as an area around the tip of the visible pulmonary artery. Centrilobular emphysema is the most common type usually associated with smoking, and with chronic bronchitis. The disease progresses from the centrilobular portion, leaving the lung parenchyma in the surrounding (perilobular) region preserved. Usually the upper lobes of the lungs are affected. Panlobular emphysema Panlobular emphysema also called panacinar emphysema can involve the whole lung or mainly the lower lobes. This type of emphysema is associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD or AATD), and is not related to smoking. Paraseptal emphysema Paraseptal emphysema also called distal acinar emphysema relates to emphysematous change next to a pleural surface, or to a fissure. The cystic spaces known as blebs or bullae that form in paraseptal emphysema typically occur in just one layer beneath the pleura. This distinguishes it from the honeycombing of small cystic spaces seen in fibrosis that typically occurs in layers. This type of emphysema is not associated with airflow obstruction. Bullous emphysema When the subpleural bullae are significant the emphysema is called bullous emphysema. Bullae can become extensive and combine to form giant bullae. These can be large enough to take up a third of a hemithorax, compress the lung parenchyma, and cause displacement. The emphysema is now termed giant bullous emphysema, more commonly called vanishing lung syndrome due to the compressed parenchyma. A bleb or bulla may sometimes rupture and cause a pneumothorax. Stained lung tissue from end-stage emphysema. HIV associated emphysema Classic lung diseases are a complication of HIV/AIDS with emphysema being a source of disease. HIV is cited as a risk factor for the development of emphysema regardless of smoking status. HIV associated emphysema occurs over a much shorter time than that associated with smoking. It is thought that an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the triggering of HIV associated emphysema may help in the understanding of the mechanisms of the development of smoking-related emphysema. Ritalin lung The intravenous use of methylphenidate, commonly marketed as Ritalin can lead to emphysematous changes known as Ritalin lung. The mechanism underlying this link is not clearly understood. Ritalin tablets contain talc as a filler, and these need to be crushed and dissolved for injecting. It has been suggested that the talc exposure causes granulomatosis leading to alveolar destruction. However, other intravenous drugs also contain talc and there is no associated emphysematous change. HRCT shows panlobular emphysema. CPFE Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) is a rare syndrome that shows upper-lobe emphysema, together with lower-lobe interstitial fibrosis. This is diagnosed by CT scan. This syndrome presents a marked susceptibility for the development of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a collection of air outside of the normal air space of the pulmonary alveoli, found instead inside the connective tissue of the peribronchovascular sheaths, interlobular septa, and visceral pleura. Congenital lobar emphysema Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), also known as congenital lobar overinflation and infantile lobar emphysema, is a neonatal condition associated with enlarged air spaces in the lungs of newborn infants. It is diagnosed around the time of birth or in the first 6 months of life, occurring more often in boys than girls. CLE affects the upper lung lobes more than the lower lobes, and the left lung more often than the right lung. CLE is defined as the hyperinflation of one or more lobes of the lung due to the partial obstruction of the bronchus. This causes symptoms of pressure on the nearby organs. It is associated with several cardiac abnormalities such as patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot. Although CLE may be caused by the abnormal development of bronchi, or compression of airways by nearby tissues, no cause is identified in half of cases. CT scan of the lungs is useful in assessing the anatomy of the lung lobes and status of the neighbouring lobes on whether they are hypoplastic or not. Contrast-enhanced CT is useful in assessing vascular abnormalities and mediastinal masses. Compensatory emphysema Compensatory emphysema, is overinflation of part of a lung in response to either removal by surgery of another part of the lung or deceased size of another part of the lung. Parenchymal focalities CT scan of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia with pulmonary cysts. A focal lung pneumatosis, is a solitary volume of air in the lung that is larger than alveoli. A focal lung pneumatosis can be classified by its wall thickness: * A pulmonary bleb or bulla has a wall thickness of less than 1 mm Blebs and bullae are also known as a focal regions of emphysema. * A pulmonary cyst has a wall thickness of up to 4 mm. A minimum wall thickness of 1 mm has been suggested, but thin-walled pockets may be included in the definition as well. Pulmonary cysts are not associated with either smoking or emphysema. * A cavity has a wall thickness of more than 4 mm The terms above, when referring to sites other than the lungs, often imply fluid content. =Other thoracic= * Pneumothorax, air or gas in the pleural space * Pneumomediastinum, air or gas in the mediastinum ** Also called mediastinal emphysema or pneumatosis/emphysema of the mediastinum =Abdominal= * Pneumoperitoneum (or peritoneal emphysema), air or gas in the abdominal cavity. The most common cause is a perforated abdominal viscus, generally a perforated peptic ulcer, although any part of the bowel may perforate from a benign ulcer, tumor or abdominal trauma. * Pneumatosis intestinalis, air or gas cysts in the bowel wall * Gastric pneumatosis (or gastric emphysema) is air or gas cysts in the stomach wall =Joints= Pneumarthrosis is the presence of air in a joint. Its presentation on radiography is a radiolucent cleft often called a vacuum phenomenon, or vacuum sign. Pneumarthrosis is associated with osteoarthritis and spondylosis. Pneumarthrosis is a common normal finding in shoulders as well as in sternoclavicular joints. It is believed to be a cause of the sounds of joint cracking. It is also a common normal post-operative finding at least after spinal surgery. Pneumarthrosis is extremely rare in conjunction with fluid or pus in a joint, and its presence can therefore practically exclude infection.Page 60 in: File:X-ray of hip prosthesis with pneumarthrosis.jpgX-ray of a hip with hip replacement and pneumarthrosis, in this case aseptic. File:X-ray of shoulder with vacuum sign - annotated.jpgA vacuum sign, or vacuum phenomenon, is a normal finding on shoulder X-rays. =Other= CT scan of subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema is found in the deepest layer of the skin. Emphysematous cystitis is a condition of gas in the bladder wall. On occasion this may give rise to secondary subcutaneous emphysema which has a poor prognosis. Pneumoparotitis is the presence of air in the parotid gland caused by raised air pressure in the mouth often as a result of playing wind instruments. In rare cases air may escape from the gland and give rise to subcutaneous emphysema in the face, neck, or mediastinum.

Rohm and Haas Co., 456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972), is a 1972 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit interpreting what conduct amounts to fraudulent procurement of a patent. It is one of the early decisions following the Supreme Court's landmark 1964 decision in Walker Process v. Food Machinery holding fraud on the patent office as potentially violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, and one of the first (if not the first) to hold that failure to disclose material information to the Patent Office was fraudulent. Background Monsanto procured U.S. Patent No. No. 3,382,280, issued May 7, 1968, having the title 3',4'-dichloropropionanilide (known as 3,4-DCPA or propanil), a herbicide that selectively killed weeds without killing crop plants such as rice.With an estimated use of about 8 million pounds in 2001, propanil is one of the more widely used herbicides in the United States. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000-2001 Pesticide Market Estimates. In November 1969 Monsanto sued Rohm and Haas for patent infringement. The only substantial issue was the validity of the patent, and that ultimately turned on whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office in procuring the patent.Monsanto Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 456 F.2d 592, 596 (3d Cir. 1972) (\\"In the view we take, it becomes necessary to reach only the misrepresentation issue.\\"). The application that resulted in the '280 patent was the third of three successive applications, the first two of which were unsuccessful. In the first application, filed in 1957, Monsanto sought a patent on some 100 \\"compounds, including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Monsanto claimed that all the members of the class possessed \\"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity,\\" while related compounds possessed \\"little or no herbicidal efficiency.\\" Unpersuaded by Monsanto's arguments, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1961, Monsanto filed a new application claiming another large class of compounds, again including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA and again asserting that the class possessed \\"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity.\\" Again, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1967, Monsanto applied again, this time claiming only 3,4-DCPA and representing only that 3,4-DCPA had \\"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity\\" and that its activity was \\"surprising\\" because \\"related compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency.\\" Again. the Patent Office (initially) rejected the application on the ground that the product was obvious over the prior art. But this time Monsanto overcame the rejection.456 F.2d at 596. A major issue in the Patent Office was whether the patent application should be denied because 3,4-DCPA was obvious from previously known products, the most significant of which was 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Both were useful in making pigments and both had herbicidal properties. The structural difference between the two \\"closely related\\" compounds was that 3,4-DCAA \\"differ[ed] in its structural formula solely by having one less CH2 group\\" than 3,4-DCPA.456 F.2d at 596. Such pairs of compounds are termed \\"adjacent homologues\\" and they are known to have similar chemical and physical properties. See article homologous series. See also In re Henze, 181 F.2d 196, 201 (CCPA 1950), in which the court stated, \\"In effect, the nature of homologues and the close relationship the physical and chemical properties of one member of a series bears to adjacent members is such that a presumption of unpatentability arises against a claim directed to a composition of matter, the adjacent homologue of which is old in the art.\\" Because of the similarity in structure between 3,4-DCPA and other chemicals, including 3,4-DCAA, the Patent Office rejected the patent application on obviousness grounds. Monsanto then tried to persuade the Office to withdraw the rejection by submitting documents to show that DCPA was not obvious, because it had greatly superior and unexpected selective herbicidal activity. Monsanto filed the Husted Affidavit. The trial court found that this document \\"contains no affirmative misrepresentation and is accurate so far as it goes\\" but \\"it is misleading, and was intended to be misleading, in that it fails to state facts known to the applicant which were inconsistent with its position that propanil is a superior herbicide.\\"Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co., 312 F. Supp. 778, 791 (E.D. Pa. 1970) The court of appeals commented: > The patent was issued, however, . . . after Monsanto submitted an affidavit > of Dr. Robert F. Husted, based on tests performed by him on twenty plant > species at three different rates of application per acre. The report as > presented to the Patent Office asserted that 3,4-DCPA completely killed or > severely injured nine of the eleven species and failed to have any effect on > only two. Eight other compounds were reported to have no effect on any of > the eleven plants and two other compounds, one of them 3,4-DCAA, either had > very slight or no effect. Significantly, although the Husted tests entailed > tests on twenty species, at three separate rates of application per acre, > the Patent Office was informed of tests on only eleven species and only at > one rate of application, two pounds per acre. In all, the affidavit showed > less than 25 per cent of Husted's results; of 899 tests, only 110 were > submitted. The district court concluded that this close-cropping of Husted's > findings amounted to misrepresentation.456 F.2d at 596-97. Under applicable law, as understood by the court, if a compound on which a patent is sought is very similar in structure to a known compound, as 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA were, a rebuttable presumption arises that the later compound is obvious from the earlier one. \\"To rebut this presumption it must be shown 'that the claimed compound possesse[d] unobvious or unexpected beneficial properties not actually possessed by the prior art homologue.'\\"312 F. Supp. at 789. The court said that the reason for this rule is that \\"the characteristics normally possessed by members of a homologous series are principally the same, and vary but gradually from member to member. Chemists knowing the properties of one member of a series would in general know what to expect in adjacent members.\\" Id. at 790. The Husted Affidavit thus appeared to rebut the obviousness rejection by showing that 3,4-DCPA possessed an unexpected beneficial herbicidal property that 3,4-DCAA and other products lacked. The Husted Affidavit misled the Patent Office, the trial court said, because both 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA \\"in fact possess the newly discovered property of the claimed compound.\\"312 F. Supp. at 790. The trial court said that Monsanto submitted a fraudulent affidavit in that: \\"It is, in short, composed of half- truths.\\" The court pointed to such omissions as these which made the affidavit one of half-truths: > For example, one omitted test result showed that 3,4-DCAA had a complete > kill on pigweed at 2 lbs. per acre of application, just as 3,4-DCPA did. . . > . Monsanto, by the Husted affidavit, attempted to show that closely related > compounds do not possess unique herbicidal properties. The facts not stated > were, therefore material.\\"312 F.Supp. 791-92. The district court held the patent invalid and Monsanto appealed top the Third Circuit. Decision of Third Circuit The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment of fraud (2-1) in an opinion by Circuit Judge Aldisert.456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972). =Majority opinion= The court looked at the Husted Affidavit in light of its place in the three successive Monsanto patent applications: > In view of Huffman's previously unsuccessful attempts to obtain a patent, it > is reasonable to conclude that his success with his 1968 application, > originally rejected by the examiner, and later accepted after presentation > of the Husted Report, was attributed to his emphasis that the compound > possessed properties of 'surprising . . . herbicidal efficiency' not > possessed by related compounds.456 F.2d at 599. Whether 3,4-DCPA really was surprisingly superior to related compounds as a herbicide was therefore critical to the patent prosecution and to whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office. The court rejected Monsanto's argument that in the affidavit it was merely putting its best foot forward: > The Husted affidavit to the Patent Office did not nearly reflect the total > Husted test as transmitted to Huffman. Indeed, an examination of the report > permits, if not compels, the misleading inference that it constituted a > complete and accurate analysis of all the testing instead of an edited > version thereof. Concealment and nondisclosure may be evidence of and > equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression > is, in effect, a representation that what is disclosed is the whole > truth.456 F.2d at 599. The Third Circuit noted but rejected the conclusion > of a Texas district court that addressed these issues in Monsanto v. Dawson > Chemical Corp., 312 F.Supp. 452 (S.D. Tex. 1970). The Third Circuit said: > \\"We do not find persuasive that court's treatment of the misrepresentation > issue or its conclusion that Monsanto 'did nothing more than put their best > foot forward.'\\" 456 F.2d at 597 n.4 (quoting 312 F. Supp. at 463). Looking at this pattern of conduct, the court said, \\"[W]e cannot bring ourselves to say that the application for the 1968 patent displayed that standard of conduct demanded under the circumstances.\\" Rather, \\"Monsanto was obliged to disclose more information as to the herbicidal properties of related compounds to the Patent Office than it did.\\" The reason is that \\"what is at issue is not merely a contest between the parties but a public interest\\" that spurious patents should not issue. As a result of Monsanto's truncated disclosure of the facts concerning 3,4-DCPA's comparative efficacy as a herbicide, \\"it was impossible for the Patent Office fairly to assess Monsanto's application against the prevailing statutory criteria.\\"456 F.2d at 600. The court concluded: > Thus, Monsanto's failure to disclose amounted to misrepresentation > transgressing equitable standards of conduct owed the public by the > applicant in return for its monopoly. Accordingly, Monsanto was not entitled > to the patent monopoly, and the district court did not err in [invalidating > the patent].456 F.2d at 600-01. =Dissent= Judge Kalodner dissented. First, he said, the majority decided the case on the basis of the preponderance of evidence but it should have used the \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" standard.The majority opinion took issue with this assertion, which was based with a colloquy with counsel. The trial court's conclusions of law stated that \\"[u]pon our examination of the record, we have concluded that Rohm and Haas has met its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing proof.\\" 456 F.2d at 601 n.14 (quoting 312 F.Supp. at 797). Second, the district court erroneously said that it was not necessary to prove specific intent to deceive the Patent Office \\"when there is evidence of a deliberate withholding of material information,\\" and that the patent must be rejected \\"even if the decision not to disclose was motivated by nothing more than bad judgment as to the materiality of the information.\\"The majority opinion took issue with this assertion, pointing out that it was an alternative holding and that the district court's statement in full was, \\"'Even if we were persuaded to change our mind' and find that 'Monsanto did not intend to mislead, ... a specific intent to deceive is not necessary where there is evidence of deliberate withholding of material information'\\" 456 F.2d at 601 n.14. Third, it was not shown that the Patent Office \\"would not have issued the patent but for the claimed fraudulent conduct.\\" There was no proof that the Patent Office was misled.456 F.2d 603-04. Commentary In an article in the George Washington Law Review, Irving Kayton criticized \\"the Third Circuit's ignorance of the accepted manner and practice, defined by statute and rule, in which patent prosecution takes place.\\"Irving Kayton, John F. Lynch, Richard H. Stern, Fraud in Patent Procurement: Genuine and Sham Charges, 43 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1, 99 (1974). Kayton said that it was the responsibility of the patent examiner to review the records of the earlier stages of the patent prosecution, and there is a legal presumption that the examiner did that; that examination would have disclosed the information that Monsanto withheld in the Husted Affidavit. Accordingly, Kayton argued, \\"Monsanto['s] patent solicitor was thus completely justified in attributing actual, but at the least, constructive knowledge to the examiner of the contents of the disclosures of both the 1961 and 1957 applications.\\"Id. at 100. Co-author Richard H. Stern disagreed with his colleague on this issue. Stern maintained, \\"The proposed reliance on constructive knowledge, and the indulgence in legal fictions and presumptions that follows, has far more flavor of a determination not to learn damaging facts than it has of the candor required in such cases.\\"Id. at 100 n.*. Moreover, argued Kayton, the fact that the Third Circuit and the judge in the similar Texas case disagreed over whether Monsanto was just \\"putting its best foot forward\\" or instead was intentionally defrauding the Patent Office indicates that reasonable men can differ: \\"This being so, is it not an inescapable conclusion . . . that the Monsanto patent solicitor's [conduct] . . . was at worst a nonculpable mistake of judgment?\\"Id. at 99. Again, co-author Stern disagreed: \\"No. The Third Circuit, on the contrary, appears to have thought that Judge Singleton's views were plainly erroneous, and that his acceptance of the patentee's theory that 'it is all right to put your best foot forward with the Patent Office' was contrary to the legal standard as to candor required in ex parte proceedings of this type. Given so thoroughly erroneous a concept of the standard of candor, it is neither surprising that in the circumstances of this case the judge using that legal standard found no fraud nor surprising that the judges rejecting it found fraud.\\"Id at 99 n.*. Another discussion of this case faults the district court's decision for purporting to invalidate the patent for fraud, and by implication the subsequent Third Circuit affirmance. The stated basis of the criticism is that fraudulent procurement does not invalidate a patent, but merely makes it permanently unenforceable.See Donald R. Dunner, James B, Gambrell, and Irving Kayton, Patent Law (1969-70), in [1970] 395, 425 n.140 (1970).

Formerly the episcopal seat of the diocese of Terracina, it is now a co-cathedral in the diocese of Latina- Terracina-Sezze-Priverno. History The cathedral was built in the 5th-6th centuries using the remains of a Roman temple with five naves in the city forum. The building underwent many alterations and restorations, among them those of the 11th century (reflecting its change of dedication from Saint Peter to the city's patron saint Caesarius of Terracina in 1074), of the 13th century and above all the extreme restoration in the Baroque style of the 18th century, which reduced the church from five naves to three with the construction of side chapels and the covering over of the Romanesque A-framed ceiling with barrel vaulting. The cathedral was the site of the Papal conclave of 1088 which elected Pope Urban II. , the cathedral is undergoing another restoration. Description The portico, which stands at the top of a flight of 30 steps on the podium of the Roman temple, is of artistic interest. It contains six reused Classical columns with a triumphal arch in the centre, surmounted by an ancient entablature with mosaic decorations including the figures of a winged monster, an eagle, palms, deer, birds, bulls and other things. Beneath the portico are a funerary basin of the Roman age and pairs of beasts crouching to either side of the bases of the columns. A further 7 steps lead to the two entrances to the cathedral, of which the principal one is decorated with marble friezes of the Augustan period. To the north of the portico is the Romanesque campanile, curiously raised above ground level on four pilasters. The interior has three naves separated by reused Roman columns, with side chapels. The two side naves terminate in apses, while the central one (which also has an apse, dating from 1729), terminates in a quadrangular space occupied by the choir. The presbytery and the choir are about a metre higher than the three naves. The following features are of particular artistic interest: * the Cosmatesque pavement of the central nave (12th-13th centuries) * the medieval pulpit (first half of the 13th century), supported by five columns; * the spiral column, used to hold the Easter candle, of the mediaeval period; a marble inscription gives the maker and the date of the column: Crudele, 31 October 1245; *Caesarius deacon and martyr, patron of Terracinaalt= the 18th-century frescoes of the presbytery and choir, depicting episodes from the election of Pope Urban II.

Discovery  Detail Hieroglyphic inscription The stele was found on 27 September 1975 near the Citadel of Niƒüde in the √áelebi H√ºsamettin Bey Mosque (now Dƒ±≈üarƒ± Camii), where it was lying carved side down in a doorway as a lintel stone. Today it is displayed in the Niƒüde Archaeological Museum with inventory number 22.1.75.  Description  The black basalt stele is 2.18 metres high and about a metre wide and belongs to a type which developed in the 10th century BC. It depicts the weather god Tarhunzas, holding an axe and a thunderbolt in his raised hands. Vines sprout from the ground to his left and grain to the right, similar to the ƒ∞vriz relief. A very similar depiction of the same god appears on the relief in the village of G√∂kbez, some 22 km to the south. The figure is depicted with clothing, hair and beard of the Assyrian style. The winged solar disk, a traditional symbol of the ruler, hovers over his head. On the right edge of the stone block is an inscription in Luwian hieroglyphs. On it the author, Muwaharanis, writes that he had the stele erected in honour of Tarhunzas and identifies himself as a king and son of king Warpalawas. John David Hawkins gives the following translation: This Tarhunzas Muwaharanis [ma]de (?), the Hero, the King, loved by Tarhunzas (and) the gods, the son of Warpalawas, the Ruler, the Hero. Muwaharanis was the successor of his father Warpalawas on the throne of the late Luwian kingdom of Tuwana, a successor state of the Hittite , in the southern part of the modern Niƒüde Province. Since it is known that Warpalawas was reigning in 709 BC, the relief must date some time after that year. Thus the stele is the latest known and datable example such a relief and possibly the latest known Luwian inscription - only the Karatepe Bilingual might be later.

Registries contain information about persons convicted of sexual offenses for law enforcement and public notification purposes. All 50 states and the District of Columbia maintain sex offender registries that are open to the public via websites, although information on some offenders is visible to law enforcement only. Public disclosure of offender information varies between the states depending on offenders designated tier, which may also vary from state to state, or risk assessment result. According to NCMEC, as of 2016 there were 859,500 registered sex offenders in United States. The majority of states and the federal government apply systems based on conviction offenses only, where registration requirement is triggered as a consequence of finding of guilt, or pleading guilty, to a sex offense regardless of the actual gravity of the crime. The trial judge typically can not exercise judicial discretion with respect to registration. Depending on jurisdiction, offenses requiring registration range in their severity from public urination or adolescent sexual experimentation with peers, to violent sex offenses. In some states offenses such as unlawful imprisonment may require sex offender registration. According to Human Rights Watch, children as young as 9 have been placed on the registry;Raised on the Registry: The Irreparable Harm of Placing Children on Sex Offender Registries in the US (2012) Human Rights Watch juvenile offenders account for 25 percent of registrants. In some states, the length of the registration period is determined by the offense or assessed risk level; in others all registration is for life. Some states allow removal from the registry under certain specific, limited circumstances. Information of juvenile offenders are withheld for law enforcement but may be made public after their 18th birthday. Sex Offender Registration and Notification (SORN) has been studied for its impact on the rates of sexual offense recidivism, with the majority of studies demonstrating no impact. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld sex offender registration laws both times such laws have been examined by them. Several challenges on parts of state level legislation have been honored by the courts. Legal scholars have challenged the rationale behind the Supreme Court rulings. Perceived problems in legislation has prompted organizations such as NARSOL, ACSOL and ACLU among others, to promote for reform. History In 1947, California became the first state in the United States to have a sex offender registration program. In 1990, Washington state began community notification of its most dangerous sex offenders, making it the first state to ever make any sex offender information publicly available. Prior to 1994, only a few states required convicted sex offenders to register their addresses with local law enforcement. The 1990s saw the emergence of several cases of brutal violent sexual offenses against children. Heinous crimes like those of Westley Allan Dodd, Earl Kenneth Shriner and Jesse Timmendequas were highly publicized. As a result, public policies began to focus on protecting public from stranger danger. Since the early 1990s, several state and federal laws, often named after victims, have been enacted as a response to public outrage generated by highly publicized, but statistically very rare, violent predatory sex crimes against children by strangers. Based on a 2003 report, prisoners convicted of rape or sexual assault who were released in 1994 were four times more likely to be arrested for a sex offense within 3 years of prison release than non-sexual offenders released within the same year. The average sentencing for imprisoned sex offenders was 8 years and offenders served less than half that period in prison. In the same 2003 report, of 9,700 released sex offenders, 4,300 had been convicted of child molestation and most of those were convicted for molesting a child under the age of 13. Almost half of those imprisoned for child-victim cases, offended against their own child or other relative. Within the three year followup on the 1994 report, 3.5 percent of released rapists and sexual assaulters were convicted for another sex crime. 43 percent of sex offenders had been re-arrested for any reason versus 68 percent re-arrest rate of non-sex offenders. Recidivism studies typically find that the older the prisoner when released, the lower the rate of recidivism. In one study of 561 clinically diagnosed pedophiles \\"who targeted young boys outside the home committed the greatest number of crimes with an average of 281.7 acts with an average of 150.2 partners\\". Only about a third of violent rapes are reported and sex crimes are widely believed to be the most underreported of all criminal offenses, with a reporting rate of barely a third of such offenses. Under polygraph, many apprehended sex offenders indicated that most of their offenses were not reported. In an effort to protect the citizenry, local, state and federal lawmakers responded to these issues through a variety of legislative enactments. =Jacob Wetterling Act of 1994= In 1989, an 11-year-old boy, Jacob Wetterling, was abducted from a street in St. Joseph, Minnesota. His whereabouts remained unknown for nearly 27 years until remains were discovered just outside Paynesville, Minnesota in 2016. Jacob's mother, Patty Wetterling, current chair of National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, led a community effort to implement a sex offender registration requirement in Minnesota and, subsequently, nationally. In 1994, Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. If states failed to comply, the states would forfeit 10% of federal funds from the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. The act required each state to create a registry of offenders convicted of qualifying sex offenses and certain other offenses against children and to track offenders by confirming their place of residence annually for ten years after their release into the community or quarterly for the rest of their lives if the sex offender was convicted of a violent sex crime. States had a certain time period to enact the legislation, along with guidelines established by the Attorney General. The registration information collected was treated as private data viewable by law enforcement personnel only, although law enforcement agencies were allowed to release relevant information that was deemed necessary to protect the public concerning a specific person required to register. Another high-profile case, abuse and murder of Megan Kanka led to modification of Jacob Wetterling Act. The subsequent laws forcing changes to the sex offenders registries in all 50 states have since troubled Patty Wetterling and she has been vocal about her opposition to including children on the registry as well as allowing full access to the public. In an interview with reporter Madeleine Baran Wetterling stated, \\"No more victims, that's the goal. But we let our emotions run away from achieving that goal.\\" In lamenting how we treat sex offenders she stated, \\"You're screwed. You will not get a job you will not find housing. This is on your record forever, good luck.\\" She believes that by not allowing sex offenders who have served their time to reintegrate to society we do more harm than good, \\"I've turned 180 from where I was.\\" =Megan's Law of 1996= Sign at the limits of Wapello, Iowa; sex offender-free districts appeared as a result of Megan's Law. In 1994, 7-year-old Megan Kanka from Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey was raped and killed by a recidivist pedophile. Jesse Timmenquas, who had been convicted of two previous sex crimes against children, lured Megan in his house and raped and killed her. Megan's mother, Maureen Kanka, started to lobby to change the laws, arguing that registration established by the Wetterling Act, was insufficient for community protection. Maureen Kanka's goal was to mandate community notification, which under the Wetterling Act had been at the discretion of law enforcement. She said that if she had known that a sex offender lived across the street, Megan would still be alive. In 1994, New Jersey enacted Megan's Law. In 1996, President Bill Clinton enacted a federal version of Megan's Law, as an amendment to the Jacob Wetterling Act. The amendment required all states to implement Registration and Community Notification Laws by the end of 1997. Prior to Megan's death, only 5 states had laws requiring sex offenders to register their personal information with law enforcement. On August 5, 1996 Massachusetts was the last state to enact its version of Megan's Law. =Adam Walsh Act of 2006= Ottis Toole; evidence indicated he killed Adam Walsh, and he confessed but then recanted. The most comprehensive legislation related to the supervision and management of sex offenders is the Adam Walsh Act (AWA), named after Adam Walsh, who was kidnapped from a Florida shopping mall and killed in 1981, when he was 6 years old. The AWA was signed on the 25th anniversary of his abduction; efforts to establish a national registry was led by John Walsh, Adam's father. One of the significant component of the AWA is the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). SORNA provides uniform minimum guidelines for registration of sex offenders, regardless of the state they live in. SORNA requires states to widen the number of covered offenses and to include certain classes of juvenile offenders. Prior to SORNA, states were granted latitude in the methods to differentiate offender management levels. Whereas many states had adopted to use structured risk assessment tools classification to distinguish \\"high risk\\" from \\"low risk\\" individuals, SORNA mandates such distinctions to be made solely on the basis of the governing offense. States are allowed, and often do, exceed the minimum requirements. Scholars have warned that classification system required under Adam Walsh Act is less sophisticated than risk-based approach previously adopted in certain states. Extension in number of covered offenses and making the amendments apply retroactively under SORNA requirements expanded the registries by as much as 500% in some states. All states were required to comply with SORNA minimum guidelines by July 2009 or risk losing 10% of their funding through the Byrne program. As of April 2014, the Justice Department reports that only 17 states, three territories and 63 tribes had substantially implemented requirements of the Adam Walsh Act. Registration Sex offenders must periodically report in person to their local law enforcement agency and furnish their address, and list of other information such as place of employment and email addresses. The offenders are photographed and fingerprinted by law enforcement, and in some cases DNA information is also collected. Registration period depends on the classification level and the law of the governing jurisdiction. Classification of offenders States apply varied methods of classifying registrants. Identical offenses committed in different states may produce different outcomes in terms of public disclosure and registration period. An offender classified as level/tier I offender in one state, with no public notification requirement, might be classified as tier II or tier III offender in another. Sources of variation are diverse, but may be viewed over three dimensions ‚Äî how classes of registrants are distinguished from one another, the criteria used in the classification process, and the processes applied in classification decisions. The first point of divergence is how states distinguish their registrants. At one end are the states operating single-tier systems that treat registrants equally with respect to reporting, registration duration, notification, and related factors. Alternatively, some states use multi-tier systems, usually with two or three categories that are supposed to reflect presumed public safety risk and, in turn, required levels of attention from law enforcement and the public. Depending on state, registration and notification systems may have special provisions for juveniles, habitual offenders or those deemed \\"sexual predators\\" by virtue of certain standards. The second dimension is the criteria employed in the classification decision. States running offense-based systems use the conviction offense or the number of prior offenses as the criteria for tier assignment. Other jurisdictions utilize various risk assessments that consider factors that scientific research has linked to sexual recidivism risk, such as age, number of prior sex offenses, victim gender, relationship to the victim, and indicators of psychopathy and deviant sexual arousal. Finally, some states use a hybrid of offense-based and risk- assessment-based systems for classification. For example, Colorado law requires minimum terms of registration based on the conviction offense for which the registrant was convicted or adjudicated but also uses a risk assessment for identifying sexually violent predators ‚Äî a limited population deemed to be dangerous and subject to more extensive requirements. Third, states distinguishing among registrants use differing systems and processes in establishing tier designations. In general, offense-based classification systems are used for their simplicity and uniformity. They allow classification decisions to be made via administrative or judicial processes. Risk-assessment-based systems, which employ actuarial risk assessment instruments and in some cases clinical assessments, require more of personnel involvement in the process. Some states, like Massachusetts and Colorado, utilize multidisciplinary review boards or judicial discretion to establish registrant tiers or sexual predator status. In some states, such as Kentucky, Florida, and Illinois, all sex offenders who move into the state and are required to register in their previous home states are required to register for life, regardless of their registration period in previous residence. Illinois reclassifies all registrants moving in as a \\"Sexual Predator\\". Public notification States apply differing sets of criteria to determine which registration information is available to the public. In a few states, a judge determines the risk level of the offender, or scientific risk assessment tools are used; information on low-risk offenders may be available to law enforcement only. In other states, all sex offenders are treated equally, and all registration information is available to the public on a state Internet site. Information of juvenile offenders are withheld for law enforcement but may be made public after their 18th birthday. Under federal SORNA, only tier I registrants may be excluded from public disclosure, with exemption of those convicted of \\"specified offense against a minor.\\" Since SORNA merely sets the minimum set of rules the states must follow, many SORNA compliant states have opted to disclose information of all tiers. Disparities in state legislation have caused some registrants moving across state lines becoming subject to public disclosure and longer registration periods under the destination state's laws. These disparities have also prompted some registrants to move from one state to another in order to avoid stricter rules of their original state. Exclusion zones Laws restricting where registered sex offenders may live or work have become increasingly common since 2005. At least 30 states have enacted statewide residency restrictions prohibiting registrants from living within certain distances of schools, parks, day-cares, school bus stops, or other places where children may congregate. Distance requirements range from , but most start at least from designated boundaries. In addition, hundreds of counties and municipalities have passed local ordinances exceeding the state requirements, and some local communities have created exclusion zones around churches, pet stores, movie theaters, libraries, playgrounds, tourist attractions or other \\"recreational facilities\\" such as stadiums, airports, auditoriums, swimming pools, skating rinks and gymnasiums, regardless of whether publicly or privately owned. Although restrictions are tied to distances from areas where children may congregate, most states apply exclusion zones to offenders even though their crimes did not involve children. In a 2007 report, Human Rights Watch identified only four states limiting restrictions to those convicted of sex crimes involving minors. The report also found that laws preclude registrants from homeless shelters within restriction areas. In 2005, some localities in Florida banned sex offenders from public hurricane shelters during 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. In 2007, Tampa, Florida's city council considered banning registrants from moving in the city. Restrictions may effectively cover entire cities, leaving small \\"pockets\\" of allowed places of residency. Residency restrictions in California in 2006 covered more than 97% of rental housing area in San Diego County. In an attempt to banish registrants from living in communities, localities have built small \\"pocket parks\\" to drive registrants out of the area. In 2007, journalists reported that registered sex offenders were living under the Julia Tuttle Causeway in Miami, Florida because the state laws and Miami-Dade County ordinances banned them from living elsewhere. Encampment of 140 registrants is known as Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony. The colony generated international coverage and criticism around the country. The colony was disbanded in 2010 when the city found acceptable housing in the area for the registrants, but reports five years later indicated that some registrants were still living on streets or alongside railroad tracks. As of 2013 Suffolk County, New York, was faced with a situation where 40 sex offenders were living in two cramped trailers, which were regularly moved between isolated locations around the county by the officials, due to local living restrictions. Effectiveness Evidence to support the effectiveness of public sex offender registries is limited and mixed. Majority of research results do not find statistically significant shift in sexual offense trends following the implementation of sex offender registration and notification (SORN) regimes. A few studies indicate that sexual recidivism may have been lowered by SORN policies, while a few have found statistically significant increase in sex crimes following SORN implementation. According to the Office of Justice Programs' SMART Office, sex offender registration and notification requirements arguably have been implemented in the absence of empirical evidence regarding their effectiveness. According to SMART Office, there is no empirical support for the effectiveness of residence restrictions. In fact, a number of negative unintended consequences have been empirically identified that may aggravate rather than mitigate offender risk. Debate According to a 2007 study, the majority of the general public perceives sex offender recidivism to be very high and views offenders as a homogeneous group regarding that risk. Consequently, the study found that a majority of the public endorses broad community notification and related policies. Proponents of the public registries and residency restrictions believe them to be useful tools to protect themselves and their children from sexual victimization. Critics of the laws point to the lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of sex offender registration policies. They call the laws too harsh and unfair for adversely affecting the lives of registrants decades after completing their initial sentence, and for affecting their families as well. Critics say that registries are overly broad as they reach to non-violent offenses, such as sexting or consensual teen sex, and fail to distinguish those who are not a danger to society from predatory offenders. Former Supervisory Special Agent of the FBI Kenneth V. Lanning argues that registration should be offender- based instead of offense-based: \\"A sex-offender registry that does not distinguish between the total pattern of behavior of a 50-year-old man who violently raped a 6-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man who had 'compliant' sexual intercourse with his girlfriend a few weeks prior to her 16th birthday is misguided. The offense an offender is technically found or pleads guilty to may not truly reflect his dangerousness and risk level\\". Some lawmakers recognize problems in the laws. However, they are reluctant to aim for reforms because of political opposition and being viewed as lessening the child safety laws.http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/five-years-after- jessica-lunsfords-killing-legislators-rethink-sex/1075251 These perceived problems in legislation have prompted a growing grass-roots movement to reform sex offender laws in the United States. Constitutionality Sex offender registration and community notification laws have been challenged on a number of constitutional and other bases, generating substantial amount of case law. Those challenging the statutes have claimed violations of ex post facto, due process, cruel and unusual punishment, equal protection and search and seizure. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the laws. In 2002, in Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed public disclosure of sex offender information and in 2003, in Smith v. Doe, the Supreme Court upheld Alaska's registration statute, reasoning that sex offender registration is civil measure reasonably designed to protect public safety, not a punishment, which can be applied ex post facto. However, law scholars argue that even if the registration schemes were initially constitutional they have, in their current form, become unconstitutionally burdensome and unmoored from their constitutional grounds. A study published in fall 2015 found that statistics cited by Justice Anthony Kennedy in two U.S. Supreme Court cases commonly cited in decisions upholding constitutionality of sex offender policies were unfounded. Several challenges to state level sex offender laws have been honored after hearing at the state level. However, in 2017 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that SORNA violates ex post facto when retroactively applied. In September 2017 federal judge found that Colorado registry is unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment as applied to three plaintiffs. Impact on registrants and their families Sex offender registration and community notification (SORN) laws carry costs in the form of collateral consequences for both sex offenders and their families, including difficulties in relationships and maintaining employment, public recognition, harassment, attacks, difficulties finding and maintaining suitable housing, as well as an inability to take part in expected parental duties, such as going to school functions. Negative effects of collateral consequences on offenders are expected to contribute to known risk factors, and to offenders failing to register, and to the related potential for re-offending. Registration and notification laws affect not only sex offenders, but also their loved ones. Laws may force families to live apart from each other, because of family safety issues caused by neighbors, or because of residency restrictions. Family members often experience isolation, hopelessness and depression. U.S. federal law prohibits anyone who is required to register as a sex offender in any state from participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) or any similar federal housing programs, such as public housing.

Contrary to the past two winters, the United States (including the Northeast) experienced warmer conditions, mainly due to a strong El Ni√±o. However, despite the warmth, significant weather systems still occurred, including a snowstorm and flash flooding in Texas at the end of December and a large tornado outbreak at the end of February. The main event of the winter was when a crippling and historic blizzard struck the Northeast in late January, dumping up to of snow in and around the metropolitan areas. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2015 occurred late on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2016 occurred on March 20. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 29. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years.  Seasonal forecasts  On October 15, 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook. The presence of a strong El Ni√±o event was expected to affect weather and climate patterns by influencing the position of the Pacific jet stream. According to CPC deputy director Mike Halpert at the time of the outlook, \\"A strong El Ni√±o is in place and should exert a strong influence over our weather this winter\\" and \\"While temperature and precipitation impacts associated with El Ni√±o are favored, El Ni√±o is not the only player. Cold-air outbreaks and snow storms will likely occur at times this winter. However, the frequency, number and intensity of these events cannot be predicted on a seasonal timescale.\\" Other oscillations anticipated to have some effect on winter in the United States were the Arctic oscillation and the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation. The precipitation outlook indicated an elevated likelihood of above-average levels precipitation from central and southern California to Texas and Florida and northward to southern parts of New England. Above-average precipitation was also favored in southeastern Alaska, with below-average levels of precipitation favored in central and western Alaska, parts of the Northwestern U.S. and northern Rocky Mountain states, and areas in the vicinity of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. The temperature outlook favored below-average temperatures in the southern Plains and Southeastern United States. Above-average temperatures were most favored across the West and the northern half of the contiguous United States and Alaska and Hawaii. The drought outlook anticipated improvement in conditions in central and southern California by the end of January 2016, noting the possibility of additional alleviation of drought conditions in February and March. The outlook favored the removal of drought across large parts of the Southwestern U.S., with additional lessening or elimination of drought conditions likely in the southern Plains. Drought conditions were expected to persist across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains, with development likely in Hawaii and areas in the vicinity of the northern Great Lakes region. On November 30, 2015, Environment Canada issued its winter outlook for December, January, and February, as part of their monthly climate outlooks. Above-average temperatures were favoured throughout most of Canada, with the exception of northern Quebec and the southern tip of Baffin Island; areas that were considered the most likely to see above normal temperatures included the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, the Maritime provinces, southern Newfoundland, central Quebec and Ontario, and northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan; in those areas, the probability of above-normal temperatures was over 80%. The areas where below-normal temperatures were favoured included extreme northern areas of Quebec and Labrador, along with southern parts of Baffin Island. Above average precipitation was favoured in the Lower Mainland of B.C., New Brunswick, northern Quebec, northern Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, and western Nunavut. Below-average precipitation was favoured on the south-eastern tip of Baffin Island and a small area just north of Lake Superior.  Seasonal summary  A winter storm moves through the Midwest, on March 23. The winter of 2015‚Äì16 was quite unusual and historic in terms of winter weather. First, around the end of November near Black Friday, a crippling ice storm hit the Southern and Central Plains with as much as of ice accumulation in some areas, knocking out power to over 100,000 residents. In December, two winter storms impacted the Great Lakes, with the latter one being a bit farther to the west, both brought roughly a foot of snow in some locations. Normally, in this area, this is not common, but the strong El Ni√±o may have been a contributor to this. Following that, the nation had one of the warmest Decembers on record, with New York City being as warm as 70 ¬∞F on Christmas Eve (December 24). A strong tornado outbreak also occurred from December 23‚Äì25, which a very similar event had occurred the year before, just weaker. After this system passed, a larger storm complex moved through the same areas impacted by the ice storm from Black Friday 2015. This storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of Texas and New Mexico, with areas reaching up to close to 2 feet of snow in parts of Texas, which is a rare event in that state. For comparison, the last time this has occurred (or near the same areas), was in 2011 during the Groundhog Day blizzard. Average temperature anomaly for the winter in the United States. Not one state had below-average temperatures. The month of January 2016 was variable in its weather patterns. Following the warm trend in December, an early cold snap brought close-to-average temperatures to the East Coast, at the same time a storm complex was moving through the Northeast, and due to the fresh batch of cold air, it was able to produce some snow on the back side of it. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the West Coast was receiving needed rainfall to help during its long-time drought. This brief period of relief soon ended. After that, around January 16‚Äì17, a potent storm system moved up the East Coast, bringing the first snowfall of the season to areas like Philadelphia and New York City. A few days later, an Alberta clipper moved through the central United States, producing a swath of snow from Illinois to North Carolina. This small system was then proceeded and eclipsed by a crippling and historic blizzard just days later on January 22‚Äì23. Cities like Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City were buried with of snow, breaking numerous records. In February, the historic weather events continued, as another snowstorm kicked off the month with a swath of snow from Colorado to Michigan. Snow accumulations ranged from , along with winds up to . After the storm system passed, its cold front transformed into another potent snowstorm for the East Coast, with snowfall amounts up to 8 inches. From there, another winter storm occurred as a nor'easter, bringing more snow to New England on February 8. Shortly thereafter, the coldest air of the season froze parts of the Northeast on February 14, with temperatures dipping to as low as , shattering many record low temperatures. The cold lingered into Presidents Day as another winter storm began to take shape. This set the stage for more snow in the Northeast. Snowfall ranged anywhere from in the Northeast, to in the Appalachians. What was interesting about the weather pattern for this system, was the 24-hour weather difference, for example, at 2:00pm EDT on February 15, New York City reported snow with temperatures in the 30s, and a day later, reported temperatures in the mid-50s and thunderstorms on February 16. The system departed by February 17. A week later around February 22‚Äì24, another winter storm formed and eventually produced the second-largest tornado outbreak ever recorded in February. The storm complex produced as much as 59 confirmed tornadoes, with 4 of them being rated an EF3, including areas which don't normally see tornadoes that strong. The massive system moved out of the United States by February 25. March was quite extreme. Around March 10, an area of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere dove into Mexico, where it stalled for a few days, and caused some extreme and record-breaking weather events from March 7‚Äì10. Parts of the South were inundated with days of heavy rain, with areas receiving more than 18 inches of rain, leading to historic flash flooding. At the same time, record-breaking temperatures pushed into the Northeast, with some areas reaching into the low 80s (which broke the record for earliest 80 degree day on record). The storm system also produced snow in Mexico, which rarely receives it at all. Around the spring equinox, winter was still not done. A weak nor'easter formed on March 20, and tracked up the East Coast later that day, producing a swath of snow up to 10 inches in some spots. The nor'easter was predicted to be stronger than what was actually observed, but due to computer models, direction of the low pressure, and amount of cold air present made it difficult to precisely time the storm out. The storm then went on to enter the Arctic Ocean where it explosively deepened to a minimum of on March 23. That same day, another winter storm began to produce blizzard conditions in the High Plains, and dropped up to of snow in parts of the High Plains and the Great Lakes through March 23‚Äì25, along with bringing a significant ice storm to parts of New England, with accumulations of of ice in some areas. Even though winter was officially over, it felt like winter somewhat in the Northeast. An unusual cold blast occurred at the beginning of April, bringing temperatures below average in the afflicted areas. It was cold enough for snow in parts of New England, and as a result, several Alberta clippers began to track their way to the East Coast. The first clipper brought mainly high winds and snow showers to much of the Northeast early on April 3, with mainly high wind warnings being issued. This system moved off rather quickly and immediately began undergoing bombogenesis, with its pressure dropping to by 12 UTC, less than 3 hours after the centre had moved off the coast. It then went to further deepen to a peak of late on April 4. The next clipper system was weaker, but brought a swath of accumulating snow to the southeastern parts of New England. It later moved off late that night. A third clipper system began to edge its way into the Great Lakes on April 6, and brought the risk for wildfires as well. It moved into Canada while transitioning into a storm complex on April 7. A fourth system then moved across nearly the same areas from April 8‚Äì9, bringing even more spring snow to the Mid-Atlantic states. This system actually intensified into a small nor'easter on April 9, and brought of wet snow from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast. It moved off later that night, but brought some more cold air with it. Finally, the cold air retreated out of the region by April 11‚Äì12, as warm air began to surge back in. However, winter made one last comeback during the weekend of April 16‚Äì17, as an upper-level low stalled in the West, producing a major snowstorm that affected the High Plains and Rocky Mountains in areas near the Denver metropolitan area, dumping up to of heavy snow, which led to power outages. The storm also produced record rainfall of up to , leading to severe flash floods. The system moved slowly eastward, as a developing Omega Block pattern was expected to bring extreme relief to the cold stricken Midwest and East Coast.  Events  = Late November ice storm = Around Black Friday of 2015, a major ice storm occurred in the Southern Central Plains, with areas receiving up to of the frozen precipitation. Residents in the areas were without powers for days, if not weeks. The storm also brought snow to parts of the Midwest, with accumulations up to of snow. Historic rainfall also fell too, breaking numerous records. Satellite image of a large storm complex over the Southern United States late on December 26 On November 25, an area of low pressure system moved through the West and central Midwest, dropping snow of up to , and also brought the first cold blast of the winter season. At the same time, incoming moisture from weakening Hurricane Sandra in the East Pacific was starting to streak through Mexico into the southwestern United States. Interacting with the low pressure area, this combined to produce a plume of precipitation from ice to rain from southern Texas into Minnesota, due to high pressure situated off Maine keeping the Northeast dry for the holiday. While causing a potent ice storm on its cold side, on the warm sector of the system, severe floods occurred as well, with areas like McKinney in Texas receiving up to of rain over a 4-day period, causing major flooding. Some areas even broke their records for yearly rainfall totals from this system, due to the axis of moisture shooting into Canada. = Post- Christmas storm complex = Two days after Christmas, a large storm complex with snow, severe weather and heavy rainfall impacted the Southern Plains and southern Rocky Mountains, including all or parts of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The system spawned tornadoes over central and eastern Texas and Oklahoma, while bringing blizzard conditions to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, most areas in New Mexico, and southern Colorado. The main area of low pressure moved northeast from the southern Plains to the eastern Great Lakes, while a secondary low pressure system formed east of the Delmarva Peninsula on December 29. After impacting New Mexico and the Texas panhandle with record snowfall, the storm system left a swath of snow and ice accumulation from western Oklahoma to Michigan. On December 29, the storm system brought a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to New York State and New England. On December 26, 2015, it affected parts of the Texas Panhandle and resulted in the formation of tornadoes in the Dallas area, including an EF4 which struck the Garland area that evening. On December 27, the same storm left 40 cm (15in.) of snow on the Southern part of the province of Quebec (Canada) with temperatures reaching -30C (-32F) as a daytime high, and -45C (-48F) low. Adding up the windchill brought temperatures below the -45C mark for daytime highs and below -50C for the low. An intensifying winter storm off the East Coast early on January 23. = Late January blizzard = A crippling and historic blizzard occurred from January 22‚Äì23 in the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm was given various unofficial names, including Winter Storm Jonas, Blizzard of 2016, and Snowzilla among others. The highest reported snowfall was in Glengary, West Virginia. Locations in five states exceeded 30 inches of snow. The storm dropped 18 inches of snow in Washington, D.C., 22 inches in Philadelphia, 26 inches in Baltimore, 30.5 inches in New York City.Winter Storm Jonas Detailed Updates The Weather Channel, January 24, 2016 (07:15 AM EST) States of emergency were declared in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware, New York, and Washington, D.C. The storm also caused coastal flooding in Delaware and New Jersey. Cape May, New Jersey set a record high water level at 8.98 feet, higher than the 8.90 feet seen during Hurricane Sandy. High winds led to blizzard conditions in many areas. Sustained winds of with gust of 72 mph were recorded in Delaware. gusts were also recorded in Massachusetts. = Early February winter storm = A trailing low pressure system to the previous weeks' blizzard had developed offshore California on January 29. The low and accompanying precipitation moved onshore the next day. At the time blizzard conditions were expected. The storm moved eastward into the Great Plains where tremendous snowfall occurred. On February 1, another area of low pressure led to severe weather across the Southeastern United States. Multiple tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, including a large EF2 tornado. After the storm had passed, the cold front associated with it stalled over the East Coast late on February 4. A new low pressure developed off North Carolina that night and started to track up the coast. It impacted areas already hit hard by the previous blizzard about two weeks prior, and caused messy travel along Interstate 95 (Northeast). The storm brought a quick but moderate-to-heavy burst of steady snow, with some areas in New England receiving up to . = February nor'easter = On February 7, an elongated area of low pressure developed offshore to the west of Florida. While moving inland, it produced a decent dose of rainfall to the Sunshine State as it moved to the northeast. Later the same day, it moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean and began to undergo bombogenesis, its pressure dropping from at 7a.m. EST February 7 to at 1a.m. EST February 8. As it did so, it also began to transition into a nor'easter, as rainbands began to impact the eastern edges of North Carolina and South Carolina. There was some cold air aloft, allowing for a few areas of wet snow to develop further inland. As the cyclone continued to strengthen, it started to achieve the conditions of a bomb cyclone. Furthermore, the system started to form an eye compared to that of a typical Category 1 hurricane, however this was short-lived and dissolved a few hours later. Snowbands began to impact New England early in the morning of February 8, with some bands reaching up to snowfall rates of an inch per hour, especially near the coast. The outermost bands did not reach New Jersey and New York City, due to the nor'easter being far offshore. The storm continued to deepen for a few more hours before reaching its peak intensity of . The system then continued to weaken as it moved northward, before finally merging with another low pressure system on February 10 to the south of it which had also exited from the East Coast. Predicted average temperature departure for Sunday, Feb. 14. Note the large area of dark blue and purple over the Northeast, signifying very cold temperatures. = Mid-February cold wave = During mid-February, record-breaking cold temperatures swung across the Northeast United States and southeastern Canada. On 13 February 2016, Whiteface Mountain underwent a record windchill of -114 degrees Fahrenheit while in Boston, Massachusetts, the temperature dropped to , the coldest since 1957. The windchill descended to , surpassing the previous record by 6 degrees Fahrenheit. In Toronto, Ontario, the NBA All-Star Weekend took place in temperatures of and wind chills near , causing some players and visitors to complain about the cold. The recorded temperatures were the coldest recorded since a very similar cold wave impacted the region exactly a year prior. = Late February tornado outbreak = On February 23, a low-pressure area developed near the east end of Texas and began to track northeastwards into the Mid-Atlantic States in the early hours of February 24. During this period, it also began to interact with some cold air on the back side of it, producing snow and ice in parts of the Ohio Valley, dumping as much as of snow. At the same time, ahead of the cold front, severe thunderstorms developed ahead of it, which would eventually lead to the second largest tornado outbreak of the month of February. = March extreme weather events = NASA satellite image of the storm system responsible for the record flooding in the South and record warmth in the Northeast. Taken March 10, 2016. On March 7, an area of low pressure system from the Pineapple Express moved ashore in California as part of the pattern change that allowed the Golden State to receive much- needed rain. Late that evening, it dove into Mexico where it became detached from the main jet stream. It then stalled for a few days and caused some extreme weather events, such as record-breaking heat in the Northeast, with areas achieving their earliest 80 ¬∞F day on record, which was the result of high pressure off the coast of Florida. It also caused historic floods in the South as well. Areas in Louisiana picked up to over of rain, setting numerous records and triggering multiple flash floods from the extreme rainfall. The highest rainfall report was near Monroe in Louisiana. The historic events also caused rare snow in Mexico, which rarely receives snow at all. = Late March blizzard = On March 21, an area of low pressure moved ashore on the West Coast, with a limited amount of moisture available. Because of this precipitation was originally isolated. As it moved eastward on March 22 it started to intensify and as such snowfall began to become widespread. The storm also began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, achieving a peak of two times on March 23. Blizzard warnings were issued for areas around Denver due to the strong winds accompanying the system along with snowfall. Parts of Interstate 80 were shut down due to the extreme winter weather conditions. Ahead of its cold front, thunderstorms began to fire up, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tornado watch. A squall line later developed out of this as more storms began to fire up and move eastwards, with the severe weather threat shifting more to the east towards the East Coast. The system also brought ice accumulations from from the Midwest into New England. It then rapidly weakened and moved offshore late on March 25, dissipating the next day. = Early April clippers and cold wave = In the beginning of April, an unusual blast of cold air rushed into the Northeast, bringing temperatures 10‚Äì30 ¬∞F below average for most of the area. Some areas even broke records for lowest April low temperatures. This was paired with a series of Alberta clippers moving through the Great Lakes through the weekend of April 2‚Äì3. The first clipper brought mainly high winds with it, knocking out power to a few thousand. This clipper then moved off the East Coast the same day and immediately began strengthening, its pressure dropping to early on April 3, then further deepening to on April 5. The next clipper system was weaker than the previous one, alias only reaching a peak of early on April 3, however, gained enough characteristics to become a full-fledged winter storm. Moving fairly quickly, this snowmaker began to drop snow near the Great Lakes at its peak intensity, and as it neared the Northeast, snow began to spread eastward. Early on April 4, light to moderate snow had reached Boston, with locally heavier snowfall rates at times, which made visibility low. By mid- day, rainfall began to fire up along the clipper's cold front, spreading into New York City and New Jersey. It began to accelerate at the same time, moving off the coast late the same day. Total snowfall accumulations from this system ranged from , in a swath extending from the Great Lakes into southeastern New England. A third system began plowing into the same areas on April 5‚Äì6, bringing more snow to the Great Lakes, and also the risk of wildfires in the Southwest. This clipper transitioned into a storm complex early on April 7, and brought heavy rain to parts of the New York metropolitan area. It lingered into early April 8 before finally retreating into Canada. A fourth clipper system reached the Mid-Atlantic states by the weekend of April 9‚Äì10, and brought both cold temperatures with it, and a swath of accumulating snow of from the Ohio Valley into the southern parts of New Jersey. As it approached the coastline, it began to transition into a small nor'easter. Because of temperatures being at or just above freezing, pockets of wet snow broke out in central New Jersey, with only accumulations on grassy surfaces, but areas further to the south picked up to . The system moved offshore late by April 9, but brought some more cold temperatures behind it, setting more record lows. The cold wave finally lifted out of the Northeastern United States by April 12, due to an imminent pattern change that would allow warm air to surge back into the region. = Mid-April storm complex = On April 13, an area of disturbed weather associated with the jet stream moved ashore on the West Coast. Moving slowly it dived into the High Plains and Rocky Mountains during the course of the day on April 14. The upper-level low associated began to stall in the area and became cut off from the jet stream, while simultaneously producing a major snowstorm in the Rocky Mountains (with up to as much as of snowfall reported) and areas around the Denver metropolitan area and soaked the Central Plains and areas to the south with heavy rain (up to of rainfall was reported early on April 18), flooding, severe thunderstorms, and possibly tornadoes. Multiple rescue efforts had to be made in southeastern Texas early on April 18, due to the extremely heavy rainfall and flooding. The upper low gradually moved out of the region by April 19, alas at a very slow rate.

During the 1940s and '50s he composed famous songs such as \\"Noche triste\\", \\"No te puedo querer\\", \\"Dos cruces\\" and \\"Camino verde\\". Life and career =Early years= Carmelo Larrea Carricarte was born at 1 AM on 16 July 1907 in the neighbourhood of Elorrieta in Deusto, Spain (nowadays a district of Bilbao), to Mariano Larrea and Nemesia Carricarte. He studied commerce at the Escolapios and music at the Philharmonic Society's Music Academy, soon deciding to pursue a career in the latter. He studied organ and choir singing under Jes√∫s Guridi. At the same time he worked as a bicycle shop assistant. He worked for five years at the circus as part of a piano/violin/concertina trio, making his debut with the Carrey brothers circus in San Sebasti√°n. After playing in Barcelona and Madrid, the trio joined the Corzana and Feijoo circuses. After a member of the trio left for the military service, Larrea joined the Bilbao-based dance orchestra La Terraza. An avid pianist, Larrea became interested in jazz. On 31 January 1931 Larrea married Victoria Garc√≠a y Encinas. =Songwriting success= Larrea and his partners reformed the trio before finally disbanding in 1936 due to the start of the Spanish Civil War while they were playing in Jerez de la Frontera. He then joined a band in Sevilla and played the saxophone in the Santa Cruz neighbourhood. Encourage by a fellow musician, Larrea began to write his own songs. His first hit was \\"¬°Qu√© buena soy!\\", buler√≠as sung by Gracia de Triana in the film Escuadrilla. Even more successful was his song \\"Noche triste\\", premiered by Antonio Mach√≠n in 1941 in Seville. Many other popular compositions followed, including \\"Las doce en punto\\", \\"Un a√±o m√°s\\" and \\"No te puedo querer\\". The latter, sung by Jorge Sep√∫lveda, earned him a golden record in Mexico in 1952. Larrea then moved to Madrid, where he played in the Alaz√°n orchestra. Motivated by his friend Mariano M√©ndez Vigo, Larrea wrote a song for the radio programme El Tribunal de la Canci√≥n. This composition ‚Äìoriginally known as \\"Soledad\\" (Solitude)‚Äì was \\"Dos cruces\\" (Two Crosses), his most famous song and one of Spain's most popular boleros.Bacigalupe, pp. 64-68. Originally sung by Jorge Gallarzo, a version that earned him his second golden record in 1954, it has been covered over 80 times. He then penned \\"Camino verde\\", a song performed by Angelillo in the 1955 film Suspiros de Triana, directed by Ram√≥n Torrado.Bacigalupe, p. 61. Many of his compositions ended up as leitmotivs in films such as Manuel Summers' The Girl in Mourning. =Later years and death= In January 1955 Larrea moved to Latin America, where he spent nine years before returning to Spain. He lived primarily in Caracas, Venezuela, where he married Josefina Reguil√≥n Ros√≥n (his previous wife had died years before).Bacigalupe, p. 80. He then went to London to join the orchestra at the Nili, an Israeli cruise ship that toured Nordic countries. He came back to Spain definitively in 1965, living in Madrid with his wife until his death on 2 February 1980. Legacy and influence Larrea is considered one of Spain's most prolific songwriters of the 20th century, particularly in genres such as the bolero and the pasodoble. During his time he was compared to songwriters such as Agust√≠n Lara, Charles Trenet, Osvaldo Farr√©s and Bobby Cap√≥ due to the fact that he wrote both the music and the lyrics of his songs. Spain's most famous singers, including Mar√≠a Dolores Pradera and Jorge Sep√∫lveda immortalized many of his works. In 2011, a garden in Bilbao was named after him, concerts took place in his honour and his biography ‚ÄìCarmelo Larrea (1907-1980) Compositor de boleros universales‚Äì was published.

A notchback version, called Riich M5, was introduced in 2010, but production ended in 2014 due to poor sales. In 2017, Chinese automobile maker Hawtai acquired the license from Chery to build the EV based M1 and production restarted in 2018. The Hawtai model was called S1 iEV360.  History  2010 Riich M1 EV 2010 Riich M1 EV rear Developed on the same platform as the Chery QQ, the Riich M1 (codeproject S18) was the smallest car marketed by Riich, the Chery division intended to sell better quality and better finished cars than the rest of the parent company. In fact, the M1 was a totally new project compared to the old QQ that was still produced and updated several times. Launched the 16 August 2009 in China, the M1 has a five-door body with a MPV-like design. With a length of 3.60 meters the car was designed especially for export, in fact it will be assembled under license in Italy by DR Motor going to be in direct competition with the european A-segment cars like the Fiat Panda, Citroen C1, Peugeot 107 and Hyundai i10. At launch the car was equipped with two four-cylinder petrol engines from the Acteco family developed by Chery and AVL. The 1.0 16V and 1.3 16V. The gearbox was five-speed manual or optional 5-speed semi-automatic on the 1.3. The interior was characterized by central instrumentation. Subsequently the 1.0 engine was replaced by the new 1.1 16V Acteco.

Characteristics of Anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species there may be color variations, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. Description The body of A. latifasciatus is blackish, with yellow snout, belly and all fins and two white bars. The mid-body bar is generally wider than similar species. The caudal fin is slightly forked. They have 10-11 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 15-16 dorsal soft rays and 12-14 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . =Color variations= None known. =Similar species= A. omanensis has a forked caudal fin however its pelvic and anal fins are black and the mid bar is much narrower. The forked caudal fin distinguishes A. latifasciatus from A. allardi, A. bicinctus, A. chrysopterus and A. clarkii. The wide mid-body bar of A. latifasciatus also helps to distinguish it from these species. A. allardi, A. bicinctus and A. chrysopterus can also be distinguished by their white caudal fin. The wide color variation of A. clarkii makes it more difficult to distinguish by color alone, although the presence of a white caudal fin or white bar at the base of the caudal fin indicates the fish is not A. latifasciatus.

In August 2014, one A. latifascjatus survived and was reared to the juvenile phase from a batch of A. latifasciatus spawn from July 14, 2014.. A. latifasciatus are extremely rare within the aquarium trade, mostly due to their habitat being limited to specific regions within the western Indian Ocean..

Lindeman was born in Trondheim, the daughter of Peter Tangen Lindeman (1810‚Äì1888) and Louise Augusta Bauck (1826‚Äì1906). Her father's parents were the organist Ole Andreas Lindeman and Anna Severine n√©e Hickmann. Anna Lindeman learned to play piano from her father's sister, Severine Dos, and was later taught to read music and harmony by her aunt Juliane Cathrine Lindeman Krogness (1816‚Äì1879) and uncle Just Lindemann (1822‚Äì1894). She traveled from Trondheim to Christiania (now Oslo) around 1878 with her musically gifted cousin Astrid Lindeman Swensen (1855‚Äì1936) and devoted herself to music. In 1884 she married her cousin, the organist Peter Brynie Lindeman (1855‚Äì1930). After half a year in Dresden, Germany, where Anna Severine was engaged in private piano teaching, the Lindeman family founded a music school in Christiania, which was renamed the Oslo Conservatory of Music in 1892. Lindeman's husband served as head of the conservatory, and she taught at the school from 1912 onward. Her son Trygve Lindeman (1896‚Äì1979) was a cellist and succeeded his father as head of the conservatory in 1928. Her daughter Signe Lindeman (1895‚Äì1974) was also a composer. Lindeman continued composing after her husband's death. Her compositions include songs, a string quartet, chamber pieces for piano, and chamber pieces for violin or cello with piano.

Biography Dedi Mulyadi was born in Sukasari, Subang on 11 April 1971 as the youngest of nine siblings. His father, Sahlin Ahmad Suryana, was a member of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) and his mother, Kasiti, an Indonesian Red Cross activist. Mulyadi is married to Anne Ratna Mustika (former Miss Purwakarta). They have 2 children: Maulana Akbar Ahmad Habibie and Yudistira Manunggaling Rahmaning Hurip. =Education= Mulyadi finished elementary school at SD Subakti in 1984, junior high at SMP Kalijati in 1987 and senior high at SMA Negeri Purwadadi in 1990, all three located in Subang. Afterwards, he moved to Purwakarta to study law at Purnawarman law school until graduating in 1999. =Political career= In 1999, Mulyadi began his political career as member of Purwakarta's house of representatives for Golkar and the electoral district Tegalwaru. He subsequently was vice-secretary and secretary until he became leader of Golkar's local chapter in 2004. At the age of 32, Mulyadi became the youngest vice-regent, serving under Lily Hambali Hasan's regency over Purwakarta from 2003 to 2008. In turn, he was elected as the next regent of Purwakarta in 2008 and again for a second term in 2013. Mulyadi succeeded Irianto MS Syafiuddin as leader of Golkar in its West Java branch in 2016. He ran as running mate to Deddy Mizwar in the 2018 gubernatorial election for West Java, but the pair lost. His term as regent expired on 13 March 2018. Mulyadi ran as a candidate to the People's Representative Council for the 2019 legislative election representing West Java's 7th electoral district under Golkar and secured a seat. Mulyadi also became the head of the West Java campaign team for Joko Widodo in the 2019 Indonesian presidential election. Mulyadi later called for Jakarta's reintegration with West Java following plans to move the capital away from Jakarta, citing historical associations and integrated transport networks.  FPI opposition  In 2015‚Äì2016, the radical Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) launched several hate crimes, raids and attack against the Dedi Mulyadi administration in Purwakarta. FPI accused the Mulyadi of being a musyrik (polytheist) after he put up statues of Sundanese puppet characters in a number of parks throughout Purwakarta. The FPI also has accused Dedi of debasing Islamic tenets by using the Sundanese greeting sampurasun, instead of the more Islamic as-salamu alaykum. In December 2015, around a hundred FPI members inspected cars passing through the front gate of Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) in Central Jakarta where the Indonesia Theater Federation Award was being held, trying to stop Mulyadi from attending the event.

The group issued one cult favorite single called \\"Horror Asparagus Stories\\" that is most known for its absurd lyrics and psychedelic instrumentals. Though short-lived, the band's sole release has been included on numerous compilation albums. Previously unreleased material by the band was also issued in 2002. The group was formed by an assortment of fellow college students from New Jersey in the summer of 1966, including frontman Roger Kelley, Richard Ehrenberg, Jeff Hildt, and Dwight Harris. Coming together for more or less a lark, rather than a serious endeavor, the Driving Stupid was created to propel the members to national prominence with inane lyrical concepts and stage uniforms. Much of the band's musical content was marked by an unproportioned combination of surf rock, jug music, and nonsensical psychedelia, with explanatory vocals that are surprisingly melodious. The Driving Stupid is commonly compared to the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band for both their unique moniker and unusual sound. On their way to Los Angeles, the group stopped in Albuquerque to record seven demos and stir up interest from record labels. The Driving Stupid completed their journey to Los Angeles, enticing KR Records to sign the group to release their debut single and record an album's-worth of new material. In September 1966, the band released the novelty song \\"Horror Asparagus Stories\\", backed by the equally- nonsensical \\"The Reality of (Air) Fried Borsk\\". Music historian Richie Unterberger remarks \\"Some listeners would subscribe to the \\"it's-so-stupid- it's-brilliant\\" school; many would find the single unbearably amateurish and dumb. But of such things reputations are made, if only cult ones\\". To promote the single, the group toured briefly, however the release was a commercial failure. As a consequence, the Driving Stupid's proposed album project was blocked and, as 1966 concluded, the group disbanded as the members returned to college. Despite their inability to achieve success in their existence, the band became cult favorites as a result of \\"The Reality of (Air) Fried Borsk\\"'s inclusion on Pebbles, Volume 3 in 1979. \\"Horror Asparagus Stories\\" appeared on the album's track listing but did not get placed on Pebbles, Volume 3 until its 1992 compact disc reissue.

It is a four-storey building faced in stone, completed and opened in 2005. Within are the local offices of 16 federal government agencies. Prior to the building's construction they were scattered in different buildings around the city. The name comes from greenstone, a rock found in great quantity in the area, from which the gold that led to Yellowknife's development was extracted. The building reflects that past in two other ways. Its interior stair tower is sided in slanted boards that recall the mineshaft towers still standing, and the location of a prominent local fault beneath the building is marked on the lobby floor. It was designed by the Edmonton firm of Manasc Isaac to be environmentally sustainable. Its central atrium has a curtain wall with photovoltaic cells, the largest such structure in Canada, and the second largest worldwide, at the time of the building's completion. Five percent of the building's electricity comes from that wall; it is used to heat water, some of which comes from the building's green roof and local groundwater, resulting in the building using half as much water as a comparably sized building. Heating efficiency is such that the building remains adequately warm during subzero winter days when many adjacent offices have to close. The building's green design reportedly saves CDN$80,000 in energy costs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by each year. Two years after its completion, on time and under budget, the Greenstone Building was recognized with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold certification by the Canada Green Building Council. It was the first building in Northern Canada to achieve that designation, and the first LEED Gold for the architects. In 2007 the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada further honored it with an Innovation in Architecture Award of Excellence. Building The Greenstone Building is located in the area of downtown Yellowknife referred to locally as New Town. It is on the east side of 50th Avenue, often called Franklin Avenue, a southwest‚Äìnortheast thoroughfare, four lanes wide at that point, which is Yellowknife's main street. It occupies the western end of a rectangular block between 51st and 52nd streets on the north and south; 52nd Avenue is the next street to the east. The terrain is generally level, around in elevation, sloping very gently down to Yellowknife Bay of Great Slave Lake 800 m (a half-mile) to the east and remaining level to Frame Lake approximately 400 m (a quarter-mile) to the west. The surrounding neighbourhood is urban. Modernist high-rise office buildings dominate this stretch of Franklin. Three of them‚Äîthe Northwest Tower to the immediate south of the Greenstone Building and the Scotia Center and Precambrian Building across the street‚Äîare among the city's tallest. The Bellanca Building, once the tallest, and the Centre Square Mall tower, the current champion, are within blocks. In between them the lots have single- or two-storey buildings with space for commercial use at the street level. Behind them are parking lots. A block to the southwest is the Yellowknife campus of Aurora College and, across Franklin, the main offices of the city school district, one of its elementary schools and the log cabin schoolhouse that was the first school building in the city. A block to the west the urban development gives way to open space in the form of a park along the lake shore next to City Hall. On the north development continues for many blocks before an area of taiga and exposed Canadian Shield bedrock buffers the descent to Old Town, the original city, on a peninsula extending into the bay. East of the building, the city likewise occupies most of the space until it gives way to residential property and open space at the bay shore. =Exterior= alt=A view along the front of the building, in which we can see some of the street and buildings nearby in the background The building itself is composed of two sections, both four storeys in height with a flat roof, topped by a small flat-roofed structure that houses the upper end of the elevator shafts, with gardens taking up most of the space on the roofs. They are joined at the northwest corner of the lot, the southeast corner of the 51st Street intersection. It uses reinforced concrete flat slabs as its structural system. Paralleling 51st is a basically rectangular section five bays wide by 17 long. It is rounded at the corner with Franklin, allowing 10 bays on that end. The main entrance portico curves between the two sections at ground level. Joined to that block on the west is an irregularly shaped 14-bay section whose west side begins to curve south halfway towards that end of the property.See accompanying photo Sidewalks surround the building on three sides. In front of the longer of the two sections, along Franklin, is a planted bed with concrete walls and wooden benches. It has shrubs and some small deciduous trees that have grown to the height of the second story. A gravel path runs between them and the front of the building. Along 51st, planters set in the sidewalk hold more shrubs and trees along the entire length of the wing. Use of the Street View option from this link will allow a view of the building's rear. A similar area planted with shrubs and flowers runs along the east facade. To the east, in the rear, is a small park with benches, grass, and more deciduous trees buffered by a concrete walkway. Beyond the park is the building's parking lot. Per Street View from this location. On the rear is a curved curtain wall between two engaged flat-roofed stair towers, connecting the far corners of both sections. It is made of glass with photovoltaic cells inside. A small secondary entrance portico is located in the center. At the building's southeast corner is an emergency exit. The north and east facades, facing the street, have a similar treatment. The first storey is faced in rusticated stone set in mortar. All bays are set with double-pane vertical casement windows on the curved sections and large four-pane casement on the straight sections, recessed with plain red sills and lintels. A similar red stringcourse above the windows separates the stone facing from smooth light tan stucco. It in turn is separated by another red stringcourse from a section with light brown panels and the same window treatments as the first storey. The course doubles as the sill line for the windows; another one serves as their lintels and marks off a division the same as the one below. The third storey has the same treatment. At the roofline, above another layer of tan panels, there is a plain red cornice, echoed on the top of the elevator-shaft building. Both stair towers are faced entirely in the rusticated stone. Each has a single narrow double-pane casement window on each storey, facing south. A single narrow concrete course runs above the first and fourth storeys. The towers have the same red cornice at the roofline. The eastern face of the north wing has a metallic framework of curved metal bars holding sections of stationary louvers. It covers all bays on the upper storeys. There are no windows on the ground level of this face. A flat semicircular roof covers the main entrance portico on Franklin. Its wide overhanging eave, with another red cornice at the roofline, is supported by several dual steel flat-plate brackets extending to the ground. The entrance doors are aluminum and glass, set in a wall of square glass panels. The rear entrance is a smaller portico faced in rusticated stone with a red cornice, flat roof, and single door in a similar glass treatment with light fixtures flanking its upper corners. =Interior= The inside of the building is dominated by a full-height atrium, illuminated mostly by natural light coming in through the curtain wall on the south. A thick black line on the floor marks the location of the West Bay Fault beneath. All the offices within, mostly open space separated into cubicles, are located on the north, with windows looking out over the atrium and through the curtain wall. An open slanted wooden spiral staircase, echoing the many mineshaft towers in the Yellowknife area, complements the elevators in providing access. Its railing is the same red found on the exterior of the trim. On the upper storeys the space below the office windows is faced in spaced wooden flushboard similar to that used on the staircase, with random boards painted red as well. History While the site on which Yellowknife now sits was long known to the Dene whose copper knives later gave it its name, and had been visited by European explorers in the late 18th century, it did not attract any settlement until gold was found in the greenstone belts of the Canadian Shield underlying the area. By 1936 it was a mining boomtown, and most of today's Old Town was built on the bay. Canada's entry into World War II three years later put that on hold, but after the war mining and development resumed. =1953‚Äì2001: Early federal presence in Yellowknife= After the war the federal government, which administered the Northwest Territories directly, realized the community needed space to grow and established New Town further inland, building the city's post office there. In 1953 it allowed limited local government, and 14 years later Yellowknife was formally named the territorial capital.At the time that included what is now the separate territory of Nunavut. This led to an influx of government workers and another economic boom. For much of that time the heavy federal government presence in the growing city was housed wherever space could be found. A small group of houses on Glen Street, or 51st Street just north of the Greenstone Building, was known as \\"Government Row\\". One two- storey gabled wooden house was known as the Federal Building. After the 1970s it was used by the Tree of Peace organization as the Native Friendship Center. =2001‚Äì2004: Design and construction= By the end of the 20th century the gold boom had died down and most mines had closed, although diamond mines had begun to replace them. With vacant properties all over Yellowknife, the federal government decided it was time to build a central headquarters for the many agencies that had been scattered across downtown for decades. At the end of 2001, it bought the property on Franklin between 51st and 52nd for just under CDN$2 million, then occupied by a building that had during the boom years housed Hudson's Bay and Canadian Tire retail stores. Demolition was completed the next summer. In September, Public Works and Government Services Canada, the government's procurement agency, commissioned Edmonton architects Manasc Isaac, specialists in sustainable buildings, to design a building expected to last 75 years on the site, flexible enough to accommodate different uses should that change be necessary, with the goal of receiving silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the Canada Green Building Council. Progress toward that goal started even before the new building's design was complete, with 90% of the material from the demolished Canadian Tire building recycled or otherwise diverted from landfill. During the actual construction, recycled and recyclable materials were used wherever possible; site fences were installed to control erosion that might be caused. As part of its integrated design process, which aimed to both create an exemplary environmental building and a public space for downtown Yellowknife, Manasc Isaac sought community input. Charrettes were held in conjunction with community roundtables, where input was sought from stakeholders, and the architects in turn learned about local construction and design practices. These helped refine its goals to focus on daylighting, public space and green space in designing the new building. The architects settled on a triangular design with an curtain wall on the south side. This would maximize the building's exposure to the sun, especially in wintertime when Yellowknife receives as little as four hours of daylight and temperatures drop as low as , allowing it to warm the atrium in the center, envisioned as a \\"winter room\\". It would also provide some electricity via of embedded solar cells, a feature made possible by a Natural Resources Canada grant program. Almost all offices in the building would be able to have some view outside, or of the atrium, as well. Artificial heat was provided by propane boilers, which emit less carbon than the fuel oil commonly used in the city during cold weather. PCL Construction was awarded the contract, and construction began early in 2004, with a budget of $CDN28 million. For the structural system, Manasc and its consulting engineer decided to use flat concrete slabs instead of more conventional steel framing, for two reasons. First, the concrete could be produced locally. Second, it used concrete with 25% fly ash, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from making concrete by up to 40%. Greenstone thus became the first project in Yellowknife to use concrete made that way, establishing the capacity for further use in other construction. The frame was covered with an insulated, pressure-equalized rainscreen clad in stucco, which uses less energy in its production. To preserve the building's warmth better, triple-glazed windows were set in fiberglass frames. Cooling the building in an environmentally conscious way was also a challenge. During the summer, Yellowknife's days get as long as its winter nights, making it the sunniest Canadian city during that season. In 20 hours of daylight with only four-hour white nights to provide respite, the overuse of air conditioning frequently leads to brownouts and as many as 50 power outages a year. The engineers compensated by adding the louvered steel shades to the south end of the building. The cooling system was based around a high-efficiency air-cooled condensing chiller. Each office was provided with its own thermal controls, from the mechanicals of the compartmentalized four-pipe and two-pipe fan-coil underfloor air distribution system, allowing ventilated air to be warmer and cleaner, to the operable windows and shades, so that occupants could work at their own comfort levels. Occupancy sensors shut off ventilation when no one is present. If these measures worked as planned, the total cooling load capacity would be only 29 watts per square metre (2.6 per square foot), and the building would see a 45% improvement over American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) energy-use standards. The architects made a green roof with two gardens, the second such roof in the city, part of the design. This both made it attractive as green space for workers to relax in on breaks and served to retain some of the rainwater that fell on it in a tank for non-potable uses such as watering the landscaping instead of letting it flow into the sewers. PCL was able to incorporate potentially problematic groundwater found during construction into the supply for the building's washrooms, which were further equipped with waterless urinals and dual flush toilets to reduce usage. Solar power was used to heat water. Total potable water consumption was estimated to be 153 litres per square meter (5.1 gallons per square foot), about two-thirds of the LEED baseline. The interior finishings were also chosen for their minimal environmental impact. Instead of rolled carpets, floors were surfaced in tiled carpet with a high percentage of recycled content to reduce waste material during the laying process. The floor itself was made of partially recycled composite materials with no urea or formaldehyde. Paints and adhesives with low volatile organic content were used to ensure good indoor air quality. Construction went well enough that the designers raised their LEED certification target level to gold. The only significant aspect of the building to fall short of original expectations was the photovoltaics in the curtain wall. They had to be manufactured by the French company Saint-Gobain S.A. and shipped to Yellowknife preassembled since there were no workers there who could do that. One of the planned bands of cells had to be abandoned when the euro appreciated enough against the Canadian dollar during construction as to make its cost prohibitive. =2005‚Äìpresent: Opening and use= The building was completed not only on schedule by shortly after mid-2005, but for $24.1 million, almost $4 million under budget. A committee formed to decide on a name chose Greenstone, from the greenstone belts underlying the city and its surrounding bush, which had been a foundation not only in the literal sense as the city's bedrock but metaphorically, as they had contained the gold that had led to its growth and prosperity. It had been suggested by David Tilden, a hazardous materials specialist with Environment Canada, one of the agencies to locate in the building. \\"Rocks are what Yellowknife is all about,\\" he said. Committee chair The Rev. John Sperry, former Anglican Bishop of the Arctic, said the committee agreed. \\"We all felt it represented Northern life.\\" It also relieved the committee of having to choose to honour one person over another, as it had originally expected to. The \\"green\\" in the name also acknowledged the new building's environmental friendliness. In recognition of the name's geological origins, the location of the West Bay Fault beneath the building is marked on the lobby floor. The building was formally opened on October 14, 2005. Officials from all levels of government spoke at the ceremony. \\"As one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the country, the Greenstone Building is an example of Canada's commitment to protecting the environment,\\" said Ethel Blondin-Andrew, then the federal Minister of State (Northern Development). She touted the estimated $30,000 savings to taxpayers in annual energy costs the building was expected to realize. Northwest Territories premier Joe Handley expressed his belief that the new building would help his government work better with their federal counterparts. \\"When I'm here, I'm in Ottawa,\\" he said. The city's deputy mayor, Wendy Bisaro, said the Greenstone Building would be \\"a wonderful addition to our downtown.\\" First Nations elements were also included, with a Dene blessing and a Haida drumming ceremony. Most of the 15 agencies and their 200 employees moved in shortly afterwards. Several meeting rooms were made available for the use of community groups after hours. Reception Shortly after its opening, it was certified LEED Basic Silver, the first building in Northern Canada to achieve any level of LEED certification. The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, when it recognized the building with its Excellence Award for Innovation in Architecture in early 2007, noted that the photovoltaic array on the curtain wall, the second-largest in Canada at the time of its construction, generated 33.5 kWh of electricity annually, about 5% of the building's total energy needs (during the first full year of the building's operations, this actually worked out to 19%). It was \\"admirable that the designers and clients were willing to take risks in innovations in a challenging project,\\" the jury said. Later in 2007 the Canada Green Building Council upgraded it to LEED Gold, again the first time that recognition had been granted to a building in the North. The council credited the Greenstone Building with 42 of a possible 70 points. Of those, it was found to be the most successful in water efficiency, earning all of the five possible points in that area. It also did well in innovation and design, with four out of five, and indoor environmental quality, at 10 of 15. Materials and resources was its weakest area, with only four of 14 earned. It was the first LEED Gold building for the architects. In 2009 Keith Halliday, an economics columnist at the Yukon News in Whitehorse, capital of the neighbouring Yukon Territory, considered the Greenstone Building's costs and benefits after that territory's government announced its intention to build all its new buildings to LEED standards. While he noted that the construction costs of the buildingHe used $18 million as the basis for this calculation. worked out to $2,500 per square metre, $500 higher than the Canadian average, that was not so much when the additional costs of building in the North and government project management requirements were factored in. He was amused by the use of occupancy sensors to manage ventilation. \\"In an old joke come true, there is also an elaborate system to capture the hot air generated at government meetings.\\" Post-occupancy evaluation Several years after the building opened, Manasc Isaac undertook a post-occupancy evaluation to find out how it had performed, and what could be learned for future projects. Data was collected about the building's performance from SNC-Lavalin, which had been contracted by the government to operate the building. Federal employees in the building were invited to complete a web-based survey on their impressions and comments, which 37% did. The architects still regretted the loss of the extra band of solar cells on the curtain wall. In the future, they suggested, hedging against unexpected currency fluctuations should be done whenever a project depended in part at least on an imported component. \\"Having Canadian capacity for manufacturing would have been even better.\\" alt=Snow-covered flat roofs and snowy streets seen from slightly above. In the far background is a frozen lake and some low hills The building's expected low utility usage profile was a reality. It had used 0.39 gigajoules (GJ) of energy per square meter during the 2008 fiscal year. That was more than the 0.22 GJ/m target of the design model and the 0.3 GJ/m in Canada's Model National Energy Code for Buildings, but those levels were not meant to be predictive. Anecdotal accounts suggested the building's heating was working well: even in outdoor winter temperatures of , cold enough that many businesses in Yellowknife send employees home, the Greenstone Building remained warm enough that workers there could continue in their duties comfortably. In the summertime, SNC had learned to start the chiller before other buildings did, in order to avoid brownouts. In some months, the solar cells in the curtain wall actually outperformed their target, generating over 2,500 kWh during March and April. This was credited to light reflecting off snow cover. During summer it fell down to below 500. During fiscal 2008, the building's metered water consumption was , for a monthly average of . This was higher than the design estimate of , but still far below , the reference measure for a building that size. Thus, despite falling short of the design target, \\"[t]he Greenstone Building still uses only 52% of the water of a comparable building,\\" the evaluation said. Respondents to the survey said they mostly found the building pleasant. They gave its daylighting their highest marks. \\"I prefer the natural light whenever it is available,\\" one said in comments, \\"and have a tendency to turn off the lights in the office when the sun is shining in through the atrium glass wall,\\" although two-thirds said they still used task lighting. Three-quarters said they made use of the window blinds to regulate the daylight in their offices. Almost half said their access to it was excellent. Conversely, the two most problematic areas were personal thermal comfort and conversational privacy. Despite overwhelming use of the windows (which they admitted helped keep the air fresh) and location- specific thermal controls, almost half rated their ability to reach their personally desired level as \\"less than adequate.\\" Manasc Isaac noted that the building operator was attempting to address that. \\"Noise levels are high due to reflected sound and lack of sound dampening,\\" one commenter said. Respondents who worked in open areas, particularly cubicles, reported more dissatisfaction with this aspect of the building than those who worked in private offices. Almost 70% said their ability to hold conversations without others overhearing was less than adequate.

While verbal plenary inspiration (\\"VPI\\") applies only to the original autographs of the Bible manuscript, VPP views that, \\"the whole of Scripture with all its words even to the jot and tittle is perfectly preserved by God in the apographsapograph, an exact copy without any loss of the original words, prophecies, promises, commandments, doctrines, and truths, not only in the words of salvation, but also the words of history, geography and science; and every book, every chapter, every verse, every word, every syllable, every letter is infallibly preserved by the Lord Himself to the last iota so that the Bible is not only infallible and inerrant in the past (in the autographs), but also infallible and inerrant today (in the apographs).\\"  Basis  The doctrine of VPP is founded on God's promise in the Scripture to perfectly preserve His words and this is affirmed in the historical confessional statements of the Christian faith. = Scripture = God's inspired words once given will be forever preserved: \\"The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever\\" (Psalm 12:6-7). Those who deny that the Bible teaches preservation say that verse 7 here refers to the preservation of God's people, not His words. The late Dr Carl McIntire, the founding pastor of the historic Bible Presbyterian Church, understood verse 7 to mean preservation of the divinely inspired words of God as he had preached in 1992 a sermon entitled \\"Help, Lord!\\", from Psalm 12, saying: Other Bible verses quoted to support divine preservation being verbal (words) and plenary (all, full, entire or complete) include the following: *Psalm 105:8: \\"He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.\\" *Ecclesiastes 3:14: \\"l know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.\\" *Matthew 4:4: \\"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\\" (See also Luke 4:4 for similar verse.) *Matthew 5:18: \\"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. *Matthew 24:35: \\"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\\" (See also Mark 13:31 and Luke 21:33 for similar verses.) *John 10:35: \\"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken.\\" *1 Peter 1:25: \\"But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.\\" = Confessional statements = The confessional statements supporting VPP include the following: =Westminster Confession of Faith (1643‚Äì1648)= =Helvetic Consensus (1675)= Like the Helvetic Consensus Formula, the Westminster Confession of Faith cites Matthew 5:18 as proof text of the special providential preservation of the divinely inspired Holy Scripture. The late Rev Dr Carl McIntire also understood Chapter 1 of the Westminster Confession of Faith to be teaching the special providential preservation of God's words when continuing from what was quoted above in his 1992 sermon entitled \\"Help, Lord!\\", from Psalm 12, he said with regard to verses 6 and 7:  Views  On VPI and VPP the late Rev Dr Timothy Tow, founding pastor of the Bible- Presbyterian Church and founding principal of Far Eastern Bible College (\\"FEBC\\"), wrote: \\"We believe the preservation of Holy Scripture and its Divine inspiration stand in the same position as providence and creation. If Deism teaches a Creator who goes to sleep after creating the world is absurd, to hold to the doctrine of inspiration without preservation is equally illogical. ‚Ä¶ Without preservation, all the inspiration, God-breathing into the Scriptures, would be lost. But we have a Bible so pure and powerful in every word and it is so because God has preserved it down through the ages.\\" On the same twin doctrines the late Rev Dr Ian Paisley, moderator of the Ulster Free Presbyterian Church for more than 57 years, said: \\"The verbal Inspiration of the Scriptures demands the verbal Preservation of the Scriptures. Those who would deny the need for verbal Preservation cannot be accepted as committed to verbal Inspiration. If there is no preserved Word of God today then the work of Divine Revelation and Divine Inspiration has perished.\\" The late Dr Edward F. Hills also penned: \\"If the doctrine of divine inspiration of the Old and New Testament Scriptures is a true doctrine, the doctrine of the providential preservation of these Scriptures must also be a true doctrine. It must be that down through the centuries God has exercised a special, providential control over the copying of the Scriptures and the preservation and use of the original text have been available to God's people in every age. God must have done this, for if He gave the Scriptures to His Church by inspiration as the perfect and final revelation of His will, then it is obvious that He would not allow this revelation to disappear or undergo any alteration of its fundamental character.\\" More views upholding the doctrine of perfect preservation or VPP can be found quoted in \\"The Historic Views of the Church Concerning Preservation\\" by Rev (Dr) P. S. Ferguson. These views include those of English puritan Thomas Cartwright (1535‚Äì1603), Professor William Whitaker (1548‚Äì1595), Bishop and Divine John Jewel (1522‚Äì1571), Cambridge-educated puritan preacher Nicholas Gibbens, German Lutheran dogmatician Johannes Andreas Quenstedt (1617‚Äì1688), English Presbyterian clergyman John Flavel (1627‚Äì1691), English puritan and theologian Edward Leigh (1602‚Äì1671), Puritan Thomas Watson (1620‚Äì1686), Puritan John Owen (1616‚Äì1683), first regent and first principal of the University of Edinburgh Robert Rollock (1555‚Äì1599), Swiss-Italian Reformed scholastic theologian Francis Turretin (1623‚Äì1687), Westminster divine Richard Capel (1586‚Äì1656), original member of the Westminster assembly John Lightfoot (1602‚Äì1675), Pastor Dr Jack Moorman, Professor Albert J. Hembd and the Rev N. Pffeifer.  Dispute between Life BPC and FEBC over VPP  FEBC, which embraces the VPP doctrine based on the Westminster Confession of Faith which at Article 8 of Chapter 1 states that the inspired OT and NT Scriptures in the original languages are \\"by His [God's] singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages\\", teaches that God has supernaturally preserved each and every one of His inspired Hebrew/Aramaic OT words and Greek NT words to the last jot and tittle so that God's people will always have in their possession His infallible and inerrant Word kept intact without the loss of any word, and that the infallible and inerrant words of Scripture are found in the faithfully preserved Traditional/Byzantine/Majority manuscripts and fully represented in the Printed and Received Text (or Textus Receptus) that underlie the Reformation Bibles best represented by the KJV, and NOT in the corrupted and rejected texts of Westcott and Hort that underlie the many modern versions of the English Bible like the NIV, NASV, ESV, RSV, TEV, CEV, TLB, etc. The Board of Elders of Life BPC disagreed. The Bible-Presbyterian churches (Singapore), which had their Synod dissolved in 1988 because of disagreements, were again split with one group aligned with the founding pastor Timothy Tow embracing VPP, and another group not aligned with him taking the non- or anti-VPP position. The church and the college had shared premises at 9, 9A and 10 Gilstead Road (the \\"Premises\\"). In 2008, due to the disagreement on VPP, the church sued the college's directors, including Timothy Tow (the church's founding pastor), in Suit 648 in the High Court over allegedly \\"deviant Bible teachings\\" in an attempt to force FEBC to leave the Premises. However the church failed as the Court of Appeal of Singapore, the apex court in Singapore's legal system, held, inter alia, on 26 April 2011 that: #\\"the VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI doctrine which both parties [i.e., the College and the Church] adhere to,‚Äù (rejecting the Church's contention in [59] of the Court of Appeal Judgement that it is ‚Äúan entirely different creature from the VPI doctrine)\\";‚Äù #\\"the College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession;\\" #\\"[i]t is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine;\\" and #\\"[i]n the absence of anything in the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we [the Court] hesitate to find that the VPP doctrine is a deviation from the principles contained within the Westminster Confession.\\" However, even after the Court of Appeal of Singapore had ruled that the VPP doctrine is not deviant, Life BPC continues to regard VPP as heresy since the paper \\"Mark Them Which Cause Divisions\\" issued by its Pastor and Elders dated January 2008‚Äîrebutted by the Rev Dr Jeffrey Khoo in \\"Making the Word of God of None Effect\\"‚Äîis still on its website more than five years after the apex court's ruling.

He is a crazy little man who dresses up as a pirate and has a tendency to attack people. In the series he is one of Nero's personal friends. Tuizentfloot is one of the most popular and recognizable Flemish comic book characters. He has his own statue in Wuustwezel. The character is also very popular in the Netherlands, according to creator Marc Sleen.Jan Smet en Fernand Auwera, \\"Marc Sleen\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1985. Origins Tuizentfloot made his debut in the 28th Nero story De Granaatslikker (\\"The Grenade Swallower\\") (1957) when he rings at Nero's door and invites him to go on adventure together. Nero, however, is tired and tells Tuizentfloot \\"to go to Geel\\"Geel is a Flemish city, known for taking care of families and people with mental disabilities. In the course of the story Nero desperately tries to get rid of this crazy man, but he travels along as a stowaway to Antarctica.De Granaatslikker (\\"The Grenade Swallower\\") (1957) From that moment on he is part of Nero's circle of friends. Character Tuizentfloot is an insane little man who thinks he is a pirate and an admiral. He uses naval expressions, especially when insulting and berating others. Tuizentfloot often brags about all the battles he supposedly won, including the Battle of Trafalgar, the Battle of Abukir and those of Zwijnaarde, Santa Cruz and Wuustwezel. He also claims to have discovered Trinidad, Port Salut and \\"Port Dada\\" and considers himself to be the \\"biggest pirate of all time!\\" Tuizentfloot acts the part too. He is always dressed like an 18th-century buccaneer, complete with black Jolly Roger bicorne and a sabre. In some stories we see him pulling a miniature cannon behind him\\"De Bom van Boema\\" (\\"The Bomb of Grandma\\") (1983), Standaard Uitgeverij. and in one story, \\"De Dolle Vloot\\" (\\"The Crazy Fleet\\") (1976) he owns a 16th-century caravel. Only in a few albums he wears different outfits, namely \\"De Driedubbelgestreepte\\" (\\"The Three Double Striped One\\") (1963), in which he calls himself \\"Otto... aha... Mobil\\" and walks around with a piece of carrossery around his body. In \\"De Neroberg\\" (\\"The Nero Mountain\\") (1986) he wears a traditional Indian outfit and calls himself \\"Kalimpong Singh\\". Despite all this there is never any real evidence that Tuizentfloot is an actual pirate? He is hardly ever seen at sea and only in \\"De Dolle Vloot\\" do we see his own ship. Tuizentfloot can't even swim.\\"De Nerovingers\\" (\\"The Nerovingers\\") (1961), Standaard Uitgeverij Seeing that he is certified insane and spent a lot of time in mental institutions it can be assumed that it's part of his personal illusions. In \\"De Zwarte Piraat\\" (\\"The Black Pirate\\") (1990‚Äì1991) he meets another eccentric man, Pol van den Hoven tot Pee (aka \\"Pottepee\\"), who also dresses up like a pirate and makes many of the same ludicrous claims Tuizentloot does. Tuizentfloot suffers from a verbal tic that makes him use the word \\"aha\\" in almost every sentence he says or shouts. He is also paranoid and frequently attacks people whom he considers to be \\"the enemy\\". Usually he swings at them with his sabre, stinging and cutting them in the process while he yells his catchphrase: \\"Ten... aha... aanval!\\" (\\"Let's... aha... attack!\\"). Much like Captain Haddock Tuizentfloot doesn't shy away from using inspired vulgarities to insult his opponents, many inspired by naval terms. Even Nero and his friends aren't safe from Tuizentfloot's aggression and anger. He frequently fights Meneer Pheip and his son Clo-Clo and destroys their clothing and homes. In some stories Tuizentfloot even sides with Villains. From his first appearance on, in \\"De Granaatslikker\\" (\\"The Grenade Swallower\\") (1957), Tuizentfloot starts a mutiny against Captain Oliepul on Nero's ship and does this again in \\"De Nerovingers\\" (\\"The Nerovingers\\") (1960). In \\"Het Knalgele Koffertje\\" (\\"The Little Bright Yellow Trunk\\") (1958‚Äì1959) Tuizentfloot helps a group of thieves to steal a precious trunk from Nero's uncle and bring it to Adolf Hitler. In \\"De Nerovingers\\" (1960) Tuizentfloot helps the mad scientist Marcus Liberius in his crazy plan to split the Earth in two. In \\"De Bibberballon\\" (1990) (\\"The Shiver Balloon\\") and \\"De Zwarte Piraat\\" (\\"The Black Pirate\\") (1990) Tuizentfloot wants to join the First Gulf War to fight Saddam Hussein. Several of his insane friends are either a nuisance to Nero and co, or even a dangerous threat.Examples would be the mad scientist Marcus Liverius (\\"De Nerovingers\\" (1960)), the secret agent Linus Baddevinus (\\"Het Knalgele Koffertje\\" (1959)), the knight Quatertemper (\\"De Gouden Kabouter\\" (1968)) and terrorist Jean-Marie Kiekepuut (\\"De Bom van Boema\\" (1983)). All in all Nero and his friends do consider Tuizentfloot to be one of their closest relatives. In \\"Nerorock\\" (1990) Nero starts a rock band and Tuizentfloot is hired as their drummer, seeing that he is \\"crazier than Animal\\".\\"Nerorock\\" (1990), Standaard Uitgeverij. When Tuizentfloot is shot by Ricardo in \\"Het Spook van Zoetendaal\\" (\\"The Ghost of Zoetendaal\\") (1979) Nero is even honestly angry and upset. He tells his wounded friend that without him the Nero stories are like \\"beer without foam\\". Tuizentfloot has also saved Nero many times against criminals who dared to attack him. Family In \\"De Adhemar Bonbons\\" (\\"The Adhemar Pralines\\") (1989) Tuizentfloot is transformed into a baby, so we get an idea what he looked like at that age. In \\"Daris Doet Het\\" (\\"Daris Does It\\") (1978)\\"Daris Doet Het\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1978, strip 6. it is revealed that his mother hailed from IJmuiden and his father from Springintveld (a non-existing place which is a pun on the Dutch term \\"spring-in-'t-veld\\", used for enthusiastic people.) This would make Tuizentfloot partially of Dutch descent. He also has a sister, Dina, who is a radical feminist and also wears a pirate hat on her head.\\"De Dolle Dina's\\" (\\"The Crazy Dina's\\"), Standaard Uitgeverij, 1970. Two of his uncles were apparently rich and left him their fortune twice\\"De Spekschieter\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1964 and \\"De Erfenis van Millaflotta\\" (2000‚Äì2001). Tuizentfloot fell in love with Prinses Lovely in \\"De Mosterd van Abraham\\" (\\"The Mustard of Abraham\\") (1973), but, despite wanting to marry him at first, she eventually rejects him \\"because his moustache is too long and his socks too short.\\"\\"De Mosterd van Abraham\\", De Standaard Uitgeverij (1973). In \\"De Gladde Figaro\\" (\\"The Slippery Figaro\\") (1991‚Äì1992) he wants to marry Madam Pheip, but she too rejects him. Friendships with animals Tuizentfloot usually gets on well with animals. In \\"De Granaatslikker\\" (\\"The Grenade Swallower\\") (1957), \\"Het Wonderwolkje\\" (\\"The Magic Cloud\\") (1960) and \\"Kouwe Kwibus\\" (1967) (\\"Cold Weirdo\\") he respectively uses a pig, a pelican and a giant mosquito as his personal mount. Still he can attack and kill them too, like the snake and tiger in \\"De Kat van Katmandu\\" (\\"The Cat of Catmandu\\") (1978). In \\"De Hond van Pavlov\\" (\\"Pavlov's dog\\") (1994) Tuizentfloot's nose is bit off by a small dog. Tuizentfloot is changed into an animal himself twice. In \\"De Kat van Katmandu\\" (\\"The Cat of Catmandu\\" (1978)) he is changed into a cockatoo and in \\"Allemaal Beestjes\\" (\\"All Animals\\") (1981) in a wasp. In popular culture Statue of Abraham Tuizentfloot in WuustwezelOver the decades Abraham Tuizentfloot has enjoyed immense popularity with \\"Nero\\"'s readers. Marc Sleen claimed he was his most popular character in the NetherlandsJan Smet en Fernand Auwera, \\"Marc Sleen\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1985. and in 1973 Tuizentfloot was elected as \\"Comic Book Character of the Year\\" by the magazine Stripschrift. In Damme, West-Flanders, a comic book store was named AHA! Tussen boek en strip (\\"AHA! Between book and comic\\"), after Tuizentfloot's catch phrase. Tuizentfloot is included along with other Nero characters on a bas-relief in Sint-Niklaas, made by sculptor Paul Dekker in 1988 to commemorate Marc Sleen's induction as an honor citizen of the city. In 1995 a special wall near the Saint-G√©ry Island in Brussels celebrating Nero characters, also included him.http://www.stripmuseum.be/nl/bsc/externe-activiteiten In 2000 Tuizentfloot also received his own statue in Wuustwezel in front of the local library in de Dorpsstraat. The location was chosen because Tuizentfloot frequently refers to the town in the Nero albums, claiming to have won the (non-existent) \\"Battle of Wuustwezel\\". It was designed in bronze by artist Gilbert Uitdenhouwen. In 2009 the statue was subject of vandalism and had to be repaired. Despite Tuizentfloot's popularity with readers Sleen was often asked by other readers to remove the character from the series. Especially his bosses from his newspaper De Standaard didn't like Tuizentfloot's aggressiveness and constant swearing. Sleen responded to this by having the character not appear in some stories, but by popular demand he was always forced to bring him back again. In \\"De Mosterd van Abraham\\" (1973) Tuizentfloot visits Marc Sleen at the start of the story to complain about his small roles in his latest albums.

Deaf communities have many distinctive cultural characteristics, some of which are shared across many different countries. These characteristics include language, values and behaviours.  Language  Save Auslan campaign protesters The single most unifying characteristic is sign language, which is at the centre of the deaf culture and community. In Australia, the deaf community's language is known as Auslan. To be fully fluent in Auslan is not necessary, but what is necessary is acceptance of Auslan as a language in its own right and respect for it. A deaf person will help someone learn Auslan if that person can show that they understand Auslan's value for deaf people. Without this understanding the person is unlikely to receive a warm welcome into the community. At best, the person will be treated politely, but as an interloper or a ‚Äútourist‚Äù. This attitude can be found in other language groups too, it is not unique to deaf culture.  Auslan  Auslan has evolved from the sign languages brought to Australia during the nineteenth century from Britain and Ireland. Auslan was not invented by any single person, hearing or deaf, it is a natural language. Any language that is used by either the deaf or the hearing will grow in response to the needs of the people and/or communities communicating it, especially between a child and parents, when it's the first language they are taught. British Sign Language (BSL) and Auslan are both very closely related, Auslan has been called a dialect of BSL. Auslan has developed some distinct characteristics including its own unique signs since the nineteenth century. Most of these new signs were developed in residential schools for deaf children because the signers may have had little contact with other deaf communities. Auslan was also influenced by Irish Sign Language (ISL). = Two major dialects = Although there are minor differences in the language between states, overall there are two main dialects of Auslan. This is a consequence of the establishment of the two major residential schools for the deaf, one dialect is in Sydney (the north) and the other in Melbourne (the south). These two sign dialects of the north and south may reflect the differences in the signing teachers from the two different schools in Sydney and Melbourne. The state and dialect differences are large and noticeable enough to know their state of origin or even the school they attended, but are small enough not to interfere or make any boundaries for communication. = Changes = Today Auslan is undergoing serious rapid changes and expansions. Expansions are occurring in sign language interpreter services, in secondary and tertiary education and in the delivery of governmental, legal and medical services. These enormous expansions have put great demands on the language by both interpreters and deaf people themselves. These developments have come up with these three main responses: ‚Äú(i) attempts to standardise usage, (ii) the development of new signs to meet new needs, (iii) the borrowing of signs from other sign languages, particularly from American Sign Language (ASL).‚Äù (Johnston & Schembri, 2007).  Auslan in Media  A Silent Agreement was the first Australian film to feature Auslan.https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the- screen-guide/t/a-silent-agreement-2017/38099/ Directed by Davo Hardy in 2017 and featuring profoundly-deaf actor Joshua Sealy in the lead romantic role, the film was highly praised for its innovation and honest depictions of deaf characters, portrayed by deaf actors.https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Agreement- Davo-Hardy/dp/B07RDGR4P4https://screencritix.com/a-silent- agreement-2018-review/  References  Category:Australian culture Community Category:Disability in Australia ","title":"Australian deaf community"},{"id":"47705518","text":"Jack Mogridge (1903‚Äì1978) was an Australian rugbly league player from the 1920s and later an administrator.

Hooper developed a lifelong interest in France as a result and has returned many times, including taking several long hikes on ancient pilgrimage trails ( le Chemin de St Jacques de Compostelle). =Education= *Groton School, cum laude 1963; *Harvard College, BA cum laude, 1968; *Boston University, MA, international relations, 1971. =Military service= Hooper served in Germany as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Adjutant General's Corps from 1968 to 1970. Career After serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army adjutant General's Corps (1968‚Äì1970), Hooper owned and managed farms on Prince Edward Island, Canada. (1971‚Äì1976). He returned to the U.S. to serve as press secretary and environmental aide to California Congressman Pete McCloskey (R) CA (1976‚Äì1977). From 1978 to 1980 Hooper served as lobbyist for The Wilderness Society in Washington, D.C. He worked with Congressional staff on regulations implementing the National Forest Management Act of 1976, which reformed timber practices on public lands. He also advocated for federal wilderness legislation (RARE II) to protect federal roadless lands the Western U.S., including organizing Congressional hearings for several statewide bills. In 1980 Hooper went to work for the national Sierra Club and moved back to his hometown of San Francisco. As Public Lands Representative and a registered lobbyist he continued to work on federal wilderness legislation and national forest management issues. During his five years with Sierra Club he helped to enact laws protecting millions of acres of wilderness lands in Colorado, New Mexico, and California. From 1981-2000, as President as well as long-time board member of the Buena Vista Neighborhood Association, Hooper championed the restoration of historic Buena Vista Park in San Francisco. The 36-acre park, designed at the turn of the 20th century by John McLaren, creator of Golden Gate Park, had fallen into disrepair.

The beach park is divided by the marina in a southern and a northern section. Kal√∏ Vig and Helgen√¶s is in the east and a bit inland to the west is the lake of Eg√• Engs√∏. The beach itself is fairly slim, between wide, with a beachline stretching for some at the southern section and in the northern section. It is coarse sandy beach with gravel and several coastal protections composed of rows of boulders extending into the sea. A few short stretches of the beach are broader with white sand. The waters are very shallow with a sandy bottom and reach a depth of some from the coast. Saline content is 20-35‚Ä∞ and there's a weak northbound current. √Ökrogen is a popular beach for windsurfers and kitsurfers due to the shallow waters and brisk winds. Each beach section is equipped with a jetty extending into the sea, from which small watercrafts can be landed or launched. The Canadian newspaper \\"The Globe and Mail\\" voted √Ökrogen one of the 10 best beaches in the world in 2008. The beach is maintained in conjunction with two park areas south and north of the Eg√• Marina. The southern section is situated along the Eg√• river where it terminates in the Kattegat sea. Both park sections comprise large grassy areas, trees and rows of bushes, designed to provide windbreaks and limited privacy for beachgoers and sunbathers. The grass extends to the beach itself, providing enough room to fly kites or play team sports and there is a playground for children.  Access  The park lies at end of the cul-de-sac √Ökrogs Strandvej, which culminates in a parking lot with room for some 20 cars and a parking space for the public buses that serve the area. Buses run from central Aarhus and the university to the bus stops in the area. Danish National Cycle Route 5 runs along the coast of eastern Jutland from Odder Municipality to central Aarhus, passing the Docklands, before it leads north past Den Permanente and Bellevue Beach. The route eventually reach √Ökrogen and continue further north. A coastal footpath leads most of the way from Riis Skov in the south. Eg√• marina lies north of the beach, providing access by sea for larger boats and ships.  Safety  At the mouth of the Eg√• stream, bathing is prohibited √Ökrogen is not a Blue Flag beach and there are no life guards in either summer or winter but both the south and north sections has a safety station with a lifesaver and the entire park is located in a populated area. Aarhus Municipality frequently tests the water for bacteria and algae and rates all beaches on a yearly basis. In 2014 and 2015 the beach received the highest possible 3/3 rating. The Eg√• river empties immediately south of the Eg√• Marina and swimming is prohibited here and some south. Warning signs signals the restricted beach stretch.

Through affiliates, Integris Health Inc. operates 16 hospitals and has health providers in 49 Oklahoma towns and cities. The Integris facilities include hospitals, rehabilitation centers, physician clinics, mental health facilities, independent living centers, and home health agencies, located throughout Oklahoma. History Integris Health was created in 1983 in order to serve as the parent corporation for, and to provide management and administrative support to, Integris Baptist Medical Center Inc. However, the network of hospitals that now comprises Integris Health was born out of a series of Oklahoma healthcare providers merging over the span of three years from 1992-1995, with additional hospitals brought onboard later. Integris's roots can be traced back to 1910 when a six bedroom home in Enid, OK was transformed into Bass Baptist Health Center, a hospital that would eventually fall under the Integris name. Nine years later, Baptist Regional Health Center opened to serve the needs of lead and zinc miners. Modern day Integris began in 1946 when Dr. Andrew Potter and Dr. T. B. Lackey, both of the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma, first proposed opening a Baptist hospital in Oklahoma City. On the Easter Sunday of 1959 this proposition came to fruition when Baptist Memorial Hospital opened its 200-bed facility in Oklahoma City. Sometimes called the \\"Hospital on the hill,\\" Baptist Memorial Hospital sat atop an elevated area of land with little around it. Later, in 1965, South Community Hospital opened after hosting a fund drive to raise the money necessary to build. In 1972 Baptist Memorial Hospital was renamed Baptist Medical Center. Six years later, in 1978, ownership of Baptist Medical Center was transferred from the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma to the Oklahoma Healthcare Corporation. Then, in 1992, South Community Hospital changed its name to Southwest Medical Center. Two years later the first of several mergers occurred, with Oklahoma Healthcare Corporation joining with Baptist Healthcare of Oklahoma to form Oklahoma Health System. The next year, in 1995, Southwest Medical Center merged with Oklahoma Health Systems and the new organization was renamed Integris Health. Over the next few years Integris grew to encompass several regional hospitals. In 2001 Integris built their first hospital under the new name, adding Canadian Valley Hospital in Yukon, OK. In 2009 Integris created a partnership with ProCure Proton Therapy Center to create the Integris Cancer Institute of Oklahoma, a facility that is one of only 14 in the county to offer proton therapy. In 2011, Integris Health Edmond was opened and in 2013 Integris became the majority owner of Lakeside Women's Hospital, greatly increasing their women's services. Later in 2013, Integris became a preferred clinical affiliate of Access Medical Centers, offering patients an urgent care alternative to the emergency room. In 2014 Integris launched an online video platform, integrishealth.tv, to provide a place for patients and family members to learn about their services and educate the community about health issues. Integris Health has partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Oklahoma City Thunder and serves as the Thunder's official health care provider. As part of the partnership, the hospital also sponsors the Thunder's practice facility, which is known as the INTEGRIS Health Thunder Development Center. Construction for the practice facility was completed prior to the Thunder's 2011‚Äì12 season.

At that time, he founded the Best Cellar Press, under which he produced handset letterpress chapbooks giving other poets who have become some of America's best known poets an early audience, including U.S. Poet Laureate Ted Kooser, Albert Goldbarth, Wendell Berry, Alfred Starr Hamilton and Richard Shelton. The Best Cellar Press was the inspiration for the current Backwaters Press in Omaha. In the 1970s, Kuzma also founded the pioneering and influential literary magazine, Pebble. As an author, he has been largely collected by libraries worldwide. Kuzma's poetry collections include Song for Someone Going Away and Other Poems (Ithaca House, 1971), Good News (Viking, 1973), and Selected Early Poems 1958‚Äì1983 (Carnegie Mellon University, 2010).

According to the Poetry Foundation's biography, Kuzma is \\"known among writers and former students as a brilliant, mercurial spirit, likely to forget more poetry than most of us will ever know,\\" Kuzma's long free-verse poems often investigate the frame of personal memory. Kuzma has spoken about reading in the context of his experience as editor of a small press: ‚ÄúI am not even sure I believe in such a thing as good poetry.‚Ä¶ There has not been a single poet, no matter how various my initial impressions, that has not brought something in me alive, to life, or sustained life.‚Äù Greg Kuzma earned a BA and an MA at Syracuse University.

Michel Delville, the author of a major critical work on prose poetry, The American Prose Poem: Poetic Form and the Boundaries of Genre (University Press of Florida, 1998), said of Dickey: \\"Whether it‚Äôs a poem about (or around) Mark Rothko‚Äôs painting Yellow Band or a prose poem about 'Mowing the Lawn' that pauses with Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology, Dickey‚Äôs poetry is grounded in a recognition that, to quote Sherwood Anderson, 'each truth [is] a composite of a great many vague thoughts,' all equally beautiful and disturbing, somber and happy.\\" Prose poet Nin Andrews (author of twelve poetry collections) writes of Dickey's They Say This Is How Death Came into the World that it is \\"seductively inventive, charmingly clever and seriously witty. The pleasures offered by Paul Dickey‚Äôs quirky and irreverent meditations are utterly irresistible.\\" Dickey has a Master of Art‚Äôs degree from Indiana University Bloomington, in the History and Philosophy of Science. In the 1970s, while a graduate student at Wichita State University, he published poetry in The Kansas Quarterly, Quartet, and Nimrod. At Wichita State, he was a student of the American-Filipino poet, novelist, and short story author Bienvenido Santos. Dickey currently teaches philosophy in Omaha, Nebraska at Metropolitan Community College (Nebraska).

A further example comes from the writings of English hermit, mystic, and religious writer Richard Rolle, who expresses his empathy with the suffering of Christ in his work Meditation on the Passion. > Ah, Lord, your sorrow--why was it not my death?

The experience of Affective Meditation is most often precipitated by meditating or concentrating attention on Christian drawings or paintings, music, or literature depicting the experience of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, until the meditator's empathy with the subjects of those depictions becomes sufficiently intense to precipitate emotive expression that may include tears and crying, vocal sounds and prayer, as well as bodily movements.McNamer, S., Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion.

During the late 1970s, psychologist, Yoga teacher, and organist at Culbone Church Joan D'Arcy Cooper, began to explore using the stories told by and about Jesus as spoken scripts with which to lead members of the parish through visualizations and meditations in the tradition of Affective Meditation. Welshman, M., A Tiny Church Called Culbone, Near Porlock. In Somerset Life, 4 November 2011. In 1982, Cooper published Guided Meditation and the Teachings of Jesus in which she suggests that the words of Jesus, as recorded in the canonical gospels, may perhaps have been intended to be considered, and are enriched by hearing or reading them as Guided Meditations, through which the reader or listener can meditate upon the message and meaning inherent in the text, and thereby come to know God.Cooper, J. D., Guided Meditation and the Teaching of Jesus. Salisbury: Element Books, 1982. While affective meditation is a marginal practice, Cooper's books and teachings, and the creative approach to Christian meditative practice that she encouraged, was acknowledged as making an important contribution to the New Age era and movement, characterized by a personal and individualist exploration of various meditative and contemplative traditions outside the boundaries and purview of formal doctrine and religious organizations, including those originating in Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism.Murphy, M., Donovan, S., and Taylor, E., The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research.

It was co-designed by architect Lawrence Nield of Bligh Voller Nield and landscape architect Spackman Mossop and has been plagued by construction issues and criticism since its opening in 1999. The Centre has a 50-metre swimming pool, leisure pool, gym and a multi- functional indoor court that is used for basketball and indoor soccer. Cook and Phillip is one of a number of facilities owned by the City of Sydney, that includes Ian Thorpe Aquatic and Fitness Centre, Andrew Boy Charlton Pool, Victoria Park Pool and Prince Alfred Park Pool.  Location  Fountain The Centre is located within Sydney's Central Business District in Cook and Phillip Park. The park lies between William Wardell's 1862 St Mary's Cathedral and James Barnet's wing of the Australian Museum. The Centre is on the corner of William and College Streets and lies beneath Cathedral Square.  Construction history  The original site of the Cook and Phillip Park Centre consisted of a park divided by two roads and the privately owned, City Bowling Club. Former Lord Mayor of Sydney Frank Sartor was the driving force behind the development when he unveiled preliminary plans for a $30 million revamp of the site in September 1996. The plan for the site was to create a contemporary park precinct within Sydney's CBD. The strategy for the Centre was applauded by architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly, who said that it would be \\"substantially increasing the city's open space quotient, creating a new public amenity and offering an exciting urban opportunity, you'd have to say it's pretty hard to beat\\". The City of Sydney appointed co-designers in Bligh Voller Nield and landscape architect Spackman Mossop with construction commencing in November 1997. The development involved the removal of the bowling club and Boomerang Street and Haig Avenue. The Centre was officially opened by Lord Mayor Frank Sartor in August 1999 after months of delays and nearly $10 million over-budget.  Design  Ice Skating at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney Lawrence Nield was the leading architect for the design, with his past sporting projects including the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre. Architecturally the building layout responds to two main grids, the CBD grid running parallel with College Street and the former East Sydney grid. As the Centre is on a steep slope, the design incorporates a series of terraces that link the urban park and the building. The building is slowly revealed as one moves through the site down the terraced landscape. On the development, Nield said that he felt a \\"special affection\\" for the Cook and Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre \\"whose innovative structure supports a system of pools and paving that make its roof into a fine civic space in a sensitive area of the city, forming a complex piazza that serves both as the parvise of St Mary's Cathedral and as the forecourt for the Australian Museum.\\" The design was described by architect Richard Goodwin as a \\"fairly minimal gesture\\" with a \\"sloping roof glass facade\\"and a \\"mixture of a grand minimal gesture with a series of machines for facilitation of the public\\". Goodwin also said that it could be \\"more accurately described as a giant roof built over a sports complex which has been neatly inserted into the side of the fill\\".  Construction issues  The Centre has been beset by structural issues since its opening in 1999. In 2006, pool manager Jason Konrads said that, \\"Our roof has been leaking ever since we opened in 1999\\". Problems have included leaking water features, stained ceilings, concrete spalling, failed glazing and degraded finishes. The Cathedral Square area above the Centre has also been subjected to graffiti and has largely been neglected. These problems caused the Centre to be renovated in 2006. The works cost around $10 million and included fixing the leaking roof, removing the vacant caf√© and altering the appearance of the forecourt. The renovations were finished in 2007. In May 2014, Sydney Mayor Clover Moore allocated $4.7 million to the Centre for further refurbishments.  Critical reception  The Centre and BVN Architects received a number of awards for the overall design, including the 2001 BDP National Urban Design Award and the 2001 RAIA NSW Civic Design Award. The RAIA NSW Civic Design Award jury said that there was an \\"overwhelming response from the public in support of the Cook and Phillip Centre\\". However, the Centre has been labelled \\"Frank's Folly\\" after Sartor and was derided as an \\"eyesore\\". Architect Clive Lucas said that \\"it's full of skateboarders, seagulls and pigeons and it's just become a slum\\", Farrelly labelled it a \\"gloomy underground pool\\" and former Prime Minister Paul Keating described the area in front of the Centre as a \\"wasteland\\".  Interior artwork  Along the walls of the 50-metre pool within the Cook and Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are eight paintings by Sydney artist Wendy Sharpe that depict the life of Australian Annette Kellerman, a swimmer and performer who overcame a number of obstacles to become a world champion. The paintings are there to provide inspiration to the public and an example of human struggle and achievement. The artworks were completed in 1999 on vinyl ester panels for the opening of the Centre.

History It is likely that the first construction of the cathedral started around the fifth or sixth century, and tradition has it that it replaced series of earlier buildings including a primitive church built on the crypt of the martyred saint, Secundus of Asti. Among other of these buildings still apparent is St. John's Church, used today for baptisms. Around 1070, the building collapsed, partly as a result of a fire that set by Adelaide of Susa in her dispute with the bishops. In 1095 the rebuilt Cathedral was consecrated by Pope Urban II to preach the first crusade. The bell tower was rebuilt starting in 1266 by the magister Murator Jacopo Ghigo consisting of seven floors, plus an octagonal spire, and it is visible in Theatrum Statuum Sabaudiae, a tome which was the result of an ambitious project undertaken by Duke Charles Emmanuel II in the 1660s consisting of two large volumes completed and printed 1682 in Amsterdam, by publisher and cartographer Joan Blaeu. It is a collection of images of places and buildings under the dominion of Savoy in the late seventeenth century which at the time included Savoie, Nice, Piedmont, Aosta Valley, and Liguria.

It is a public health intervention aimed at preventing drowning. Originally devised to address childhood drowning in Bangladesh, it has been expanded across the region.  History  Childhood drowning is a leading cause of death in low and middle income countries in Asia. Practical barriers to accessing health care including cost and distance have led to the under- reporting of drowning deaths and injury. Many LMICs rely on data from health clinics for their official mortality figures. Because drowning victims rarely present to health facilities in these countries, the rate of drowning has been unknown until relatively recently. In contrast, communicable diseases including cholera and dysentery where families are likely to seek health care during the course of the illness have been significantly better recorded and addressed. A BBC World Service documentary, The Silent Epidemic, which was filmed in Bangladesh and Vietnam, documented the scale of the problem. SwimSafe was established to address the high levels of drowning across Asia. It began as a research project in 2001, when health prevention experts designed interviews and went from door-to-door in urban and rural areas across five countries. Ultimately more than two million households took part in the research. The results published by UNICEF and The Alliance for Safe Children concluded drowning was a leading cause of death in childhood in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China (Jiangxi Province and the capital, Beijing), Thailand and Vietnam.http://www.tasc-gcipf.org/downloads/Innocenti_Papers_2008.pdf Following the conclusion of the first phase of research in 2003 which was focused on Bangladesh, the research leaders began looking for public health interventions to reduce the number of drowning deaths and injuries. The first SwimSafe program was developed in Bangladesh in 2005 after the 2003 Bangladesh Health and Injury Survey (BHIS) survey showed very high drowning rates, particularly in children. SwimSafe was developed by The Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh, The Alliance for Safe Children and Royal Life Saving Society Australia (RLSSA) with assistance from the Bangladesh Swimming Federation. After consultation between technical experts, there was a one-year pilot of a draft teaching manual in Savar, Dhaka in 2006. Since 2005, the SwimSafe curriculum has been tested and adapted to suit the cultural and geographical needs of programs in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Thailand. In 2008 SwimSafe started in Thailand where it was implemented by The Alliance for Safe Children and the Thai Life Saving Society. It was partially funded through a grant from the Australia-Thailand Institute. SwimSafe Da Nang began in 2009 and was expanded with funding support from AusAID. By the end of 2012, 16,500 children in Da Nang, Vietnam had completed the program. In Bangladesh, SwimSafe has been in operation since 2005. Initially begun as part of the PRECISE program funded by UNICEF Bangladesh through 2010, it expanded with additional funding from International Inspirations (UK Sport) and AusAID (now known as DFAT). More than 465,000 Bangladeshi children 3‚Äì16 years old have now graduated from SwimSafe. In 2014, SwimSafe in Bangladesh was further adapted to safely train children at higher risk of harm due to health and growth conditions. This began with funding from Grand Challenges Canada. Known as the BASS Project (Bangladesh Anchal and SwimSafe Project) it has been implemented by the University of British Columbia and the International Centre for Drowning Research Bangladesh (IDRCB), with technical assistance from RLSSA and TASC.  Curriculum  SwimSafe employs community-based instructors to teach children how to swim and rescue others. The SwimSafe program consists of 21 lessons of instruction in survival swimming, rescue and resuscitation skills and water safety knowledge. It is taught in a variety of different teaching environments including natural water bodies (ponds, rivers, beaches) above- ground portable pools and in-ground swimming pools. The initial SwimSafe program was developed solely for use in ponds in rural Bangladesh. SwimSafe version 2 was developed to use other natural water bodies such as rivers and beaches and portable swimming pools. The most recent (2014) version is SwimSafe version 3. It adds safety and risk management strategies designed to allow high-risk children to be safely included in SwimSafe and adds in-water rescue and resuscitation for older children. SwimSafe has two levels of certification, Basic and Advanced. The Basic program is for younger children, aged four to six-years-old. The Advanced program is for children seven years and older. It adds rescue skills aimed at rescuing others and basic life support including CPR. It is important that children at this level are confident in the water and have the mental and physical capacity to perform rescue skills. The curriculum includes guidelines for swim teaching, logistics, venue management, instructors‚Äô criteria, training details of skill sets and graduation criteria. Of the 21 steps in the manual, water familiarisation features in eight; another eight steps relate to acquisition of different components of swim skills; three steps focus on rescue techniques and another two steps are about acquiring competence as a survival swimmer. Research has been published in academic journals demonstrating children are successfully using these rescue skills in practice. In 2014, the journal Injury Prevention published a research paper based on interviews with 3890 children who had graduated from the SwimSafe program and concluded the children were frequently using these skills; adults were not involved in any of the reported rescues.  Ponds and portable swimming pools  In many low and middle income countries in Asia there are very few publicly available swimming pools, so alternative venues must be found for water safety lessons. Two of the alternatives used by SwimSafe are ponds and portable above ground pools. Ponds are used most commonly in Bangladesh, with bamboo structures defining the teaching area. Being natural water bodies, the ponds have problems with maintenance and water quality and so are mostly used during the rainy season. There is increasingly competition for use of the ponds with commercial fishing operations. Portable pools (6m by 12.5m) with ladders, sand-filtration systems and chlorination for water sanitation have been used in Thailand, Bangladesh and Vietnam. The portable pools have some practical advantages including controlled water depth and water quality.  Related programs  SwimSafe is part of an integrated package of drowning interventions in communities. Another key program is the Anchal (cr√®che) program in Bangladesh which targets children under five. Each Anchal cares for about 30 children (9am and 1pm, six days per week), by providing a safe, health focused, educational environment for as little as few dollars per day. Through these Anchals over 3,725 children are supervised by trained caregivers. Research has shown children who participated in the Anchal were 82% less likely to drown than those who did not participate in the program.http://www.ciprb.org/centres/international-drowning-research-centre- bangladesh-idrc-b/notable-activities/anchal/ References  External links  * Swimsafe site * http://fad.danang.gov.vn/default.aspx?id_NgonNgu=EN&id;_ThucDon_Sub=177&TinChinh;=0&id;_TinTuc=4605&TrangThai;=BanTin * http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SwimSafe-web.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtNfYS9a_bo Category:Swimming safety Category:Lifesaving organizations Category:Public health education ","title":"SwimSafe"},{"id":"47706494","text":"Silver Town or Silvertown may refer to: *Silvertown, London *Silver Town, a district of Khayelitsha, Cape Town *Silver Town, a district of Rainbow City, Panama *Silver Town (album), by The Men They Couldn't Hang ","title":"Silver Town"},{"id":"47706496","text":"Stadio Vito Simone Veneziani is a multi-use stadium in Monopoli, Italy.

Bundesanstalt f√ºr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg 1959. ‚Üí Online map (pdf, 6.1 MB)The Rammert is unit number 104.11, the Bay is 104.10. The majority of the ridge lies in the county of T√ºbingen, with small elements in the county of Zollernalbkreis.  Geography  The Rammert extends for 18 kilometres from Rangendingen in the southwest to T√ºbingen in the northeast and is 7 kilometres across at its widest point between Rottenburg am Neckar and Ofterdingen. In the north it is bounded by the Neckar valley, in the southeast by the Steinlach valley and in the southwest by the water gap of the Starzel. In the northeast it peters out to a point, which gives it a roughly triangular shape. Its highest point is the Hohwacht at which rises between Rangendingen and Bodelshausen, followed by Langen First near Hirrlingen at 558 m and the 556 m-high Lausb√ºhl not far from the Schadenweiler Hof near Rottenburg. The valleys of the Vorbach, Katzenbach and Krebsbach streams, which head northwards or northeastwards, divide the Rammert sharply. As part of the South German Scarplands the Rammert tilts slightly towards the southeast and forms a striking ledge, about 100 to 150 metres high on the rim of the Neckar valley. The Weilerburg (555 m) which lies in front of the Rammert to the north is an outlier of it. The southeastern slopes on the opposite side are gentler. There the Rammert transitions gradually into the rocks of the Black and Brown Jurassic rocks of the Jura Foreland. The Rammert predominantly forested because of its sandy and clayey soils that are unfavourable for farming. Its forests are intensively used for forestry. The main tree species are beech, spruce, Scots pine and oak. Extensive wetlands only cover parts of the valleys.

It is the episcopal seat of the Suburbicarian Diocese of Palestrina, and dedicated to Saint Agapitus. History and Description Tradition holds that the church was founded atop the site of a temple dedicated to Jove the Emperor, located in the Ancient Roman forum of Praeneste. Documents cite the transfer in 898 of the relics of Saint Agapitus, since moved to the interior of the Basilica cimiteriale extramoenia delle Quadrelle. The original paleo-Christian church was enlarged by bishop Conone with the addition to two lateral aisles and the construction of a crypt in the presbytery. The basilica was consecrated on 16 December 1117 by Pope Pasquale II. During the civil conflicts in 1437 between the Colonna family and the papacy, part of the facade including the bell-tower were razed, and the relics of Sain Agapitus were take to what is now Tarquinia. A century later, they were returned at the request of Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna and pope Sixtus V. They are housed in a bejeweled bust of silver, and displayed in a public procession in honor of the saint held every 18 August. The facade, originally Romanesque-style has a portal built in 1505. It displays the heraldic coat of arms of Cardinal Girolamo Bassi della Rovere, depicting Agapitus and his palm of martyrdom adjacent to the coat of arms of the Colonna family. The interior nave is decorated with medallions depicting Bishops of Praeneste. While the windows depict saints an martyrs associated with the town. Among the altarpieces are one depicting the Decapitation of Sant‚ÄôAgapito by Carlo Saraceni (last chapel on right), a Crucifixion with the Virgin and St Lawrence and a Savior by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta.

It was initially built in the 9th century in the Venetian-Byzantine style. It was restored and rebuilt several times, finally in the 18th century, when the fa√ßade was altered, stucco applied to the central nave and the ceiling vaults of the interior and three altarpieces added - 'Jesus among the Doctors' in the Chapel of St Francis, a 1771 'Visitation of the Virgin' by Giambattista Canal and 'The Adoration of the Magi' by Jacopo Marieschi (the third of these has now been moved elsewhere). The ceiling painting is also by Canal in the style of Tiepolo and shows scenes relating to the church's patron saint - her baptism in the left aisle, the saint in glory in the central nave and episodes from her life in the right aisle. Its right side overlooks the Giudecca canal and has a portico with Doric style columns, taken from the nearby church and monastery of Santi Biagio e Cataldo during the latter's 1593 restoration. In a niche inside the porch is a Gothic-style image of the 'Holy Bishop' below a 14th-century crucifixion with donors in the Byzantine style, set in a three- faceted bezel. Its interior is a three-nave basilica, whose original columns and capitals survive. A chapel now houses the remains of Blessed Giuliana of Collalto, translated there in 1822, again from santi Biagio e Cataldo. The left aisle also houses an 18th-century marble sculpture of the Virgin Mary and Christ by Gianmaria Morlaiter in the left, whilst the firsts altarpiece in the right aisle houses the central part of a triptych of saint Roch and the angel under a lunette of the Virgin and Child, both by Bartolomeo Vivarini and dating to 1480. The presbytery also houses a painting of the Last Supper by Benfatto Alvise Dal Friso, from the Veronese school.

It is dedicated to Saint Euphemia. History The present basilica stands on a fourth century basilica, of which not much is known. Although some features are still visible. The present basilica was ordered to be built by Elijah, the Archbishop of Aquileia, some time in the sixth century, during his retreat from the invasion of the Lombards. After which Elijah proclaimed himself patriarch and dedicated the church to Saint Euphemia. During the sixth through early seventh century the basilica was the seat of the pro-Roman and pro- Byzantine branch of the church until the formation of the patriarchate of Grado. Due to the suppression of the Grado patriarchate by the Venetians it lost the title of cathedral in 1451, but shortly after in 1455 the bell tower was built, possibly to compensate for this. Alterations to the church were made in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, although these were partly removed in twentieth century restorations. Features Much of the fame of the basilica comes from the incredibly well preserved sixth century floor mosaics that decorate the basilica, as it is extremely rare to find the original floor mosaics preserved in an early Christian basilica. Features from the fourth century basilica are visible in the nave, including a visible fragment of its floor mosaics and a Corinthian capital. The bell tower is topped with a cast copper weathervane statue of Archangel Michael, which has become a symbol of the city. The apse is decorated with a thirteenth century Gothic fresco of Christ enthroned. On the left side of the central nave stands a tall hexagonal pulpit, which is adorned with thirteenth century sculptured decorations. Next to the basilica complex is an octagonal baptistery which is also adorned with sixth century floor mosaics and contains a large marble dipping basin.

It was signed by Viceroy of India Lord Lansdowne and the Chinese Amban or resident in Tibet, Sheng Tai on 17March 1890 in Calcutta, India. Background The British imperative in North East India was to open the markets of Tibet and by extension China to their manufactured textiles, tobacco, grain, tools and tea. At the same time, in the context of The Great Game being played out with the Russian Empire in the region, the British considered it important to create a buffer zone north of their Indian empire to prevent incursion by the Russians. Provisions Under Article 1, the boundary of Sikkim and Tibet was defined as the crest of the mountain range separating the waters flowing into the Teesta River in Sikkim and its tributaries from the waters flowing into the Tibetan Mochu River and northwards into other rivers of Tibet. The line commenced at Mount Gipmochi on the Bhutan frontier, and followed the above watershed to the point where it met Nepali territory. Aftermath A protocol was added to the original convention in December 1893. \\"Regulations Regarding Trade, Communications , and Pasturage to Be Appended to the Sikkim-Tibet Convention of 1890\\" allowed for the establishment of a British trading post in Yatong, Tibet as well as laid down regulations concerning pasturage and communication.

The ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù situation is not the refugee numbers (number of migrants seeking protection) but the system‚Äôs failure to respond in an orderly way in the government‚Äôs legal obligations. Some notable crisis are; European migrant crisis, English Channel migrant crisis and World War II evacuation and expulsion. Refugee crisis refer to movements of \\"large\\" groups of displaced people which may or may not involve a migrant crisis. USA government‚Äôs legal obligations inadvertently created 2014 American immigration crisis. Crisis developed because of unaccompanied children who does not have a legal guardian to provide physical custody (USA ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child) and care quickly overwhelmed the \\"local border patrols\\" creating a migrant crisis. Push-Pull view: The \\"refugee crisis\\" is a humanitarian one for those adopting the \\"Push\\" factors as main cause, while they acknowledge that reasons for migration may be mixed, even the refugees as weapons. For those focusing on \\"Pull\\" factors, the \\"migration crisis\\" has its roots in border enforcement policies (Immigration system) that were perceived as not sufficiently strict (family separation policy), severe (Operation Streamline), or careful (catch & release) by potential migrants. Compared to refugee crisis (refugee is a refugee), migrant crises also have a separate or distinguish between the ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù refugee from the ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù migrant and play into fear of cultural, religious, and ethnic difference in the midst of increasing intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations and lacking in predictability, job security, material or psychological welfare for many in Europe (such in closure of Green Borders). \\"Migrant crisis management\\" involves dealing with issues (\\"immigration system\\", \\"resource management\\", etc) before, during, and after they have occurred. This is an area which Global Crisis Centre of PricewaterhouseCoopers works by developing outlines on roles, opportunities and challenges faced by governments and private sector actors in addressing migration crisis through the 'push' and 'pull' factors that influence migration. According to Global Crisis Centre, migrant crisis management is shaped using the definitions and responsibilities outlined in the UN‚Äôs Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and subsequent Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and international solidarity and burden-sharing with collaboration, communication and information dissemination, which are absolutely necessary for solving migratory issues of the world.  Crisis management  Immigrant receiving states need effective management strategies at achieving a set of tasks for responding to the threat [reasons of crisis] to re-establish a perceived normalcy. \\"Transboundary crisis management\\" (migration is transboundary) involves co-decision, shared procedures and collective instruments in aligened with the steps below: *Detection: Recognition of threat. (process: emerging- timely) *Sense-making: critical information for picture of the situation. (process: the collecting, analysing, sharing) *Decision-making: formulation of an effective strategy (process: formulation of key decisions) *Coordination: collaboration between key partners. *Meaning-making: Messaging on the path taken (process: explanation , actionable advice, and a sense). *Communication: message delivery (victims, citizens, stakeholders, ...). *Accountability: Production of documents that list the decisions and strategies. = European migrant crisis = Management of the crisis shows succession of four scenarios. # (2011 fall of the Gaddafi) Libya let the flow of irregular migrants. EU Commission approve \\"Communication on Global Approach to Migration and Mobility\\" (GAMM). # (November 2013-October 2014) The Italy's humanitarian Operation Mare Nostrum. # (November 2014-September 2015) The EU recognize humanitarian and migratory pressures shelves GAMM and develops another comprehensive approach # (October 2015) Migrants and refugees: the European Council secure the borders against the unwanted migrants and refugees. (Valletta Summit on Migration) = Role of NGO = Institution that works in this area is the Migration Policy Institute. Global Crisis Centre of PricewaterhouseCoopers works on migrant crisis management.  Crisis and immigration system  Broken immigration system (Crisis) is what immigration experts and lawyers refer to as failure in management of \\"push and pull factors.\\" Push forces for the displaced people are summarized as running from horrors and poverty in the departure country toward a broken immigration system in the receiving states. Pull forces are receiving states having a functioning economy, the safer-faster journey with the help of communication technology (organize and warn) and established smuggler networks which has safer-faster ways to move people. For a full description Human migration#Lee. The condition of refugee or asylum seekers in receiving countries, from the perspective of governments, employers, and citizens, is a topic of continual debate (debate on migrant crises), and on the other end, the violation of migrant human rights is an ongoing crisis. = Immigration reform = According to Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International, Immigration reform is the solution to \\"Migrant crisis\\" through implementing procedure or protocols to manage push and pull factors.  Crisis and resource management  Broken resource management toward the immigrants is part of the inability to develop efficient responses to people in need, causing crisis. The asylum offices in USA, United Kingdom and Australia manages the immigration services. = USA = During 2014 American immigration crisis, immigration courts as well as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum system are completely under-resourced and confronting an unmanageable caseload. In June, 2019 (five years into crisis), more than 350 \\"unaccompanied children\\" have been removed from a holding facility in Texas to bring it into compliance as designed to hold around 120. Resource management towards the immigrants in USA includes \\"private sector\\" involvement as listed in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Law mandates that all companies must help the federal government. Specific immigration areas where human resource managers must ensure compliance by meeting the legal requirements of this immigration reform regulation by incorporating the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) Form I-9 into their hiring processes. Another case for resource management for migrant crisis is the Trump wall, which is a colloquial name for President Trump's solution to immigration. President Trump signed Executive Order 13767, which formally directed the US government to begin attempting wall construction. Executive Order 13767 followed with the 2018 federal government shutdown because of presidential veto on any spending bill that did not include \\"resource\\" on wall funding. In February 2019, Trump signed a Declaration of National Emergency, saying situation is a \\"crisis,\\" officially declaring a \\"Migrant Crisis\\" in the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. = EU = The financial burden of crises: Germany allocated roughly 10 billion Euros for the cost of refugee care and acceptance in 2015. On the other hand Greece was exempt to pay from EU-wide refugee sharing initiatives between 2013 and 2015. = UK = Resource management toward the immigrants in UK managed under National Asylum Support Service (NASS) which is tasked with the responsibility for regulating entry to, and settlement in the interests of sustainable growth and social inclusion. NASS is a section of the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) division of the Home Office which support \\"otherwise be destitute.\\" Provision of accommodation is part of the process.

In 1952 he joined the fledgling Virus Research Centre in Pune, and worked under the supervision of some of the finest vector control specialists such as Dr T Ramachandra Rao. In recognition of his outstanding work as a young research scientist, in 1957 he was awarded a Fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue a Master's program in Public Health from the University of California.[4] He went on to secure a Diploma in Acarology from the University of Maryland at College Park. He returned to India in 1960 and rejoined the Virus Research Centre where he was asked to lead the investigation into the mysterious Kyasanur Forest Disease in rural Karnataka. The origins of the disease was unknown. His pioneering work on the role of migratory birds in spreading disease vectors as part of the investigation into KFD, conducted under the supervision of the eminent ornithologist the late Dr Salim Ali, led to his doctoral degree from Pune University. He was then assigned as a Senior Scientist to the World Health Organisation Project on Genetic Control of Mosquitoes in New Delhi, during which time he expanded the body of knowledge on mosquito population behaviour. In 1975 he was posted to Pondicherry where he founded the Vector Control Research Centre - a research centre set up to study ecological control of vector borne diseases. The VCRC, under his leadership, contributed significantly to the control of Japanese Encephalitis in Burdwan District. However its flagship achievement under the leadership of Dr Rajagopalan was to pioneer the technique of Biological Control, which combined minimal chemical intervention with environmental measures and the use of natural mosquito larval predators to bring down the incidence of diseases like filariasis. This was demonstrated spectacularly over five years in Pondicherry and Shertallai in Kerala. He has travelled extensively all over the world. He was a Rockefeller Fellow; member of STAC (Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee) of WHO; WHO Expert committees on Malaria, Filariasis and Vector Control; WHO Steering committee of TDR (Tropical Diseases Research) on Filariasis and Biological Control of Vectors. He was also WHO consultant for malaria control in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Vietnam. He has published more than 200 scientific papers while in service. He started a M.Sc. Medical Entomology course at the VCRC for the first time in India, and which turned more than 100 graduates. He had also guided 18 students for Ph.D. while at the VCRC. After his superannuation in 1990, he served the World Health Organization as a member of their steering committees on Filariasis and on biological control of vectors.[1] He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine, UK[2] and is credited with several articles on vector control and acarology.[6][7] He continues to write and talk on Vector Control issues to schools, universities and research bodies.  Scientific Interests  Dr Rajagopalan has worked extensively on ecological aspects of vector borne diseases for four decades on a variety of diseases in India. Summarising his vast body of work: * Japanese Encephalitis and its control in several states; * On ticks and mites, small mammals, birds, and on the Epidemiology of Kyasanur Forest Disease; * Genetic control of mosquitoes; * Integrated vector control methods with community participation to control Bancroftian Filariasis in Pondicherry * Elimination of Brugian Filariasis in Shertallai; * Control of Island Malaria in Rameswaram and Riverine and urban malaria in Salem * Malaria control in Coastal villages of Pondicherry; Malaria control in Tribal areas of Orissa, etc.) He started a M.Sc. Medical Entomology course at the VCRC for the first time in India, and which turned more than 100 graduates. He had also guided 18 students for Ph.D. while at the VCRC.  Lifelong Learner  Dr Rajagopalan has continuously kept himself abreast with the body of knowledge in vector biology. He has received extensive training on arboviruses from 406th SEATO research Centre, Bangkok, at the National Institutes of Health, Tokyo, at theTrinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, Port- of-Spain and at the East African Virus Laboratory in Entebbe in Uganda. He sharpened his knowledge of Malaria vector control at the Malaria Research Institute, Amani in Tanzania and on mosquito taxonomy from P.F.Mattingly at British Museum (Natural History), London. He had the privilege of learning Ecology under Charles Elton at Bureau of Animal Populations, Oxford; and Acarology under Dr Hoogstraal, US Naval Medical Research Unit in Cairo during his career. The great Ornithologist, Dr Salim Ali, was his Ph.D.guide. Having worked extensively in the field investigating diseases with unknown etiology, and on the epidemiology of many vector borne diseases in the field all his life, he is a complete biologist. He was associated with Dr Jorge Boshell and many others of the Rockefeller Foundation for two decades. In his work on the Filariasis Control Program in Pondicherry, Dr Rajagopalan personally learnt and applied the then new field of population statistics in the field to establish a control parameter for the Program.  Awards and Honours  He was awarded P.N.Raju oration award of ICMR in 1980, for his outstanding contribution in the field of vector biology and control; the prestigious Om Prakash Bhasin Award for Science and Technology was awarded in the field of Health Sciences, in 1985; Charles University, Prague, Gold Medal for his long standing contribution to science in 1988; Britain‚Äôs prestigious Royal Society of Biology elected him as Fellow in 1989., The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine elected him as a Fellow (Tropical Medicine) in 1990. In recognition of his body of scientific work, he was honoured with a Padma Shri by President R Venkataraman in 1990.  Post Retirement  In the years after retirement, he continues to serve thereafter in many institutions in advisory committees and also in teaching as visiting professor at the SRM University School of Public Health. In his post retirement period, he published scores of critical articles on Public Health in India, wrote many articles on Popular Science, Social and Esoteric subjects as well and which have been published and welcomed. Life Time Achievement awards were presented to him by ( (1) the Association of Medical Microbiologists of India; (2) National Congress of Parasitology, and, (3) Anna University Department of Biotechnology, Chennai. (4) In 2014, he was honored by the School of Public Health, SRM University, Chennai (India‚Äôs largest and richest private University) at the First Global Public Health Conference for his lifelong contribution to Public Health. (5) In January 2016, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme and The Indian Association of Epidemiologists, at their meeting at Bangalore, conferred another Life Time Achievement award on him. (6). On February 27, 2017, the National Academy of Vectors and Vector Borne Diseases and the Central University of Tamil Nadu at Thiruvarur, at a glittering function gave yet another Life Time Achievement Award to him. (7) The Frontline News Magazine, in its issue of April 28, 2017, published an article about his life and achievements, ‚ÄúBattle against Mosquitoes‚Äù, written by Dr A. Raman, Professor at Charles Strut University, Australia. (8)On 13 February 2019, the Society for Vector Ecology (SOVE) ‚Äì The Indian Chapter‚Äîat its first meeting in Panjim, Goa, conferred the Dr T.Ramachandra Rao memorial Gold Medal along with a Shield and a Citation, for his outstanding achievements in the Field of Medical Entomology. He delivered an Oration on Malaria, and this was published in April 2019.  List of Publications  # Rajagopalan, P.K. Larva and pupa of Aedes (Stegomyia) Walbus Theobald 1905 (Diptera: Culicidae).

Most notably he toured with the Original All Blacks on their 1905‚Äì06 tour of the British Isles, France and North America. They were the first New Zealand representative team to visit the British Isles, and of their 32 matches there Cunningham played in 23. He played mainly at lock, and was added to the touring party due to his strong scrummaging ability. He played in three Test matches during the trip: against Scotland, Ireland and France, but did not play in the loss to Wales due to injury, the All Blacks' only defeat on tour. Born near Te Awamutu, Cunningham originally played club rugby in Waihi, in the Coromandel region. Lying within the Auckland Rugby Football Union's boundaries, he was selected to play for Auckland province in 1899 and continued to represent the side until his retirement in 1913. He was first picked for New Zealand in 1901, and played against New South Wales that year, but was not selected again until the 1905 Originals' tour. After the tour he continued to represent New Zealand in both 1907 and 1908. Affiliating to Rongowhakaata, he was a member of the first ever New Zealand MƒÅori team in 1910, and played for them again in 1912. On retirement in 1913 he had appeared for Auckland 45 times, and for New Zealand 39‚Äîboth large numbers for the time.  Early life and family  Born at Rangiaowhia, near Te Awamutu, on 8 July 1874, Cunningham was the son of Hera (Sarah) Ngaihika Halbert and her second husband, James Cunningham. Hera was the daughter of Thomas Halbert, a whaler and trader who landed in Poverty Bay in about 1832, and his fifth wife, Keita Kaikiri, who belonged to the Rongowhakaata iwi. Hera later remarried Paratene Tatae, a cousin of Te Kooti: their daughters included Reremoana Hakiwai, and Keita Kaikiri Paratene, who married Reweti Tuhorouta Kohere. Cunningham married Ethel Minnie Dance of Waihi on 23 September 1907. The same year, Ethel gave birth to their son, William Henry Cunningham, however he died at only a day old. This was the only child the couple had.  Early career  Cunningham first played representative rugby union for Auckland province in 1899. He was selected from his club Waihi West (a club in Waihi on the Coromandel Peninsula), which was affiliated to the Goldfield subunion. At the time the Goldfields Rugby Union was a subunion of the Auckland Rugby Football Union, but its constituent clubs are now affiliated to the Thames Valley Rugby Football Union. He was first selected to play for New Zealand in 1901, and played against Wellington and the New South Wales team that was touring New Zealand at the time. Both matches were comfortably won, with the tourists defeated 20‚Äì3. Cunningham played his first of four matches for Auckland against international opposition, against the same New South Wales side a week later, with his Auckland team winning 24‚Äì3. Cunningham moved to Auckland in 1902, and played his club rugby for City, before joining Ponsonby the following season. He had been displaced from the national team by this time, with Cantabrian Bernard Fanning preferred at lock. The New Zealanders used a different scrum formation than seen today, and only one lock was ever required. Despite not being selected for New Zealand in 1904, Cunningham continued to appear for Auckland, and played in two particularly notable matches that season. In 1904 the first Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial challenge trophy won by defeating the holder, was to become the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Cunningham in the side, Auckland lost 6‚Äì3. The second notable match that season was against the touring British Isles who were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Aucklanders defeated the British Isles side 13‚Äì0, with Cunningham scoring a try and contributing significantly to the dominance of his team's forwards.  Original All Blacks  Cunningham and the other Original All Blacks that toured the British Isles, France and the United States during 1905‚Äì06. The team won 34 of their 35 tour matches. Cunningham is standing in the back row, third from left. The first ever tour of a New Zealand representative team to the British Isles was planned for 1905, and a preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand was undertaken to help fund the tour. Cunningham was not in the original touring squad, and so played for Auckland against New Zealand. According to Winston McCarthy, New Zealand's forwards were at \\"sixes and sevens mainly through want of a good lock.\\" Following the conclusion of the preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand it was clear that a specialist lock forward needed to be added to the side. Fanning, who had kept Cunningham out of the New Zealand side in 1903 and 1904, had retired following the 1904 season and consequently Cunningham did enough to earn selection as the team's only specialist lock. The team departed aboard the Rimutaka and during the voyage conducted training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by the team's captain, Dave Gallaher, with help from Cunningham. Vice-captain and first five-eighth Billy Stead was in charge of the backs, and consequently the services of the New Zealand Rugby Union-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8 September 1905. After finally arriving in England, the side opened their tour against Devon. Cunningham played in the match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55‚Äì4. Devon were expected to pose a serious challenge, but were overwhelmed and only managed to score a drop-kick. A series of large victories followed against domestic opposition throughout England, and by the time the All Blacks played their first Test match against Scotland, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15. When time for the Scotland Test did arrive, it was discovered that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements, and had frozen over. The Scotland Football Union wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7‚Äì6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries, including one to Cunningham, to win 12‚Äì7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.: \\"despite Scotland having a 7‚Äì6 lead at half-time, the All Blacks always looked the better team. And yet the score would not come.\\" Cunningham was selected for the Ireland match a week later. The fixture was won 15‚Äì0 by New Zealand in front of 12,000 people at Landsdowne Road. The tourists then returned to England where they defeated England 15‚Äì0 at Crystal Palace, but Cunningham was not selected due to injury. He was still injured for the Wales Test, and this may have contributed to New Zealand's defeat. The 3‚Äì0 loss, the New Zealander's first of the tour, was narrow and controversial, and according to team manager Dixon, \\"New Zealand suffered by the absence from the team of G. W. [George] Smith, W. Cunningham, and J. W. [Billy] Stead.\\" Cunningham recovered to play the team's final Test, against France in Paris, where he played as \\"breakaway\\" (flanker) rather than his usual position of lock. His last two tour matches were against British Columbia during the American leg of the tour, after which the side returned to New Zealand. The \\"Original All Blacks\\"‚Äîas the team is now known‚Äîhad played 35 games and lost only once. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles, of which Cunninghham had played 23, New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. The 1905‚Äì06 Originals are remembered as perhaps the greatest of All Black sides, and set the standard for all their successors. They introduced a number of innovations to Britain and Ireland, including specialised forward positions and unfamiliar variations in attacking plays.  Later career  Anglo-Welsh. Cunningham is seated in the middle row on the far right.alt=Photo of a group of rugby players posing in their uniforms. Cunningham continued to play for Auckland on his return from the Originals' tour. They had regained the Ranfurly Shield in 1905, and he played in a number of shield defences over the subsequent seasons. He was selected for the New Zealand team that toured Australia in 1907 where he played seven matches, including all three Tests against Australia. He was again selected for the All Blacks in 1908, this time to play the touring Anglo-Welsh team, and played in all three Tests. This was his last appearance for New Zealand, which gave him 39 appearances for his national team, including 9 Test matches. He was later selected for the inaugural New Zealand MƒÅori team (now called the MƒÅori All Blacks) on their 1910 tour of Australia, and again for another tour in 1912. He continued to play for Auckland until 1913. This period included two more matches against international opposition: a victory over the 1908 Anglo-Welsh side 11‚Äì0, and a defeat of Australia in 1913. Auckland had held the Ranfurly Shield throughout this time, and had endured a number of close shield challenges during their reign. They had 23 successful shield defenses before they faced Taranaki on 16 August 1913. In the match Taranaki scored a converted try (worth five points at the time) four minutes from full-time to end Auckland's shield reign. Cunningham had played in 16 of Auckland's 24 shield matches during their tenure. He retired from provincial rugby at the end of that season.  Personal life and playing style  Cunningham was very physically fit and strong, and was \\"remarkably agile\\" according to writer Matt Elliott. He was very popular with his teammates and possessed a good sense of humour. Like Billy Stead, the other MƒÅori in the 1905‚Äì06 All Black side, Cunningham was able to speak the language. Outside of rugby he spent his early working-life as an axeman, and spent some time as a miner before later working for the Auckland Harbour Board. At the time of his death he was working at an Auckland freezing works.  Death and legacy  Cunningham died suddenly from acute meningitis at Auckland in September 1927, and his funeral was attended by a number of dignitaries, including representatives of the New Zealand, Auckland, New South Wales and Thames Rugby Unions. His pallbearers were all former All Blacks, and included fellow Original All Blacks George Tyler, George Nicholson and George Gillett. After his casket had been lowered into its grave at Hillsborough Cemetery, an Auckland representative jersey was thrown on top.

He played an important role in the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and served in a variety of ministerial roles between the wars. He also served for many years as a representative in the Czechoslovak parliament and was a tenured professor in the history of medicine. He retired from public life before the outbreak of the Second World War, but following the war he resumed a ministerial career in the re-established Czechoslovak government in the five years before his death. Early life and education Born in Liskov√° (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary), he was educated between 1878‚Äì82 at the gymnasium in Ru≈æomberok where only the Hungarian language ‚Äì which he did not speak ‚Äì was used as the language of education. He moved to the German-speaking gymnasium at Levoƒça between 1882‚Äì83 before moving on, between 1883‚Äì86, to the gymnasia at Bansk√° Bystrica and P≈ôerov in Moravia, from which he ultimately graduated. As he was a Slovak he was not permitted to graduate from gymnasia in Upper Hungary (corresponding mostly to present-day Slovakia). From 1888 to 1898 ≈†rob√°r studied medicine at Charles University in Prague, where he chaired the student organisation Detvan. Political emergence After graduating he returned to Ru≈æomberok and became the founder and chief editor of the journal Hlas (The Voice), published by and in support of progressive young Slovak intellectuals who opposed the Slovak National Party's conservative approach to politics. He was a supporter and acquaintance of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, the sociologist and philosopher who went on to be the founder and first President of Czechoslovakia. After unsuccessfully running for a seat in the Diet of Hungary, his agitation on behalf of Slovak causes led to him being imprisoned for a year in 1906 along with Andrej Hlinka, on the grounds of \\"instigation against the Magyar nationality\\". He had continued to work as a doctor and in 1909 he published ƒΩudov√° obr√°zkov√° zdravoveda (Illustrated Guide to Public Health). Slovak aspirations towards independence continued to simmer during the First World War, accompanied by the rise of an agrarian movement with which ≈†rob√°r was involved. Along with Anton ≈†tef√°nek and Pavol Blaho, he visited Slovak villages to promote the course of Czech and Slovak unity and to provide both a political and a cultural education to the peasants. He also involved himself with the Czechoslovak National Council (CNR), an √©migr√© organisation led by Edvard Bene≈° that campaigned abroad for an independent Czechoslovak state. He acted as a representative for the Maffie, the CNR's underground operation in the Czech lands and Slovakia. By the end of the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was beginning to disintegrate and on 1 May 1918 ≈†rob√°r proclaimed the Slovak people's right to self-determination and to create a common state with the Czechs. He was arrested by the Hungarian authorities and imprisoned until October 1918 when the empire collapsed. Career in inter-war Czechoslovakia ≈†rob√°r was appointed the Slovak chairman of the CNR and signed the new Czechoslovak state's proclamation of independence, which was read out in Prague on 28 October. He was the only Slovak involved. He was not by any means a major political figure in Slovakia at the time and his involvement only a few days after his release from prison was quite fortuitous, as he later recalled: The CNR had not, in fact, given any thought to issuing an official invitation to the Slovaks (whose own Slovak National Council would issue its own declaration of independence two days later, unaware of the CNR's actions) but as ≈†rob√°r was well known to Masaryk and the other Czech leaders he was accepted as a representative of Slovakia. The oversight was indicative of the Czech leaders' drive to create a Czech-led Czechoslovakia, with the Slovaks relegated to a subordinate role. Over the following two months ≈†rob√°r founded the provisional government of Slovakia and became both the Czechoslovak minister of health and the minister for the administration of Slovakia. He retained both posts until 1920 and contributed significantly to the establishment of Czechoslovak rule in Slovakia, exercising virtually dictatorial powers on behalf of the Prague government. It was ≈†rob√°r's decision to make the former Austrian city of Pressburg ‚Äì now Bratislava ‚Äì the administrative capital of Slovakia, despite only 15% of its pre-war population being Slovaks. He also chose who would represent Slovakia on the newly established Revolutionary National Assembly. Only 54 of its 256 members were from Slovakia, and of those only 41 were ethnic Slovaks. Lutherans outnumbered Catholics ‚Äì the majority denomination in Slovakia ‚Äì by three to one, reflecting ≈†rob√°r's pro-Lutheran leanings but angering the Slovak Catholic clergy and increasing ethnic and religious tensions in the new state. He dissolved the Slovak National Council on 8 January 1919 as part of a centralising drive, for which he was widely criticised,Miller, p. 66 and a year later Slovakia itself was abolished as an administrative unit under the new constitution. ≈†rob√°r served as a member of the Czechoslovak parliament between 1918‚Äì25, representing the Slovak National Republican and Peasant Party initially and subsequently the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants after a merger with another party in the early 1920s. ≈†rob√°r's ministerial career continued between 1920‚Äì23 with appointments as the minister for public health and physical education, minister for the unification of laws and organisation of information, and minister of education and national enlightenment. In 1923 ≈†rob√°r submitted his post-doctoral thesis in social medicine at Bratislava's Comenius University. He was elected to the Czechoslovak Senate in 1925 and acted the chair of the Agrarian Club in the Senate between 1925‚Äì29. He published a two-volume work, Osloboden√© Slovensko (Liberated Slovakia) between 1928‚Äì32 and in 1935 he was appointed by Comenius University as a tenured professor for the history of medicine. Two years later, in 1937, he retired from academic and political life. Second World War and post-war career Memorial plaque on ≈†rob√°r's house During the Second World War, when Slovakia was a nominally independent pro-Nazi puppet state, ≈†rob√°r was discreetly active as a supporter of the anti-fascist Czechoslovak opposition. He became co-chairman of the revived Slovak National Council in 1944, representing the non-Communist elements of the anti-fascist movement, and wrote the text of a statement read by Jozef Styk on 30 August 1944 that launched the Slovak National Uprising against the pro-Nazi government. After the war he was appointed minister of finance in the restored Czechoslovakia and served in this role until 1947. ≈†rob√°r also founded the Catholic Freedom Party in 1946, which later merged into the Czechoslovak National Front, and published an autobiography, Z m√¥jho ≈æivota (From My Life) in the same year. He subsequently served as minister for the unification of laws. He continued in this role in the Communist government of Klement Gottwald that came to power in the Czechoslovak coup d'etat of 1948. On 6 December 1950, ≈†rob√°r died in Olomouc in Moravia and was initially buried there. His body was later reinterred in St Martin's Cemetery in Bratislava.

(2014). Freshwater fungi: and fungal-like organisms. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter. They are composed of filamentous free-living fungi and yeasts that are associated with planktonic particles or phytoplankton. Similar to bacterioplankton, these aquatic fungi play a significant role in heterotrophic mineralization and nutrient cycling. Mycoplankton can be up to 20 mm in diameter and over 50 mm in length. In a typical milliliter of seawater, there are approximately 103 to 104 fungal cells. This number is greater in coastal ecosystems and estuaries due to nutritional runoff from terrestrial communities. The greatest diversity and number of species of mycoplankton is found in surface waters (< 1000 m), and the vertical profile depends on the abundance of phytoplankton. Furthermore, this difference in distribution may vary between seasons due to nutrient availability.GUTIERREZ, Marcelo H; PANTOJA, Silvio; QUINONES, Renato A and GONZALEZ, Rodrigo R. First record of flamentous fungi in the coastal upwelling ecosystem off central Chile. Gayana (Concepc.) [online]. 2010, vol.74, n.1, pp. 66-73. ISSN 0717-6538. Aquatic fungi survive in a constant oxygen deficient environment, and therefore depend on oxygen diffusion by turbulence and oxygen generated by photosynthetic organisms. Aquatic fungi can be classified using three groups: * Lower fungi - adapted to marine habitats (zoosporic fungi, including mastigomycetes: oomycetes & chytridiomycetes) * Higher fungi -filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle (hyphomycetes, ascomycetes, basidiomycetes) * Terrestrial fungi - contain appendages of marine fungi (trichomycetes) The majority of mycoplankton species are higher fungi, found in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late Proterozoic era, 900-570 million years ago. It is hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the Paleozoic era (390 million years ago). The methods and pathways of terrestrial fungi's adaption to the marine environment are still under study.  Biogeochemical Contributions  The primary role of all fungi is to degrade detrital organic matter from plants,Carlile MJ, Watkinson SC, Gooday GW (2001) The fungi. San Diego: Academic Press. and mycoplankton is no exception. By working with microbial communities, mycoplankton efficiently converts particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter as part of the biogeochemical cycle. Mycoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria mediate carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems. It has been shown that there are higher concentrations of mycoplankton near the surface and in shallow waters, which indicates their connection with the upwelling of organic matter. This further correlates with abundant phytoplankton communities at the surface, implying that mycoplankton is intimately involved in organic matter consumption in the euphotic zone.

The Court held that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 did not bar application of a California rule forbidding insurance companies from denying untimely claims without showing that they had been prejudiced by the delayed notice.

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the movie 3 stars describing the movie as \\"The film is funnier and slightly less misogynistic than the prequel.\\" He notes that \\"It‚Äôs in the last act that the film throws away any pretence of humor and adopts an especially spiteful tone that‚Äôs reminiscent of the earlier film.

It is the sequel to his free flash game Lakeview Cabin, which released on 21 October 2013. In 2014, Tamminen announced that he was seeking to have the game released through Steam Greenlight and on 25 March 2015, Tamminen released the Lakeview Cabin Collection to Steam, Humble Bundle, and itch.io.  Premise  The game's initial setting is a hub level set in a New York City movie theater, with a monstrous killer lurking in the sewers beneath a cinema. This level was formerly going to be Lakeview Cabin VI: Manhattan Lake Massacre, but Roope found it too small for a full length film and instead chose to turn it into the hub level and let Lakeview Cabin VI take its place from the seventh entry. Within the cinema, there are five \\"movies\\" that are playable games set elsewhere. Each film is centered on a different plot and a new set of playable protagonists, though the storylines are all connected and the movies take place in the same universe. The game references and borrows elements from classic horror movies such as Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Alien, and The Thing. *Lakeview Cabin III ‚Äî Set around a decade after the original Lakeview Cabin flash game, a new group of counselors for Camp Lakeview unwittingly encounter a mysterious killer known as Babyface. Described as a \\"sandbox boss-fight\\". This game takes place at an idyllic-looking cabin surrounded by woods and a large lake. Players are able to control several characters and have them interact with their surroundings. Characters can swim, drink, handle objects, and have intercourse with one another, however during the night the characters are hunted and are able to be killed by their pursuer. Players can also kill the characters off themselves via several different methods. *Lakeview Cabin IV: Curse of the Lake ‚Äî After a rising girl band finds their tour bus out of gas, they must fight through a family of inbred cannibals, a swarm of mutant rats, and a vast array of traps hidden within Lakeview Manor. Described as a \\"randomized action survival\\". *Lakeview Cabin V: Homecoming ‚Äî On Halloween night, a small suburban neighborhood finds itself terrorized by an unkillable evil, and must resort to supernatural means to defeat it. Described as a \\"supernatural mystery\\". *Lakeview Cabin VI ‚Äî In a space station collecting remains of the original cabin, a handful of janitors find themselves face to face with multiplying alien creatures who can travel through the station's built-in delivery system. *Epilogue (also called Lakeview Cabin II) ‚Äî This game is far simpler than the ones mentioned above, and is unlocked when the previous four are completely finished. The epilogue's plot is vague, though it has been interpreted as the details of the events that took place that inspired the movies. When each of the Lakeview Cabin movies and the epilogue are finished, there are minigames that can be played as well. The minigames alongside Lakeview Cabin III, IV, V, and VI are, respectively, Lake of the Dead, Treasure of the Vampire Rednecks, Super Dad, and Space Psychos. Additionally, in 2017, another minigame (unconnected to any of the other games) called Last Christmas became available. The playable protagonist is a father who must fend off Christmas-themed killers.  Development  Tamminen initially began developing the game as a small prototype with similar mechanics as the 8-bit Nintendo game Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers and chose to turn it into a survival horror game. Prior to further developing the first game Tamminen sought his wife's approval to make a horror game, as she was pregnant at this time and the first game's antagonists were a pregnant woman and her unborn fetus. While the first game had more of a cartoon-esque look, Tamminen decided to make the further episodes in 8-bit style, as he felt that this made it easier for him as a solo developer. Tamminen has stated that the game's puzzles \\"came almost naturally\\" as he \\"just added items that you might usually find at a cabin, and then tried to think of at least three ways to use them. The obvious use, the \\"self-harm\\" use and the use as a weapon.\\"  Reception  Critical reception of Lakeview Cabin Collection has been predominantly positive. Much of the game's praise centered upon its humor, sandbox game play, and easter eggs, while criticism centered upon the game's direction, mechanics, and lack of a tutorial.  Sequels  On October 22, 2019, Tamminen released the game Lakeview Valley, which serves as a \\"spiritual successor\\" to Lakeview Cabin Collection and focuses on a customizable protagonist who arrives in the eponymous town. The game introduces a number of new characters while also featuring the return of characters familiar to the players of Tamminen's previous Lakeview games. In 2020, Tamminen announced that he is developing Lakeview Cabin 2, which is a direct sequel to Lakeview Cabin Collection.

The term is historic, arising from the now- discontinued form of action, which distinguished between real property disputes and personal property disputes. Personal property was, and continues to be, all property that is not real property. In countries with personal ownership of real property, civil law protects the status of real property in real-estate markets, where estate agents work in the market of buying and selling real estate. Scottish civil law calls real property \\"heritable property\\", and in French-based law, it is called immobilier (\\"immovable property\\"). Historical background The word \\"real\\" derives from Latin res (\\"thing\\"), which was used in Middle English to mean \\"relating to things, especially real property\\".Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Tenth Edition,1999,p 1192. In common law, real property was property that could be protected by some form of real action,https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/real%20action. in contrast to personal property, where a plaintiff would have to resort to another form of action. As a result of this formalist approach, some things the common law deems to be land would not be classified as such by most modern legal systems: for example, an advowson (the right to nominate a priest) was real property. By contrast the rights of a leaseholder originate in personal actions and so the common law originally treated a leasehold as part of personal property.https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/personal%20action. The law now broadly distinguishes between real property (land and anything affixed to it) and personal property (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money). The conceptual difference was between immovable property, which would transfer title along with the land, and movable property, which a person would retain title to. In modern legal systems derived from English common law, classification of property as real or personal may vary somewhat according to jurisdiction or, even within jurisdictions, according to purpose, as in defining whether and how the property may be taxed. Bethell (1998) contains much information on the historical evolution of real property and property rights.  Identification of real property  To be of any value, a claim to any property must be accompanied by a verifiable and legal property description. Such a description usually makes use of natural or man-made boundaries such as seacoasts, rivers, streams, the crests of ridges, lakeshores, highways, roads, and railroad tracks or purpose-built markers such as cairns, surveyor's posts, iron pins or pipes, concrete monuments, fences, official government surveying marks (such as ones affixed by the National Geodetic Survey), and so forth. In many cases, a description refers to one or more lots on a plat, a map of property boundaries kept in public records. These legal descriptions are usually described in two different ways ‚Äì metes & bounds, and lot & block. A third way is the Public Land Survey System, as used in the United States. * Metes. The term \\"metes\\" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing (magnetic), or a more precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods. * Bounds. The term \\"bounds\\" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public roadway, an adjoining property owner, or an existing building. The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms), and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description. * The Lot & Block system is perhaps the simplest of the three main survey systems to understand. For a legal description in the Lot and Block system a description must identify: ** the individual lot, ** the block in which the lot is located, if applicable, ** a reference to a platted subdivision or a phase thereof, ** a reference to find the cited plat map (i.e., a page and/or volume number), and ** a description of the map's place of official recording (e.g., recorded in the files of the County Engineer). *Principal meridians and Baselines governing the United States Public Land Survey System. The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to divide real property for sale and settling. The PLSS used nominally rectangular shapes to divide. The basic unit in the PLSS is the Section of land, typically 1 mile square. A 6 x 6 mile grid of sections of land form what is referred to as a Township. Townships are laid out east and west of a Principal Meridian, and north and south of a Baseline. Estates and ownership interests defined The law recognizes different sorts of interests called estates, in real property. The type of estate is generally determined by the language of the deed, lease, bill of sale, will, land grant, etc., through which the estate was acquired. Estates are distinguished by the varying property rights that vest in each, and that determine the duration and transferability of the various estates. A party enjoying an estate is called a \\"tenant\\". Some important types of estates in land include: *Fee simple: An estate of indefinite duration, that can be freely transferred. The most common and perhaps most absolute type of estate, under which the tenant enjoys the greatest discretion over the disposal of the property. *Fee simple conditional: An estate lasting forever as long as one or more conditions stipulated by the deed's grantor does not occur. If such a condition does occur, the property reverts to the grantor, or a remainder interest is passed on to a third party. *Fee tail: An estate which, upon the death of the tenant, is transferred to his or her heirs. *Life estate: An estate lasting for the natural life of the grantee, called a \\"life tenant\\". If a life estate can be sold, a sale does not change its duration, which is limited by the natural life of the original grantee. *A life estate pur autre vie is held by one person for the natural life of another person. Such an estate may arise if the original life tenant sells her life estate to another, or if the life estate is originally granted pur autre vie. *Leasehold: An estate of limited term, as set out in a contract, called a lease, between the party granted the leasehold, called the lessee, and another party, called the lessor, having a longer estate in the property. For example, an apartment-dweller with a one- year lease has a leasehold estate in her apartment. Lessees typically agree to pay a stated rent to the lessor. Though a leasehold relates to real property, the leasehold interest is historically classified as personal property. A tenant enjoying an undivided estate in some property after the termination of some estate of limited term, is said to have a \\"future interest\\". Two important types of future interests are: *Reversion: A reversion arises when a tenant grants an estate of lesser maximum term than his own. Ownership of the land returns to the original tenant when the grantee's estate expires. The original tenant's future interest is a reversion. *Remainder: A remainder arises when a tenant with a fee simple grants someone a life estate or conditional fee simple, and specifies a third party to whom the land goes when the life estate ends or the condition occurs. The third party is said to have a remainder. The third party may have a legal right to limit the life tenant's use of the land. Estates may be held jointly as joint tenants with rights of survivorship or as tenants in common. The difference in these two types of joint ownership of an estate in land is basically the inheritability of the estate and the shares of interest that each tenant owns. In a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deed, or JTWROS, the death of one tenant means that the surviving tenants become the sole owners of the estate. Nothing passes to the heirs of the deceased tenant. In some jurisdictions, the specific words \\"with right of survivorship\\" must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights of survivorship. The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of any contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property. The death of a co-owner of a tenants in common (TIC) deed will have a heritable portion of the estate in proportion to his ownership interest which is presumed to be equal among all tenants unless otherwise stated in the transfer deed. However, if TIC property is sold or subdivided, in some States, Provinces, etc., a credit can be automatically made for unequal contributions to the purchase price (unlike a partition of a JTWROS deed). Real property may be owned jointly with several tenants, through devices such as the condominium, housing cooperative, and building cooperative. = Bundle of Rights = Real property is unique because there are multiple rights associated with each piece of property. For example, most U.S. jurisdictions recognized the following rights: right to sell; right to lease; right to acquire minerals, gas, oil, etc. within the land; right to use; right to possess; right to develop; etc. These multiple rights are important because owners of the real property can generally do what they choose with each right. For example, the owner could choose to keep all the rights but lease the right to drill for oil to an oil company, or the owner could choose to keep all the rights but lease the property to a tenant. In other words, the owner can elect to keep, lease or sell the rights to the land. = Other Ownership types = *Allodial title: Real property that is independent of any superior landlord. Allodium is \\"Land held absolutely in one's own right, and not of any lord or superior; land not subject to feudal duties or burdens. An estate held by absolute ownership, without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof.\\" Jurisdictional peculiarities In the law of almost every country, the state is the ultimate owner of all land under its jurisdiction, because it is the sovereign, or supreme lawmaking authority. Physical and corporate persons do not have allodial title; they do not own land but only enjoy estates in the land, also known as \\"equitable interests\\". =Australia and New Zealand= In many countries the Torrens title system of real estate ownership is managed and guaranteed by the government and replaces cumbersome tracing of ownership. The Torrens title system operates on the principle of \\"title by registration\\" (i.e. the indefeasibility of a registered interest) rather than \\"registration of title\\". The system does away with the need for a chain of title (i.e. tracing title through a series of documents) and does away with the conveyancing costs of such searches. The State guarantees title and is usually supported by a compensation scheme for those who lose their title due to the State's operation. It has been in practice in all Australian states and in New Zealand since between 1858 and 1875, has more recently been extended to strata title, and has been adopted by many states, provinces and countries, and in modified form in 9 states of the USA. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, The Crown is held to be the ultimate owner of all real property in the realm. This fact is material when, for example, property has been disclaimed by its erstwhile owner, in which case the law of escheat applies. In some other jurisdictions (not including the United States), real property is held absolutely. England and Wales English law has retained the common law distinction between real property and personal property, whereas the civil law distinguishes between \\"movable\\" and \\"immovable\\" property. In English law, real property is not confined to the ownership of property and the buildings sited thereonoften referred to as \\"land\\". Real property also includes many legal relationships between individuals or owners of land that are purely conceptual. One such relationship is the easement, where the owner of one property has the right to pass over a neighbouring property. Another is the various \\"incorporeal hereditaments\\", such as profits-√†-prendre, where an individual may have the right to take crops from land that is part of another's estate. English law retains a number of forms of property which are largely unknown in other common law jurisdictions such as the advowson, chancel repair liability and lordships of the manor. These are all classified as real property, as they would have been protected by real actions in the early common law. =United States= Each U.S. State except Louisiana has its own laws governing real property and the estates therein, grounded in the common law. In Arizona, real property is generally defined as land and the things permanently attached to the land. Things that are permanently attached to the land, which also can be referred to as improvements, include homes, garages, and buildings. Manufactured homes can obtain an affidavit of affixture. Economic aspects of real property Land use, land valuation, and the determination of the incomes of landowners, are among the oldest questions in economic theory. Land is an essential input (factor of production) for agriculture, and agriculture is by far the most important economic activity in pre-industrial societies. With the advent of industrialization, important new uses for land emerge, as sites for factories, warehouses, offices, and urban agglomerations. Also, the value of real property taking the form of man-made structures and machinery increases relative to the value of land alone. The concept of real property eventually comes to encompass effectively all forms of tangible fixed capital. with the rise of extractive industries, real property comes to encompass natural capital. With the rise of tourism and leisure, real property comes to include scenic and other amenity values. Starting in the 1960s, as part of the emerging field of law and economics, economists and legal scholars began to study the property rights enjoyed by tenants under the various estates, and the economic benefits and costs of the various estates. This resulted in a much improved understanding of the: *Property rights enjoyed by tenants under the various estates. These include the right to: **Decide how a piece of real property is used; **Exclude others from enjoying the property; **Transfer (alienate) some or all of these rights to others on mutually agreeable terms; *Nature and consequences of transaction costs when changing and transferring estates.

Early life and education Born in Los Angeles, Nishi was the daughter of Hatsu and Tahei Matsunaga who had emigrated to the United States from Kumamoto, Japan. Her father was a hotel owner in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles. She attended Theodore Roosevelt High School before enrolling as a music student at the University of Southern California. A trained classical pianist, she often played with her sister Helen who was a violinist. Despite writing a telegram to President Roosevelt complaining about \\"internment as undemocratic\\", she had to interrupt her studies and her music career in spring 1942 when, as Japanese Americans, she and her family were incarcerated at the Santa Anita Assembly Center following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Five months later, in the fall of 1942, she and her sister were among the first students to leave the internment camp thanks to the efforts of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council. Nishi then studied sociology at Washington University in St. Louis where she earned a master's degree in 1944. She completed her education at the sociology department of the University of Chicago where she ultimately received a doctorate in 1963. Career In Chicago, Nishi married the painter Ken Nishi in 1944 and they subsequently started a family with the birth of a son, Geoffrey. Nishi took up employment at the Pittsburgh Courier where she became the assistant of the editor, her African-American friend and supporter, P.L. Prattis. Prattis introduced her to fellow American sociologist Horace R. Cayton who helped her found the Chicago Resettlers Committee, later known as the Japanese American Service Committee. In that connection, in 1946 she published the widely distributed pamphlet Facts About Japanese Americans. In the late 1940s, she headed the Chicago Council Against Racial and Religious Discrimination which coordinated civil rights and labour groups. In the early 1950s, the Nishis moved to Tappan, New York, where they had four more children. Nishi worked as a researcher for the National Council of Churches. With Horace Cayton, she wrote The Changing Scene (1955), a study of churches and social service. In 1965, Nishi became professor of sociology at Brooklyn College, also teaching at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. At Brooklyn, she delivered the first courses on Asian American studies, creating a new generation of scholars. In the 1970s, she joined the New York State Advisory Committee, which reported to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She served on the committee for three decades, ultimately becoming its chair. During her teaching career, she had increasingly combined her academic assignments with community involvement. She retired in 1999. Later life and distinctions In 2001, her husband Ken died. Nishi devoted her final years to work on the large-scale Japanese American Life Course Survey which reviewed the effects of the wartime internment of Japanese Americans. In 2007, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Asian American Studies and, in 2009, she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, by the Japanese government. Nishi died in Cape Breton, Canada, on November 18, 2012. She is survived by her five children: Geoffrey, Lisa, Paula, Stefani, and Mia, and six grandchildren: Emiko, Lian, Mia, B√©la, James, and Chloe.

The first episode premiered on 3 September 2015. It is the last series to air for HKTV. Plot A supernatural-themed detective series ‚Äì however the ‚Äòsupernatural‚Äô won't be the traditional ghosts and spirits-theme that audiences are used to seeing. Rather, the drama uses ‚Äòsuper‚Äô scientific concepts as well as realistic methods to investigate a variety of mysterious, unusual cases. The series will revolve around the main character Sun Gei Yuen (Felix Wong) -- a former high- ranking police inspector who, after being traumatized by the mysterious death of his son, acquires the hidden ability to capture and enter other people's subconscious, as he deeply believes that his son was actually murdered in the ‚Äòinner confines of the subconscious‚Äô! At the same time, he starts to display signs of having a split personality and works hard to study about the ‚Äòhidden subconscious‚Äô in the hopes of one day finding his son's killer. Each main character in this series will have some sort of ‚Äòhidden ability‚Äô that makes them different from other people. Even though each of them will have a ‚Äòregrettable flaw‚Äô and perhaps even be viewed by society as being ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô or ‚Äòweird‚Äô, this does not affect their self-esteem. In fact, they are able to turn this ‚Äòregrettable flaw‚Äô into a ‚Äòhidden ability‚Äô and use it to help them solve many mysterious cases.

The factory made more varieties of man-made gemstones than any other in the world. It grew artificial gems and gem simulants, including synthetic ruby and sapphire and simulated diamonds, citrine, topaz, and other birthstone substitutes, and mounted them in gold or silver jewelry.  History  alt=see caption ICT Incorporated, trade name \\"Shelby Gem Factory\\", is sited in Shelby, Oceana County, on the west coast of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. It was founded in 1970 by Larry Paul Kelley. and Craig Hardy. Larry Paul Kelley and his wife Jo Kelly later retained full ownership making the Shelby Gem Factory a family business. The Shelby Gem Factory initially produced only synthetic ruby, with ruby lasers being the principal application, to firms primarily in California. However, the greater profit potential of transmuting ruby rods into gemstones led to a change in the enterprise's focus. A colorless variant crystal was developed by experimentation with different materials and proportions. This was the first simulated diamond variety. It became the first business anywhere to mass- produce cubic zirconia (CZ). In the 1970s the Shelby Gem Factory rode a wave of popularity CZ then enjoyed. At its peak, tons of cubic zirconia were produced for the world market. Subsidiary factories were opened in China, India, and Panama to keep up with demand. The factory closed in 2019, after 50 years of manufacturing.  Factory  alt=see caption Formerly, factory tours were offered. However, they were discontinued due to liability concerns attendant to the \\"very high temperatures and extremely bright light\\" and the unavailability of affordable insurance to cover the risk. Some of the furnaces burn at . The factory features a museum, a showroom, and a theater and is a popular destination for schools, venture tours, and lapidary clubs. The 50-seat Art and Science theater shows visitors the differences between the processes that produce natural and man-made gems. Exhibits on-site include a lapidary machine visitors can try out for themselves to learn about gem cutting and a low-temperature model of a working crucible-furnace, along with photos of the now-off-limits factory floor. The public can purchase gemstone jewelry from the factory. Jo Kelley, wife of Larry Paul Kelley, attributes the factory's increase in sales between 2008 and 2010 to the weak national economy.  Gem manufacturing  alt=see caption Cubic zirconia \\"run\\" being opened Recrystallized natural ruby in a crucible The gems are synthesized in a furnace. It uses an US $85,000 heat resistant iridium crucible heated by surrounding electric coils. Temperatures range from . A crystal-producing mix is put into this furnace and melted. Then a slowly-spinning rod, the \\"seed\\", is lowered into the crucible, circulating the molten minerals, creating a homogeneous mixture and maintaining an even temperature throughout. Raised slowly over the course of weeks, the rotating rod cools the liquid and allows a large crystal to form. Kelley says it takes several weeks to grow a gem crystal. The factory does not use the Verneuil method of \\"pulling\\" crystals, using temperature differences like the process that forms an icicle. Rather, it uses small fragments of mined gems, which are then used as seeds to re- crystallize liquid into larger gemstones. This is the so-called Czochralski process, which is akin to chemical vapor deposition. According to Kelly: \\"As far as I know, we are the only company on Earth that uses the second method.\\" Shelby Gem Factory workers then cut several dozen rough gems from each crystal using a diamond saw. A rough gemstone piece is placed onto a faceting machine, where over fifty facets are cut and polished to create a finished gemstone. ICT has a master jeweler on staff to mount the finished gemstones in gold settings; Kelley purchases rough gold castings from out of state, and finishes these at the factory to make settings as needed. The crystals made by the Shelby Gem Factory are used in jewelry and scientific industries worldwide. Unlike naturally-produced stones, these products are free of occlusions and internal and external flaws or inclusions. The Shelby Gem Factory's simulated diamonds are diamond simulants, which are not to be confused with actual lab- grown synthetic diamonds. However, they can be difficult to distinguish from real diamonds. They have a Dcolor rating, the highest rating for diamonds (as determined by the Gemological Institute of America). Although some of the company's products are \\"simulants\\" (such as their diamond simulants), their synthetic ruby and sapphire stones are not imitations ‚Äì they have the same chemical and crystalline structure that is found in natural stones. The factory's FAQ says \\"our rubies and sapphires are really ruby and sapphire!\\" The Shelby Gem Factory also manufactures simulated citrine and topaz, along with other birthstone substitutes. As per the company website's FAQ section in 2017, below are the Mohs scale hardness values for some well-known gems along with Shelby gem products: * Genuine diamond, 10 * Ruby, sapphire, Shelby ruby, and Shelby sapphire, 9 * Shelby simulated diamond (\\"Diamond Encore\\"), 8-7/8 * Shelby simulated emerald, aquamarine, and garnet, 8.6 * Genuine emerald and aquamarine, 7.5-8.0 * Genuine garnet, 6.0 The company's policy is to maintain the confidentiality of celebrity clients, of whom there are many.

Kelley, is an American inventor and gemologist who developed proprietary methods for manufacturing man-made gemstones. He also invented a method for making high efficient crystalline silicon material for solar cells. Kelley received degrees at the University of Michigan in science, chemistry and physics. He founded the Shelby Gem Factory in 1970 to manufacture artificial gems.  Biography  Magazine Born in 1944 and raised in Hart, Michigan, Kelly was influenced by his father, Laurence, who worked on repairing auto bodies. His father had a set of Popular Science magazines which he read through often with much interest as a boy. As a 12-year-old boy Kelley did an experiment one day based on one of these magazine articles. He understood that ruby was a chemical mixture of aluminum oxide and chromium oxide. He observed that some sandpaper that his father used had aluminum oxide dust. Kelley took some of this dust and placed onto a firebrick. He put a chip of chrome with the aluminum oxide sandpaper dust, melted them with high heat, and serendipitously created his first ruby, albeit of poor quality. As a teen, Kelley fostered his interest in science and experimentation. As a thirteen year old he shot homemade rockets over the local lake. He got into trouble with local police authorities when permission was denied to shoot these rockets so close to a heavily populated area. Kelley and his brother Arthur made some small wooden workshops in 1961 to do experiments with chemicals. In 1962 when they blew up these workshops after mixing sulfur potassium chlorate with aluminum oxide dust the boys were seriously injured but survived.  Career  Faceting machine located at the Shelby Gem Factory to shape gems Kelley enrolled at the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. There he took up the study of science, chemistry, and physics. One of his studies was working as an assistant chemist at Dow Chemical. At Dow he worked with high-temperature furnaces and processing of materials using heat. At that time there was a high demand for ruby for solid-state lasers. After graduating from U of M he went into the business of making equipment to produce ruby laser rods. Kelley later learned how to cut the ruby laser rods into little chunks and then shape them into \\"gems\\" using a faceting machine. He then sold these synthetic artificial man-made gems for just under a hundred dollars each. He progressed from making rubies to manufacturing other man-made gems including an imitation diamond. Kelley turned this into a business of making man-made artificial gems for all the traditional birthstones of each of the twelve months.  Shelby Gem Factory  Factory simulator of growing crystals Kelley experimented with several formulas and processes for making synthetic artificial gems. One method involved using temperature difference techniques to create crystals in a way water icicles are formed. One of these man-made gemstones made this way was a transparent clear crystal resembling glass. It looked to the naked eye like a real diamond when faceted correctly and no glass was involved in its manufacture. A second technique involves small pieces (\\"seeds\\") of mined gems put into a heated up chemical liquid. The liquid then is slowly cooled, and recrystallized to form larger pieces of the gemstone. Man-made gemstones grow from these \\"seeds.\\" Kelley's technical success in growing crystals led to the founding of the Shelby Gem Factory in 1970.  Semiconductor technology  Semiconductor thin film patent In 1978 Kelley invented a unique method to create thin semiconductor films, especially useful in solar cells. Semiconductors have an absorptive graphite substrate and a layer of silicon grid-work is plated onto it. Kelley's process uses a rotating drum. Surface tension is overcome by the whirling motion of the rotating drum to spread out the molten material. The centrifuge invention spreads out the crystalline thin film material evenly and causes the interface to have a low amount of silicon carbide. The idea is to have the thin film layers be single crystals. The title to the patent is Centrifugal forming thin films and semiconductors and semiconductor devices and is United States patent #04101925. Craig A Hardy is shown as co-inventor. Kelley's invention is cited for reference in 7 other later patents for similarity.

He has won two medals, a gold in the men's team recurve and a bronze in the mixed team, in a major international tournament, spanning the Asian Games and the World Championships. Gu rose to prominence in the world archery scene at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. There, he and his teammates Yong Zhiwei and Qi Kaiyao powered past the Malaysian side in straight sets (6‚Äì0) to capture the men's team recurve title. At the 2015 World Championships, Gu contributed to the Chinese trio's effort by finishing fifth and securing the full quota spot for Rio 2016. On that same season, he and his compatriots Yong and Xing Yu confidently knocked out the Canadians 6‚Äì0 towards their golden finish in the men's team recurve at an Olympic test event in Rio de Janeiro. Gu was selected to compete for the Chinese squad at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, shooting in both individual and team recurve tournaments. First, he recorded 670 points out of a possible 720 to lead the Chinese threesome for the seventeenth seed heading to the knockout stage, along with an aggregate score of 1,997 produced by the trio in the classification round. Sitting at sixth in the men's team recurve, Gu, along with Xing and Wang Dapeng, scored an upset 6‚Äì0 victory over the defending champion Italy in the quarterfinals, before they dropped the semifinal match to the Americans with a 2‚Äì6. Attempting to retaliate on Australia for the podium lock, the Chinese trio could not edge their rivals out by a two-set deficit (2‚Äì6), but finished outside of medals in fourth instead. In the men's individual recurve, Gu lost the opening round match to Kazakhstan's Sultan Duzelbayev with a score of 4‚Äì6.

Use Besides its decorative function, a bijou serves as a signal for many other purposes. These have varied over time and space, and really its perceived function is dictated by the wearer, not those who view it. Nevertheless, it is possible roughly to categorise: =In high society= A bijou can be a mark of social status, and indicates whether the wearer is married, engaged, a debutante, and so forth. Traditionally, these kind of bijou have jade, or other black stone. =As member= Bijoux can indicate the membership of some group, be it a religion, a profession, a political allegiance, one of ethnicity or sex, or allegiance to a sports team: as wristbands might do in other cultures. They are also used as purely identification symbols, for example the Companions of the Tour de France wear them as earrings to show their allegiance to a particular rider. In a crowd, it may thus distinguish them from others supporting other riders, depending on how dedicated each are to recognise the symbol. =As a magic or religious symbol= Bijoux are often used for physical therapy, like amulets. Generally, a significant date is inscribed thereon, and perhaps their birth colour, or their astrological sign, a patron saint, or other magic symbols. They may also be used for fun in guessing-games. The date, generally, is that of the birth of the wearer. A fish symbol, often called an Ichthys, indicates that the wearer is a Christian. Bijou jewellery =In daily life= A bijou can be used in daily life as various significands by the wearer, and can be put on scarves, capes, hats, handbags, and so on. =As a gift of love= Bijoux are often given as a symbol of love, specifically to one person. It has a special meaning to the wearer, and similarly to that of an engagement ring, is displayed publicly and proudly. In French it is sometimes called a souvenir, but this is a false friend, being the infinitive for the verb \\"to remember\\". Bijouterie, the art of making or wearing bijoux, has thus developed its own private language or rebus known only to the initiated. Symbols may be religious or allegorical (two hands intertwined, for example, indicate the love of two fools, like Romeo and Juliet); Pansies (, literally \\"Flowers of thought\\") indicate \\"I am thinking of you\\". Sometimes the bijou will have, hidden under a clasp, a photograph of the lover-to-be, or a strand of their hair, or one of their baby teeth. The bijou is usually given as a symbol of eternal love, and also its fragility: it can be easily broken, lost or discarded. Sometimes the gemstone is made of glass to emphasise this fragility and essential uselessness, such as those made by Foire de Beaucaire (Gard- France) in the 18th century (The name comes from the small cry made by the wearer when it was torn from her.) =As a promise of sex= Baudelaire writes of the bijou's function thus in his novel Les Bijoux, as does Diderot in Les bijoux indiscrets. (Roughly, \\"The Indiscreet Jewels\\"). In both novels, the bijou serves as a symbol, like a pink carnation may do in English culture. It is worn by the wearer to show that she is available but must be wooed, before any touch, sight or smell, and is an erotic act of self-denial. As a well- known symbol, this same object can still have various uses. Among others, it is a symbol of emancipation and a symbol of sexual equality, but most people in Western culture wear it as a sign of faithfulness, be it in marriage, religion, or society. Not to wear one is a statement in itself. History = Prehistory = Tomb 43 at the Varna Necropolis contains some of the most ancient bijoux yet found Body ornamentation predates that of writing. Some consider it as itself part of human evolution, and call it the , the rise of Symbolic culture. The oldest well-identified bijoux are some 45 pieces unearthed from Blombes, South Africa. These perforated and styled bijoux have been dated to being years old. Beyond Africa, Yvette Taborin has devoted her life to studying the use of language symbols in Europe. She divides her analysis of the first objects of interaction between people into two types: those that are simply to collect things, as hunter-gatherers do, and those that are deliberately made or modified to be ornaments. Taborin does not classify on which material or source these ornaments were made from. Most paleoarcheology concentrates on remains of bodies themselves, such as fossils, or animal remains such as teeth. Taborin took a different tack, to investigate the remains of those around them. In doing so, she literally unearthed a whole new classification and understanding of our prehistoric ancestors, based on scientific evidence and statistics. For example, she established that the teeth used as ornaments in jewellery were not statistically correlated with the animals living thereabouts, neither browsers nor carnivores, so that they were specifically ornamental and not just \\"spare parts\\" after killing an animal to eat it. Most ancient jewellery is of bone, ivory, antler or some soft stone (such as limestone or lignite). The diversity and manufacture of these pieces, then, indicates a significant development in human evolution, especially as it comes in such various forms (hairbands, placed in clothing, bracelets, anklets, and so forth). = Bronze age = Sacred objects from Blanot, C√¥te-d'Or dating to the Bronze Age, now housed at the Archaeological Museum in Dijon In Europe, the Celtic people were foremost in their work in bijou and filigree; strapwork variations on the celtic cross are still popular today. Once metal had become part of the human way of life, and particularly during the Iron Age, various techniques such as filigree and embossing. An enormous variety of objects, of the highest quality, have been found. Bijouterie flourished in the civilisations around the Mediterranean Basin, and slowly but surely, bijouitiers established a trade and business, passing on their knowledge through guilds and adapting their wares to the tastes of their clients and the fashion of the day. = Recorded history = Coral bijou made for Queen Farida of Egypt(1938, Naples, at the Coral Jewellery Museum, Naples). *In Ancient Egypt and contemporaneously but disparately in Western Africa, bijouterie was considered a form of high art. *In the New World, Native Americans had a culture of making bijoux from gold. Christopher Columbus, indeed, ransacked much gold of this sort on his return to Portugal. The art of bijouterie was pretty much stable, over many centuries, and reserved and codified as a profession. *Metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution made bijoux affordable to all, so they were no longer considered mere luxuries for the rich. *In the First World War, French soldiers wore bijoux carefully selected to indicate their rank and speciality. **These would often be made simply of iron or aluminium *In the Second World War, the new industry of bijoux manufacture in France was paralysed; but they responded by producing , with the emblems of regiments and other army units, to wear on their uniforms. *After the second world war, in the optimistic spirit of the time, with more money, more hope, and more future, bijou once again became part of daily life as a way to express thanks and love. Modern day After the 1950s, three distinct strands of the art developed: * Joaillerie, made as one-off pieces or in limited editions, in precious metal and gemstones. * Bijouterie fantaisie, made of many new materials such as plastic * Bijouterie artisanale, again made as one-offs or in limited editions, but not of high-valued material.

In December 1928 Auriol published the first issue of a magazine called Du cin√©ma which, after being adopted by the publisher Gallimard, became La Revue du cin√©ma. It ran for a total of 29 issues until December 1931, and it established a reputation for intellectual seriousness and the quality of its contributors, who included Jacques Brunius, Louis Chavance, and Jean-Paul Le Chanois. Auriol established a structure for each issue (a major article, a selection of studies, film reviews and news items) which became a model for other journals.Lucien Logette, \\"Jean George Auriol ou l'Oubli√© majuscule\\", in La Lettre du syndicat fran√ßais de la critique de cin√©ma, no.39 (nov. 2011) pp. 24‚Äì25.

Among the writers who featured in it at this period were √âric Rohmer, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Pierre Kast, and Andr√© Bazin. After the closure of the journal, and after the death of Auriol, members of this group were among the founders of Cahiers du cin√©ma, of which the initial design and content were modelled on the earlier journal.

It is a subsidiary of San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc. The company comprises over 90% of the non-refrigerated margarine market and over 80% of refrigerated margarine market in the Philippines. History Magnolia, Inc. was established in 1981 when San Miguel Corporation (SMC) spun off its butter, margarine and processed cheese assets into a joint-venture with New Zealand Dairy Board (NZDB), forming Philippine Dairy Products Corporation (PDPC). The company was a business unit of SMC's Magnolia Division and engaged in the manufacture of butter, margarine and processed cheese. Its production facility was the Magnolia Dairy Products Plant on Aurora Boulevard. The Aurora Boulevard plant remained as its production facility until 2000 when it transferred to a new facility in General Trias City, Cavite. In 1994, PDPC acquired the margarine brands Star Margarine and Dari Creme from Procter & Gamble Philippines, Inc. (formerly Philippine Manufacturing Company). In 1996, SMC spun off its ice cream and milk business into a joint-venture with Nestl√©, forming Magnolia-Nestl√© Corporation. The Aurora Boulevard property remained under the ownership of SMC and served as the venture's main production facility and site of its ice cream parlor. After SMC withdrew from the venture in 1998, albeit still owning the property, Nestl√© Philippines continued with the business under the Nestl√© brand name (the ice cream parlor became known as Nestl√© Creamery). PDPC and Nestl√©‚Äôs ice cream production was gradually transferred a new facility in General Trias City, Cavite. By 1999, Nestl√© ceased ice cream production operations in the Aurora Boulevard facility. In 2008, SMC sold the Aurora Boulevard property to Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC), a subsidiary of JG Summit Holdings, Inc. News reports cited that the property was sold reportedly in the amount of P1.6 billion. The property was developed by RLC into a mall (Robinsons Magnolia) and residential condominiums (The Magnolia Residences). One of the mall‚Äôs first establishments was a Magnolia-franchised ice cream parlor named Magnolia Flavor House, which operated from 2012 to 2017, as a fitting homage to the property‚Äôs roots. In July 2002, SMC gained full ownership of the company after NZDB divested its stake. With this, the company name was changed to Magnolia, Inc. and became a subsidiary of San Miguel Pure Foods Company (now San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc.), the corporate parent for the entire food and beverage portfolio of SMC. Magnolia, Inc. has since diversified from the manufacture of butter, margarine and processed cheese, to include jelly snacks, cooking oil, salad aids and the revived Magnolia ice cream and milk products.

The current hypothesis for why the phenomenon occurs is that much like the sun dog phenomenon sunlight is reflecting off or refracting through tiny ice crystals though unlike sun dogs crown flash ice crystals are found above the crown of a cumulonimbus cloud. These ice crystals are aligned by the strong electric field effects around the cloud, so the effect may appear as a tall streamer (with a curved shape at times), pillar of light, or resemble a massive flash of a searchlight/flashlight beam through the clouds. When the electric field is disturbed by electrical charging or discharging (typically, lightning flashes) within the cloud, the ice crystals are re-orientated causing the light pattern to shift in a characteristic manner, at times very rapidly and appearing to 'dance' in a strikingly mechanical fashion. The effect may also sometimes be known as a \\"leaping sundog\\". As with sundogs, the observer would have to be in a specific position to see the effect, which is not a self-generated light such as seen in a lightning strike or aurora, but rather a changing reflection or refraction of the sunlight. The first scientific description of the crown flash phenomenon appears to be in the journal Monthly Weather Review in 1885, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Also mentioned in Nature in 1971 and in a letter to Nature slightly earlier in the same year, this phenomenon is regarded as uncommon and not well documented. Starting with an initial video upload in 2009 dozens of YouTube videos have since emerged that appear to document this phenomenon.

Ehrlich is Professor of Pharmacology and of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at Yale University working on the biophysics of membrane ion channels. Recent research investigates the function of polycystin-2, the inositol trisphosphate receptor, and the ryanodine receptor. Early Life and Education Ehrlich was born in New London, CT in 1952 and grew up in Newport, RI. Ehrlich attended Brown University, where she received a Bachelor of Science: ScB in Applied Mathematics and Biology. She then received her PhD from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1979 on the topic of membrane transport parameters in bipolar disorder.  Career  At Brown University, Ehrlich worked with Helen Cserr, Professor of Physiology. Her doctoral advisor was Jared Diamond and she studied lithium transport in human red blood cells as a way to understand lithium treatment in bipolar disorder. Ehrlich completed her post doctoral research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. She then went on to work as a professor at the University of Connecticut for 11 years. At the University of Connecticut, she coined the term \\"Molecular Hermeneutics.\\" Hermeneutics is a philosophical discipline derived from Hermes, who was the Messenger of the Gods and had to both deliver and interpret messages. Hermeneutics became the exegesis of the Bible, and eventually it evolved to interpretation, in particular of Truth and Beauty. She continues to be the Director of the Laboratory of Molecular Hermeneutics at Yale University, where she presently works. Ehrlich began working at Yale University in 1997 as a Professor of Pharmacology and of Cellular and Molecular Physiology. At Yale, Ehrlich has mainly focused on intracellular calcium regulation. Her laboratory uses calcium imaging combined with electrophysiological, biochemical, and molecular techniques to study the classes of calcium release channels known to exist inside virtually all cells: the inositol trisphosphate receptor-gated channel, the ryanodine receptor, and polycystin 2. Ehrlich and her team work to understand the loss of calcium regulation observed in disease states as seen in cells from patients with polycystic kidney disease or leading to drug- induced peripheral neuropathy. The Ehrlich team hypothesizes that these abnormalities in function are consequences, at least in part, of altered intracellular calcium homeostasis and that these studies will lead to suitable treatment regimens. From 2004-2011, Ehrlich was on the board of scientific counselors at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  Awards  * 2005 K.S.

The recordings are all of American patriotic songs sung by Bing Crosby and Frank Luther. Background Historically, the term \\"album\\" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early 19th century. Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). The only way an ‚Äúalbum‚Äù could be put together was to sell three or four 78s in a bound set of sheathes. These sets, known as folios were increasingly popular. Whilst they had originally been neutral ‚Äì blank albums into which the distributor could insert whatever 78s he liked ‚Äì the idea of using a theme to link the records in the folio was catching on. By the late 1930s, this trend had developed to the point where artists were going into studios to record six or eight titles with a folio set in mind. This in effect was the birth of the concept album, although it would not be until LPs became commonplace that the phrase gained any currency. The first album issued by Decca, probably in 1938, was Moussorgsky Songs by Vladimir Rosing, on catalogue number A-1. (List of Decca albums). Patriotic Songs for Children was one of the first concept albums of 78rpm recordings issued by Decca Records.

Eat Bulaga! hosts also serve as narrators and commentators. The term is coined by eat Bulaga host Joey De Leon which means \\"street series\\" because it is like a TV series where the setting is on streets in a remote barangay in the Philippines. It officially premiered on July 16, 2015, when Yaya Dub (played by Maine Mendoza) meets Alden for the first time. The show follows the love story of Yaya Dub and Alden. Yaya Dub's employer and adoptive grandmother, Lola Nidora, is initially against the couple's budding romance. Lola Nidora then reveals her Book of Secrets/Secret Diary which contains various reasons for her disapproval. The appearance of other characters like the luxurious Frankie Arenolli and the socialite DuhRizz make things even more complicated for the amorous pair. As the story unfolds, characters from Lola Nidora and Yaya Dub's past are revealed as a part of their backstory. Lola Nidora turns out to be one of the triplet children of the Zobeyala Family. Also, during the course of the series, Alden must prove his trustworthiness and love for Yaya Dub by overcoming several obstacles. For the most part, Lola Nidora provides these challenges to Alden while she imparts to Yaya the values of ‚Äúlove at the right time‚Äù and other words of wisdom.

Early life Born in Caistor in Lincolnshire, Peck grew up in Scunthorpe and was educated at Scunthorpe Grammar School.\\"Death of John Peck: the people's champion\\", Hucknall Dispatch, 29 March 2004 He flew with the Royal Air Force during World War II and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. Inspired both by experience of postings in Calcutta and the American Deep South, and also an uncle who was an active communist, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1944.\\"Peck John\\", Compendium of Communist Biography\\"Remembering Nottingham's hung council\\", Nottingham Post, 13 May 2010 Political activism After the war, Peck worked in the steel industry and became an active trade unionist. He first stood for election for the CPGB in 1946, taking only 146 votes for the Scunthorpe seat on Lindsey County Council. In 1948, he moved to Nottingham to take up a full-time post for the CPGB area committee, and in 1955 began regularly contesting the Bulwell ward for Nottingham City Council. He also contested Nottingham North at the 1955 general election, the first of ten unsuccessful attempts to win the seat. In his election campaigns, Peck often used photographs of himself in his RAF uniform, wearing his medals, something which proved controversial with other CPGB members. Peck became a well-known figure in Nottingham, and in the 1960 film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, he is shown speaking to a meeting at the gates of a factory. He served as first secretary, then president, of the Bulwell Tenants Association, and during the 1970s he was vice-president and president of the Nottingham Trades Council. During the 1980s, Peck served as national election agent to the CPGB, briefly as acting national organiser, and eventually was elected to the CPGB's executive committee. However, he increasingly came into conflict with other local members, becoming one of the few supporters of the Eurocommunist leadership in the area. Electoral success In 1987, Peck finally won the seat of Bulwell East, at his 36th attempt. From 1988 to 1990, with the remainder of the council consisting of an equal number of Labour Party and Conservative Party members, Peck effectively held the casting vote, generally siding with Labour, but voting against them to prevent a reorganisation of council departments. In 1990, with the CPGB on the verge of dissolution, Peck defected to the Green Party of England and Wales, for which he held his seat at three further elections, until he retired in 1997. In total, he contested 49 elections at various levels, a record acknowledged by the Guinness Book of Records. Retirement Peck published an autobiography in 2001, entitled Persistence, while leading the Nottingham Pensioners' Action Group. He died in 2004 after suffering ill health.

Location The McGehee Plantation is located at 50 Ed Nelson Drive in Senatobia, Mississippi. History The land belonged to the Chickasaw Nation until 1830. In 1854, it was acquired by planter Abner F. McGehee, the son of Hugh McGehee, and thus the nephew of Edward McGehee. The Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad ran through the grounds, thus making it a desirable business opportunity. The mansion, designed in the Greek Revival architectural style, was completed in 1856. It was built by African slaves, who also picked cotton in the fields. Author Stark Young grew up on the plantation, as his mother was a direct descendant of McGehee.

Three of the Puccios were convicted of four kidnappings and three murders in the early 1980s. Background The family, which comprised father Arqu√≠medes Puccio, mother Epifan√≠a Calvo, and five children (three sons and two daughters) ‚Äì Alejandro, Silvia, Daniel, Guillermo, and Adriana Puccio - lived in a large house in San Isidro, a wealthy suburb of Buenos Aires. Arqu√≠medes is suspected to have been involved in forced disappearances during the Dirty War. Alejandro was a star rugby player, and Silvia was an art teacher. Crimes *Ricardo Manoukian, aged 23, who disappeared on July 22, 1982, was the Puccio family's first known kidnapping victim. Manoukian's family paid a ransom of $250,000; nevertheless, he was later killed with three shots to the neck. He had been introduced to Alejandro Puccio by friends in his neighbourhood, and the two often played tennis and soccer together. *Engineer Eduardo Aulet was kidnapped on May 5, 1983. Although his family paid $150,000 for his ransom, the Puccios killed him. His body was found four years later. *Emilio Naum was kidnapped in June 1984 and attempted to resist the kidnapping. He was shot right there, and his body was left in the street. *N√©lida Bollini de Prado, the family's last victim, was kidnapped and held for almost a month. The police detained the kidnappers as the latter attempted to retrieve the ransom; they also detained Alejandro and his girlfriend Monica, who were home at the time. Bollini de Prado was found and released in a police raid on the Puccio house on 23 August 1985. Punishment The family was arrested and taken to jail. While awaiting court sentencing, Alejandro tried to commit suicide by jumping from the fifth floor of the courthouse when he was being taken to testify. He survived, however, with serious health complications. Arqu√≠medes and his two older sons, Alejandro and Daniel, were convicted of the crimes, along with three other accomplices. Arqu√≠medes and Alejandro each received a life sentence, while Daniel was jailed for a number of years. The youngest son, Guillermo, who had escaped from the family long before they were arrested, avoided justice by leaving the country.

After checking with Interpol it was concluded that there were no pending arrest warrants for Daniel. In his possession was US$5,000.00 in cash which according to him, it was a gift from his brother. *In the early 1980s, Guillermo left Argentina and never returned.

The area is the site of the abandonment and loss of many vessels in the disastrous 1779 Penobscot Expedition, an American Revolutionary War expedition in which the rebellious Americans lost an entire fleet of ships. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973; it has been of interest to salvagers and later archaeologists since the early 19th century. Description and history The Penobscot River flows into Penobscot Bay, a long bay that nearly bisects the state of Maine. At its head of navigation stand the cities of Bangor (on its western bank) and Brewer (on its eastern bank). The 1779 Penobscot Expedition was a military response by the state of Massachusetts (of which Maine was then part) to the seizure of Castine by British forces in June 1779. Beset by poor leadership, the amphibious expedition was scattered by the arrival of a British fleet on the bay. All of the expedition's ships were captured, scuttled, burned, or abandoned. Nine armed vessels and as many as 16 transports are documented to have made it as far upriver as Bangor.Kelly, Richard (1972). NRHP nomination for Penobscot Expedition Site; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service Some materials were salvaged by the Royal Navy from the abandoned and sunken ships not long after the expedition. Readily-accessible wrecks were salvaged by local residents, and the state also authorized at least one formal salvage operation, whose results are not known. In 1809 Ebenezer Clifford recovered 30 cannons and several tons of cannonballs from the river. Later finds in the Penobscot River included cannons found on the river bottom in the Bangor- Brewer area in 1876 and in 1954-55. The obvious importance of the area, with a well-documented history, led to the area's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, primarily for the potential archaeological significance of materials located there, including military equipment, cargo, and other artifacts. Between 1994 and 1997 surveys conducted by the University of Maine located several wrecks in the Penobscot, tentatively identified as the USS Warren and the transport Samuel. In 1998 Brent Phinney, the owner of a riverfront industrial business in Brewer, reported the presence of Revolutionary War-era finds near his property in Brewer, and opposite downtown Bangor. These prompted archaeological teams from the United States Navy (which retains an interest in military shipwrecks) to conduct preliminary surveys in 1999, and more detailed fieldwork and excavation in 2000 and 2001. These surveys determined that the Phinney Site on the Brewer side was of a shipwreck, and that the Shoreline Site on the Bangor side consisted of dispersed artifacts, including cannon and other military hardware. The ship was determined to be a two-masted brig or schooner, and has tentatively been identified as the privateer Diligent.

He was the leader of Angkatan Pemuda Insaf (API) who fought the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Malaya.  Early life  Kamarulzaman was born into a family of Malay farmers in Temerloh, Pahang. He joined Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM) during the Japanese occupation in Malaya to fight against the Japanese army. He was very enthusiastic about the party as he saw socialism as a way to conquer poverty in his state through taxation of land owners. He was also attracted to guerrilla warfare, which he thought of as the most effective way to counter the Imperial Japanese army. Ultimately, he was elected as the head of the youth wing in Angkatan Pemuda Insaf (API) of Pahang.  Incarceration and Charge  During the Malayan Emergency in 1948, the British took Kamarulzaman into custody in a bus station in Temerloh, without further investigation. He was also charged with owning firearms. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but was later granted a royal pardon from the Sultan of Pahang. His charge was reduced to life imprisonment instead. He spent the following 14 years in the prison at Temerloh. Following the departure of the British, he was released, but placed under surveillance. However, his freedom was short-lived, as he was arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for another eight years.  Release from prison  Following his release, Kamarulzaman joined Parti Sosialis Rakyat Malaysia (now Parti Rakyat Malaysia) and campaigned unsuccessfully for election in 1974. Even with his loss, he remained actively involved in PRM throughout the seventies.  Health  Kamarulzaman's health slowly deteriorated. Because his family had difficulties paying his medical bills, he was taken care of by his adopted sister and her husband. He was put in a home for the elderly in Kuala Lumpur. His health worsened in July 2002, and he was moved from Kuala Lumpur back to his hometown in Temerloh.  Reunion and death  After returning to Temerloh, he went to southern Thailand to reunite with his old comrades. His friends included General Secretary of the Communist Party of Malaya, Abdullah CD and Chin Peng. He also reunited with his friend Rashid Maidin when Rashid visited him in the nursing home. At that time, he was immobile and no longer able to recognise people due to his severe health problems.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK8INeSCTgs He died in Thailand at 10:30 am on 5 November 2002.

Biography  She was born in Leicester and studied at the Brighton School of Art. Whilst in Sussex she met the artist Leslie Robert Baxter. They married in 1926 before moving to Manchester... She returned south, to London, in 1937 and was then introduced to the British Surrealist Group before the end of the decade by Gordon Onslow Ford. Edith was one of the few female members, along with Eileen Agar and her close friend Emmy Bridgwater. Bridgwater and Rimmington had been inspired by the International Surrealist Exhibition which first introduced surrealism into England in 1936... Having joined the London group she was encouraged in her painting, and indeed admired, by the artists Edward Burra and John Banting who became a good friend. Much of her early work, both art and poetry, was reproduced in pamphlets and other short publications by surrealist groups both in England and abroad. She continued working as part of the London surrealist movement well beyond the formal disbandment of the Group in 1947. In 1950, Rimmington moved from London to live in Bexhill of Sussex. Sussex became an escape for artists and poets traveling away from war torn countries. In her later years of visual art, Rimmington worked with color photography of coastal scenery including Sussex Coast, taken in 1960. She died in 1986 in Bexhill-on- Sea.  Art  {  The Decoy (1948), oil on canvas  The Oneiroscopist (1947), oil on canvas } There is only one painting by Edith Rimmington in the public domain, The Decoy which is on display in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. The remainder of her works are in private collections but appear from time to time in exhibitions across the globe. Her work entitled The Oneiroscopist (the interpreter of dreams) was exhibited in 2011 at the Vancouver Art Gallery as part of a major exhibition of surrealist art.  Exhibitions  * Surrealist Objects exhibition at the London Gallery (1937) * International Surrealist Exhibition at the Galerie Maeght in Paris (1947).  Poetry  As well producing works of art, and later photography, Edith also wrote poems and poetic prose often created through the medium of automatic text. There is no single volume of her collected work and much is now hidden away in dusty copies of short-run publications. Two such pieces were written for Free Unions, published in 1946 by the London group and edited by Simon Watson Taylor. = The growth at the break = As fantasy in the claws of the poet is released by the broken arm it becomes imprisoned in the ossiferous callus wherein lice build themselves a tomb in which to escape the magic of the Marvelous. Instead of, with the blood of the wound, rushing like the river to the sea - oh life orgasm - the river is damned. The banks do not overflow and the lice choke as the arm stiffens. The wise eye sees the substitute running its poisonous imprisoned course in the cystic tomb. I see the dark sad face of the wounded man as the arm is amputated. = The seagull = I try to catch the seagull with a silken cord but I find that the soft cord becomes a fagged iron chain which tears my hands. The gull flies out to sea where it sits brooding. I see it fly back to the beach to join a lazy crowd of gulls where it is fed on human flesh by tanks and guns. I am horrified by the greedy eagerness of the speckled young birds. I find I cannot escape from the chain unless I have to offer my flesh to the gulls. I wait ... thinking of death and living death. I decide that out of living death I may see the gull dive into the sea once more.

Built in the 1750s using elements of a house built in 1680, it is one of the oldest surviving public hostelries in the state. The original house was built by John Banks, one of York's early settlers, and the tavern was built by a prominent local businessman. Now a private residence, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Rose Tavern is located at the end of a long private drive off Long Sands Road, which runs just east of, and parallel to, the main access road to York High School. It is a two-story L-shaped wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. Its main facade, which faces east, is roughly symmetrical, five bays wide, with a center entrance set in an enclosed projecting gabled vestibule. The door is flanked by sidelight windows, which are separated from the door and the vestibule corners by pilasters. To the right of the door, instead of a pair of sash windows (as found to its left) there are a group of three modern replacement sash windows. The interior of the building follows a central hall plan, with the original staircase still in place, along with late Georgian and Federal period woodwork elsewhere. The property on which the tavern stands was granted to John Banks, the son of Richard Banks who settled in York in 1642. Banks, born in York in 1657, built his house in 1680. Banks and his house survived the 1692 Candlemas Massacre, in which his father and two brothers perished, probably because it was set well back from the beach. In 1756 Robert Rose purchased the Banks property, and built the present house as a major expansion of Banks' 1680 house, leaving little more than parts of the frame and foundation as recognizably 17th-century in origin. Rose operated the tavern until 1782, and was active in local civic affairs, hosting meetings of the town selectmen. He supplemented his income by working as the keeper of the local jail.

The British Royal Navy captured Confiance in 1805, took her into service under her existing name, and sold her in 1810. Before she was sold, Confiance took part in two notable actions. French service Confiance as built in 1797 Completed in Bordeaux in November 1797, Confiance capsized at her launch and had to be refloated. On 3 February 1799 Confiance captured as Echo was sailing from the Cape of Good Hope for London. Confiance sent Echo to France.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ3060. 1799 Confiance was commissioned under Aurnaud Taudin in May 1799. On 24 December 1799, Confiance encountered the American ship Atlantic and the British East India Company \\"extra ship\\" (chartered ship) near the Sandheads in the Bay of Bengal. The engagement was inconclusive both that day and the next morning. Confiance broke off the action and sailed away early on Christmas morning.History of the Bengal Pilot service, 1534‚Äì1800. In May 1800, Confiance was recommissioned in √éle de France and her command was awarded to Robert Surcouf, with a complement of 23 officers and 190 men, and an armament of six 8-pounder long guns, sixteen 6-pounders and two 36-pounder obusiers de vaisseau. On 7 October, she encountered the East Indiaman Kent and captured her after a fierce battle; an 81-man prize crew under Joachim Drieux brought Kent to √éle de France (Mauritius), where she was sold for 30,900 piastres. In 1801, Confiance had her crew reduced to 89 men and sailed en aventurier to La Rochelle, loaded with colonial goods for her return to France. According to one source Confiance sailed \\"√† l'aventure\\"; she was a letter of marque, a vessel that was primarily a merchantman, but with the legal authorization to attack targets of opportunity. On the journey, Surcouf still managed to capture a number of ships, notably the Portuguese Ebre, with eighteen 12-pounder carronades and a 60-man crew; he released her against a ransom of 10,000 piastres and after exchanging her main mast for that of Confiance. After her arrival in France, Confiance was commissioned as a merchantman under Paul Castanet from May 1802. Capture By late 1803, she served in Muros, Spain, under Captain Roque and later under Papin. On 4 June 1805, HMS Loire attacked the town of Muros, in Spain, and captured Confiance, as well as her consort B√©lier. Loire had six men wounded in the landing party that captured a fort, a battery, and the two vessels, and nine men wounded on Loire by fire from the batteries before the British could capture them. The Spaniards lost 12 men killed, including the commander of the fort and Confiances 2nd captain, and 30 men wounded, including most of Confiances officers. Captain Frederick Maitland, of Loire, reported that Confiance was a \\"very fit Ship for His Majesty's Service; is reckoned to sail excessively fast; was to have gone to Sea in a few Days, bound to India, with a Complement of 300 men\\". Maitland burnt B√©lier, which he described as also fitting for sea, \\"supposed to be destined to cruise to Westward of Cape Clear.\\" The action led to promotion to Commander for Lieutenant James Lucas Yeo, who commanded the cutting out party. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded a sword worth 150 guineas to Maitland, and two swords, each worth 50 guineas, to lieutenants Yeo and Mallock. HMS Confiance The British commissioned Confiance into the Royal Navy in June as an 18-gun sloop under the newly promoted Commander James Yeo, and for the Channel. (Confiance kept her status as a sloop until 1807, when the Admiralty re-rated her as a sixth rate. She remained at Plymouth from 19 June to 14 March 1806 undergoing fitting out.The British measured Confiance and reconstituted her plans. These were published in the first edition of Bateaux-Bois in February 1998, and then later in David Lyon's Sailing Navy List (p.275)) Confiance shared with , , and in the proceeds from the recapture on 11 January 1807 of the schooner Monarch. On 18 August, as Confiance was sailing to Oporto, Yeo received information that the Reitrada, a small Spanish privateer lugger that had been active along the coast of Portugal, was anchored at La Guardia. Yeo sent in a cutting out party in Confiances boats. They captured the lugger, which was armed with one 12 and two 4-pounder guns, and had a crew of 30 men. The Spaniards had one man killed, several wounded, and the rest of the crew jumped overboard. The privateer had sheltered under the guns of two forts, which fired on the boats as they came in. One fort was armed with four 24-pounder guns and the other with six 18-pounder guns; there were also 150 troops. Despite the Spaniards' fire, the British sustained no casualties. Confiance sailed to Portugal on 16 January 1808. The French had captured Lisbon and the Royal Navy was maintaining a blockade in the Tagus where the onset of the Anglo-Russian War had trapped a squadron of Russian ships under the command of Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin. Confiance was off the Tagus when on 13 February she sent her cutter and jolly boat, with 15 men under the command of Master's Mate R. Trist, to row picket because of rumours that Senyavin was about to leave. Trist observed a French gun-vessel anchored under the guns of Fort San Pedro, between Fort Belem and Fort Julian. He immediately attacked, capturing Gunboat #1, which was armed with one 24-pounder gun and two 6-pounder carronades. She had 100 stands of arms aboard, and a crew of 50 men under the command of ensign de vaisseau Gandolphe. The British suffered no casualties; the French had three men killed and nine wounded. Trist, who had passed his exams for Lieutenant a year earlier, received promotion to that rank for his feat. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"13 Feb. Boat Service 1808\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Confiance next sailed to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On 14 January 1809 Confiance captured Cayenne. Yeo received permission from the commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy's Brazil station, Admiral Sir Sidney Smith to mount an operation against the French. Yeo took Confiance, two armed Portuguese brigs, an unarmed Portuguese brig, a Portuguese cutter, and 4-500 Portuguese soldiers, and sailed to Oyapoc, in French Guiana, which they captured on 8 December 1808. A week later they captured Appruagoc (or Appruague). Emboldened by the ease of their victories, Yeo and the Portuguese commander then decided to attack Cayenne. They captured three forts and defeated the French forces under the command of Victor Hugues, the French governor. British casualties were only one man killed and 23 men wounded. On 13 January 1809, while Yeo was on shore with three-quarters of Confiances crew, seamen and marines, the approached Cayenne. She was carrying flour and was under orders to avoid combat, but the British did not know that. Midshipman G. Yeo, Yeo's younger brother, another midshipman, the remaining 25 men of the crew, and 20 local Negroes that the two midshipmen induced to join them, set sail towards Topaze. Topaze, judging from the sloop's boldness that she had company that would be forthcoming, turned away. A few days later captured Topaze. King George knighted James Yeo in 1810 for his victory. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Confiance 14 Jany. 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the operation. Fate The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Confiance Sloop, 560 [Tons Burthen]\\", lying at Deptford, for sale on 22 December 1810. She sold on that day.

(In Richard Matheson's source novel, I Am Legend (1954), the plague is coincident with a great war, but it is unclear if it originated in BW.) * The Crazies (1973), a U.S. Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon (a virus code-named \\"Trixie\\") crashes near a small Pennsylvania town contaminating the water; infected victims either die or become violently homicidal, and heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks soon arrive. * In the Alien franchise of four British-American films‚Äînamely, Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997)‚Äîa key plot-driving element of the story background is that the \\"Bioweapons Division\\" of the sinister \\"Company\\" must have a specimen of the creature at all costs even at the expense of the \\"expendable\\" humans that get in its way. This is most fully developed in the fourth installment wherein a remote \\"Army Medical Lab\\" is attempting‚Äîas part of a secret military/commercial partnership‚Äîto tame the monster. It will be used in \\"urban pacification\\" as well as other, supposedly less malign, purposes, such as materials science and vaccines. * In the Japanese film Virus (1980), a deadly virus (\\"MM88\\") created accidentally by an American geneticist amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with; in 1982, MM88 has been stolen from a lab in the US, and a team of Americans vies with a shady East German scientist to recover it, but fail, and a pandemic, initially known as the \\"Italian Flu\\", results. * In Men Behind the Sun (1988), a Hong Kong‚ÄìChinese historical war horror film graphically depicting war atrocities at the secret Japanese BW facility Unit 731, during World War II, details the various cruel medical experiments inflicted upon Chinese and Soviet POWs. * In 12 Monkeys (1995), a deadly unnamed virus wipes out almost all of humanity in 1996, forcing the few survivors to live underground.

Television (Alphabetical by series) * In The 100, season 1, episode 10, the Grounders infect the exiled Murphy with a hemorrhagic virus, then allow him to escape. While fleeing, he stumbles upon an area surrounding the Ark survivors' camp and infects those who make contact with him. They then unwittingly spread the virus throughout the camp, which sickens some members and kills others. Lincoln explains to Octavia the Grounders use the virus to \\"soften up\\" the enemy before attacking them. * In Between a village is infected with a bioweapon, killing everyone over the age of 21, and the remaining people as soon as they become 21. * In the season 2 finale of Blue Bloods, Frank must work with Homeland Security to prevent a terrorist attack that would infect New York City with a (presumably deadly) strain of flu.

After Mason's wife Anne and friend Marty modify the virus to be harmless to humans, Tom sets out to deploy it in the series finale \\"Reborn\\" (August 30, 2015). Tom infects himself as the alien queen is draining him of his blood, so the virus passes through Tom's blood into her. As the queen is organically linked to her entire race, the bioweapon destroys them, freeing the Earth from oppression. * In the Sliders series finale, \\"The Seer\\" (2000), the main characters land on a world where their enemy, the Kromaggs, were wiped out with a bioweapon. One, Rembrandt Brown, injects himself with the virus (harmless to humans) and returns to Earth Prime in an unresolved cliffhanger in hopes of using it to free his homeworld. * In Season 7 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, we find out about a disease which is killing off the Founders; this disease later turns out to have been caused intentionally by Section 31. * In Season 4 of The Americans, Elizabeth and Philip Jennings must work with another KGB spy, William, to acquire and use deadly bioagents. In the first episode of the season, \\"Glanders\\", the two aim to acquire the deadly bacterium Burkholderia mallei. Throughout the season, endeavors like this continue and intensify, putting the characters in grave danger. *In Season 4 episode 24 of Criminal Minds, the substance anthrax is released into the public and the BAU must find a cure before it is too late. Video games (Chronological, then alphabetical within years) * In Resident Evil (1996‚Äìpresent), the titular Resident Evil originally was discovered through a plant that was taken by Umbrella Corporation, which starts the birth of the biological weapon known as T-virus, which mutates its victims into zombie-like creatures. Later installments of the game and other works in the franchise (e.g., films) saw the release of still more biological weapons over time, created mainly by the fictional Umbrella Corporation and various other organizations. The viruses are also often engineered to radically mutate the subjects into grotesque killing machines, referred to in-universe as B.O.W.s, short for bio-organic weapon. * In Command & Conquer: Generals (2003), the Global Liberation Army (GLA) makes extensive use of biological weapons and has a general who specializes in bio and chemical warfare named Dr. Thrax. The GLA units such as the toxin tractor and toxin rebels spray toxins on enemy units and later use anthrax beta, a weaponized strain of anthrax. Anthrax beta is also used in Scud missiles and the air dropped anthrax bomb. Dr. Thrax's troops have access to the more potent anthrax gamma strain. * In Act of War: Direct Action (2005) and its expansion the Consortium, a syndicate of corporations, PMCs and terrorists use a modified strain of Ebola known as Ebola II hemorrhagic fever strain causing the infected soldiers to lose health and die. It is often deployed by the Super-weapon Falling Star which drops satellites than can carry the weapon on enemy targets. * In Crysis 2 (2011), a large outbreak of \\"Manhattan virus\\", a gruesome disease causing complete cellular breakdown, causes civil unrest; people panic upon an alien invasion by the Ceph, the tentacled, squid-like alien race from the previous game, Crysis (2007). * In Plague Inc. (2012), the player creates a pathogen and attempts to have it mutate and adapt to new environments so it can wipe out the human populace. The game features multiple real pathogen types and fictional pathogen types, all with unique abilities and mechanics. * During the campaign in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014), Atlas CEO Johnathon Irons develops a bioweapon called Manticore, designed to attack all the population that is not in the Atlas database. Irons deployed the weapon late in the campaign, killing most of the Sentinel soldiers in New Baghdad planning to attack him. * In Tom Clancy's The Division (2016), an eco-terrorist unleashed a heavily modified variant of smallpox in New York City, in a bid to kill a large portion of the population. The spread of the disease spiraled out of control, resulting in the complete breakdown of law and order and a rise of hostile factions in the city, mostly on Manhattan Island, which was ground zero of the virus. * In the Mass Effect franchise, the genophage is an agent that genetically modified the Krogans to stop their aggressive expansion into Citadel Space. The agent made it difficult for Krogans to conceive children, however. Even when conceived, most Krogan pregnancies henceforth resulted in stillbirth. * In the Metroid series, the Chozo race creates the Metroid to combat the X Parasite on SR388. The Space Pirates try to capture and breed Metroids and use them as bioweapons, but their plans are foiled by Samus Aran several times: once in Metroid (1986), in Metroid Prime (2002) and another time in Super Metroid (1994). At the end of the events of Metroid Fusion (2002), the last Metroid is killed, ending the threat of Metroids once and for all. * In the Fallout series, F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) was created by the US government in an effort to protect their soldiers from biological weapons deployed by the Chinese military that were ravaging civilian populations. The results of this Pan-Immunity Virion Project was the FEV, a virus that provides immunity to human pathogens, near-immunity to radiation, increases strength and intelligence (in unmutated humans, humans with mutations from radiation or substrains of FEV lose intelligence upon infection), while simultaneously sterilizing the host and eliminating secondary sexual characteristics, making them all outwardly male in appearance. FEV has unpredictable effects on other animals and it is a partial contributor to the mutated beasts you encounter throughout the wasteland. There is also the US developed New Plague (a.k.a Blue Flu). Code-named Limit 115, it was developed by the US government in secret as a sterilization agent for use against the Chinese (people who survived the deadly virus were usually rendered sterile), Chinese agents managed to get their hands on it however and it was accidentally released during their escape causing a national outbreak in the heart of the US. The symptoms are generally flu like at first with hemorrhagic-fever like features in the late-stage. It usually took 3‚Äì5 days from onset of symptoms to death. *In Hitman, Agent 47 is tasked with assassinating an Italian bio-engineer named Silvio Caruso, who is creating a bioweapon capable of rapidly spreading and laying dormant within an area until it detects its target's DNA, killing them. *In the new Old Man campaign in Arma 3, a modified strain of malaria hits the fictional nation of Tanoa. CSAT scientists have engineered it and called it the Atrox strain, which is capable of killing someone within hours. It was used as a method of subversion to expand CSAT's sphere of influence.

He played college football at Ohio State and was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the 4th round of the 1976 NFL Draft. He was a wide receiver and kick returner for the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints and Buffalo Bills from 1976 to 1979. College career Willis played for the Ohio State Buckeyes in 1974 and 1975 after transferring from junior college. His teammates with the Buckeyes included 2-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin, fellow wide receiver Brian Baschnagel, fullback Pete Johnson and safety Tim Fox, and his quarterback was Cornelius Greene. In 1974, he was clocked as the fastest Buckeye football player ever until that time, running the 100-yard dash in 9.3 seconds. Besides playing as a receiver he also returned kicks and even played some free safety for the Buckeyes. In 1974, he did not catch a pass, but ran 11 times for 146 yards, a 13.3 yards per rush average. In 1975, he caught 17 passes for 350 yards, a 20.6 yards per catch average, with 2 touchdowns. His receiving yards and touchdowns were each good enough to rank 8th in the Big Ten Conference. The Buckeyes won the Big Ten Conference championship in both his years with the team, but lost in the Rose Bowl each season. Professional career Willis was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings with the 118th pick in the 4th round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Willis played in all 14 regular season games for the Vikings in 1976, primarily as a kick returner. He returned 24 kickoffs for 552 yards, a 23.0 yard average. He also returned 30 punts for 207 yards, a 6.9 yard average. He also played in all 3 playoff games for the Vikings, as the Vikings won the NFC Championship, primarily returning punts and kickoffs. In Super Bowl XI against the Oakland Raiders Willis returned 3 kickoffs for 57 yards (a 19.0 yard average) and 3 punts for 14 yards (a 4.7 yard average). In 1977 Willis played for both the New Orleans Saints and the Buffalo Bills, again primarily as a kick returner. In 1978, playing for Buffalo, he only played in 4 games and returned just 1 kickoff. But he also had his only 2 professional receptions that year, gaining 41 yards for a 20.5 yard average on those receptions. He finished his career with Buffalo in 1979, playing 7 games and returning 4 kickoffs for 92 yards that season.

The venom of P. paulista contains a peptide with potential use as a chemotherapeutic substance named Polybia-MP1. Habitat Polybia paulista are found in tropical areas of Argentina, Paraguay and are prevalent in Brazil, specifically S√£o Paulo. Nesting and colonization tends to occur in areas where they have protection from weathering. There can be up to three colonies in the same location, and swarms are present periodically. Initial development of the nest begins with swarming or absconding in which the first comb is used to fix the nest to a substrate. The first comb does have the development of envelopes but no eggs are found, due to the low survival rate. During this period there is a large percentage of the colony on the exterior of the nest due to the lack of available space inside the nest. This creates a tight cluster of wasps around the nest, which limits access of the nest to predators, such as ants. The swarm on the exterior of the nest is no longer present around the 10 day period. This time can fluctuate depending on the season, warmer temperatures allow faster work rate of wasps causing quicker construction of the nest. There is a pause in nest construction to allow for larval emergence, this is to allocate resources towards the larval development. Once the larva emerge, a final comb is built around 12 days; with a final comb count of 5-6. A colony size range throughout the development of the nest, specifically during the energizing phase there is about 4500 wasps and up to 13,000 wasps during production of males.[Garcia, Z.J. and Noll, F.B., 2013. Age and Morphological Changes in the Epiponini Wasp Polybia paulista Von Ihering (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Neotropical entomology, 42(3), pp.293-299.] Queen numbers also range throughout colony development, because P. paulista are polygenic, there is a constant recruitment of young queens.[Dias, N.B., de Souza, B.M., Gomes, P.C. and Palma, M.S., 2014. Peptide diversity in the venom of the social wasp Polybia paulista (Hymenoptera): a comparison of the intra-and inter-colony compositions. Peptides, 51, pp.122-130.] Therefore, numbers from 10 to 94 queens have been found in nest throughout the colony cycle. Social behaviours Polybia paulista are swarm- founding wasps which are highly social societies that are complex.[Kud√¥, K., Zucchi, R. and Tsuchida, K., 2003. Initial nest development in the swarm- founding paper wasp, Polybia paulista (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Epiponini): cases of building multiple initial combs. Journal of the New York Entomological Society, 111(2), pp.151-158.] The diverse organization of social structure creates different partitioning locations, collecting and transporting or storing resources. In colonies there is a division of labour which is base on age and caste differentiation; young castes have low risk in nest duties, mirage caste are involved in external nest activities such as construction and defensive against predators or parasites and older castes do high-risk duties, such as foraging. Designated workers in the colony have the tasks of nest building, foraging, brood feeding and defence of the colony. =Foraging= Foraging is an essential part of the colonies survival as it allows for growth of the colony and ecological relationship between the colony and the ecosystem. The main influence of foraging is temperature, where the increase in temperature sees the increase in foraging. This is typically due to increase water requirements for cooling the nest if workers are unable to cool nest through the fanning of their wings. The water is then spread on combs and envelopes which allows the decrease in nest temperature through evaporation. It is observed that foraging takes place during a specific range of temperature, from 19.5 ¬∞C to 32 ¬∞C. Temperature also regulates foraging through flight, wasps cannot fly until a distinct thoracic temperature is reached. This can be done through environmental factors or from workers flexing flight muscles to increase thoracic temperature. Humidity and light intensity have mixed results of impacts on foraging but seem to correlate with temperature. There are four important items that P. paulista preferentially forage after. The first is water, which is collected throughout the year and used for temperature control, nest construction and metabolic processes. Plant fibre or pulp is also foraged, and typically is collected through the months of August to September and December to January. Macerated wood fibre made into a pulp is used for repair of cells and envelopes, as well as nest construction. Animal protein is also collected year round and is used for feeding larva. The demand of animal protein is dependent on the number of immatures in the colony and the cycle the colony is currently in. Finally carbohydrates are forged year round for energy and is important in the diets of adult wasps. Wasps seem to feed primarily on cactus fruits, and focus on the cacti species which are in abundance and easily available during that time of year.[Santos, G.M., Cruz, J.D.D., Bichara Filho, C.C., Marques, O.M. and Aguiar, C.M., 2007. The use of cactus fruit food resources by social wasp (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Polistinae) in an area of Caatinga (lpir√°, Bahia, Brazil). Revista Brasileira de Zoologia, 24(4), pp.1052-1056. ] =Reproduction= In a swarm-fonding paper wasp colony there are multiple queens depending on colony cycle and progression. Young queens tend to be morphologically similar to those of workers but some distinction can be found in older queens, generally with physically size.[Kud√¥, K., Yamane, S., Mateus, S., Tsuchida, K., It√¥, Y., Miyano, S. and Zucchi, R., 2004. Parasitism affects worker size in the Neotropical swarm-founding social wasp, Polybia paulista (Hymenoptera, Vespidae). Insectes sociaux, 51(3), pp.221-225.] Queens have a life span of up to 1 year while workers life cycle last 30 days, with the first day of flight is around the 6th day) Queen dominance is attributed by social dominance, which is believed to be a behaviour and to shift colony from poling to monogyny.[Noll, F.B. and Zucchi, R., 2000. Increasing caste differences related to life cycle progression in some neotropical swarm- founding polygynic polistine wasps (Hymenoptera Vespidae Epiponini). Ethology Ecology & Evolution, 12(1), pp.43-65.] As well as queen physical size, where it is observed that younger queens replace older queens base on the development in size. The queens have the ability to store sperm in the spermatheca, and use it when her eggs need to be fertilized. Envelopes are created over combs to protect brood cells during oviposition. The development of envelopes helps regulate a common concern with the loss of water in eggs, which causes the embyrosgenesis to become dormant. Eggs develop into workers throughout the year and takes place in intermediate periods. Polybia paulista have 5 larval instars and allows the growth and development of multiple morphological features. Head size typically increases with instars but amount of growth is dependent on biotic an abiotic influences. With each instar there is an increase of body weight, salivary glands and mandibular gland, and development was associated with social relatinoships and task performed in the colony. Specifically lateral tooth in mandibles develop in the fourth instar, opening the body spiracles in the second instar, and presence of spines in the maxilla after the fifth instar.  Defence  Polybia paulista venom has been currently a focus of study because of its potential ability to be used as a chemotherapeutic substance. Currently there are 6 major peptides identified which represent 3% of the 70% of the composition of venom. The 6 peptides are mastoparnas polybia MP-I and -II which induce mast cell degranulation, Polybines-I and -II that are N-terminal acetylated peptides that are involved in inflammatory actions, Polybia-CP which is a chemotactic peptide for polymorphonucleated leukocytes and peptides at disulphide bridges which promote insulin secretion from beta cells. Wasps use venom to cause mnemonic actions in stung victims by inflammatory response to toxins and cause physical discomfort. The toxins are produced by peptides that have multiple actions, such as pain oedema formation, hemolysis, chemotaxis of PMLs and most cell degranulation.[Dias, N.B., de Souza, B.M., Gomes, P.C., Brigatte, P. and Palma, M.S., 2015. Peptidome profiling of venom from the social wasp Polybia paulista. Toxicon, 107, pp.290-303.] The variety of peptide composition for venom in intra and inter nest individuals, creates different potencies and toxicity. Allowing wasps to defend themselves against a vast number of predators. The low molecular weight compounds of wasps venom cause anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects on bioassays; which could be a used to help treat epilepsy.[do Couto, L.L., dos Anjos, L.C., Araujo, M.D.A.F., Mour√£o, C.A., Schwartz, C.A., Ferreira, L.B. and Mortari, M.R., 2012. Anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activity of the peptide fraction isolated from the venom of the social wasp Polybia paulista. Pharmacognosy magazine, 8(32), p.292. ] Polybia MP-I have been suggested to be a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of prostate cancer and bladder cancer, due to its relatively lower cytoxicity to unaffected cells.[Wang, K.R., Zhang, B.Z., Zhang, W., Yan, J.X., Li, J. and Wang, R., 2008. Antitumor effects, cell selectivity and structure‚Äìactivity relationship of a novel antimicrobial peptide polybia-MPI. Peptides, 29(6), pp.963-968. ] Research has also shown that the venom of P. paulista contains an antimicrobial agent, Mastoparan, that inhibits all developmental forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that is responsible for Chagas disease.Vinhote, J. F. C., Lima, D. B., Mello, C. P., de Souza, B. M., Havt, A., Palma, M. S., ... & Martins, A. M. C. (2017). Trypanocidal activity of mastoparan from Polybia paulista wasp venom by interaction with TcGAPDH. Toxicon. = Chemotherapeutic potential of Polybia-MP1 = Polybia paulista features a peptide Polybia-MP1 that causes increased permeability in cells featuring phospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the outer membrane. As cancer cells feature the PS and PE phospholipids on the outside of the cell membrane, unlike with non-cancerous cells where they usually remain on the inside of the cell membrane, they are susceptible to the peptide which causes increased cell permeability to a degree that molecules critical for cell function may leak out. Further research is needed to ensure that Polybia-MP1 is safe for use as a chemotherapeutic drug. = Parasitism = Polybia paulista are infected by the parasites strepsipteran and an un-described gregarine. Both these parasites infer the hemocoel in the master of adults. Strepsipteran manipulates the overall body size if workers, and cause workers to depart from the nest after emergence as adults. Gregarine found to cause workers to have larger body size, but was concluded that these parasites prefer larger worker body size and prolong development in larvae which allows them to grow larger.

The propeller increases thrust by 15-20% over single propellers and reduces noise levels, especially low frequency noise, while eliminating torque effects. The propeller system was designed for ultralight trikes and powered parachutes. The latter are especially sensitive to torque effects and the propeller design addresses that issue.

The two propellers are powered by two meshing and counter-rotating shafts, powered by helical gear wheels running in an oil bath. The gap between and the pitch of the two propellers must be exactly right. Neudorfer explains, \\"when the setting is not exactly right, the air stream from the second propeller meets the retrograde air stream from the first propeller at the wrong angle and all this does is to produce more noise and more turbulence. The correct agreement of the setting angle and the hub gaps for the different propeller hub forms can only be established by doing the finest of setting work.

Construction started in 2013 at a cost of ¬£82 million, with train assembly commencing in 2015. It was the first factory that Hitachi built in Europe, as a result of it winning the Intercity Express Programme tender. No actual manufacturing operation takes place at the site; it assembles components built elsewhere into completed trains. By October 2017, the plant employed over 1,000 members of staff. __TOC__  History  In 2007, the Department for Transport (DfT) in the United Kingdom decided to procure new trains to replace the InterCity 125 fleet and on 12 February 2009, the DfT announced that Agility Trains, a consortium led by Hitachi, had won the tender. In 2011 Hitachi chose the site of the UK factory at developer Merchant Place Developments' Amazon Park (later renamed Merchant Park mid-2013) site in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, close to Heighington railway station and adjacent to the Tees Valley line. ‚Äì location of the Hitachi factory, Amazon Park / Merchant Park, Newton Aycliffe Hitachi announced its intention to proceed with construction of the facility in July 2012, after financial closure was achieved for the part of the train order for First Great Western. The contract for the construction of the ¬£82 million factory was awarded to Shepherd Group on 1 November 2013. Construction of the factory was scheduled to start in 2013, with train production beginning in 2015 and the plant reaching full production capacity in 2016. Erection of the frame of the factory was complete by June 2014, with an official topping out ceremony held in October 2014. The factory was officially opened on 3 September 2015, in the presence of Hiroaki Nakanishi (Hitachi), Patrick McLoughlin (MP), Claire Perry (MP), George Osborne (MP), David Cameron (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) and 500 guests.Sources:  It has created 420 jobs, and aims to employ more than 700 jobs at maximum capacity. It was reported that it received over 16,000 job applications, in an area where the Teesside Steelworks recently closed down with a loss of 3,000 jobs. In January 2016 it was announced that Hitachi's successful tender for the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme consisting of new Class 385s would be primarily assembled at Newton Aycliffe, and as part of FirstGroup's successful tender for the TransPennine Express franchise, it was announced in March 2016 that new Class 802 rolling stock would be assembled at Newton Aycliffe. It was claimed by Hiroaki Nakanishi that a UK vote to leave the European Union would result in a scaling back of investment in Newton Aycliffe, a claim which was echoed by local Labour politician, and backer of Britain Stronger in Europe, Phil Wilson. In March 2019, FirstGroup ordered five AT300 trains for its East Coast Trains services on the East Coast Main Line. The five units will be built at Newton Aycliffe and maintained by Hitachi for ten years as part of the ¬£100 million deal. When this order was announced, Hitachi stated that the plant needed new orders especially after it had lost out on the New Tube for London contract with London Underground to rival firm Siemens. The company said that it would be bidding for a proposed bi-mode fleet for the East Midlands franchise and the replacement trains for the Nexus contract on the Tyne & Wear Metro. In July 2019, it was confirmed that Hitachi would build a fleet of 165 vehicles for East Midlands Railway. These would be marshalled into five car trains and be of a bi-mode design with four diesel engines per five car train. Due to the infrastructure restraints on the Midland Main Line, the vehicles will be long, shorter than the Class 800/801/802 carriages from the IEP. The project was listed as being worth ¬£400 million. In late 2019, a new order for 23 units from the A-Train family was announced for the Avanti West Coast franchise. The order, nominally worth over ¬£350 million, is for 13 five car bi-mode units, and 10 seven car electric trains. The seven car units will have a similar capacity to the nine car Pendolino trains as each vehicle will be long. The new units are intended to replace the 20 strong fleet of Class 221 Voyager stock used on the West Coast franchise.  Site  The factory covers over 31.5 acres of land with a building footprint of 44,000 m2. It can assemble a maximum of 35 vehicles a month. The site is situated close to where George Stephenson assembled Locomotion No. 1, the first locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line.

He has co-presented three BBC TV documentaries on social insects (BBC4's Planet Ant: Life Inside the Colony, BBC2's Life on Planet Ant and BBC2's Hive Alive). Hart has written and presented numerous BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service documentaries and written more than 100 scientific papers. In 2015, he authored the popular-science book The Life of Poo about our complex relationships with bacteria. His latest book, Unfit for Purpose, covers mismatches between human evolution and the modern world and was published by Bloomsbury in 2020. In 2017 he presented the BBC World Service weekly science programme Science in Action.  Academic career Hart was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, studying Zoology at Churchill College. His PhD at the University of Sheffield was on the cooperative behaviour of social insects (a group he became interested in because of their social behaviour). Following a post-doc examining conflict in social systems, he transferred to the University of Gloucestershire in 2005, where he is currently the Professor of Science Communication. Hart has published scientific papers on a variety of topics, including entomology, ecology, disease, hygiene, nesting phenology, citizen science, Africa antelope surveying, thermal imaging, African grassland management and climate change. In 2018 his research on spiders was named by Made at Uni as one of the UK's 100 best breakthroughs for its significant impact on people's everyday lives. Research Hart co-authored on the use of low-cost thermal imaging for anti- poaching work won the 2019 Green Gowns Awards in the Research with Impact category. He co- wrote the Oxford University Press textbook Applied Ecology, described as 'a cornerstone publication for all undergraduate students studying ecology', and is also a co-author of the textbook Introducing Forensic and Criminal Investigation. He has served as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Ecological Entomology and is currently an Associate Editor of that journal. He sits on the Editorial Board of The Biologist, the magazine of the Royal Society of Biology, and is an Associate Editor of Antenna, the magazine of the Royal Entomological Society. Hart is also the founding co-editor of Instar, a magazine published by the Royal Entomological Society for children. Hart has an active involvement with large-scale citizen science projects that include the \\"Flying Ant\\" survey, the \\"Spider in da House\\" survey and app and the \\"Starling Murmuration\\" survey with the Royal Society of Biology. The scientific findings of these studies have been widely disseminated. In 2018 he led a team that studied, for the first time, the use of Twitter-mining in ecology, which was covered by a number of news sites. In 2017 Hart co-ran the Big Wasp Survey with Seirian Sumner, which attracted criticism from quarters in the national press because it asked people to set up lethal wasp traps. Hart and collaborator Seirian Sumner responded to this criticism in press and media. Hart authored a piece for BBC Online News defending wasps and their ecological value as well as putting forward the scientific case for the Big Wasp Survey. Hart later went on to make a BBC Radio 4 documentary and a BBC World Service series exploring some of the issues raised. As a commentator on science-related stories, Hart has frequently appeared in the national press, often contributing to stories involving invertebrates such as ladybird invasions, spiders and ants. He has also discussed topics including the fear of spiders, the threat of tree diseases, banana disease and insect conservation. Hart has written a number of high-profile articles on African conservation issues, including trophy hunting, rhino poaching and the horn legalization debate, the issues of fences in conservation, and the economics and conservation issues of breeding of color variant antelopes in South Africa. He is also a frequent commentator on our relationships with bacteria, including the medical implications of gut bacteria. In recognition of his academic work Hart is a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and of the Royal Society of Biology. In 2010, he was awarded a National Teaching Fellowship by the Higher Education Academy and the Society of Biology (now the Royal Society of Biology) Science Communicator of the Year award. In 2011, he delivered the Charter Lecture for the Royal Society of Biology and in 2015 he launched the University of Gloucestershire's public lecture series and delivered the AGM address for the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. Hart thinks that science communication is about sharing science, saying that \\"The scientific method is our greatest intellectual achievement ‚Äì it is a tool to understand ourselves and the universe. How could you not want to share that?\\" Broadcasting Hart has frequently appeared on and presented TV and radio science documentaries. He co-presented BBC4's Planet Ant: Life Inside the Colony (with George McGavin), a 90-minute documentary about leafcutting ants, and BBC's two-part series Hive Alive (presenting with Martha Kearney and Chris Packham). Hart also presented Life on Planet Ant, aimed at a younger audience, for BBC2. Planet Ant was nominated for Broadcast Digital and Royal Television Society awards. Hart captained the University of Sheffield team to the final of the BBC2 Christmas University Challenge series, which sees \\"teams of prominent alumni from 14 universities and university colleges...compete for the glory of their institutions and the honour of being declared Series Champions\\". Since 2011, Hart has presented BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service documentaries on an array of topics including honey, migratory beekeeping, swarm robotics, tree diseases, gut bacteria, de-extinction, trophy hunting (in the wake of the Cecil the Lion story), the concept of free will in biology and animal personality. In 2016 he presented documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service on human-induced evolutionary change, the controversy over rhino horn trade and on mosquito control. Hart presented the BBC World Service weekly science magazine programme Science in Action for three months in 2017. In 2018, Hart wrote and presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary Inside the Killing Jar, exploring the fact that entomologists often have to kill what they study. The program investigated lethal sampling and the controversial idea that insects may feel pain and was later extended into a series for BBC World Service. In the same year, he wrote and presented the 5-part series The Genius of Accidents for BBC Radio 4, which explored the role of accident and luck in scientific discoveries In 2019, Hart co-authored a commentary paper on the ethics of insects in research, with a particular emphasis on ecological sampling and by-catch reduction. Writing and public speaking Hart is a frequent public speaker, lecturing on topics that include social insects, citizen science and trophy hunting to schools, public audiences and special- interest groups. In 2013 he delivered a 24-hour lecture on social insects as part of the Royal Society's National Biology Week. He has also written numerous articles for newspapers, magazines and for the BBC Science and Environment pages, including opinion pieces on migratory beekeeping, human- induced evolution, animal personality and the realities of modern-day African hunting. He has also written about the complex role of gut bacteria in human immunity. In 2015, his first popular-science book was published. The Life of Poo details our complex relationship with bacteria. He is a regular presenter and chair at the Cheltenham Science Festival, tackling topics such as tree diseases, bees, gut bacteria, and garden moths. He has also appeared at the Edinburgh, Northern Ireland and Malta Science Festivals, speaking on, amongst other things, the role of gut bacteria and the use of pheromones in communication. He has also been a speaker at the New Scientist Live Event held annually in London. In 2013, he hosted the EU COST Science Night in Brussels. Hart also hosted the 60th anniversary celebrations of the British Society for Immunology at the Royal Society and chaired the debate 'The changing face of medical research'.

History The PNC arose mainly from the process of convergence of Palestra, the so-called \\"Elements d‚ÄôEstat Catal√†\\" (the militants from Estat Catal√† that were critical of the decision to create the Republican Left of Catalonia), dissidents from Nosaltres Sols! and independents (like Manuel Mass√≥ i Llorens). The PNC participated in the first elections to the Parliament of Catalonia, on 20 November 1932, with a candidacy in Barcelona, headed by the jurist Francesc de Paula Maspons i Anglasell. Despite obtaining more than 6,000 votes, the lack of representation in the Catalan parliament conditioned its subsequent political development. Following a strong internal discussions, that lead to the abandonment of the formation of some of its founders, and the \\"freezing\\" of its internal statutes for a year under the direction of Joan B. Muntada i Macau and of Antoni Mur i Ubiergo, after 1934 the PNC participated with other independentist groups in the preparation of the events of October 6th. In the municipal elections of January 1934 the party presented lists in the cities Barcelona and Tarragona, obtaining poor results. Finally, in June 1936, along with Nosaltres Sols!, the PNC dissolved itself to become part of the historical party Estat Catal√†, which had just broke with the Republican Left of Catalonia a few weeks before. Some leaders, and a minority of members, rejected the merge and maintained the party alive until 1940, when the majority of them joined the National Front of Catalonia (FNC).

Life  Arnold is the son of Annemarie (n√©e Wachter) and Johann Heinrich Arnold (1913‚Äì1982), and grandson of Eberhard Arnold (1883‚Äì1935), who co-founded the Bruderhof Communities in 1920. Arnold was born in the Cotswolds, where the Bruderhof fled from Nazi Germany. He traveled with his parents to Paraguay but then moved to New York in 1954. He lived in Rifton, New York until his death in 2017. On May 22, 1966, he married Verena Meier with whom he had eight children. Arnold helped found Breaking the Cycle of Violence, a conflict resolution program in the wake of the Columbine high school massacre. Through the program he spoke to school students and adults about the importance of forgiveness in the US, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Rwanda and other places. He traveled and spoke extensively with Steven McDonald, a US police officer who was shot and paralyzed, and who contributed to Arnold's book on forgiveness. Arnold had a wide circle of friends and co-workers. On September 11, 2017, an event was held in New York City to commemorate his life. Speakers at the event included First Things editor R. R. Reno, veteran civil rights activist John M. Perkins, Professor Robert P. George of Princeton University, and others. Writing career Arnold wrote a total of twelve books, covering a wide range of topics. The books are published by Plough Publishing House. Many of these books have become bestsellers and large numbers of copies have been given away for free, or are available as free e-books. Arnold's best known book is Why Forgive?, which has been published in more than 10 languages. The book details the stories of people who have forgiven after negative life events. The book has been endorsed by Nelson Mandela, who said: \\"A much-needed message not only for South Africa, but for the whole world.\\" In 1996, Arnold wrote A Plea for Purity, later renamed Sex, God and Marriage. The book was endorsed by Pope Benedict XVI while he was still a cardinal saying \\"I am very happy for this book and for its moral conviction.\\" The foreword was written by Mother Teresa, who wrote: > In this book we find a message needed today in every part of the world. To > be pure, to remain pure, can only come at a price, the price of knowing God > and of loving him enough to do his will. He will always give us the strength > we need to keep purity as something beautiful for God. Purity is the fruit > of prayer.

In the United States, approximately 51% of the six million annual pregnancies are unintended. A majority of the women affected by an unintended pregnancy are aged 20‚Äì24, poor or low income, or a member of a minority group. Unintended pregnancy rates are generally higher in the South and Southwest regions of the United States and densely populated areas. A lack of family planning, limited access to birth control, and inconsistent use of birth control are three of the contributing factors to unintended pregnancy. Counselors are knowledgeable about available services and help women decide how to handle their pregnancy. They advise on whether the woman will seek an abortion, give the child up for adoption, or if she will choose to parent the child as a single parent. Counselors give information in a non-biased manner, neither encouraging or discouraging a particular decision for a woman to make.  Abortion =Prevalence= Abortion is described as an intentional termination of a pregnancy. More than forty percent of women have an abortion during their reproductive cycle in their lives. In the United States, three out of ten women have an abortion by the time they are forty-five years old. Throughout the world, about twenty to thirty million legal abortions are performed each year. Another ten to twenty million more are performed illegally. According to E Medicine Health, illegal abortions are unsafe and are responsible for thirteen percent of deaths in women. =Requirements and arguments= There are different requirements for women who wish to access abortion services. If someone is under eighteen, the person's state may require parental consent from one or both parents for the abortion to be carried out. In most states, you can go to a judge and request to be excused from this requirement. The Supreme Court first legalized abortion in 1973 with the Roe vs. Wade decision. When an abortion can be done depends on how far along an individual is in their pregnancy. Depending on that fact, the mother may have a choice between a medical abortion, which uses drugs to induce the abortion, or a surgical abortion. In a surgical abortion, the mother undergoes an operation to have the fetus and placenta removed. After nine weeks, a surgical abortion is typically the only option. There are many controversial questions that arise when the issues of abortion are discussed in political and social arenas. Some questions that are considered are: \\"Should spouses be notified before a woman has an abortion?\\", \\"Should public funds be used for abortions?\\", \\"Should the rules be different in cases of sexual assault and rape?\\" The issue of parental consent also resurfaces. There are many pro and con arguments that surface when discussing whether or not abortion should be legal. Many supporters of legal abortion argue that, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court has declared abortion to be a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution.‚Äù They also argue that allowing women to get abortions gives them control over their own bodies. In general, individuals who believe abortion should be illegal disagree. First and foremost, they believe that abortion is murder. They believe that life begins at conception. These are only a few of the many important arguments that both supporters and non- supporters voice regarding abortions. Adoption =Types of adoption= There are two types of adoption to choose from: closed adoption and open adoption. Closed adoptions occur when the birthmother and the family adopting do not receive any information about one another, which typically happens when the birthmother wants to remain anonymous. Open adoptions occur when the birthmother and the adoptive parents do have some form of contact. In this situation, the birthmother usually chooses the family based on their values, life style, and religion. Sometimes the birthmother and adoptive parents will have some type of relationship, which might include visits with the child, phone calls, or pictures to update the birthmother. Birthmothers might choose this option when they wants to be updated as the child grows up. =Adoption laws= Whether open or closed adoption is chosen, adoption is legal and binding. Every adoption must be approved by a judge in a court of law. The adoption laws differ in each state, and adoption agencies, counselors, or lawyers can give information on the laws in each state. After the baby is born, the birth mother must sign papers to terminate her rights as the parent of the child. Laws about the birth father‚Äôs consent also vary from state to state. Choosing to parent =Prenatal care= When an unplanned pregnancy occurs women are faced with a tough choice, and are urged to write down thoughts, feelings, and fears about her pregnancy options to help with her decision. If the women decides to parent the child herself, her first step is to start prenatal care. This will ensure she and the baby stay in good health. Prenatal care is the care you receive from a health care provider, such as a doctor or midwife, during pregnancy. The first prenatal care visit the mother will have a full physical examination as well as a gynecological exam. The expecting mother should have a doctors visit every four to six weeks for the first 28 weeks (7 months). From week 28 to 36 the expecting mother should visit her doctor every two to three weeks. From week 36 to delivery the mother should visit the doctor every week. =Lifestyle changes= If the mother chooses to parent, doctors often encourage mothers to make positive lifestyle choices in order to prevent health problems with the unborn baby. These lifestyle changes are an attempt at controlling as much as we can to avoid any health problems with the unborn child. These rules include no consumption of caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, other recreational drugs, prescribed medications, or over the counter remedies. The mother is encouraged to maintain a healthy diet and to exercise regularly. More than 97 to 98% of babies are born healthy. =Monetary assistance= The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a program called Maternal and Child Health Bureau that coordinates medical care, support, and advice for pregnant women as well as information about health insurance. This mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is to provide leadership to improve the physical and mental health, safety and well-being of the maternal and child health population which includes all of the nation's women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families. Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program are two assistance programs that aid with paying for prenatal care.

He graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in economics and later earned a master's degree in business administration at Golden Gate University. After spending several years as a businessman managing his family enterprises, he entered politics in 1980s and went on to serve in various community organizations. In 1996, he was the volunteer liaison for then District 4 supervisor Leland Yee. In 2002, Yee successfully ran for a seat in the California Assembly, and Jew ran for Yee's seat on the Board of Supervisors in the 2002 election, but was defeated. When Yee's successor Fiona Ma in 2006 ran for state assembly, Jew again ran for supervisor in District 4, which comprises most of the Sunset District. After winning a highly competitive election decided by instant-runoff voting, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Six months after he took office, the FBI raided his office and homes for allegedly extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned in the face of extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64 months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury. Personal life Edmund Jew was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. The Jew family emigrated from China around the start of the 20th century. His grandfather James Jew, who arrived to the city in 1913, established an employment agency in 1925 and the Canton Flower Shop in Chinatown in 1927. He became a distinguished leader in the Chinese community after serving many local Chinese American associations. Jew was raised in Chinatown. After graduating from McAteer High School, Jew attended City College of San Francisco and San Francisco State University, where he earned a degree in economics. In 1984, he also earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Golden Gate University. Before entering politics, Jew was an entrepreneur. Among other enterprises, he managed his family's flower shop and owned a local taxi company named Howard Mock Jew, Inc. In addition, he invested in real estate. He bought his first property in San Francisco at the age of 21 and, as of 2002, he had a real estate portfolio (including properties in the Bay Area and Arizona) worth as much as $5 million. , Jew's wife Lorene and their daughter Cammie live in Burlingame, California. He also has a brother named David Jew. Political career Jew began his political career in the 1980s, establishing the Chinese Neighborhood Resource Center, which helped to clean up alleyways in Chinatown. He was then appointed by the mayor to serve on the Ten Year Plan Council to End Chronic Homelessness and the Office of Aging Advisory Council, the later oversaw the city's senior services. Like his grandfather, Jew was heavily involved in local Chinese-American politics, serving as president of the Jew Family Benevolent Association, the Yeong Wo Benevolent Association, the Hay Sen Benevolent Association, the Hip Sen Benevolent Association, and the Lung Kong Benevolent Association. He was also an active participant of numerous other community organizations, such as the Northeast Community Federal Credit Union, the Chinese Holocaust Museum, the Sunset Residents Association, and the Sunset Parkside Education and Action Committee. Jew once served as vice chairman of the San Francisco County Republican Central Committee before re-registering as an Independent and then as a Democrat. From 1996 to 2001, Jew was District 4 then-supervisor Leland Yee's volunteer community liaison. Jew first ran for Yee's District 4 seat in 2002 when Yee ran for the California State Assembly. Despite Yee's endorsement, Jew finished third, missing the runoff election. In 2006, Jew again ran for same supervisor seat when Fiona Ma ran for the California Assembly. Jew led other candidates including his top challenger Ron Dudum in the first round with 26% first-place votes. He eventually won the closely fought election after securing a 52% majority. In December 2006, Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Jew to serve out the remainder of Ma's term; he took office in January 2007. Controversies =FBI raid and extortion charges= On May 18, 2007, six months after Jew took office as supervisor, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), armed with a federal warrant, raided his office at City Hall, his houses in San Francisco and Burlingame, and his Chinatown flower shop. The FBI sought evidence in Jew's computers and records regarding \\"potentially criminal allegations\\" surrounding an extortion attempt. Jew said that he had been contacted by the owners of a local chain tapioca drink shop, Quickly, to resolve Quickly's business permit issues. Jew demanded $80,000 for his assistance, but agreed to accept $40,000. The shop owners then contacted the FBI, which supplied the cash for a sting operation. The FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew and hand over the money. Jew claimed that he turned over the money to a man named Robert Chan from a land use consulting firm called Bridge Consulting, though this was never substantiated. He also asked that half of the money be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up to raise money for the renovation of a playground at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street. The donation was later rejected by the group's fiscal agency, Sunset Youth Services, after the directors, Dawn and Ron Stueckle and Delvin Mack learned the nature of the donation source. On September 20, 2007, federal prosecutors charged Jew with one count of mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated his refusal to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, a federal grand jury added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges. =Residency requirements violation= One of the letters sent by Herrera to Jew's defense attorney requesting the supervisor to provide more evidence regarding his residency In late May 2007, following the FBI raid, questions surfaced about whether or not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed that he spent most of his time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests. On June 12, 2007, San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris issued a warrant for Jew's arrest, and charged him with nine felony counts of perjury, election code violations, voter fraud, and providing false documents. Jew turned himself in to the Burlingame Police Department. On June 18, 2007, City Attorney Dennis Herrera sought approval from then California Attorney General Jerry Brown to remove Ed Jew from office. Citing records that showed little use of utilities and interviews with 32 neighbors, Herrera declared that Jew had violated the residency requirements of the City Charter by falsely claiming in his campaign papers that he was a resident of San Francisco. Mayor Gavin Newsom said the case against Jew was \\"very damning\\" and raised concern about Jew continuing to cast votes while the legitimacy of his residency was in question. On July 4, 2007, Jew's attorneys issued a 138-page response to Herrera's petition, arguing that even if Jew had not lived full-time in his home in District 4, his election had not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of political bias in bringing the charges. Herrera denied Jew's accusations, and released signed bank loan documents on which Jew had identified his address in Burlingame. On July 17, 2007, Jew pleaded not guilty to the perjury charges, and was granted bail after Jew agreed to surrender his passport. During the preliminary hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house and spent most of his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him. =Suspension and resignation= On September 25, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom suspended Jew for alleged official misconduct and began the process of removing him from office. The city attorney also served Jew with civil charges of misconduct for allegedly lying about where he lived. Deputy budget director Carmen Chu was appointed as Jew's temporary replacement on the Board of Supervisors. On January 10, 2008, Jew tendered his resignation in exchange for Herrera and Newsom dropping both the civil lawsuit and misconduct proceeding before the Ethics Commission regarding his residency violation. In a letter, he noted that he resigned due to tremendous legal expenses and swore never to seek public office again in the best interest of his family. Chu became Jew's interim successor until the election in November 2008. = Guilty plea and sentencing = On October 10, 2008, Jew changed his plea to guilty on the federal mail fraud and extortion charges. The following month, he also changed his plea to guilty on the perjury charges. On April 3, 2009, Jew was sentenced to 64 months in state prison and fined $10,000 on the federal extortion charge. Prosecutors stated that he \\"preyed upon and victimized the very people whom he had proposed to support in his campaign: small business owners in the Sunset District.\\" On April 22, 2009, he was sentenced to one year in county jail, three years of probation, and a $2,000 fine on the state perjury charge. Jew reported to a federal prison in Safford, Arizona on June 30, 2009. In June 2012, Jew was held at Taft Correctional Institution in Kern County, California. = After prison = In 2013, Ed Jew was released to a halfway house in San Francisco's Tenderloin area. In late 2014, he took up a low- paying job in a city-funded program targeting illegal garbage dumping in Chinatown, a position he still held in 2016.

He later served as an officer in the army of the Sultan of Oman.Major Grahame Vivian - obituary. The Telegraph, 27 July 2015. Retrieved 3 September 2015. Early life John Edgar Grahame Vivian was born in Camborne, Cornwall on 28 October 1919. His father managed mining companies and the family moved to Burma and Siam to take up work there. He went to school at Repton in Derbyshire and would go on to attend Camborne School of Mines. However, the outbreak of the Second World War curtailed his studies at the mining school.  Military Service  = Second World War = Vivian entered the British Army in the Duke of Cornwall‚Äôs Light Infantry but was disappointed to be posted close to home. After volunteering for service with the Indian Army, in December 1942 he joined the 4th battalion of the 8th Gurkha Rifles in India. His battalion deployed to Ranchi and to Arakan area of Burma towards the end of 1943.  Military Cross Action  On 9 January 1944 Vivian was ordered to infiltrate Dhobi Hill which intelligence suggested was lightly defended. However, when Vivian closed on the position he found it to be defended by the Japanese Army in strength. In spite of the enemy strength being greater than anticipated Vivian decided to attack. Once battle had been joined Vivian was knocked over by a mortar shell and received wounds to his chest, stomach and arm. He refused medical treatment and ordered his men to dig in and hold their position in the face of strengthening Japanese resistance.

The series was written by Joe Harris with artwork by Colin Lorimer, and featured cover art by menton3. Millennium focuses on Frank Black, a former offender profiler investigating the Millennium Group, a cult-like organisation which had sought to control the end of the world at the turn of the 3rd millennium. Black learns that the Group is still operating over a decade after their supposed defeat, and have recruited his estranged daughter to combat gathering demonic forces. The first issue, released on January 21, 2015, saw sales of over 8000 issues, though sales figures would subsequently drop. However, the series has been reviewed positively by critics, with Lorimer's artwork frequently singled out for praise. The complete series was collected in a trade paperback after its run was finished. Plot =Background= Set during the events of the season ten comic book series for The X-Files, the events of Millennium see Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Fox Mulder joining the long-standing crusade of offender profiler Frank Black as he combats the Millennium Group, a doomsday cult entrenched in elements of the United States law enforcement. =Events= Fox Mulder attends a parole hearing for Monte Propps, a serial killer he helped to apprehend in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until they were willing to commit suicide by drowning; however he is now seen as a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster. Black attempts to locate further information about the Millennium Group's activity, having believed them defeated in 1999. He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering‚Äîand that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes. Mulder follows Black to Seattle, arriving at the abandoned ruins of Black's old family home, where he is confronted by the powerful demon Lucy Butler. Black arrives to find Mulder struggling against her attempts to control him, and she threatens to kill them both, before Jordan arrives to intervene. Butler, now appearing in her full demonic form, is eventually banished by Jordan's psychic abilities. Jordan leaves again, knowing that the Group will need this power, as Mulder unsuccessfully tries to persuade Black to rejoin the FBI. Watching this is a black cat, which shapeshifts into Butler's human guise, who vows to wait \\"a millennium\\" for revenge. Publication Published by IDW Publishing, Millennium is a five-issue limited series, acting as a spin-off from the seventeenth issue of The X-Files Season 10, itself another IDW title. It is an adaptation of the 1990s television series Millennium, which featured Lance Henriksen as Frank Black. The comic series was written by Joe Harris with art by Colin Lorrimer, and saw Chris Carter, the creator of Millennium, serve as executive producer. Both Harris and Lorimer had previously worked on The X-Files Season 10. Cover art for the series was provided by menton3. Harris cites the success of the adaptation of The X-Files for providing the impetus for a Millennium comic, noting that IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall approached him to write the latter series having seen the reception the former had been receiving. Harris himself had been a fan of the series during its initial broadcast, personally favouring its second season. He also expressed interest in possibly adapting another of Carter's creations, Harsh Realm. Release and reception The first issue was released on January 21, 2015, and featured a variant cover by artist Paul Shipper. The issue sold 8,505 copies in North America, making it the 197th best-selling comic by units for that month. By the release of the second issue, sales had dropped to 6,273 issues, the 263rd highest sales figure for the month. A trade paperback collection comprising all five issues was released on August 12, 2015. Critical reaction to the series was positive, with review aggregator website ComicBookRoundUp giving the series a score of 8.2 out of 10, based on 20 critics' reviews of individual issues. Reviewing the first issue for We The Nerdy, Taneisha Jane gave a score of 90 out of 100, describing it as having \\"excellent storytelling that will keep you engaged\\", and complimenting Lorimer's artwork. Comic Vine's Tony Guerrero praised Lorimer's \\"creepy\\" artwork, but felt that the storytelling required too much foreknowledge of the television series to fully understand. He summed the issue up as being \\"the crossover we've been waiting for\\". Reviewing the third issue for SciFiPulse, Patrick Hayes praised the series' use of photographic alternate covers for subscribers, and complimented the artwork and colouring throughout. Hayes rated the issue an \\"A\\" overall.

Smen (from also called sman, semn, semneh, or sminn) is a salted, fermented butter, and a traditional Yemeni dish. In Yemen, Yemenis prepare a special version of semneh (ÿ≥ŸÖŸÜÿ©‚Äé) which is smoked with aromatic herbs inside of a gourd in order to impart deeper flavour and aid in preservation. However, Smen is also an important ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine and North African cooking. It is produced using the butter made from the milk of sheep, goats or a combination of the two. The butter is brought to boiling point for about 15 minutes, then skimmed, strained into a ceramic jar called a khabia, and salted before it curdles. Thyme is often added to it to provide a yeast and enzyme starter. Other plants or fruits can be used. The result is then aged, often in sealed containers. It is then traditionally buried in the ground for temperature stability purposes, just like cheese is left to mature in caves because they have cooler and more stable temperatures. It is similar to ghee and niter kibbeh, but has a characteristically strong, rancid, and cheesy taste and smell. Matured smen is very similar in taste to blue cheese as it is a high-fat form of cheese. The older the smen, the stronger‚Äîand more valued‚Äîit becomes. Smen is traditionally used mainly in the preparation of couscous and trid, as well as of tagines and kdras, although it is becoming increasingly difficult to find due to its increasing replacement by peanut oil, a non-native culinary element introduced from Senegal and other West African countries. Smen made during winter is believed to be more fragrant than those made during a warmer season. In constant warm weather, closer to the temperature where butter becomes liquid, smen matures very slowly. In lower temperatures, one month is considered an acceptable time to start using the smen in cooking, although its flavour will not be strong. In a constant warm weather, like in equatorial countries, it can take up to four months to develop the equivalent amount of flavour. Smen holds great cultural significance, particularly as an indicator of familial wealth. As such it will often be used as a token of honor for esteemed visitors to a household, akin to other cultures' customs such as using the \\"fine china\\" or serving an especially prized wine. Berber farmers in southern Morocco will sometimes bury a sealed vessel of smen on the day of a daughter's birth, aging it until it is unearthed and used to season the food served on that daughter's wedding.

It is about an eleven-year-old boy turning twelve, completing a cycle of the Chinese zodiac, in San Francisco, and his struggles juggling cultures and growing into his name. Setting Grant Avenue in Chinatown, view north toward the intersection with California and the distinctive Sing Fat and Sing Chong buildings dating to 1906 The novel, written in 1991, is set in then present-day Chinatown, San Francisco, though it makes reference to many other historical periods. Plot elements Donald Duk is an eleven-year- old Chinese-American, preparing to celebrate both his twelfth birthday and Chinese New Year. He is the son of a Chinese chef named King Duk, and a Chinese mother named Daisy Duk. Donald has two older twin sisters named Penelope and Venus Duk. From the start of the book we are told how embarrassed Donald is of his name and of being introduced with his family. The story begins with Donald comparing himself to Fred Astaire. Donald believes he dances as well as Fred and throughout the novel considers himself the real \\"Chinese Fred Astaire\\" (91). Donald immerses himself in old black-and-white movies, and especially admires Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films. He envies the way \\"everyone\\" adores Fred when he dances. Donald wishes he could \\"live the late-night life in old black-and-white movies and talk with his feet like Fred Astaire, and smile Fred Astaire's sweet lemonade smile\\" (1). Grant Avenue during Chinese New Year (2006). King Duk fears Donald sees the world too much in black-and-white, wanting to become as American as possible. Donald is ashamed of the way his family rejects American culture and that even when they watch television \\"they make everybody on the TV look Chinese!\\" (91). Donald does not want to be like them; he considers himself American because he was born in America. Donald's father tells him, \\"I think Donald Duk may be the very last American-born Chinese-American boy to believe you have to give up being Chinese to be an American\\" (42). Having to put up with harassment due to his uncomfortable name, Donald also listens to his father's advice on standing up to bullies. As Donald and his family welcome the Chinese New Year, Donald's best friend, Arnold Azalea, stays over at Donald's home in Chinatown in order to observe Chinese culture and celebrate the new year. On the first day of the New Year, Donald's family begins to talk about Chinese immigrants working on the Central Pacific Railroad end of the Transcontinental Railroad. Donald begins to have dreams of being a lion dancer, urging the Chinese gandy dancing railroad men on in a race to Promontory Summit. As these dreams progress, he is inspired to read up on the work the Chinese immigrants put into this track- laying and finds that the photos in the history books of Promontory Summit only show white workers: the role of Chinese labor had disappeared from history. Suddenly Donald finds himself claiming that white people are racists. King reminds his son that not all white people are racist and that up to that point, Donald had been the one acting ashamed of his cultural identity. Hallucinatory dreams are interwoven with trips to the Chinese apothecary with his father and with tales of illicit firecracker dealers from the neighborhood gang. Subplots include Donald stealing and destroying one of the model airplanes his family has been making for the festival; Donald and Arnold getting in trouble with the police for blowing up fireworks in traffic; Donald's annoyance at the UC Berkeley idealism of his schoolteacher concerning Chinese Americans; and Donald's discomfort at learning that a Vietnam veteran in his neighborhood has been incorrectly arrested for a murder that happened while he had been with Donald. Characters Donald Duk is a Chinese American boy turning twelve who lives with his family in Chinatown, San Francisco. \\"Donald Duk hates his name. He is not a duck. He is not a cartoon character\\" (1). Donald wishes he was Fred Astaire and aspires to be like him. He loves tap dancing and sometimes daydreams he is talking with Astaire. Donald is ashamed of being Chinese and wishes he was only American. He finds his culture stupid, boring and embarrassing. The story covers his search for identity and his path to accepting his culture. Arnold Azalea is Donald's best friend and attends the same school as Donald. He is white and is very fascinated by Donald's culture. He stays with Donald for a couple weeks so he can spend Chinese New Year with Donald and his family. He can't understand why Donald hates his culture and Chinese people so much. At one point, he and Donald get into a fight over Arnold's interest in the Chinese. It is also implied that he sometimes shares Donald's dreams about the railroad workers. King Duk is Donald's father. King owns a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, of which he is the chef. He is recognized by his community as having the most authentic Chinese food. King is also the one who provides Donald with tough love rather than pity when Donald complains of the bullies in the neighborhood. King's response is, \\"You walk like a sad softie...you look like you want everyone to beat you up\\" (3). He is direct with Donald and refuses to allow him to linger in self-pity but rather provides him with insight to allow him to accept his heritage. King had assimilationist parents and learned about his Chinese heritage only after he ran away from home and studied Chinese opera overseas. Daisy Duk is Donald's mother. She is the reasonable one in the family. Daisy keeps the balance within the family when Donald upsets his father with anti- Chinese remarks. Penelope Duk is Donald's older sister. Penny has a twin sister named Venus. She is eccentric and likes to make pop culture references often when the mood is sour and in order to lighten it. Venus Duk is Donald's other older sister. She is Penny's twin and with Penny, she discusses pop culture and both provide the book with a sense of humorous relief. Uncle Donald Duk is Donald's uncle, a Chinese opera performer touring with his troupe. He provides a lighter tone when issues arise between Donald and his father. He provides Donald with insight into his heritage and helps him understand the accomplishments of his race in America. He is also especially the one to tell Donald of the work Chinese immigrants put into building the Central Pacific Railroad. Larry Louie is Donald's dance instructor. He is also known as \\"The Chinese Fred Astaire.\\" He keeps himself looking very thin in order to physically resemble Astaire. Larry Louie enjoys tap dance but he also enjoys flamenco and because of this, Donald feels he is the true \\"Chinese Fred Astaire.\\" Donald doesn't think that Astaire enjoyed flamenco and therefore Larry Louie shouldn't either. The Frog Twins are local residents who used to be Hollywood actresses. Late in the novel, they have a conversation that illustrates some of the difficulties of being an Asian or Asian-American actress at the time. American Cong is a Vietnam veteran that Donald meets early in the novel. He is Chinese American, but talks about himself as white, since he grew up in Iowa. He is arrested for murder, but Donald's testimony that they were together at the time of the murder (coupled with corroboration from the Frog Twins) gets him released. Major themes ;Concept of Identity: This story deals with the issue of cultural identity. Donald Duk is ashamed of being Chinese and ridicules a lot of things about his culture in the beginning of the novel. As the novel progresses, however, he begins to accept who he is and embrace his culture. Named for a Disney character--also the subject of a widely circulated Marxist essay first printed in Chile in 1971 (How to Read Donald Duck)--the novel explores the manner in which culture is woven into the individual. ;Concept of Racism: This novel also deals with the issues with racism. As Donald Duk accepts his culture more and more, he begins to see the racism around him more and more. He sees the racism in school with the way his teacher, Mr. Meanwright, portrays Asians as passive and noncompetitive. He sees it in the country's history, which doesn't acknowledge the help of Chinese workers to build the Central Pacific Railroad. He also sees it in himself. \\"What's wrong with racists, anyway?\\" Mom asks. \\"We have been living with them for over a hundred years now, and we get along with them fine.\\" (p. 150) As time moves on this consciousness of racism allows him to appreciate the famous figures who tried to change this view and he learns to be proud of who he is. Literary significance and reception Donald Duk is recognized by many critics as \\"a small masterpiece\\" (novelist Tom Robbins, back cover of book). Kirkus Reviews described the novel as a \\"wonderfully zany coming-of-age journey that deals with the interpenetration of Chinese myth and American popular culture\\". Donald Duk has also become required reading at many schools, \\"having sold 45,000 copies, many through college course adoptions\\". Donald Duk has been the subject of several scholarly works by academics, and remains one of Chin's more popular and studied works. Allusions and references =Allusions to history= Transcontinental railroad under construction The novel mentions the Union Pacific Railroad and sets the \\"legendary Kwan Kung as foreman of the Chinese laborers building the Central Pacific Railroad\\" in the 1860s. The book deals with the issue that these Chinese laborers didn't get the credit they deserved for building the railroad. Although Kwan Kung, a famous general of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms era of China, died centuries before the railroad was built, the building of the railroad by Chinese workers did take place. It also references the lives and treatment of Chinese Americans who lived in Chinatown during the mid/late 20th century. This book altogether deals with \\"racist U.S. exclusion laws, the nineteenth century exploitation of Chinese laborers, the distortion of classic Chinese philosophy and literature, the erasure of Chinese-American history, [and] the emasculating stereotypes of Chinese in the American media\\". =Allusions to other works= Artists and performers * Don Ameche * Fred Astaire (1) * Gene Autry * Connie Chung * Joan Crawford (170) * Greta Garbo * Alec Guinness (33) * Rita Hayworth (2) * Katharine Hepburn (162) * Julio Iglesias (59) * Bette Midler (165) * Marilyn Monroe * Ricky Nelson * Ginger Rogers (1) * Frank Sinatra (51) * Barbara Stanwyck (2) * Shirley Temple (165) * Lily Tomlin (165) Authors, poets, artists and illustrators * Richard Avedon * Samuel Beckett * Pearl Buck (135) * R.
