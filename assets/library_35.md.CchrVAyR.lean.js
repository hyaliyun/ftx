Two species have been described, both from Liaoning province, China: Yanornis martini, based on several fossils found in the 120-million-year-old Jiufotang Formation at Chaoyang, and Yanornis guozhangi, from the 124-million-year-old Yixian Formation. Description Fossil specimen of Y. martini Y. martini was the size of a chicken,Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. had a long skull with about 10 teeth in the upper jaw and 20 teeth in the lower jaw, and was both able to fly and walk well, having a well- developed U-shaped furcula (wishbone). The absence of the prefrontal bone and the non-diapsid skull allows Yanornis to be classified as an ornithuromorph, a member of a group of stem-birds which also includes the common ancestor of living birds. Similarly, its scapula and coracoid had evolved the basic shape and layout as in modern birds, enabling Yanornis to lift its wings far above its back for an efficient upstroke. It was probably a more efficient flyer compared to Enantiornithes (which have the modern condition in a less well- developed form), and especially compared to Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx, which were only marginally able to perform upstrokes. To allow for the necessarily large flight muscles, the sternum of Yanornis was longer than it was wide, again representing an essentially modern condition. =Diet= crop, and macerated fish remains in its stomach Several fossil specimens of Y. martini preserve the remains of fish in the stomach and crop, suggesting that these birds were primarily fish-eaters. Their fish-eating and associated adaptations show convergent evolution with the unrelated enantiornithine Longipteryx.Zhou Z. and Zhang F. (2001). \\"Two new ornithurine birds from the Early Cretaceous of western Liaoning, China.\\" Chinese Science Bulletin, 46 (15), 1258-1264. PDF One specimen preserved large amounts of supposed gastroliths (\\"stomach stones\\") in the gizzard region. Large numbers of small gastroliths are usually associated with species that need to grind tough plant material, such as seeds, after swallowing them. This led some scientists to suggest that Yanornis was capable of \\"diet switching\\", perhaps seasonally, between fish and seeds. However, later studies cast doubt on the diet- switching hypothesis. Further study of the specimen found that the supposed stomach stones were not massed around a single region corresponding with the gizzard, as in other fossils with such stones, including specimens of Archaeorhynchus and Hongshanornis. Rather, the stones were spread throughout the body cavity in a front-to-back arrangement. This has been suggested to correspond more closely with the intestines, and may represent impacted sand. In modern birds, sand is often swallowed accidentally during feeding (particularly when feeding on dead fish), and, due to some obstruction, may eventually become impacted in the intestines, leading to death. Classification In a 2006 study of early bird relationships, it was found that Yanornis, Yixianornis, and Songlingornis formed a monophyletic group; since Songlingornis was the first of these birds to be described, the family containing this group is Songlingornithidae. The order Yanornithiformes has been erected to mark their distinctness from other early Ornithurae such as Gansus, but might be called Songlingornithiformes; especially if the present taxon is indeed a junior synonym of Songlingornis as sometimes proposed. Reconstructed alimentary canal superimposed over a specimen of Y. martini The cladogram below follows O‚ÄôConnor et al., 2013 phylogenetic analysis. The clade names are positioned based on their definitions (contra O‚ÄôConnor et al. (2013)). =Name and synonyms= The genus name Yanornis is derived from the Ancient Chinese Yan dynasties, whose capital was at Chaoyang, and Ancient Greek ornis, \\"bird\\". The species Y. martini was named for avian paleontologist Larry Martin. Yanornis gained notoriety when the front half of a fossil bird was combined with the tail of a Microraptor to make the paleontological forgery \\"Archaeoraptor\\". Upon discovering this, the bird half was described as Archaeovolans repatriatus, which was later found to be a junior synonym of Yanornis. Some studies have found that the bird species Aberratiodontus wui is in fact a poorly preserved specimen of Yanornis martini, or at least a close relative, an opinion which has been supported by subsequent reviews of enantiornithine taxonomy.

He was best known for his crusades against the metric system and in favour of capital punishment. Domm represented the riding of Peterborough, Ontario from the 1979 federal election until his defeat in the 1993 election. Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, Domm was the son of a United Church of Canada minister. He was educated at the Ryerson Institute of Technology and became a radio broadcaster in Peterborough. Domm's campaign against Metric conversion in Canada was most vocal during the final Pierre Trudeau government of 1980 to 1984. In 1983, he and other Tory MPs illegally pumped gas using Imperial measurements at their \\"Freedom to Measure\\" gas station. The station was leased by the MPs in hopes of provoking the government into laying charges and thus allowing a legal challenge to mandatory use of metric. The government ignored the station and it closed after a year. When the Progressive Conservatives formed government following the 1984 federal election, Domm became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, the government minister responsible for the metrification program. However, while the Metric Commission was disbanded and rules on enforcing metric were loosened, the \\"metrification\\" of the country was not reversed. Domm's lobbying for the death penalty resulted in a free vote being held in the House of Commons in 1988, however the motion to restore capital punishment was defeated. He was more successful in his campaign for the restoration of Via Rail service on the Toronto-Peterborough-Havelock line.

The larger bell produces the mellow tone of a standard euphonium; the second smaller bell has a brighter tone, similar to a baritone horn or valve trombone. The instrument is sometimes dismissed as a novelty, but has had a small number of enthusiastic adherents, although few professional musicians use it as their sole or primary instrument. The smaller bell can give more appropriate tone in the higher range of the instrument. The two bells can also be used for special effects, such as echoes, and using the distinctly different tone of the two bells for a single musician to give the effect of call and response.  Construction  The last valve on the horn (either the fourth or the fifth, depending upon the model) is used to switch the sound from the main bell to the secondary bell. Both bells cannot play at the same time because each bell usually has its own tuning slide loop, such that they can be matched adequately for consistent performance. Unlike the double horn, there is only one set of valve slides with a double bell euphonium, so only the basic pitch of the two bells can be matched. Double bell euphonium being played History of the double bell euphonium The double bell variation of the euphonium was mass-produced starting in the 1880s, first produced by the C.G. Conn company in the United States . Other major U.S. brass instrument makers followed suit. The instrument was first popularized by euphonium virtuoso Harry Whittier with the famous Patrick Gilmore band starting in 1888; the John Philip Sousa band added the instrument the following year [Bone Paull and Morris, p. 12], with other US brass bands following the example. Peak production of the instrument was from about the 1890s into the 1920s, although it was never one of the more popular brass instruments. =Decline= The last double bell euphoniums were made around 1960. In practice, most double bell models ended up being used with the large bell only, effectively a very heavy single bell euphonium. About the second bell, famous euphonium soloist Arthur W. Lehman once said during a Marine Band concert, \\"We use it to hold our white gloves when we are not wearing them.\\"  Soloists  Simone Mantia used to play a double-bell euphonium as a virtuoso.

It connects the Don River to inner Toronto Harbour (Toronto Bay) on Lake Ontario. The channel is named after Edward Henry Keating (1844-1912), a city engineer (1892-1898) who proposed the creation of the channel in 1893. The channel was built to connect Ashbridge's Bay to the harbour; later, the Don was diverted into the channel, and its river mouth infilled in the early 1910s. History Toronto harbour in 1906 showing the Keating Channel and Don River mouth Prior to the 19th century, the Don River naturally entered Toronto Harbour in two mouths, one roughly near where Keating Channel now flows out and one further south. In the late 19th century, a public works program was started to straighten the lower part of the Don River south of the Winchester Street Bridge. The project was called the \\"Don Improvement Project\\". The goal of the project was to alleviate floods on the lower Don that were periodically washing out bridges. It was also done to create additional wharf space for the Toronto harbour. When it was completed, the river was directed south into Ashbridge's Bay. At the time Ashbridge's Bay was still a lacustrine marsh. It was heavily polluted by local industry. The water from the river was diverted into the bay with the hope that it would flush the bay of the poor water. However the flow of water introduced raw sewage in the river into the bay. The bay water remained stagnant and was increasingly becoming a serious health risk. The Keating Channel was proposed as a method of directing the dirty river water into the harbour thus dispersing it more rapidly. The channel was planned to go from the northeast corner of the inner harbour east towards Leslie Street and join up with the Coatsworth Cut at the foot Coxwell Avenue. However, the portion east of the Don River was never completed and it was closed in 1916. The channel was completed in 1922 after eight years of construction. The completed channel now runs from the harbour east to the mouth of the river, a distance of about 800 metres. The original mouth of the Don is buried under infill near where the Gardiner Expressway meets Cherry Street. The original course from the mouth upstream now lies underneath railway tracks used by GO Transit for storage. The channel is flanked on the north by the elevated Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard East. The south side is occupied by the PortsToronto aka Toronto Port Authority works yard and the Keating Channel Pub. At the west end Cherry Street crosses the channel over a single sided drawbridge rarely used by ships. At the east end is the start of the Don Valley Parkway. In the 1940s the watershed further up the Don River became more urbanized. This caused an increasing amount of silt to flow down the river. The silt collects in the channel where there is very little water flow. Since that time, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has been dredging the channel. The dredgeate material is barged out to the Leslie Street Spit where it is dumped in a containment area built for this purpose. In 2005, the annual amount of silt dredged was about 35,000 cubic metres. The containment area has the capacity to take 50 years of Don River dredgeate . In 1980 Ontario's Minister of the Environment was asked, during question period, about an exemption from environmental regulations, granted to those who dredged the channel. Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Bryden was quoting Donald Chant's recommendation concerning the Keating Channel, and why the recommendation had been ignored, when she was interrupted by the Minister. Chant was then the chairman of the Premier's steering committee on environmental assessment. According to the MPP, Chant's recommendations had questioned whether dredging the channel was worthwhile: Industry During World War One a small shipyard on the Keating Channel built vessels for the war effort. Canada's Federal cabinet published a tender for a railway swing bridge over the channel in 1896. Construction began in 1900. Early in its history the banks of the channel were lined with industrial enterprises, including a small shipyard, the Toronto Shipyard Company, which built vessels for the war effort. The channel has always been dredged, to continue to allow navigation. In the 21st century, with its role as a cargo route over, the channel is only dredged to a depth of . Toronto Life quoted Toronto harbour master Angus Armstrong's explanation that the current dredging efforts are aimed at \\"whatever is needed for the health of the river.\\" Current issues Debris collected at mouth of the Keating Channel after a storm in August 2005 The channel's impact on the Don River is varied. Both sides of the channel are lined with concrete dock wall which creates a barrier and provides little habitat for fish and other water dwelling creatures. The Don is home to about 21 species of fish. Only about four or five species can be found near the mouth. This is partly due to poor water quality but also due to lack of habitat. The dock wall continues, mostly unbroken, north to Riverdale Park. This is in contrast to the Humber River to the west, which has a natural mouth and is home to about 44 species. Another problem affecting the channel is floating debris that is washed down the Don. Composed largely of logs and dead wood, there is also an assortment of garbage that collects in the channel. The TRCA corrals this material with a boom across the channel. There can be significant flotsam where the Keating Channel enters Toronto Harbour, especially after a big storm. Restoration initiatives On the north side of the channel a slight bend in Lake Shore Boulevard has created a narrow open space. In 1998, the Task Force to Bring Back the Don planted Staghorn Sumac (Rhus typhina), Sandbar Willow (Salix exigua), and Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) in this area. Despite poor soil conditions, the willow and the hardy sumac have thrived. It is now a long narrow glade of small trees and shrubs. Another small green space at the eastern end was also planned for restoration but the project was abandoned after one planting. There was also a proposal to remove part of the dock wall to improve fish habitat. These projects were suspended when it became apparent that a larger project would be starting soon. In 1999, the three levels of government announced plans to revitalize Toronto's waterfront. Among the four initial projects was a plan to restore the mouth of the Don to a more natural outlet. In 2005, an environmental assessment was initiated to investigate options to restore the original mouth of the Don. Some of the options being considered would fill in the Keating Channel and direct the Don River through a new channel just north of Lake Shore Boulevard or straight south to link up or cut the inner basin shipping channel to the south of the Keating Channel. The environmental assessment process is ongoing.

Vivian Hughes Ridler, CBE (2 October 1913-11 January 2009), was a printer, typographer and scholar in Britain. He was Printer to the University of Oxford at Oxford University Press from 1958 until his retirement in 1978; and also established his own Perpetua Press. Biography Ridler was born in Cardiff, Wales on 2 October 1913. When he was a boy, he and his family moved to Bristol. While still at Bristol Grammar School, he became interested in printing and typography. He bought an Adana platen, and with his friend, David Bland (who had a Wharfedale), established the Perpetua Press, a private press which they ran between 1931 and 1936. One year their Fifteen Old Nursery Rhymes was chosen as one of the 50 best books of the year. During this time, Ridler met Eric Gill and Douglas Cleverdon. After school he served a short apprenticeship at the Bristol firm of E. S. and A. Robinson. Ridler got to know John Johnson, then Printer to the University of Oxford, and in 1936 went to Oxford to help the Assistant Printer, Charles Batey. In the late 1930s, Ridler moved from Oxford to London, to establish the Bunhill Press for Theodore Besterman, the Voltaire scholar. He also designed for the publishers Faber and Faber, where David Bland was Production Manager. Through Bland he met Anne Bradby, who was working at Faber's as secretary to T. S. Eliot. In 1938 he and Anne were married, and they went on to have four children - Jane, Kate, Benedict, and Colin. Anne Ridler became well known as a poet, published first by Faber and later by Carcanet. During the Second World War, Ridler served in the British Royal Air Force, in Orkney, Nigeria, and Germany. After the war he resumed free-lance designing, and also became the first tutor in typography at the Royal College of Art in London and typographer to Lund Humphries & Co. in Bradford. In 1948 Charles Batey brought him back to Oxford, engaging him as Works Manager at the Oxford University Press. He was appointed Assistant Printer in 1950, and Printer in 1958. As Printer, he introduced film setting, rotary and web-fed letterpress and sheet- and web-fed offset, replaced collotype with 400-screen halftones and established a fully mechanised bindery. The Press mainly published dictionaries, reference works, bibles and academic books demanding complicated settings or exotic type; it also accepted commissions from external publishers, learned societies and examination boards. Among Ridler's productions were Stanley Morison's book on the Fell types, facsimiles of Eliot's The Waste Land and the Constable Sketchbooks and The Great Tournament Roll for the British College of Arms. Ridler was widely known in printing beyond Oxford. During the war, he had been elected to the Double Crown Club (1943) and on demobilisation had lectured to the Club on the typefaces of Eric Gill; in 1963 he served as its president. He was a founder of the Institute of Printing, an examiner in typographic design for the City and Guilds of London Institute, and served as President of the British Federation of Master Printers (later the British Printing Industries Federation), with its 4,000 members, from 1968 to 1969. In 1971 Ridler was made a CBE. He became a fellow of the Oxford college of St Edmund Hall. He retired from the Oxford University Press in 1978. After his retirement, Ridler ran his own printing shop, where he produced on his hand-press Christmas cards (often incorporating poems by Anne Ridler), broadsides, ephemera, and some small books under the revived imprint of the Perpetua Press; one was Mutiny on the Bembo, a set of comic verse lampooning publishing by his colleague OUP editor John Bell. An exhibition of some of his work was held at The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford University in 1993. Ridler's wife, Anne, died in 2001. Ridler died on 11 January 2009, aged 95.

The sutta describes a discourse imparted by the Buddha to two brahmins, Bharadvaja and Vasettha, who left their family and caste to become monks. The two brahmins are insulted and maligned by their own caste for their intention to become members of the Sangha. The Buddha explains that caste and lineage cannot be compared to the achievement of morality practice and the Dhamma, as anyone from the four castes can become a monk and reach the state of Arahant. Then, he explains about the beginning of the Earth and the birth of social order and its structure, including the castes. The Buddha emphasizes the message of universality in the Dhamma and how the Dhamma is the best of all things. The Beginning The Sutta begins when the Buddha is staying in Savatthi, in the temple donated by Visakkha, the mother of Migara. At that time, two brahmins, Bharadvaja and Vasettha, are training with the monks (bhikkhu) and aim to be a member of the Sangha. As usual in the evening, the Buddha rises from his meditation and strolls in the open yard near his dwelling. Vasettha sees his Teacher strolling, tells his friend, Bharadvaja, and suggests that they meet the Buddha to see if they can hear a Dhamma exposition from the Buddha. They both approach the Buddha and after some formal proprieties, the Buddha asks the two if they received insults and denigration when they left their caste and layman's life in order to join the order. Vasettha and Bharadvaja answer that they did receive a 'flood of insults'. They say that the other Brahmins maintain that the Brahmin caste is the best, as the Brahmins are of high social status and authority, pure-bred, have radiant complexions, and are born from the mouth of the God Brahma, unlike the other lower castes. So, by the opinion of the other Brahmins, how can Vasettha and Bharadvaja leave this good caste and status, thus joining together with fraudulent ascetics with shaven heads from other castes, lower in status as they are born from the feet of Brahma? To this remark, the Buddha tells them that the Brahmins have indeed forgotten about their past if they said such things. The fact is that the women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds. The Buddha then elaborates that if any of the caste does the following deeds: killing, taking anything that is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practise wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi); people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are not worthy of respect. They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be. While those who refrain from killing, taking anything that is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, being greedy, cruel, and practising wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi), will be seen by people as positive and will earn respect from the people and the wise ones. They would be profiting from their deeds, no matter what their caste might be. Logically, as the four castes can do either negative (demerit) or positive (merit) deeds, so will the wise reject the statement that only the Brahmins are the best caste. Why? Because anyone from the four castes, if they left the worldly affairs and became a monk, and due to their discipline and struggle, they become arahant, people who conquered their mind's stains, have done whatever what must be done, have been relieved from the burden, have broken the bondage of birth, achieved freedom, freed due to achieved knowledge, then he is the best among others based on Truth (Dhamma). The Buddha says, \\"Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.\\" Further, the Buddha proves that Dhamma is indeed the best thing of all things in life. He takes the example of King Pasenadi of the Kosala Kingdom, who has now conquered the Sakyans. The Sakyans revere, praise, and serve him with respect. But, towards the Buddha, who came from the Sakyan people, King Pasenadi reveres, praises, and serves the Buddha with utmost respect. Even the monarch thinks like this: \\"The Shramana Gotama had perfect birth, while I am not perfect. The Shramana Gotama is mighty, while I am weak. The Shramana Gotama inspired awe and respect, while I do not. The Shramana Gotama is vastly influential and charming, while I only possess small influence.\\" As even the King respects Dhamma, reveres Dhamma, and obeys Dhamma, therefore he bows and praises the Tathagatha. The Buddha then advises Vasettha that whoever has strong, deep-rooted, and established belief in the Tathagatha, he can declare that he is the child of Bhagavan, born from the mouth of Dhamma, created from Dhamma, and the heir of Dhamma. Therefore, the titles of the Tathagatha are the Body of Dhamma, the Body of Brahma, the Manifestation of Dhamma, and the Manifestation of Brahma. The Beginning of Life on Earth In the second part of the Sutta, the Buddha tells the story of how human beings came to dwell on Earth. The Buddha said that sooner or later, after a very long time, there would come a time when the world shrinks. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious ‚Äî and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having died from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious ‚Äî and they stay like that for a very long time. They floated above and around the Earth. At this time, there were not yet seen the Moon and the Sun, there were not yet Night and Day, there were not yet names and identity or female or male. The creatures were only known as creatures. At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness.... And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or heated butter and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey (1) Some of the creatures of light (the Abbhasaras) who had curiosity and a greedy nature began to dive and taste the savory Earth's substance. At that moment, the creature found out that it tasted so delicious. Thus, greed started to seep in and it ate the substance voraciously, greedily, also calling its comrades (who were flying above and on earth) to join in the feast. Not long afterwards, the creatures began to eat greedily, and due to the huge amount of the mud substance they could feed on it for a very long time. As they ate and ate, their luminous body began to be coated by the mud substance, formed a coarser body, then suddenly, the sun and moon were seen, so were the stars, and also Night and Day began on Earth. The logical explanation of this was that the creatures were the self-illuminating, so blinding and luminous that they didn't notice the Sun. The Earth was covered in their light. So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' of mud and thus the night and day became apparent to them. Then, as the night and day became apparent, seasons and years also appeared. Their body was still coarse and roughly shaped. Thus, after a very long time, the mud-like substance began to be exhausted. Then, mushroom-like plants began to grow so fast that they replaced the mud-like ocean. The creatures began to devour them as well, and they also found it delicious, like sweet honey and milk. Their body hardened more and details began to turn finer. After another very long time, the mushrooms also began to be exhausted, replaced by cassava or turnip-like plants. They also began to devour them night and day, and thus they began to notice differences amongst them. As the changes of their bodies varied between each other, the concept of difference arose. The concepts of the beautiful and the ugly were born. The beautiful scorns the ugly and they became arrogant because of their appearance. Then, after the turnips, the earth was grown with rice plants. The first rice plants were without husk and kernels. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people consumed them for a very long time. But there are people who became greedy and lazy. They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were too lazy to take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The generation time for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice. By this time, the body of the creatures had become finely evolved. There was already the distinction between male and female. The man became preoccupied with women and vice versa. Then, as they were deeply attracted to each another, passion and desire was aroused, and they engaged in sexual relationships. The people who saw a couple engaged in sexual activity scolded them, and usually the couple were forbidden from entering the village for a certain period of time. Owing to this, the indulgent couples built closed dwellings where they indulged in sexual activity. The Birth of Social Order and Castes In the third part, the Buddha explained about the origin of Castes, their titles, and their order in the society system which were still rigidly effective in Buddha's time. =The Khattiya Caste (Rulers)= The rice plants, as mentioned earlier, began to grow in separate plots and people began to divide lands and tend each other's cluster of rice fief. They became preoccupied in tending their own field. Then, as the evil and greed were aroused, there were people who begin stealing others' crops. At first, the others only warned the culprit and the culprit promised that he would never repeat it again. But when it was repeated several times, the people began punishing him with fist, stones, and then sticks. That is the origin of punishment forms. Then, people began to think that they were too busy to heed every crime and abuse that happened in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people. But most of their time had already been invested in tending their fief. So, they appointed someone to rectify what is right and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice. So, they went to the fairest, ablest, most likeable, and most intelligent person and appointed him to do the judging and passing out sentences on the reward of a share of rice. The appointed person thus agreed and the people bestowed upon him the title : 'Maha Sammata' meaning: The People's Choice. Then, they bestowed also the second title: 'Khattiya' meaning the 'Lord of the Rice Field', and finally the third title: 'Raja' which means 'Who gladdens people with Dhamma (or Truth)'. This order was created by the people's wish and need, based on the Dhamma and not from others. The Buddha stated again that Dhamma is indeed the best of all things. =The Brahmin Caste= Then, amongst the people, some of them begin to think like this: \\"Evil deeds have risen amongst us, such as: theft, lies, murders, sexual abuses, punishment, and banishment. Now let us set aside evil, unuseful, and impolite things.\\" The word Brahmins came, as it meant: \\"They who put aside Evil and unwholesome things\\" (1). They set up retreats and huts in the forests and meditated there. They came to the city at morning and evening only to gather food and after finishing gathering food, they returned to their huts and meditations. People noticed this and 'Those who meditated' were called 'Jhayanti' or 'Jhayaka'. There are other people, who can't meditate or dwell in huts in the forest. So, they settled in the cities, did not meditate, but compiled books. The people called them 'Ajjhayaka' which meant 'They who don't meditate'. At first the Ajjhayaka were viewed lower than Jhayaka but in the Buddha's time, the Ajjhayaka had been viewed higher in status than the Jhayakas. =The Vessa (Traders) and the Sudda (Hunters)= Among the people who had settled and had family, some began to adopt various trades. The remainder of these people preferred the work of hunting. The Sudda caste came from the word 'Sudda' which means: 'They Are Base Who Live By The Chase' [1]. All of the castes, from Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda originated from these people, and not from others; in accordance to the Dhamma and not by others. =The Ascetics= But from the four clans, there were people who were not satisfied with their living, left their home and became celibate ascetics. These are the origin of the fifth caste formed from all the four castes' people who left their lay life and became an ascetic. Buddha's Conclusion The Buddha then concluded his discourse to Vasettha and Bharadvaja: (Due to the governance of Dhamma which became the root of all castes and people) anyone, from any the caste, who did demerit and wrongdoings, lived a bad life of speech, thoughts, views, and wrongdoings, they would end up after their death, in the realm of sufferings, hell, loss, and torture. But anyone, from any caste, who did merit and good deeds, lived a good life of speech, thoughts, and deeds; had the right view, after their death, they would end in the realm of happiness and heaven. Anyone, from any caste, who did both merit and demerit, lived a good and bad life of speech, thoughts, and deeds; had either a right or a bad view, after their death, they could end in the realm of suffering or the realm of joy. Anyone, from any caste, who lived a life of disciplined deeds, speeches, thoughts, who had trained and developed himself in the seven factors of Enlightenment, then he would attain the eradication from the (stains/dust/dirt/filth) of mind in this current life. Anyone, from four castes, who became a bhikku (Monk), arahant, who had eradicated stains of Mind, had done what must be done, had relieved himself from burden, who had attained freedom, who had broken the bondage of birth, who had been freed due to knowledge; then they would be declared as the best from all of them, in accordance to the Truth (Dharma) and not from the basis of not Truth (adhamma). The Buddha quoted, \\"Dharma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.\\" The Buddha quoted the verses of Brahma Sandakumara: \\"The Khattiya is the best among those who maintain their lineage; He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.\\" then, the Buddha asserted that the verse is indeed true, according to the Dhamma, profitable, and true. The Khattiya‚Äôs best among those who value clan; He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.\\" Thus the discourse ended with Vasettha and Bharadvaja rejoicing in hearing the words of Buddha. Digging Deeper Into the Sutta While the story of the world's beginning is considered a myth, on the other hand, the Buddhist doctrine requires a constant sceptical approach, where one must see and prove it before one believes it (ehipassiko). However, the profound insight of the Buddha in two major fields: science (cosmology) and social structure's origin indeed was revolutionary in his era. On the science part, Buddha implied the theory of the Evolution of the Universe, where it is said to shrink and then expand in repeated cycles. While on the social science part, the Buddha's words implied the equality of origin in the human race, whether by their sex, appearance, or by other categories which were founded later based on physiological differences. Buddha also emphasized that the social structure is formed voluntarily, based on righteousness and necessity, not based on Divine command as some theories stated. The Monarchy is also formed voluntarily, and the people elect the most righteous and capable person, which implied the Democracy concept. The Monarch accepts a 'share of rice' as his reward to rectify the social order, which is the origin of voluntary reward which evolves into the taxation concept. However, the Buddha states that the Monarch is regarded worthy not because of his divine right but due to his righteousness in deeds. The Buddha's message was clear, however, that the best thing in the world is Truth (Dhamma) and everything is created, measured, and valued based on Truth and not from something other. According to Richard Gombrich, the sutta gives strong evidence that it was conceived entirely as a satire of brahminical claims regarding the divine nature of the caste system, showing that it is nothing but a human convention.Richard Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo. Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 85: .David J. Kalupahana, M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way. Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1991, page 61: According to Gombrich, the Buddha satirizes the Vedic \\"Hymn of the Cosmic Man\\" and etymologizes \\"reciter of the Veda\\" so as to make it mean \\"non-meditator\\" instead.Richard Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo. Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 82-85. Not all scholars agree with Gombrich's interpretation and his view is not unanimous. Among those who disagree is Suwanda H J Sugunasiri, a Canadian Buddhist scholar, who most recently has presented a novel interpretation of the Sutta. Rejecting the view that the Sutta is a ‚Äòsatire‚Äô (Gombrich) or ‚Äògood humoured irony‚Äô (Collins), he shows how ‚Äúthe Discourse is a historically and scientifically accurate characterization of the cyclical cosmic process‚Äù [2]. He compares the stages of cosmic, vegetation, human and linguistic evolution as indicated by the Buddha with those in western theory, beginning with 13.5 billion years ago of the Big Bang and ending with 150,000 years when ‚Äòanatomically modern humans‚Äô appear. The Big Bang, in this interpretation, marks not the beginning of the Evolutionary phase but the ending of the earlier Devolutionary phase, when there appears seven suns (as in a different Sutta), symbolic of intense heat. A critical point in Sugunasiri‚Äôs reconstruction of the Buddha‚Äôs universe is the novel take on the Abhassaras - as photons, translating the term Abhassara literally as ‚Äòhither-come-shining arrow‚Äô (ƒÅ + bhas + sara). In an expanded study, Sugunasiri points to two other Suttas (Brahmajala and Patika) in which the Buddha presents dimensions of the cosmic process. He also shows how the Buddha cuts through the Vedic myth of creation referred to in Gombrich.Gethin, Rupert. \\"Cosmology and meditation: from the Agganna Sutta to the Mahayana\\" in Williams, Paul.

It stands above the hamlet of the same name at the head of Borrowdale. Position of the summit The fell is very rugged with several small tops along the summit of the ridge. At the northern end is a peaked summit at 1,971 ft (601 m), very prominent from the valley below. Alfred Wainwright took this as the summit of the fell in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, even though he readily acknowledged that it wasn't the highest point. This is one of many subjective decisions which differentiate Wainwrights from more modern (and logical) hill lists such as Nuttalls and Hewitts. Wainwright stated that the 1,971 ft top was generally regarded as the summit of the fell, although he cited no references. Other guidebooks have taken Wainwright's lead, Mark Richards stating Stand upon that (northern) pike and you know why tradition has ordained this to be the summit. The view down Borrowdale is peerless. A new generation of fellwalkers may arrive seeking to overthrow the traditional perception and feeling no compunction at adopting the highest ground as a summit.Richards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): Richards does at least acknowledge the highest point as a top, as does Birkett, who gives equal status to both.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): To provide ease of identification, the highest point (2,073 ft, 632 m) is immediately east of Great Slack on Ordnance Survey maps. Great Slack being the name of the broad rake on the sw of the fell. Pt. 632 stands near the centre of the fell and is listed as a Nuttall and a Hewitt, but not of course as a Wainwright. The situation is further complicated by a third top to the south (2,070 ft, 631 m). This has been of little interest to guidebook writers, but of great significance to the authors of modern hill lists based purely upon height and prominence. Thus Seathwaite Fell South Top, unnamed on maps, is a Nuttall, reducing the 'traditional' summit to third place. Topography Seathwaite Fell is a northern ridge of Great End in the Scafells. It projects out from beneath the great northern cliff of its parent, occupying a tongue of land between two tributaries of the River Derwent. These are Styhead Gill to the west and Grains Gill to the east, the streams meeting at Stockley Bridge below the nose of the fell. Sty Head Gill falls from the walkers' pass at Sty Head, the main pedestrian route from Borrowdale to Wasdale. Near the head of the pass is Styhead Tarn. This in turn is fed by the outflow of Sprinkling Tarn, a beautiful indented pool lying between Seathwaite Fell and Great End. Sprinkling Tarn lies very close to the course of Grains Gill, ensuring that Seathwaite Fell is almost surrounded by water. The prow of the fell above Stockley Bridge has two tiers of crag, with Aaron Crags standing above Black Waugh. A long line of crags also stands above Grains Gill on the eastern side, looming above the popular path from Seathwaite to Esk Hause. The western face, although rough, drops more gently down to Styhead Gill. In addition to a number of rocky knolls, the summit ridge also carries numerous small tarns. None are named on Ordnance Survey maps, although the one below the south top is of a reasonable size. The 'traditional' northern top and Pt 632 have small cairns. The view northward is good from both, but only the traditional top shows the foreground of upper Borrowdale. To the south is an intimate view of the cliffs of Great End. Geology The summit plateau is composed of volcaniclastic sandstone of the Seathwaite Fell Formation, with a dyke of andesite and hybridized andesite porphyry running due north from Sprinkling Tarn. The coarse grained sandstone and breccia of the Cam Crag Member is exposed further down the norther slope.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Precipitation Seathwaite is listed as having 3552mm of rainfall annually; this figure makes it the wettest place with rainfall statistics in England.Lake District National Park Authority: Facts and Figures The rain gauge used for this measurement is on the slope of Seathwaite Fell above the hamlet. Provisionally, the 24-hour total rainfall at Seathwaite (ending 0045 on Friday 20 November 2009) of 314.4 mm is a UK record for a single location in any given 24-hour period. Records going back to 1914.http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2009/pr20091120.html Ascents Seathwaite Fell and Stockley Bridge The fell is invariably climbed from Seathwaite, taking the bridleway from Stockley Bridge which goes to Styhead Tarn for a kilometre, passing the waterfall of Taylorgill Force, before striking south westerly over rocky terrain to reach the cairned northern summit. A ridge path works its way south from here although it bypasses both Great Slack and the south top and a short detour is needed to reach them. An alternative is to make for Sprinkling Tarn from either Esk Hause or Sty Head and then work back along the ridge.

Early life Frothingham was born in Jamaica Plain on July 13, 1871. He attended the public schools and Adams Academy. He graduated from Harvard University in 1893 (where he was a member of the Porcellian) and from Harvard Law School in 1896. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Boston. He served as second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Political career Frothingham was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and served as Speaker from 1904 to 1905. He was the Republican nominee in the 1905 Boston mayoral election after narrowly defeating former Judge Henry S. Dewey. He lost the general election to Democrat John F. Fitzgerald 48% to 39%. He served as the 41st Lieutenant Governor 1909‚Äì1911, but was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor in 1911. He was lecturer at Harvard. He then moved to North Easton and continued the practice of law. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916. On May 9, 1916, Frothingham married Mary Shreve Ames in North Easton, Massachusetts. Mary Shreve Ames was a member of the wealthy and prominent Ames family of Easton, Massachusetts, she was the daughter of Frederick Lothrop Ames the great niece of Congressman Oakes Ames, and the first cousin, once removed of Oliver Ames who was Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts. Frothingham served as a major in the United States Army during World War I. He was a member of the commission to visit the soldiers and sailors from Massachusetts in France. He served as first vice commander of the Massachusetts branch of the American Legion in 1919. He was overseer of Harvard University for eighteen years. Frothingham was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-seventh and to the three succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1921, until his death on board the yacht Winsome in North Haven, Maine on August 23, 1928. His interment was in Village Cemetery in North Easton.

It may develop in the epigastrium (upper, central part of the abdomen). Epigastric hernias are more common in adults and usually appear above the umbilical region of the abdomen. It is a common condition that is usually asymptomatic although sometimes their unusual clinical presentation can present a diagnostic dilemma for the clinician. Unlike the benign diastasis recti, epigastric hernia may trap fat and other tissues inside the opening of the hernia, causing pain and tissue damage. It is usually present at birth and may appear and disappear only when the patient is doing an activity that creates abdominal pressure, pushing to have bowel movements, or crying.  Symptoms  * Pain * tenderness *redness *Impulse on cough  Causes  * Obesity * Pregnancy. * Frequent heavy lifting * Genetic defects * Aging * Severe vomiting Diagnosis Computed tomography scans of the suspected areas with intravenous contrast can assist in diagnosis.. Doctors are also able to identify whether it is a suspected hernia by palpating the affected area. Ultrasonography is also used for diagnostic purposes. Treatment Symptomatic epigastric hernias are repaired with surgery. Even if they are asymptomatic, they can be surgically corrected for cosmetic reasons. In general, cosmetic surgery on infants is delayed until the infant is older and better able to tolerate anesthesia. If the size of the hernia is greater than 4 cm, then a hernioplasty or herniorraphy surgery is required. Prognosis  Epigastric hernia becomes a problem when the hernia becomes incarcerated or loses blood supply to that area. This can be life- threatening.

Biography A graduate of the University of Illinois, he was a member of the Kappa Kappa chapter of Sigma Chi. Stahl began his baseball career as a catcher before being traded to the Senators, where he moved to first base full-time, with occasional stints in the outfield. He was regarded as a good fielder and an average hitter, although he did lead all hitters in the American League in home runs with 10 in . He also struck out 128 times for the year, a record that would stand until 1938. Stahl sat out the 1911 season, instead opting to return to his native Illinois, where he took a position as a bank manager for a firm on the South side of Chicago.\\"Jake Stahl is Reinstated,\\" Piqua Daily Call, Jan. 8, 1912, p. 6. Stahl was offered a position as player-manager of the Boston Red Sox for 1912 ‚Äî a position which required the team and Stahl to obtain formal reinstatement by baseball's National Commission since Stahl had been previously deemed to be in violation of \\"rule 33\\" when he failed to report in 1911. This dispensation was given in January 1912, freeing Stahl to assume his place as player-manager of the Red Sox. The team did not elect to fine him for his absence in 1911. As a player-manager, he led the Senators to two seventh- place finishes, and in his second managerial stint led the Red Sox to the 1912 World Series title. His success was short-lived, as he had a falling-out with his teammates and resigned midway through the season. His successor, Bill Carrigan, would win two more World Series titles for the Sox. Stahl died of tuberculosis in Monrovia, California at age 43.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Jake_Stahl Stahl has a measure of immortality as the acknowledged eponym of the term \\"jaking it\\", a baseball phrase for faking an injury to stay out of the lineup, or otherwise loafing.

It was from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan. The type and only species is F. adenticulatum. Classification Ferganocephale was originally classified in the group Pachycephalosauridae. It would then be one of the oldest known pachycephalosaurids. Robert M. Sullivan however, in 2006 disputed the pachycephalosaur classification, finding \\"few of the features [...] are characteristic of pachycephalosaur teeth,\\" citing the lack of serrations on the teeth, and concludes the specimens are \\"too incomplete for identification\\". He considers the taxon a nomen dubium. Discovery and naming The type species, Ferganocephale adenticulatum, was first described by Averianov, Martin, and Bakirov in 2005, and is based solely on teeth from Fergana Province, Kyrgyzstan, dating to the Callovian. The holotype is ZIN PH 34/42, an adult unworn tooth. The type species is Ferganocephale adenticulatum. The genus name combines the name of location it was found with the Greek kephale, \\"head\\", a reference to the presumed pachycephalosaurian affinities.

It is one of two Broadway theaters that use a thrust stage that extends into the audience on three sides. History The original Circle in the Square was founded by Theodore Mann, Jos√© Quintero, Jason Wingreen, Aileen Cramer and Emily Stevens in 1951 and was located at 5 Sheridan Square (a former nightclub) in Greenwich Village. The original Circle in the Square did not have a theater license, but Mann was able to get a cabaret license; the production staff and off duty actors served as waiters if anyone insisted on ordering food or drinks. Many of the theater personnel, both acting and technical, lived on the premises. Even classical performances took place here: Pianist Grete Sultan, who later became a well known interpreter of New Music and was John Cage's close friend, performed the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach at the theatre in January 1953. After directing several landmark productions at Circle in the Square, Jose Quintero left to work on other projects. His last production for Circle in the Square was Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under The Elms.The best known productions in the original theater were Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke, with Geraldine Page and Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, with Jason Robards.Journey's In The Night In 1960 the company moved to the Circle in the Square Downtown, at 159 Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village in a historic building built in 1917 (which now houses The Market NYC, an indoor market). Their first production in the new space was Thornton Wilder's Our Town. Before it became the second Circle in the Square Theatre, the company's new home was first a movie house followed by the original Amato Opera House. It was built by and operated by Italian-Americans, which was typical of the South Village in the late 19th/early 20th centuries. Many of these theaters in the South Village were, like the second Circle in the Square, built or altered from other types of existing structures. This location allowed productions to be staged in a theater in the round format, with a long jutting stage flanked by seats on both sides. In 1963 Theodore Mann invited Paul Libin to join the Circle in the Square, as its managing director. Designed by architect Alan Sayles, the present home of the company is one of two theatres in the Paramount Plaza office tower. Its much bigger sibling is the Gershwin Theatre. The theatre entrance lobbies are side by side but separated by a wall. It is designed to reflect the theatres of ancient Greece and Rome and is the only Broadway theatre that has a vomitorium, which is sometimes used as an entrance and exit for the actors. The Gershwin and Circle in the Square were built in 1970 when the Uris Brothers tore down the Capitol Theatre to build the tower (with the Gershwin originally being called the Uris Theatre). Their first production on Broadway, a revival of Mourning Becomes Electra, opened on November 15, 1972. The theatre is below street level. It is one of only two Broadway houses with a thrust stage (the other is Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater). The theatre operated as a non-profit, subscription supported producing house for the next 25 years, continuing its tradition of introducing new talent while presenting powerful productions of classic plays and new works. But after a series of poor critical and financial returns, the company filed for bankruptcy in 1997. The theatre reopened in 1999, now operating as an independent commercial receiving house. Circle in the Square Theatre School, started by Theodore Mann in 1961, is the only accredited training conservatory associated with a Broadway theatre. The School, which offers two-year training programs in acting and musical theatre is located in studios within the theatre. As a tribute to founder Theodore Mann (who passed away in 2012), his son Jonathan created and directed Teens on Broadway, a diversity and access initiative at Circle in the Square for NYC area youth seeking careers in theater. Through 2016 Teens on Broadway enabled over 1,000 teens from 20 public performing arts schools to perform on a Broadway stage and learn about the paths to beginning a career in the industry. Partners included American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League. Teens on Broadway built on Theodore Mann's long-term commitment to diversity, demonstrated by Circle in the Square's international 1969 production of Trumpets of The Lord, based on Gods Trombone by James Weldon Johnson (with a book by Vinnette Carroll); by casting James Earl Jones to play Hickey in the Circle's 1973 production of The Iceman Cometh; and by casting Raul Julia in Abbott & Loesser's Where's Charley (1974), Coward's Design for Living (1984) and Shaw's Arms and The Man (1985). . The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It does not plan on opening until January 3, 2021.

Produced by Barney A. Sarecky and directed by Lee Sholem, it stars George Reeves as Superman and Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane. It is the first feature film based on any DC Comics character. The film's storyline concerns reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane arriving in the small town of Silsby to witness the drilling of the world's deepest oil well. The drill, however, has penetrated the underground home of a race of small, bald humanoids who, out of curiosity, climb to the surface at night. They glow in the dark, which scares the local townfolk, who form a mob intent on killing the strange visitors. Only Superman can intervene to prevent a tragedy. Plot Clark Kent and Lois Lane arrive in the small town of Silsby to report on the world's deepest oil well. That night two small, furry, bald-headed humanoids come up through the shaft and scare the elderly night watchman to death. Lois and Clark arrive at the oil well and find the dead watchman. Clark and the foreman explore the surrounding area for signs of foul play when Lois glimpses one of the creatures and screams. No one believes her when she tells them what she saw. The medical examiner is summoned, and he later leaves with Lois. Clark stays behind to confront the foreman, who confesses that the well was closed for fear that they had struck radium and not oil. The foreman proceeds to show Clark ore samples that were collected during different stages of drilling; all of them glow brightly. Meanwhile the two Mole Men innocently explore the town. The residents become terrified because of their peculiar appearance and because everything that they touch glows in the dark (due to simple phosphorescence). Soon an angry mob forms, led by the violent Luke Benson, in order to kill the \\"monsters\\". Superman stops Benson and the mob and saves one of the creatures after it has been shot. He takes it to the hospital. The second creature returns to the well head and disappears down its shaft. A doctor announces that the injured creature will die unless he has surgery to remove the bullet. When a nurse refuses to do so out of fear, Clark volunteers to assist. Benson's mob arrives at the hospital demanding that the creature be turned over to them. Superman stands guard outside the hospital. Lois stands at his side, but a shot is fired from the mob, narrowly missing her. Superman sends her inside and relieves the mob of their rifles and pistols. Three more Mole Men emerge from the drill shaft, this time bearing a strange weapon. They make their way to the hospital. Benson and his mob see the creatures, and Benson goes after them alone. The creatures fire their laser-like weapon at him. Superman jumps in front of the pulsating ray, saving Benson's life, which Superman says \\"is more than you deserve!\\". Superman fetches the wounded creature from the hospital and carries him as his companions return to the well head. Soon after, from deep underground, the Mole Men destroy the drill shaft, making certain that no one can come up or go down it ever again. Lois observes, \\"It's almost as if they were saying, 'You live your lives ... and we'll live ours'\\".

Both have been considered retrospectively as the product of (and a reaction to) the \\"Red Scare\\" of post- World War II era. Grossman also cites the later film The Mole People (1956). Production Superman and the Mole Men was the first theatrical feature film based on any DC Comics character.Superman and the Mole Men is the first theatrical feature film based on any DC Comics character. Previously, two live-action, multiple chapter movie serials were made by Columbia Pictures Inc., based on the Superman comics feature and radio program, featuring Kirk Alyn as Superman and Noel Neill as Lois Lane, had been shown in weekly installments in movie theaters. Two additional serials based on DC's Batman, the first featuring Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin/Dick Grayson, and the second featuring Robert Lowery as Batman and Johnny Duncan as Robin/Dick Grayson, were also made by Columbia (1943 and 1949). The original screenplay was by \\"Richard Fielding\\", a pseudonym for Robert Maxwell and Whitney Ellsworth. Superman and the Mole Men was filmed in a little more than 12 days starting on July 10, 1951Ames, Walter. Los Angeles Times. July 6, 1951. at RKO-Pathe Studios. The feature runs just 58 minutes and originally served as a trial balloon release for the syndicated Adventures of Superman TV series, for which it became the only two-part episode, \\"The Unknown People\\". Some elements of the original film were trimmed when converted for television, including some portions of a lengthy chase scene and all references to \\"Mole Men\\". The theme music used for the film had a generic \\"science fiction sound\\", with nothing suggesting a specific Superman theme. The title cards were similarly generic, with low-grade animation of comets sailing by Saturn-like ringed planets. The original film score by Darrell Calker was removed when Superman and the Mole Men was re-cut into the two-part Superman TV episode and replaced with the \\"canned\\" production library music used in the first season of the series. The laser-like weapon of the Mole Men, which they retrieve from their subterranean home in order to defend themselves and rescue their injured comrade, was a prop made by adding metal shoulder braces to one end of an Electrolux vacuum cleaner body; for the ray's \\"gun barrel\\" a standard metal funnel was attached to the other. The image of actors Reeves and Coates on the theatrical release poster is a painting derived by reversing (\\"flopping\\") a publicity photograph image of the two actors, with Superman's \\"S shield\\" emblem then reversed in order for it to read correctly. Home media Superman and the Mole Men was first released on VHS and LaserDisc by Warner Home Video on July 22, 1988, coinciding with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Superman character that year. Both the two-part TV episode and the full feature are on the 2005 first season DVD release for Adventures of Superman. During 2006, the film was released as a bonus feature on the DVD 4-Disc Special Edition of Superman: The Movie. Superman and the Mole Men received a Blu-ray box set release in 2011. In 2017 Cheezy Movies released it on DVD. References * Warren, Bill. Keep Watching the Skies: American Science Fiction Films of the Fifties, 21st Century Edition.

In 1917, he opposed the creation of a committee to deal with women's suffrage. Walsh thought the creation of a committee would be yielding to \\"the nagging of iron-jawed angels\\" and referred to the women picketing Woodrow Wilson's White House (the Silent Sentinels) as \\"bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair.\\" It is from this that the film Iron Jawed Angels gets its name.

It premiered on June 13, 2003, serving as the series finale. The movie drew an audience of 5.1 million viewers. Plot Louis Stevens interrupts his older sister Ren's junior high graduation with a remote-controlled beachball meant to be full of confetti, unaware that his sidekick Beans has filled it with spaghetti, which spills on the school's gym teacher Coach Tugnut as the beachball explodes. Meanwhile, Ren breaks up with her boyfriend Gil, so she takes a job babysitting Beans. After Ren and Louis get into a fight and accidentally hurt a stranger named Miles McDermott, he talks the Stevens family and Beans into going on a vacation, which is the set of a new reality TV show called Family Fakeout. It is set on the fictional island of Mandelino, which in reality is only a short distance off the California coast. Louis accidentally destroys the sacred palace the family was meant to spend their vacation in, making the island's natives shun them and forcing them to live on their own. The family separates into two groups pitted against each other. Both groups encounter various situations, such as facing starvation and a \\"killer squirrel.\\" Ren seeks solace with a native named Mootai and they fall in love. Mootai is actually an actor named Jason who is supposed to romance Ren merely to boost ratings, but he is genuinely interested in her. Louis' best friend Twitty and girlfriend Tawny come to the island to rescue them. Twitty is caught by the show's staff, but he escapes and shuts down the equipment monitoring the Stevens groups. Louis' older brother Donnie finds Tawny, and the newly- reconstituted family comes together and learns the truth. They unite with Twitty and Tawny to stop Ren from killing Louis because she believes he sold her and her new boyfriend out after being told by one of the island's natives. Ren corners him on a cliff, and despite the protests of the family and Miles, who tells her the truth, she pushes him off to his apparent death, much to the viewers' and Miles' horror. As Miles breaks down in guilt, a helicopter from another reality show, Gotcha, appears and says that Louis is safe and that the Stevens had tricked Miles; they planned a charade to get back at him for what he had done to them. Lance LeBow, the host of the TV show, \\"Gotcha\\", informs Miles that he is no longer a host of his own show because of his torments. He is then chased away by the Stevens family. Louis tells Ren that as his sister, he loves messing with her, but he would never do anything to hurt her. He then suggests she start a relationship with Jason back on the mainland. Jason comes and apologizes to Ren for stringing her along, but she forgives him and says she understood he was just doing his job as an actor. Jason confesses that when he told her he loved her, he wasn't acting and his feelings were real. After the family returns home and Beans pops up to disrupt their dinner yet again, Ren and Louis argue about who let Beans in the house.

From May to September 1942 he served as Martin Bormann's representative on General Walter von Unruh's staff, seeking to mobilize for total war and replenish losses of manpower. In this capacity, he traveled widely through the occupied eastern territories, including the General Government, Ostland and Ukraine. Hoffmann advised Hitler on the Holocaust. He gave insights into actions of the Einsatzgruppen murders and on the death camps of Operation Reinhard, on which he spoke at the Reich Chancellery. He made suggestions for improvement, or Verbesserungsvorschl√§gen, to Hitler and Joseph Goebbels. \\"In the course of the travel of the DB by the \\"eastern territories\\", Hoffmann won deep insights in the extermination of the Jews, Germanization policies, and the brutal measures to recruit \\"Eastern workers.\\" To leading representatives of the \\"Final Solution\\", including the General Governor of Poland, Hans Frank, and Odilo Globocnik, head of Operation Reinhard. He had to portray the work processes and \\"successes\\" of their campaigns. In his reports to Bormann, who came to discuss it with Goebbels and Hitler, Hoffmann forged the image of a ruthless occupation policy. (trans. from German)http://www.historisches-centrum.de/index.php?id=284 On 26 January 1943 Hoffmann was appointed Acting Gauleiter of Westphalia-South, when Paul Giesler took up new duties in Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria. At the same time, Hoffmann also was made Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. On 1 August he was named to the Prussian State Council. On 9 November he was promoted to SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer. In December of the same year, Hoffmann was appointed Deputy to Joseph Goebbels in his capacity as Reich Inspector for Civil Aerial Warfare Measures. On 17 April 1944, Hofmann was made permanent Gauleiter of Westphalia-South. On 25 September 1944 he was placed in command of the Volksturm units in his jurisdiction. In October he was named Reich Defense Commissioner for the Rhine and Ruhr regions. Hoffmann, who did not enjoy widespread popularity even within Hitler's inner circle ranks owing to his arrogance and bossy manner, was said to have been a staunch National Socialist right through to the war's end. Shortly before the war ended, as Allied troops were invading his jurisdiction, he ordered the destruction of numerous bridges and other infrastructure. Finally, on 13 April 1945, Hoffmann dissolved his Gau staff and the Volkssturm organization in Westphalia-South and went into hiding. Post-war trial, conviction, and sentence Hoffmann was finally discovered and arrested by British troops on 4 October 1945. He testified as a witness to atrocities in the Nuremberg Trials and was later himself charged in connection with the murders of Allied soldiers and foreign forced labourers. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. However, he was then tried by a German De-Nazification Court and received a prison sentence of 4 years and 9 months, only part of which he served, receiving a pardon. Later life and family After his release in April 1950, Hoffmann earned considerable assets as an entrepreneur in Bremen. Hoffmann was married. His son Bolko Hoffmann is likewise a successful entrepreneur and the founder of the Pro DM Party, a rightwing, conservative political party in Germany whose main policy is to campaign for the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark.

The exam includes several parts: *position/lighting/draping *inspection *palpation *motion The latter three steps are often remembered with the saying look, feel, move. History taking Before performing a physical examination of the knee joint, a comprehensive history should be asked. A thorough history can be helpful in locating the possible pathological site during the physical examination. The mechanism of injury, location, character of the knee pain, the presence of a \\"pop\\" sound at the time of the injury (indicates ligamentous tear or fracture), swelling, infections, ability to stand or walk, sensation of instability (suggestive of subluxation), or any previous traumatic injuries to the joint are all important historical features. The most common knee problems are: soft tissue inflammation, injury, or osteoarthritis. The mechanism of the knee injury can give a clue of the possible structures that can be injured. For example, applying valgus stress on the knee can cause medial collateral ligament rupture, meanwhile a varus force can cause lateral collateral ligament rupture. When a person suddenly slows down during running, twisting, or pivoting with valgus force applying on the knee, the anterior cruciate ligament can rupture. Posterior dislocation of the tibia can cause posterior cruciate ligament injury. Twisting and pivoting while bearing weight can cause tearing of the meniscus. Fractures of the knee are less common but should be considered if direct trauma to the knee has occurred such as during a fall. Examples of fractures involving knee joints are: tibial plateau fractures, fractures of the lateral condyle of femur, medial condyle of femur, and patellar fractures. For non-traumatic causes of knee pain, history such as fever, morning stiffness, pain after exercise, infections, history of gout or psoriasis, and previous activities that contributes to long-term overuse of the knee joint should be asked. Knee pain due to long-term overuse are reproducible. For example, repetitive jumping can cause inflammation of patellar tendon. Repetitive kneeling can cause prepatellar inflammation of synovial bursa. General examination Physical examination of the knee begins by observing the person's gait to assess for any abnormalities seen while walking. Gait assessment can be used to differentiate genuine knee pain or pain which referred from hip, lower back or the foot. A person can be asked to perform a duckwalk. This requires the person to squat and walk in that position. In order to perform a duckwalk, the person has to be free of ligamentous tear, knee effusions, and meniscal tears. The person can also be asked to stand with both feet stuck together. This position is useful to observe for valgus or varus deformity of the knees which is suggestive of osteoarthritis. The circumference of each thigh can be measured to look for wasting of quadriceps muscles. Skin around the knee can also be observed for psoriasis, hematoma, rash, abrasions, lacerations, or cellulitis which could be important causes of the knee pathology. Palpation Palpation of the knee should begin from the unaffected side first. This will reassure the patient and is useful for comparison with the affected knee. The back of the hand can be used to assess the warmth of the knee. The knee is then flexed 90 degrees and the anterior structures are assessed. Inflammation of the patellar tendon is present if the patellar tendon is painful upon palpation. Radiographic imaging should be done if the examination findings fulfills the Ottawa rules: age 55 years and older, pain at the head of fibula, patellar pain, unable to flex the knee to 90 degrees, and inability to stand and walk at least four steps. If anterior cruciate ligament injury is suspected, radiographic imaging should also be ordered because it is frequently associated with lateral tibial plateau fracture. If there is a painful, reddish, and warm swelling in front of the patella, acute prepatellar bursitis should be considered which may require aspiration or drainage. Those presented with these features usually had history of frequent kneeling and direct trauma over the knee. Pain, swelling, and a defect of the insertion of the quadriceps tendon into the superior part of the patella is suggestive of quadriceps tendon rupture. A \\"pop\\" sound may be associated with this injury, followed by the loss of the ability to straighten the knee (knee extension). Pain at the medial joint line (medial to the inferior border of the patella) indicates medial compartment osteoarthritis, injury to the medial collateral ligament, or a medial meniscal tear. Pain at the midpoint between the anterior part of the medial joint line and tibial tuberosity is suggestive of Pes anserine bursitis (inflammation of anserine bursa. Lateral joint line tenderness is associated with lateral compartment osteoarthritis, lateral collateral ligament injury, and lateral meniscal tear. Pain at the lateral femoral condyle is suggestive of iliotibial band syndrome. Swelling at the popliteal fossa may reveal a Baker's cyst. Motion =Assessment of effusion= The absence of normal grooves around patella may indicates a patellar intra-articular effusion. There are two ways to confirm the effusion. The knee is extended fully before the examination begins. This first way is the patellar tap. It is to squeeze the fluid between the patella and the femur by pressing at the medial patella using a non- dominant hand. Then, using the dominant hand to press on the patella vertically. If the patella is ballotable, then patellar intra-articular effusion is present. Another way is the milking of the patella. First, the effusion is milked at the medial border of the patella from inferior to superior aspect. Then, using another hand, the effusion is milked at the lateral border of the patella from superior to inferior aspect. If effusion is present, a bulge will be appear at the medial border of the patella because the effusion is milked back to the medial patella. =Assessment of range of motion= Both the active and passive range of motion should be assessed. The normal knee extension is between 0 to 10 degrees. The normal knee flexion is between 130 to 150 degrees. Any pain, abnormal movement, or crepitus of the patella should be noted. If there is pain or crepitus during active extension of the knee, while the patella is being compressed against the patellofemoral groove, patellofemoral pain syndrome or chondromalacia patellae should be suspected. Pain with active range of motion but no pain during passive range of motion is suggestive of inflammation of the tendon. Pain during active and passive range of motion is suggestive of pathology in the knee joint. =Assessment of collateral ligaments= Valgus stress test can be performed with the examined knee in 25 degrees flexion to determine the integrity of the medial collateral ligament. Similarly, varus stress test can be performed to access the integrity of the lateral collateral ligament. The degree of collateral ligament sprain can also be assessed during the valgus and varus tests. In a first degree tear, the ligament has less than 5 mm laxity with a definite resistance when the knee is pulled. In a second degree sprain, there is laxity when the knee is tested at 25 degrees of flexion, but no laxity at extension with a definite resistance when the knee is pulled. In a third degree tear, there will be 10 mm laxity with no definite resistance either with knee with full extension or flexion. =Assessment of anterior cruciate ligament= The anterior drawer and Lachman tests can be used to access the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament. In the anterior drawer test, the person being examined should lie down on their back (supine position) with the knee in 90 degrees flexion. The foot is secured on the bed with the examiner sitting on the foot. The tibia is then pulled forward by using both hands. If the anterior movement of the affected knee is greater than the unaffected knee, then the anterior drawer test is positive. The Lachman test is more sensitive than the anterior drawer test. For the Lachman test, the person lies down in supine position with the knee flexed at 20 degrees and the heel touching the bed. The tibia is then pulled forward. If there is 6 to 8 millimeters of laxity, with no definitive resistance when the knee is pulled, then the test is positive thus raising concern for a torn anterior cruciate ligament. A large collection of blood in the knee can be associated with bony fractures and cruciate ligament tear. =Assessment of posterior cruciate ligament= Posterior drawer test and tibial sag tests can determine the integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament. Similar to anterior drawer test, the knee should be flexed 90 degrees and the tibia is pushed backwards. If the tibia can be pushed posteriorly, then the posterior drawer test is positive. In tibial sag test, both knees are flexed at 90 degrees with the person in supine position and bilateral feet touching the bed. Bilateral knees are then watch for posterior displacement of tibia. If the affected tibia slowly displaced posteriorly, the posterior cruciate ligament is affected. =Assessment of meniscus= Those with meniscal injuries may report symptoms such as clicking, catching, or locking of knees. Apart from joint line tenderness, there are three other methods of accessing meniscus tear: the McMurray test, the Thessaly test, and the Apley grind test. In McMurray test, the person should lie down in supine position with the knee should in 90 degrees flexion. the examiner put one hand with the thumb and the index finger on the medial and lateral joint lines respectively. Another hand is used to control the heel. To test the medial meniscus, the hand at the heel applies a valgus force and external rotates the leg while extending the knee. To test for the lateral meniscus, the varus force, internal rotation are applied to the leg while extending the knee. Any clicking, popping, or catching at the respective joint line indicates the corresponding meniscal tear. In Apley compression test, the person lie down in prone position with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. One hand is used to stabilise the hip and another hand grasp the foot and apply a downward compression force while external and internal rotates the leg. Pain during compression indicates meniscal tear. Examination for anterior cruciate ligament tear should be done for those with meniscal tear because these two conditions often occurs together. =Additional Tests= *Clarke's test may be used to examine for patello-femoral pain *The Wilson test is a test used to detect the presence of osteochondritis dissecans in the knee.

Fossils of the dinosaur were found in the Los Colorados Formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni√≥n Basin in northwestern Argentina. Although a full skeleton has not yet been discovered, Zupaysaurus can be considered a bipedal predator, up to long. It may have had two parallel crests running the length of its snout.  Discovery  left Discovered in May 1997 by Santiago Reuil (\\"Vultur\\"), part of the crew of Guillermo Rougier, it was later described by Arcucci and Coria and published in 2003. The name Zupaysaurus is composed of the Quechua word supay meaning \\"devil\\" and the Greek word sauros (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"lizard\\"; thus \\"devil lizard\\". In Incan mythology, supay was both the god of death and ruler of the ukhu pacha, the Incan underworld. The type species was named Z. rougieri in the honor of Guillermo Rougier, the scientist who led the expedition which discovered and collected the holotype (original specimen) PULR-076. Zupaysaurus was first described and named in the scientific journal Ameghiniana by Argentine paleontologists Andrea Arcucci and Rodolfo Coria in 2003.  Description  Skull diagram Zupaysaurus was a medium-sized theropod. An adult skull, measured approximately in length, suggesting a body length of approximately from its snout to the tip of its tail. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave a length of 6 meters (20 ft) and a weight of 250 kg (550 lbs). In 2016 it was given a much smaller size of 4.2 meters (14 ft) and 70 kg (154 lbs). Like all theropods, Zupaysaurus walked only on its hindlegs, leaving its forelimbs free to grasp its prey. The length of the neck bones recovered suggests that this genus has a rather long neck. Like the coelophysoids, Zupaysaurus has a kink in its snout, between the premaxillary and maxillary bones of the upper jaw. It is estimated that Zupaysaurus had 24 teeth and an intermandibular hinge is present in the lower jaw.Arcucci, A.B. & Coria R.A. 2003. A new Triassic carnivorous dinosaur from Argentina. Ameghiniana 40(2):217-228. Only one specimen of Zupaysaurus is known to science. The holotype specimen was designated PULR-076, which consists of a nearly complete skull which was very well preserved, the right shoulder girdle, the lower right leg and ankle, and twelve vertebrae from the neck, back, and hips. Additional material of a smaller individual found at the same site may or may not belong to Zupaysaurus. As Zupaysaurus was originally described, the head bore two thin parallel crests on top of the skull, similar to theropods like Dilophosaurus and Coelophysis kayentakatae. These crests are thought to have been formed by the nasal bones solely, unlike those of many other theropods which also incorporated the lacrimal bones. Crests on the skull were pervasive among theropods and may have been used for communicative purposes such as species or gender recognition.Currie, P.J. & Zhao X. 1993. A new carnosaur (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Jurassic of Xinjiang, People's Republic of China. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 30: 2037-2081. However, more recent analysis of the skull has cast doubt on the presence of these crests in Zupaysaurus. An unpublished abstract presented at a recent conference indicated the structures initially identified as crests were in fact the lacrimal bones displaced upwards during the process of fossilization.Ezcurra, M.D. & Novas, F.E. 2005. Phylogenetic relationships of the Triassic theropod *Zupaysaurus rougieri* from NW Argentina. Presented in August 2005 during the II Latin American Congress of Vertebrate Paleontology in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This analysis will be published in peer-reviewed print form later in 2006. A summary of the talk can be seen here. Other cranial ornamentation included a rugose laterally-projecting lacrimal ridge on the top of the skull. Life restoration of Zupaysaurus in a resting pose A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra (2006) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), Zupaysaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the maxillary fenestra is within the antorbital fossa (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the rostral process of the lacrimal is ventrally bowed (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the ventral process of the squamosal is kinked (according to Ezcurra, 2006), wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (according to Ezcurra, 2006). The maxillary-jugal ventral margin describes an obtuse angle in lateral view (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a notch on the dorsal margin of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal ramus of the lacrimal is rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the ascending process of the maxilla; (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a lacrimal with a highly pneumatized antorbital recess (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a short and square-shaped retroarticular process of the mandible (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), the cnemial crest is poorly developed (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006).  Classification  Zupaysaurus was classified as the earliest known tetanuran theropod due to several features of its skull, dentition, and hindlimb. However, several features typical of more basal theropods were also noted by the original authors. Analyses by Carano (2005), Tykoski (2005), and Ezcurra and Novas (2005) have classified Zupaysaurus as a coelophysoid related to Segisaurus and probably Liliensternus, though more basal than Coelophysis.Carrano, M.T., Hutchinson, J.R., & Sampson, S.D. 2005.

Global correlation of the Triassic theropod record. Gaia 15: 63-74. [not printed until 2000] Both specimens assigned to this genus are housed in the collection of the National University of La Rioja in La Rioja, Argentina. The Los Colorados Formation was interpreted as an ancient floodplain and it was home to several types of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs (including Riojasaurus, Coloradisaurus , and Lessemsaurus), all of which shared the same paleoenvironment with Zupaysaurus. It is recognized as one of the earliest known faunal assemblages dominated by dinosaurs, which were 43% of the number of tetrapod species currently known. The non-dinosaurs that inhabited this locality included pseudosuchians, therapsids like Cynodontia, other early reptiles, and possible archosaurs.

The directors of the line and the chief engineer were greeted by leading inhabitants and then went in procession to the old coaching inn, the White Hart, for a champagne lunch. The station buildings were designed by architects Weightman and Hadfield. A substantial stone frontage with full-height portico with 4 attached Roman Ionic columns and triple arcade with moulded round arches. The MS&LR; became the Great Central Railway (GCR) on 1 August 1897, which in turn amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at the end of 1922. The LNER inherited two stations in Gainsborough, and to distinguish them, the ex-GCR station was renamed Gainsborough Central in September 1923. The station buildings were demolished in 1975, leaving just the two platforms and a footbridge over the two railway lines. Weekday passenger services (which had been thrice-daily each way between Sheffield and since the early 1980s)GB National Rail Timetable May 1984 Edition, Table 29 were withdrawn by British Rail in October 1993 leaving only three trains in each direction running on Saturdays.Friends of the Brigg & Lincoln LineCampaign for Better Transport; Retrieved 6 March 2015Northern Rail Timetable 32: Sheffield - Retford - Lincoln/Cleethorpes Northernrail.org; retrieved 7 March 2015 In the Strategic Rail Authority's 2002/3 financial year, only 5 fare-paying people (excluding season ticket holders) boarded trains at Gainsborough Central station, and 3 disembarked, making it the least busy station in Great Britain, alongside Barry Links.The usage information (Station Entries and Station Exits) is based on ticket sales in the financial year 2002/03 and covers all National Rail stations.

The 2004/05 figures suggested 21 passengers used the station that year, putting it slightly above Watford West, a station closed since 1996 and on a line which is currently missing both track and bridges. The line through the station was upgraded and refurbished in 2008 by contractors Arup and Carillon to allow it to carry increased levels of freight traffic from the port complex at Immingham to South Yorkshire and the East Midlands.Brigg Line Freight Enhancements Arup press release; Retrieved 2 March 2015 This was done to reduce congestion on the busy route via Scunthorpe. Meanwhile, the Friends of the Brigg and Lincoln Line, who come under the umbrella of the Lincolnshire Branch of Railfuture, was campaigning for the introduction of regular weekday services. This was finally achieved in May 2019 when Northern introduced an hourly service between Gainsborough Central and Sheffield on weekdays and Saturdays, the most regular service the station has received since 1849. Although it falls outside Northern's franchise commitments, the operator agreed to run the service without extra subsidy, with West Lindsey District Council agreeing to fund improvements to the station and signage. The new services utilise trains and crew which would otherwise have waited 40 minutes at Retford. Stopping at all stations, it now allows the Lincoln to Sheffield service to run non-stop between Worksop and Sheffield as part of the new Northern Connect network. Just eight months later however, the regular service was suspended again due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, with no confirmed date of when services will restart. Location Gainsborough Central station is situated close to Gainsborough steel stock holders (since moved) and the new Marshalls Yard Shopping Centre. In late 2008, a new car park was opened next to the station, however this is only for permit holders. Good access is available even for the disabled. Services As of May 2019, Gainsborough Central is served by an hourly Monday-Saturday service to via and . On Saturdays, there are also 3 trains that continue to . The station is not served by trains during the evenings (after approx 19:15) or on Sundays. However, passengers can use the nearby Station which continues to operate at these times.

Biography Philadelphia native Adam Dorn is the son of renowned jazz and R'n'B producer Joel Dorn. He grew up around the jazz and R&B; discs his father produced for Atlantic Records in the '60s and '70s. As a 15-year-old, he sent a fan letter to bassist Marcus Miller. When Miller responded, inviting Dorn to come by the studio, one visit turned into three years hanging around artists David Sanborn, Luther Vandross and Miles Davis. Dorn is a bass player and vocalist. He studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Dorn adopted the Mocean Worker moniker as a DJ of drum 'n' bass music. The project came about almost by accident, the results of a series of half-serious recording sessions. Since the release of his first album, Home Movies from the Brain Forest, the style has varied from a drum 'n' bass sound to a jazz-oriented dance sound that some call Electro- Swing, incorporating elements of funk, big-band and swing. Dorn currently resides in Los Angeles after living in New York City for the better part of 25 years. In 2008, Dorn led an eight piece band, which featured some of New York City's most revered soul and funk players. Assembled by Dorn to bring to life the \\"breakbeat jazz\\" stylings of the Mocean Worker studio albums, the group gave a series of high-profile performances, including Bumbershoot, Burlington Discover Jazz Festival and a residency at NYC venue Nublu. Dorn's music has been used extensively in TV, advertising and film, including \\"Tres Tres Chic\\" in The Devil Wears Prada and The Pink Panther, \\"Chick a Boom Boom Boom\\" in Inside Deep Throat, \\"Reykjavak\\" in The Namesake, and \\"Right Now\\" in Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Elliot Spitzer. He also scored the Showtime/BBC film documentary about the life of comedian/actor Richard Pryor entitled Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic. Additionally, his song \\"Intothinair\\" from the album Aural and Hearty was featured in the film The Bourne Supremacy. In early 2014 Dorn and partner Charlie Hunter launched the podcast Compared To What featuring conversations with a wide variety of people. There has also been a sudden interest in the Japanese market for Mocean Worker's sound. In February 2014 Dorn released an album featuring some new and unreleased material entitled It's Pronounced Motion... in Japan through the Voil label.

Guitarist Wolf Hoffmann later remembered the debut as simply a collection of songs the band had worked up over their formative years, with no real focus: \\"We were just playing songs that we had always played.

He did however manage to visit the battle areas of New Guinea on a four-month scientific mission for the Australian Army. Antarctic exploration He spent the first of many summers in Antarctica in 1947-8 as a senior research officer on ANARE. He soon became director due to his strong belief in the value of management and educational techniques that ensured that each individual had more than one role.

The station opened in 1873 and is located on the Tczew‚ÄìKostrzyn railway, Dzia≈Çdowo‚ÄìChojnice railway, Chojnice‚ÄìRunowo Pomorskie railway, Chojnice‚ÄìKo≈õcierzyna railway and Ole≈õnica‚ÄìChojnice railway. The train services are operated by Przewozy Regionalne and Arriva RP. History The railway reached Chojnice in 1871 as part of the Prussian Eastern Railway between Berlin, Danzig and K√∂nigsberg. At the time Chojnice only had 3,000 inhabitants. This route was chosen as it did not involve routes through any big cities. Chojnice become a hub from 15 November 1877, after construction of the line to Czluchow, extended a year later to Szczecinek. In 1883 the line from Chojnice to Tuchola was opened. In 1894 the line from Nak≈Ço nad NoteciƒÖ to Chojnice opened and in 1902 Chojnice received a direct connection to Koscierzyna. Because of heavy snowfall in October 1908, the Chojnice - Pi≈Ça route was suspended for a few days. In the first decade of the twentieth century, due to the planned increase in the importance of the role of the Chojnice - Czersk section, it was decided to expand the line to four tracks. Improvemenets on the line to Tuchola were planned but the work was not completed. From 1920 the Polish-German border ran just west of Chojnice and the station was the border crossing, located on the route between the Reich and East Prussia. On 1 September 1939, while defending Chojnice, a railway viaduct was blown up. In 1945 Germany attached great importance to the defense of Chojnice, due to the existing railway junction. During the communist era, despite the announced plans, Chojnice was not electrified. On 1 April 1991, together with the closure of the roundhouse in Ko≈õcierzyna, the service of passenger steam traction ended. In 1992 the first series of SA101 railcars were introduced between Ko≈õcierzyna and Gdynia were introduced. These later proved to be too small and were transferred to other lines which used steam trains, including Chojnice - Ko≈õcierzyna. In March 2001, thanks to the intervention and funding from the local government of Pomerania the Chojnice - Ko≈õcierzyna line was rescued from closure. In 2007 the first Arriva RP train left the Chojnice station.

Biography Kirino is the middle child of three. She has two brothers, one who is six years older and one who is five years younger. Her father was an architect. Kirino has lived in many different cities, including her current residence, Tokyo. Kirino married in 1975 and had a daughter in 1981. She earned a law degree in 1974 from Seikei University, and she dabbled in many fields of work before settling on being a writer. For example, not knowing what she wanted to do in life, Kirino began working at the Iwanami Hall movie theater in her early twenties. She soon discovered it wasn't right for her and just before her thirtieth birthday she started taking scriptwriting classes. It wasn't until she was in her thirties that she began to seriously think about becoming a writer, and it wasn't until her forties that she became popular as a writer. Literary career Kirino began her writing career in 1984 when she first started off composing novels in the romantic genre. However, these types of novels were not popular in Japan, so she found it difficult to make a living while writing them. She also did not have a passion for writing romance novels and wanted to concentrate on works focusing on the psychological aspect of crimes. She then turned her focus towards writing mystery novels in the early 1990s. To date, she has written several short story collections and many novels, and is now one of Japan's most popular writers. She is most famous for her 1997 novel, Out, which received the Mystery Writers of Japan Award, Japan's top mystery award, and was a finalist (in English translation) for the 2004 Edgar Award. In addition, Kirino received the 1993 Edogawa Rampo Prize for mystery fiction for her debut novel, Kao ni Furikakaru Ame (Rain Falling on My Face), and the 1999 Naoki Prize for her novel Yawarakana hoho (Soft Cheeks). So far, four of her novels (Out, Grotesque, Real World, and The Goddess Chronicle, the last of which was written for the Canongate Myth Series) have been translated into English, with Out being the first. A further novel, In is scheduled for publication in 2013. In spite of writing in stories in the genre, Kirino does not particularly like mysteries. As far as influential books from her childhood, Kirino cites Two Years' Vacation, The Three Musketeers, and Little Women as favorites. She also feels that her vices are things such as laziness, wastefulness, and being too emotional. However, she says that if she were to try to correct these traits, she would lose her ability to write novels. Kirino enjoys reading, seeing, and tasting the creative work of other people, as well as contemplating ideas for her next novels. Many critics challenged and criticized Kirino for her storylines, especially for Out, by saying women should only be writing love stories. In fact, one male radio host refused to talk with her because of the fact she wrote about a husband being murdered by his own wife. However, her fiction has been mirrored by reality with an increasing number of bizarre murders in Japan such as the woman who in 2007 murdered her husband, dismembered his body, and dumped the parts across Tokyo. Writing style and themes Kirino's works, such as Out, asks the reader what he/she would do if something awful happened to her/him. By writing novels that people can relate to, Kirino hopes her novels can help her readers through hard times and be comforted. She has apparently been successful in reaching readers emotionally; for example Kirino was approached by a woman who thanked her for the liberation she felt after reading Out. Her work is reminiscent of American hardboiled detective stories, but her use of multiple narratives and perspectives provide \\"no authoritative master narrative . . . that finally reassures the reader which of the many voices one is to trust\\". Her prose style has been described as \\"flat,\\" \\"functional,\\" and \\"occasionally illuminated by a strange lyricism.\\" Unlike most hardboiled fiction, Kirino's novels often feature a female protagonist such as her detective Miro Murano, who complicates the typical hardboiled role of females by becoming both detective and victim. By doing this, Kirino \\"implicates [the reader] in the voyeuristic pleasure of the detective genre by making [the reader] conscious of [the] act of watching.\\" Kirino said she is fascinated by human nature and what makes someone with a completely clean record suddenly turn into a criminal. In addition to comparisons with hardboiled crime fiction, Kirino's work has been compared with horror fiction (the gruesome dismemberment scenes in Out, for example) and proletarian literature such as Kanik≈çsen. Kirino has noted that her work can be viewed as a portrait of contemporary Japanese life, contrasting it with the work of Haruki Murakami, who she feels writes more for a global audience, calling his work \\"global literature.\\" Critic Sophie Harrison has argued that Kirino presents a less-sanitized version of Japan, far from the stereotypical images of cherry blossoms and Hello Kitty, and deals with sordid subjects such as crime and prostitution in her work. Loneliness often seems to be a theme in her work, as is the idea that materialism and money have corrupted modern Japanese life, especially where family and romantic relationships are concerned. In fact, Out has been interpreted as \\"a cautionary tale of personal finance\\" and \\"a grim portrayal of Japan's underclasses, of its female characters' lives, and of the social, sexual, and economic injustice that they face.\\" In a 2003 interview with JapanReview.net, Kirino revealed the inspiration behind her dark themes and fast-moving plots. When asked what motivates her to write, Kirino said: ‚ÄúI am the type of person who always wants to be straightforward in dealing with my emotions, and my way of life, and my will. Because I am a complicated person, I can't otherwise work or live on a day-to-day basis in any sort of healthy manner.‚Äù As for the methodology behind her writing, if it is a piece that is to be read in one sitting, she quickly bores into the theme of the work; if it is serialized, then she engulfs herself in the information before splitting it into blocks. Kirino said that she considers herself a ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù writer who does not fit into a simple category. Her main motivation to write is to ‚Äúobserve the fabric of human relationships.‚Äù Most of Kirino's novels center upon women and crime. Typically, in her novels, such as Out, Kirino mainly focuses on women who do unimaginable things, which is why her books can be considered as ‚Äúfeminist noir.‚Äù She writes in a convincing, realistic type of way, which leads to the greatness of her work stemming from \\"her ability to put us inside the skins of these women.‚Äù This focus on more realistic portrayals of Japanese women seems to be a trademark of her work, found in many of her novels such as Grotesque. She is also committed to giving women recognition in Japanese literature, where they are often resigned to sexual and domestic roles. The author recounts how a young man once told her that until he read Out, he ‚Äúnever realized that regular middle aged women actually had a life.‚Äù Society, she says, takes advantage of powerless women and it is her goal to create empowered female characters to show readers the power of the ‚Äúweaker sex.‚Äù For these reasons, she has been called the \\"queen of Japanese crime.\\" In fact, the plot of Out has been described as a framework for her critique of \\"the problems of ordinary women in contemporary Japanese society.\\" Works in English translation ;Crime/thriller novels *Out (original title: Auto), trans. Stephen Snyder (New York: Kodansha, 2003; New York: Vintage, 2005) Significance of Title ‚Äì Kirino explains that the title Out has many meanings attached to it‚Äîout as in ‚Äúoff the path‚Äù or ‚Äúexit,‚Äù out as in ‚Äúno good,‚Äù and out as in ‚Äúoutside.‚Äù She believes there is ‚Äúa certain kind of freedom in being completely ‚Äòout.‚Äô If you go out one exit, there's another door, and if you open that, you don't know what awaits you\\" When asked about the broken bonds in the story, the author says she believes there is no such thing as society and that we are essentially solitary creatures. This becomes clear when people unconsciously release their true nature by committing deviant acts. The book's title clearly conveys the experience of being on the out-side of social groups. Reception - Out had an initial print run of 500,000 in Japan. Although Kirino received much criticism for her gruesome and disturbing scenes, Out sold a significantly large number of copies, won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award, and was even made into a film directed by Hideyuki Hirayama, which was released in 2002. According to Variety, New Line Cinema has purchased the rights for an American version, to be directed by Hideo Nakata. Research - Kirino researches her books for approximately six months. For Out, she visited a pathology autopsy class at a university but was not able to view a real corpse. Instead, she interviewed a pathologist and took notes on the details of their operations, such as wearing goggles while dismembering a body due to the flying shards of bone. ‚ÄúIn terms of that dismemberment scene,‚Äù Kirino says, ‚ÄúI actually was thinking about cooking while I was writing. When I later heard a doctor say that the description of my novel wasn't far off from the way they do it, I was quite relieved.‚Äù Regarding characters, none of hers are modeled after real people, and she stresses that her dark characters do not cast a negative light on her own personhood. Kirino also stated in an LA Weekly interview that \\"[While writing] Out, I wanted to understand the experience of [working] at a bento factory. An acquaintance of mine happened to know a person who worked at [one]. So for two nights, I worked the night shift. After that, I just had to escape.\\" *'Grotesque' (original title: Gurotesuku), trans. Rebecca L. Copeland (New York: Knopf, 2007) *Real World (original title: Riaru WƒÅrudo), trans.

Its vernacular name is Brown's peony, native peony or western peony. It is native to the western United States and usually grows at altitude, often as undergrowth in part-shade. The fleshy roots store food to carry the plant through the dry summers and produce new leaves and flowers the following spring.  Description  Paeonia brownii is a glaucous, summer hibernating, perennial herbaceous plant of 25‚Äì40 cm high with up to ten stems per plant, which grow from a large, fleshy root. Each pinkish stem is somewhat decumbent and has five to eight twice compound or deeply incised, bluish green, hearless, somewhat fleshy leaves which may develop purple-tinged edges when temperatures are low. The blades of the leaflets or segments are oval to inverted egg-shaped, 3-6 √ó 2‚Äì5 cm, with a clearly narrowed, stalk-like foot and an stump or rounded tip. The bisexual flowers are cup-shaped, 2‚Äì3 cm when open, nodding, and are set individually at the tip of a branching stem, and bloom for 9‚Äì15 days. Flowering occurs from March to June (mostly mid-April to mid-May). The five or six overlapping sepals are a purplish green, cupped, and oval or almost circular, persist after flowering. The five to ten circular petals are usually shorter than the sepals, and grade in colour from brownish- maroon at the base, via wine red to greenish or yellowish on the edge. Each flower has 60-100 yellow stamens, consisting of filaments of 3‚Äì5 mm, that are topped by anthers of 2‚Äì4 mm long. These open in succession from the inside out shedding yellow pollen, starting from the second day. A disc consisting of about twelve fleshy cone-shaped greenish-yellow lobes of 2¬Ω-3 mm high surrounds the two to six (mostly five) glabrous, initially yellow-green to ultimately yellow-red carpels, each having a short style topped by a curved stigma that forms a ridge. These are receptive during the first two days that the flower is open. Fertilised carpels mature into 2‚Äì4 cm long follicles that have become leathery when ripe. About four seeds develop per follicle, which are yellowish-brown to black, round to oval and 6‚Äì11 mm in diameter. As all diploid peonies, Paeonia brownii has ten chromosomes (2n=10). = Differences with related species = Brown's peony is most related to, and close in appearance to the California peony, with which it constitutes the section Onaepia. Common characters include having rather small drooping flowers, with small petals and a very prominent disk which usually consists of separate segments, while the seeds are cylindrical rather than ovoid. P. browniii can still be easily distinguished from P. californica however, the latter having 35‚Äì75 cm high stems bearing seven to twelve leaves which are green, while the leaflet blade gradually eases into the leaflet stalk or lacks such a stalk all together, and the finest lobes are lanceolate or narrowly elliptic. P. brownii is usually only 20‚Äì40 cm high, has six to eight glaucous leaves per stem that suddenly narrow at their base and the finest segments are egg-shaped. In P. californica the petals are egg-shaped, and about 1¬Ω-2¬Ω cm long, reaching beyond the sepals, while in P. brownii the petals are circular or wider than long, and about ¬æ-1¬Ω cm long, definitely shorter than the sepals. cited on  Taxonomy  Paeonia brownii was first described in 1829 by David Douglas in the Flora boreali-americana which was edited by Hooker. No synonyms for this scientific name are known. Paeonia californica has been regarded a subspecies of P. brownii, but there are several morphological differences, the environmental circumstances in which each grows are different and the distributions of both species do not overlap, so currently there seems to be consensus that both need to be regarded as separate species. Paeonia brownii and P. californica together make up the section Onaepia of the genus Paeonia. Precise relationships between the three sections remain ambiguous, and can be represented by the following phylogenetic tree. cited on = Etymology = The species is named after Scottish botanist Robert Brown.  Distribution  Brown's peony grows in open dry pine forests such as with Ponderosa Pine, in sagebrush, in mountain brush, and in aspen stands at elevations of 200‚Äì3000 m, where winters are long and cold with little or no snow cover and the growing season is short. It occurs in northern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. It is not native to Canada.  Ecology  fruitsseedsIn the Blue Mountains at about 1050 m altitude, P. brownii grows in an upland prairie on basalt-substrate close to conifer stands. In addition to a variety of grasses, the surrounding vegetation includes western monkshood, Hooker's and arrowleaf balsamroot, redstem ceanothus, pinkfairies, hairy clematis, dwarf larkspur, parsnipflower buckwheat, fernleaf and nineleaf biscuitroot, sulphur lupine, beardtongues species, virgate scorpion-weed, sticky and slender cinquefoil, sagebrush buttercup, dwarf and Nootka rose, common snowberry, American vetch and northern mule's ears. Brown's peony avoids drought by dying down completely in early summer, after flowering and surviving underground with stores of nutrients and energy in its thick rootstock. When parts of the plant are broken, bruised or damaged by predation it produces a pronounced bitter and unpleasant scent. Plants are rarely eaten, but caterpillars of the species Euxoa ustula, dark grey fishia and small heliothodes moth have been found to eat 1‚Äì2 mm holes in the flowers, although these species are better known from other host plants. Flowers give off the same smell more weakly and the lobes of the disc secrete a sweet nectar with a bitter aftertaste over the entire time the stigmas and anthers are fertile. = Pollination = According to one source, wasps such as the common aerial yellowjacket and Polistes aurifer, and sweet bees in particular Lasioglossum species make up the majority of pollinators, in addition to hoverflies such as Criorhina caudata. Bernhardt et al., after studying an endemic population in Oregon's Blue Mountains, stated: Although this plant produces a significant amount of pollen, the insects that pollinated it sought it for nectar. The study's authors argued that it is unlikely that the vespid wasps coevolved with the plant, although they do benefit it by preying upon moth larvae that attack the plant. The plant is a hexose-type nectar producer, with glucose being its primary sugar. Lepidoptera typically seek sucrose-producing flowers. This plant also uses what the researchers described as an unpleasant odor to increase pollinator selectivity. = Seed dispersal = Paeonia brownii seed is partially dispersed by rodents that harvest seeds from the ripe, hanging fruit and store these with few together in small caches up to 20 m away. In Washoe County, Nevada, yellow-pine chipmunks, deer mice, and Great Basin pocket mouse have been observed to do so. The peony seeds however are not very popular compared to pine kernels, which contain much more fat and protein. Forgotten seeds germinate early in the next year.  Cultivation  Brown's peony is rarely cultivated because it has limited ornamental value due to its few and small flowers and the difficulty to grow it. It is highly intolerant of water during its summer dormancy. It is advised to place this plant in an area of the garden with superb drainage and sheltered from summer rains. Paeonia brownii tolerates sand.  Uses  Native Americans made the roots into a tea to treat lung illnesses.

The species is endemic to certain regions of eastern Australia, including South West Queensland, northern New South Wales and north-west Victoria. Its scientific and common names refer to Charles Walter De Vis (1829-1915), first director of the Queensland Museum and writer of around 50 papers on herpetology.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Denisonia devisi, p. 71). Description Denisonia devisi is short, thick, and slightly flat. The eyes are set at the top of the head and have a conspicuous iris. The dorsal surface of the body is yellowish-brown to olive-green in colour, broken by irregular, ragged-edged, narrow, dark bands running across the body. De Vis's banded snake is sometimes confused with death adders, as both have thick, banded bodies. The main difference is that the De Vis's banded snake's tail does not taper abruptly and its head is not broad and triangular. Distribution and habitat The De Vis's banded snake was thought to be confined to alluvial flats in Queensland and New South Wales. However, when mammal expert Peter Menkhorst reported a death adder in north west Victoria, an expedition was carried out in November 2005 to survey the Wallpolla Islands. Instead of finding a death adder, the survey identified a De Vis' banded snake for the first time in Victoria. Further confirmation of the species' new habitat came with a report on the results of raising water levels for environmental purposes at several sites along the Murray River at the Victoria - New South Wales border, making special note of the snake. The snake was found in Wallpolla Island Park, a area consisting of floodplain vegetation in the extreme North West, on the Victoria-New South Wales border. It was a designated ‚ÄúIcon Site‚Äù, an area of high ecological value within the Murray- Darling basin. The new addition to Victorian snakes was probably carried south during a period of flooding in the Murray River. The usually dry habitat had become more suitable over the years as water and biodiversity increased due to environmental water. Caution is recommended regarding potentially threatening landuse. Behaviour The mud adder is a sluggish snake inhabiting low-lying areas, particularly near sites subjected to seasonal flooding. During the day, this snake stays in the soil cracks or deep cavities and emerges at night to feed on frogs. Reproduction The mud adder gives birth to fully formed young with an average total length (including tail) of . A litter consists of three to 11, five on average, baby snakes. Taxonomy This species was first described by De Vis in 1884 as Hoplocephalus ornatus. In 1920 Waite and Longman decided to place it in the genus Denisonia. However, since Krefft in 1869 had named a different species Denisonia ornata, the name was preoccupied. Therefore, Waite and Longman solved the conflict by creating the new name Denisonia maculata var. devisi. Subsequently, Cogger in 1983 raised it to full species status as Denisonia devisi.

The bridge is the largest structure in the state with more than of deck area, and the longest bridge in the state at . Its 11 highway lanes accommodate an average daily traffic of 117,000 vehicles. The bridge is actually a set of twin bridges, but they are generally spoken of using the singular \\"bridge;\\" the local media and residents refer to it as \\"The Goldstar\\". History Traffic diversion during resurfacing and repair work on the southbound span in 2017 The bridge was completed in 1943 as a single span. It was part of Southeastern Connecticut's \\"free span\\" highway bypass, a short long four-lane stretch connecting New London to Groton, Connecticut. As part of the new highway, the bridge's purpose was to remove automobiles from a previous bridge that carried U.S. Route 1 over the Thames River. In 1958, the bypass was connected to the intersection of routes 95 and 395 in East Lyme. The Route 184 bypass was completed to the Rhode Island border on December 12, 1964, officially making the bridge and both bypasses part of Interstate 95. In 1951, the bridge was designated as the Gold Star Memorial Bridge in honor of members of the Armed Forces from Groton, New London, and Waterford who lost their lives during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. During construction of the second span on July 1, 1972, the US Coast Guard Academy's three-masted barque was involved in a serious accident with the bridge as she was returning to her berth in New London. The ship's foremast and mainmast caught the safety netting slung below the new bridge, despite extensive precautions, as she passed below the original span and the new span being built parallel to it. Both masts were snapped off about seven-eighths of the way up, the upper parts left hanging dangerously from the remaining upright masts. The ship had to undergo emergency repairs as a result. The bridge's second span was completed in 1973.New London Day, July 1, 1972. Design The design is a pair of steel truss bridges, each composed of eleven spans.

He was well known for his general biblical knowledge, especially the Old Testament. Hailey and the churches of Christ are the topics of the book The Churches of Christ in the 20th Century: Homer Hailey's Personal Journey of Faith by David Edwin Harrell, Jr. Most of Hailey's books are still in print. Audio recordings of his sermons and classes are available through TruthOnDisc.Net Homer Hailey was born outside Marshall in Harrison County in East Texas, the oldest child of Robert Thomas Hailey and the former Mamie Collins. His brothers and sisters were Rob, Ruth, Jack, Roy, and Mary Ida. On December 20, 1930, in Abilene, Texas, he married the former Lois Estelle Manly (1907-1954). They had five children: Roma Luceil, Mary Lois, Homer Rob, Charles Dennis, and Carol Ann. After Lois' death, he married the former Widna Neeley Kirby (1917-1997) on October 4, 1955. Hailey died in 2000 at the age of ninety-seven in Tucson, Arizona. In 2000, Harrell, a professor emeritus of religion at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, published The Churches of Christ in the Twentieth Century: Homer Hailey‚Äôs Personal Journey of Faith (University of Alabama Press, 2000). Harrell alternates chapters between an historical look at an issue or conflict within the first century of the Churches of Christ and the way in which Homer Hailey responded to that issue or conflict. The plain-spoken Hailey who had memorized nearly every verse in the Bible became Harrell's touchstone for the history of the churches of Christ in the 20th century. In 2001, Alvin Jennings, owner of Star Bible Publications and a student in Homer Hailey's 'Denominational Doctrines' class in 1949, preserved Hailey's polemic style class notes which gave his reasons that led him out of the churches which offer instrumental music. Hailey reviewed the old hectograph outlines and refined them for publication. As a child, Homer Hailey lived outside Marshall, Texas. The night Lady Bird Taylor - the future First Lady - was born, her brothers spent the night at the Hailey house, with their friends Homer and Rob.

In ancient philosophy, any attenuated \\"thin\\" matter such as air, aether, fire or light was considered incorporeal.Priestley, Joseph. Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit. p. 212 The ancient Greeks believed air, as opposed to solid earth, to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed fire to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.Priestley, Joseph. Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit. p. 235 In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter. In the problem of universals, universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a hylomorphic account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of Forms. Aristotle used the Greek terms soma (body) and hyle (matter, literally \\"wood\\"). The notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept action at a distance as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing. In Philosophy Plato depicted by Raphael.On Empedocles and incorporeal, Burnet writes: > \\"The Love and Strife of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces. They are > active, indeed, but they are still corporeal. At the time, this was > inevitable; nothing incorporeal had yet been dreamt of. Naturally, Aristotle > is puzzled by this characteristic of what he regarded as efficient causes. ‚Äú > The Love of Empedokles,‚Äù he says is both an efficient cause, for it brings > things together, and a material cause, for it is a part of the mixture.‚Äù And > Theophrastos expressed the same idea by saying that Empedokles sometimes > gave an efficient power to Love and Strife, and sometimes put them on a > level with the other four. The fragments leave no room for doubt that they > were thought of as spatial and corporeal. All the six are called ‚Äú equal.‚Äù > Love is said to be ‚Äú equal in length and breadth ‚Äù to the others, and Strife > is described as equal to each of them in weight (fr. 17).\\" On Anaxagoras and incorporeal, Burnet writes: > \\"Zeller holds, indeed, that Anaxagoras meant to speak of something > incorporeal ; but he admits that he did not succeed in doing so, and that is > historically the important point. Nous is certainly imagined as occupying > space; for we hear of greater and smaller parts of it (fr. 12).\\" On the whole of ancient philosophy and incorporeal, Zeller writes: > \\"If, therefore, we understand by the Deity the incorporeal spirit, or the > creative power apart from matter, the whole of the ancient philosophy is > atheistical in principle; and if it has in part, notwithstanding, retained a > religious tinge, this is either an inconsistency, or it may be due to the > form of the exposition, or perhaps is the result of personal faith, and not > of philosophic conviction; in all these cases, however, the best > philosophers are those who prefer to set aside the religious presentation > rather than adopt it without philosophical warrant.\\" Renehan (1980) writes: > \\"When all is said and done, it must be recognized that one man was > responsible for the creation of an ontology which culminates in incorporeal > Being as the truest and highest reality. That man was Plato\\" For Alcinous' writings on the incorporeality of qualities, see Alcinous The Handbook Of Platonism translated by John Dillon (2002, 1993). p. 19-20. Flannery in A Companion to Philosophy of Religion writes: In chapter 10 of De ratione animae, Alcuin defines anima (soul) by combining Platonic attributes, including intellect and reason, ceaseless motion and immortality with the Christian tenents of free will and salvation. As a means of interaction with corporeals such as the human body and incorporeals such as God and the Forms, his definition includes traits pertaining to the soul as an incarnate entity within the natural world.  Theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God. This concept of a corporeal God is supported by Biblical references to his face, mouth, finger, feet, back, and right hand; as well as various references to God creating man his own image and likeness. Examples of physical manifestations of God include where the prophet Jacob declared, \\"I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved\\"; and in , which reads: \\"...the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.\\" Other scriptural references consisting the Latter-day Saint canon include , which tells of the brother of Jared seeing Jesus in the flesh. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that when the Church's foundation of revelation (, ) crumbled with the martyrdom of the Apostles, doctrine gradually began to shift as a result of the speculation and reasoning of theologians who took it upon themselves to continue the development of Christian doctrine despite not being authorized receivers of revelation for the body of the church. The writings of many of these post-Apostolic theologians show that they were influenced in varying degrees by the prevailing Greek metaphysical philosophies of that era, which strongly rejected the idea of a corporeal, material God. For example, in \\"Confessions\\" Book 7, Augustine of Hippo attributed his conception of God as incorporeal substance to Neoplatonism: \\"I no longer thought of thee, O God, by the analogy of a human body. Ever since I inclined my ear to philosophy I had avoided this error\\". Origen's preoccupation with the philosophers' concept of God is apparent in this quote from ‚ÄúHomilies on Genesis and Exodus‚Äù: \\"The Jews indeed, but also some of our own people, supposed that God should be understood as a man; that is, adorned with human members and human appearance. But the philosophers despise these stories as fabulous and formed in the likeness of poetic fictions\\".Ronald E. Heine, translator; \\"Origen: Homilies on Genesis and Exodus\\", The Catholic University of America Press, Washington D.C., 1981 In addition, asserts that immaterial matter does not exist, and is instead a finer substance which \\"can only be discerned by purer eyes\\". This Hellenistic rejection of anything material in the \\"metaphysical\\" world caused the resurrection to be one of the most hotly debated doctrines. This was apparent in the Greek's skeptical reaction to the doctrine of the resurrection in , and is what prompted Paul's defense of the resurrection in . In ‚ÄúExpositions on the Psalms‚Äù Augustine wrote, ‚ÄúNothing has been attacked with the same pertinacious, contentious contradiction, in the Christian faith, as the resurrection of the flesh...many Gentile philosophers have...written that the soul is immortal: when they come to the resurrection of the flesh...they most openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible that this earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven.‚Äù\\"Exposition on Psalm 89\\", Translated by J.E.

Prior to European contact, indigenous peoples in Canada used items such as wampum and furs for trading purposes, which continued when trade with Europeans began. Wampum and beaver pelts were considered currency. During the period of French colonization, coins were introduced, as well as one of the first examples of paper currency by a western government. During the period of British colonization, additional coinage was introduced, as well as banknotes. The Canadian colonies gradually moved away from the British pound and adopted currencies linked to the United States dollar. With Confederation in 1867, the Canadian dollar was established. By the mid-20th century, the Bank of Canada was the sole issuer of paper currency, and banks ceased to issue banknotes. Canada began issuing its own coins shortly after Confederation. In the 20th century, Canada has issued many commemorative coins into circulation, temporarily replacing current coinage designs. There also exists a long history of numismatic coin issues.  Indigenous peoples and trade  Beaver pelt in an Iroquois village The original inhabitants of Canada were the First Nations and Inuit who traded in goods on a bartering basis. Various items played the role of currency, such as copper, wampum and beaver pelts. Wampum belts, made of numerous tiny shells, were used by indigenous peoples in eastern Canada to measure wealth and as gifts.The Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 1. Wampum belts were also used as currency during the early colonial period, and were recognised as legal tender in the early Dutch and British colonies.James Powell, A History of the Canadian Dollar (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, 2005), p. 2.\\"The Quest for Confidence: 400 Years of Money ‚Äì from La Nouvelle France to Canada Today\\", Remarks by Pierre Duguay ‚Äì Former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada (2000‚Äì2010), Universit√© Laval, November 10, 2008. Indigenous peoples also traded furs with European traders for trade goods such as weapons, cloth, food, silver items, and tobacco. During the long period of the fur trade, the beaver pelt was universally accepted as a medium of exchange by indigenous peoples and European traders alike, to the point that beaver pelts, called \\"Made Beavers\\", were used as a unit of account by the Hudson Bay Company, to establish consistent pricing of all its trade goods.Powell, p. 3. The Ojibwe in eastern Canada were noted for mining and trade in copper.. Special objects, such as copper shields, had special economic and social value. The Haidas of the west coast used copper shields as a measure of status and wealth.Canadian Museum of History ‚Äì Chiefly Possessions ‚Äì Copper Shields  New France: 1608‚Äì1763  = Chronic shortage of coins = With the foundation of Quebec in 1608, French settlement and trade began. The early French colonists bartered goods and also used French coins. The basic unit of currency was the denier or penny. Twelve deniers made a sol or sou, and twenty sols made a livre of New France. However, there was a recurring problem: there was never enough hard currency. Even though the French government sent silver coins from France, such as the \\"double tournois\\", the coins tended to be taken out of circulation by merchants, who used them to pay their taxes and buy European goods, as well as hoarding the coins for personal financial security. To deal with the shortage, the French government authorized the use of coins limited to New France, the monnoye du pays.Bank of Canada: Image of 15 sol \\"monnoye de pays\\" These coins had an assigned value higher than coins used in France (the monnoye de France) but the New France coins were not successful because they had no value outside the colony. Spanish-American coins minted in Mexico, such as the piastre, would sometimes come in through secret trade. The colonial government adopted a practice of over-stamping these coins with a fleur-de-lys and a Roman numeral indicating the weight of silver, and thus value. The over- stamped coins were then permitted to circulate.Powell, p. 4. = Playing card money = By 1685, the coin shortage had grown so severe that colonial authorities resorted to using playing cards as currency. Reproduction of playing card used as money The first issue of playing card money was by Intendant Jacques de Meulles. In 1685, he needed to pay soldiers for their services in a recent campaign. His funds, both government and personal, were exhausted, and he did not want to borrow money at the rate offered by merchants. Instead, he issued three denominations of playing card money (15 sols, 40 sols, and 4 livres). Playing cards were marked with the amount on the back and were given to soldiers as compensation. They were redeemed three months later, when more coins became available.Powell, pp. 4‚Äì6. Although in the form of a promissory note, namely a promise by the colonial government to pay the soldiers when more coinage was available, the playing cards began to circulate as a medium of exchange. This was the first issue of paper money by a Western government. The card money did not meet with the approval of the French government, which was concerned that the cards were too easily counterfeited, and discouraged the colonial authorities from issuing the card money. Nonetheless, even when more coins did arrive from France, the cards continued to be used. The Intendant issued more card money the next year, 1686, with further issues in later years. The Governor, Louis de Buade de Frontenac, gradually saw the value of the paper currency and agreed to the expanded use, but as time went by, the use of card money contributed to a rise of inflation. In 1717, the colonial government withdrew all card money from circulation, redeeming the cards at 50% of their face value, and burning the cards.R.J. Graham (ed.), Canadian Government Paper Money (30th ed.), (Toronto: Charlton Press, 2018), pp. 1‚Äì3. Reproduction of playing card money (10 sols) The withdrawal of card money did not solve the problem of a chronic shortage of coinage. In 1722, the government introduced copper coins, but they were not well received. The lack of coinage contributed to a recession.Powell, pp. 7‚Äì9. In 1729, the continued shortage of coinage led to the reintroduction of card money, this time with the approval of the French government. The amount of new card money was initially strictly controlled and the card money was redeemable as bills of exchange in France. This approach reduced the need to transport coinage across the Atlantic. Although referred to as \\"card money\\", this issue did not actually use playing cards, but rather plain card stock. The colonial government also issued promissory notes payable by the treasury, termed ordonnances de paiement which also circulated as currency. However, given the state of the French finances, the government relied increasingly on treasury bills to finance the wars. By 1760, the treasury notes totalled 30 million livres, and the amount of paper money circulating in the colony was fifteen times greater than in 1750. The new card money and the ordonnances de paiement were initially successful. However, the gradual deterioration of the finances of the French government over the first half of the 18th century and the expenses of the Seven Years' War with Britain triggered a rapid increase in the amount of paper money in circulation in the 1750s. That in turn meant that inflation became a problem, as noted by Governor Montcalm in a dispatch to the French government. The declining confidence in the paper money meant coinage was increasingly hoarded, an application of Gresham's law. The paper money issued by the colonial government continued to depreciate in value, especially once the French government suspended redemption of the card money until after the end of the war with Britain. = French coinage = The French government continued to ship coinage to the colonies in the 18th century, such as the gold Louis d'or.Powell, pp. 9‚Äì10. Louis d'or of Louis XIV (1709) Although in short supply, French coinage continued to circulate in the 18th century, such as the 15- and 30-deniers.Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 2. These gold coins, known as the mousquetaire, were meant to pay soldiers and civil servants but did not stay in circulation very long. The name is believed to have come from the cross on the reverse of the coins, which resembled the crosses on the cloaks of the legendary musketeers. Another coinage that was used was the sol (sou). The sol was equivalent to the size of a 20th-century one-cent coin and was produced between 1738 and 1756. The Sol was rated at 12 deniers. The double sol was produced until 1764, although large shipments to Quebec and Cape Breton ended in 1756. The double sol was rated at 24 deniers. = End of French rule = French rule came to an end with the conquest of Quebec by the British in 1760. The value of the card money and the ordonnances de paiement plummeted, since their value had come from the promise by the French government that they could be redeemed for coinage. Under the Treaty of Paris, 1763, the French government agreed to continue to redeem the paper money, and three years later introduced a series of government debentures to replace the paper money. However, the state of France's government finances was poor, and by 1771 the debentures were essentially worthless. After New France fell, the card money and ordonnances were redeemed at only one-quarter of their face value. As a result, the habitants of Quebec were left with a deep distrust of paper money which lasted for generations.  British colonial rule: 1760‚Äì1825  = Shortage of currency = Prince Edward Island \\"holey dollar\\" The shortage of currency continued under British rule. Although historical economists disagree on the reasons for the shortage, the effect was that a wide variety of foreign coinage and paper instruments, such as colonial Treasury bills and notes from different merchants, were used in commercial transactions. One account from Nova Scotia in 1820 illustrates the confusion caused by the lack of unified currency: a customer in a market bought vegetables costing six pence, and paid with a ¬£1 Nova Scotian Treasury note. His change back consisted of ninety-three separate items: eight paper notes from different merchants, ranging in value from 5 shillings to 7 1/2 pence; one silver coin; and eighty-four copper coins.Powell, pp. 17‚Äì18. Colonial governments could be imaginative in domesticating foreign currencies. For example, in 1808, officials in Prince Edward Island punched out the centres of Spanish-American dollars, creating the \\"holey dollar\\". The two pieces were each used as coins, with values of one shilling and five shillings. = Units of account and rating systems = Because of the variety of currencies that were used, two measures were needed for order and consistency in financial accounting: units of account and \\"ratings\\" system. By general agreement, all accounts were usually kept in one currency, and coins and bills from other systems were notionally converted to that system for bookkeeping purposes. That step required a generally accepted conversion system, or \\"rating\\" of other currencies, typically based on their weight and the value of the precious metal they contained. The colonies all initially used the British system of \\"Pounds, shillings and pence\\" as the unit of account, but there was variation in the rating system. Each colonial government established rating systems to value the wide variety of foreign currencies that came into use.Powell, pp. 11‚Äì14.A.B. McCullough, \\"Currency Conversion in British North America, 1760‚Äì1900\\", (1983) 16 Archivaria 83. Six shilling note in York currency, issued by Michael Dye, an innkeeper in Toronto in 1815 The two most important rating systems were the Halifax rating and the York rating. The Halifax rating set the value of a Spanish dollar at five shillings. This value was actually six pence higher than the value of the Spanish dollar at that time. The higher rating was chosen to encourage the continued circulation of the Spanish dollar and to discourage people from melting the dollars down for their bullion value. The Halifax rating came into use shortly after the colony of Nova Scotia was established in 1749, and was confirmed by a statute of the Legisature of Nova Scotia in 1758.An Act for establishing the rate of Spanish Dollars, and the interest of Money within this Province, Statutes of Nova Scotia, 32 Geo. II (1758), c. VII. Although the British government disallowed the Nova Scotia legislation, the Halifax rating continued to be widely used in the Maritime colonies and eventually in Lower Canada.An Act for better regulating the Weight and the Rates at which certain Coins shall pass Current in this Province, for preventing the falsifying, counterfeiting or impairing the same, and for repealing the Act or Ordinance therein-mentioned, Statutes of Lower Canada, 36 Geo. III (1796), c. V. The York rating was named after New York, where it had been adopted during the colonial period. The York rating set the value of a Spanish dollar at eight shillings. The York rating was introduced in Upper Canada by United Empire Loyalists. Although Upper Canada formally adopted the Halifax rating by legislation in 1796,An Act for the better regulation of certain Coins current in this Province, Statutes of Upper Canada, 36 Geo. III (1796), c. I. the York rating continued to be used, apparently up until the union of Upper and Lower Canada in the Province of Canada in 1841. = Government treasury bills = Colonial governments began to experiment in paper treasury bills, often when needed to finance government expenses. The first Canadian colony to do so was Prince Edward Island (at that time known as the Island of St. John). In 1790, the colonial government issued ¬£500 in treasury notes, in values up to ¬£2. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island all issued treasury bills in the early years of the 19th century.Graham, pp. 11‚Äì38.Powell, pp. 14‚Äì17. During the War of 1812, the British Army issued a series of \\"Army bills\\", redeemable for government bills of exchange at London, with eventually ¬£1.5 million issued. All of those bills were redeemed in currency by 1816, which helped build confidence in government paper money.Graham, pp. 4‚Äì8. The Colony of British Columbia also issued paper money in the 1850s, denominated in pounds and later in dollars. = Banks and bank notes = One dollar banknote of the Montreal Bank, 1821 Note of the Molson Bank for deux piasters / ten shillings, 1853 As the level of commercial sophistication rose in the colonies, banks began to be founded. The banks then began to issue bank notes, with the first from the Montreal Bank (now the Bank of Montreal) in 1817, shortly after it was incorporated. Other banks, such as the Bank of Upper Canada, the Bank of New Brunswick, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Bank of Prince Edward Island, followed suit, issuing their own bank notes. The right to issue bank notes was a valuable one. The notes amounted to an interest-free loan to the bank, which only became due if the holder of a note presented it to the bank to redeem it in coinage.Graham, p. xvii‚Äìxviii. The bank notes were only redeemable at the branches of the bank which issued them. Although the bank notes were generally well-received by the populace, they could trade at a discount when they were far away from a bank branch where they could be redeemed. The notes issued by banks in Upper and Lower Canada tended to be denominated in both pounds and dollars, while the bank notes in the Atlantic provinces tended to be in pounds only. This difference reflected the greater commercial ties which Upper and Lower Canada had with the United States, while the Atlantic colonies mainly traded with Britain, less with the United States. Some merchants also issued paper notes which exchanged as currency. In Lower Canada, they were often referred to as \\"Bons\\", from the opening words \\"Bon pour\\", French for \\"Good for\\".Powell, pp. 92‚Äì93. = Tokens = Lower Canada bank token for one penny / two sous, a Habitant token, nicknamed a \\"Papineau\\", from 1837 In addition to issuing bank notes, some banks as well as merchants began to issue trade tokens. Although they had no legal status, they were accepted as currency on a local basis. The tokens were mainly imported from England. The banks in Lower Canada cooperated in issuing tokens to improve their reliability. One of the tokens they produced had the arms of Montreal on one side, and an image of a habitant on the other. These tokens were nicknamed \\"Papineaus\\", named after Louis-Joseph Papineau, who was the leader of the 1837 rebellion in Lower Canada and who was well-known for wearing habitant clothing almost as uniform.Banning 18Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 3. These tokens are more commonly known today as Habitant tokens. Illustrations of trade tokens of the North West Company and the Hudson Bay Company The two major fur- trading companies, the Hudson Bay Company and the North West Company also issued trade tokens, which were used in their extensive trading networks. The Hudson Bay Company tokens were based on the \\"Made beaver\\" pelts which had been used as a medium of exchange.  From the British pound to the Canadian dollar: 1825‚Äì1867  During the mid-19th century, there was a policy disagreement between the British and the colonial governments. The British wanted all the colonies to continue to use sterling, to facilitate trade within the Empire. The Canadian colonies, both in the east and British Columbia, increasingly favoured linking their currencies to the US dollar, given the strong local trade links.Powell, pp. 19‚Äì20. Eventually, the local trade won out and the Canadian colonies migrated to currencies linked to the US dollar. One feature of the regulation of coinage at this time was fixed exchange rates. The colonial and imperial legislation set fixed exchange rates for coins, often based on their weight as bullion. = British Order-in- council of 1825 = The issue first arose in 1825, when the British government passed an imperial Order-in-council which was designed to encourage the circulation of sterling coinage throughout the British Empire, including the Canadian colonies.Order-in-council, March 23, 1825; re-printed in Chalmers, p. 425. The Order-in-council actually had the reverse effect in the Canadas, driving out what little sterling specie coinage did actually circulate.Chalmers, p. 184 This was because the rating of one Spanish dollar to four shillings and four pence sterling that was contained in the order-in- council did not represent a realistic comparison between the silver content in the Spanish dollar as compared to the gold content in the British gold sovereign. When Britain passed remedial legislation in 1838, the British North American colonies were excluded from its provisions due to recent rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. = Colonial pounds = Each of the colonies had their own currencies. Although modelled on the British system of pounds- shillings-pence, the exact value of each currency could vary, depending on the legislation of each colony. There was the Canadian pound, used in Upper and Lower Canada, and then the Province of Canada; the New Brunswick pound; the Newfoundland pound; the Nova Scotian pound; and the Prince Edward Island pound. They were all gradually replaced with decimal systems of currency linked to the US and Spanish dollars. = Province of Canada pound, 1841 = Following the union, the Province of Canada adopted a new system based on the Halifax rating. The provincial legislation set exchange rates for a new Canadian pound: one pound, four shillings and four pence Canadian was equal to one pound sterling.An Act to regulate the Currency of this Province, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 4 & 5 Vict. (1841), c. XCIII. Described the other way, the new Canadian pound was worth sixteen shillings, five and three-tenths pence sterling. The legislation also set the rate for the new Canadian pound against the US dollar, setting the legal tender value of the American gold eagle at two pounds, ten shillings Canadian (i.e. the Canadian pound was worth four US dollars). The legislation also set the exchange rates for the Canadian pound against the French franc, the old Spanish, Mexican and Chilean doubloons, and other Latin American currencies. British currency, US gold and silver coins, and Spanish dollars were all considered legal tender.Powell, p. 21. = Movement towards the dollar and decimal currency = Throughout the 1850s, the imperial and colonial governments debated the issue of colonial currency. The imperial government favoured a system where all colonies used currency based on sterling, which could be either British currency or local colonial currency tied to sterling, including a decimalised currency. The colonial governments increasingly favoured a decimal monetary system based on the United States dollar, because of the practical implications of the increasing trade with the neighbouring United States.Powell, pp. 22‚Äì24. In June 1851, representatives of the Province of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia met in Toronto to discuss the introduction of a joint decimal currency. The Government in London agreed in principle to a decimal coinage but held out the hope that the colonies would adopt a sterling unit under the name 'Royal'.  Province of Canada  Following the 1851 conference, the government of the Province of Canada under the leadership of Co-Premier Francis Hincks began to move towards decimal currency. The provincial Parliament passed an act to introduce a pound sterling unit in conjunction with decimal fractional coinage. The idea was that the fractional values would correspond to exact values of fractions of the US dollar. The Preamble to the statute expressed the hope that the decimal currency could \\"...hereafter be advantageously made common to all the Provinces of British North America, as being simple and convenient in itself, and well calculated to facilitate their commercial intercourse with other parts of this continent\\".An Act to provide for the introduction of the Decimal System into the Currency of this Province, and otherwise to amend the laws relative to the Currency, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 14 &15 Vict. (1851), c. 47. The authorities in London delayed implementation of the act on technical grounds. A related statute passed in the same session continued the statutory exchange rates for British and US currency used in Canada.An Act to extend the provisions of the Currency Act to certain Gold and Silver Coins coined after the period in the said Act limited, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 14 & 15 Vict. (1851), c. 48. Canada's first ten cent coin, 1858 As a compromise between basing the currency on sterling or on the US dollar, in 1853 the Parliament of the Province of Canada enacted a statute to introduce the gold standard into the province, based on both the British gold sovereign and the American gold eagle coins.An Act to regulate the Currency, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 16 Vict. (1853), c. 158. The gold sovereign was legal tender at a rating of ¬£1 equal to $4.8666 Canadian, and the $10 eagle was rated at $10 Canadian. No coinage was provided for under the 1853 act. Sterling coinage was made legal tender, and all other silver coins were demonetized, although they continued to circulate. Dollar transactions were legalized. Since the New Brunswick and Canadian statutes had adopted the same conversion rates, their two currencies were now compatible, fixed at par with the US dollar. The trend towards decimalization continued, and in 1857 the Province of Canada provided that all public accounts were to be kept in dollars and cents.An Act to require accounts rendered to the Provincial Government to be so rendered in dollars and cents, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 20 Vict. (1857), c. 18. The next year, 1858, the first Canadian decimal coins were released. Minted at the Royal Mint in London, they were issued in the name of \\"Canada\\", with an effigy of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The coins were in denominations of one-cent, five-cents, ten-cents, twenty-cents and fifty-cents.  New Brunswick  In 1852, the year following the Toronto conference, New Brunswick passed a similar statute as the Canadian statute, establishing \\"pounds, shillings and pence\\" as the government unit of account, but also setting both British coinage and US coinage as legal tender. The statute also authorized the provincial government to obtain a new supply of coins.An Act for establishing a Tender in all payments to be made in this Province, and for consolidating and amending the laws relating to the Currency therein, Statutes of New Brunswick, 15 Vict. (1852), c. 85. New Brunswick ordered a supply of coins from the Royal Mint in London in 1860, but because of the demand faced by the Mint, the first shipment of New Brunswick coins did not arrive until 1862.  Nova Scotia  Nova Scotia one cent coin, 1861 In 1860, Nova Scotia adopted a system of decimalization, and set the exchange rates for British currency as well as other coins. The provincial government was authorised to obtain coins in cents, and the unit of account for the government was to be in dollars and cents. All court judgments were to be issued in dollars and cents. However, since the Nova Scotia legislation set the exchange rate as ¬£1 equal to $5, the Nova Scotia system was not compatible with the Canadian and New Brunswick systems, which gave a slightly lower value to the pound.An Act to regulate the Currency and the Decimal System of Accounting, Statutes of Nova Scotia, 23 Vict. (1860), c. 3. Nova Scotia also ordered coins from the Royal Mint in 1860, but like New Brunswick, the first shipment of Nova Scotia coins did not arrive until 1862.  Newfoundland  Newfoundland two-dollar gold coin, 1870 Prior to 1865, Newfoundland used the Newfoundland pound, equal in value to the pound sterling. In 1865, Newfoundland switched to a decimal system, the Newfoundland dollar, and started to release its own coinage, in denominations of one-cent, five-cent, ten-cent, twenty-cent and two-dollar coins.Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland (1st Series, 1874), Title XXV, \\"Of the Regulation of Trade in Certain Cases\\", c. 92, Of the Currency. The Newfoundland decimal coinage represented fractions of the Spanish dollar that was used in British Guiana. This had the benefit of making one penny sterling exactly equal to two new Newfoundland cents, which was seen as a compromise between those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the British system and those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the United States system. However, it meant that the Newfoundland dollar was worth slightly more than the Canadian dollar (one Newfoundland dollar was worth 1.014 Canadian dollars), so the Newfoundland and Canadian currencies were not easily convertible.Powell, p. 27. Although the Newfoundland government issued coinage, it left the issue of bank notes to the two private banks in Newfoundland: the Union Bank and the Commercial Bank. By the late 19th century, both of those banks were badly managed and in very weak financial condition.Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador, \\"1894 Bank Crash\\". When there was a downturn in the cod industry, the banks failed on Monday, December 10, 1894, known as Black Monday. Both banks closed their doors permanently that day and their notes became worthless, triggering a financial crisis on the island. The Government of Newfoundland passed legislation guaranteeing payment on the bank notes of the two insolvent banks, but at depreciated values.An Act respecting Union Bank Notes, Statutes of Newfoundland, 58 Vict. (1895), c. 1.An Act respecting Commercial Bank Notes, Statutes of Newfoundland, 58 Vict. (1895), c. 2. The Government also introduced legislation to set the value of the Newfoundland dollar the same as the Canadian dollar.An Act respecting the Currency, Statutes of Newfoundland, 58 Vict. (1895), c. 4. Canadian banks moved in quickly following the crash, in 1894 and early 1895. The net effect was that the Newfoundland monetary system became integrated with the Canadian system.  British Columbia  In 1867, the Colony of British Columbia enacted a statute to implement decimal currency based on the United States dollar. The statute provided that all government accounts would be kept in dollars and cents and established rates of exchange for the various coins then in circulation, at the rate of ¬£1 equal to $4.85. The legislation repealed similar legislation enacted a few years earlier by the former colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia prior to their union.The Currency Ordinance, 1867, Statutes of British Columbia, 30 Vict. (1867), No. 82.  Prince Edward Island  Ten-dollar note of the Bank of Prince Edward Island, 1872 Prince Edward Island shifted to decimal currency in 1871, with the dollar replacing the Prince Edward Island pound. By statute, dollars and cents were adopted as the unit of account for the colonial government. The statute also set the exchange rate between sterling and the dollar at ¬£1 equal to $4.8666. The colonial government was authorized to arrange for the printing of notes denominated in dollars, and the issuance of copper coins in cents.An Act to establish a Decimal system of Currency on this Island, Statutes of Prince Edward Island, 34 Vict. (1871), c. 5.  Province of Canada government notes  = Proposal for a central bank, 1841 = Governor-General Lord Sydenham, who proposed a central bank and provincial notes In 1841, the first Governor General of the new Province of Canada, Lord Sydenham, proposed the creation of a provincial central bank. He suggested that the province establish a bank which would have exclusive power to issue bank notes. The first issue would be for ¬£1 million in provincial notes, but denominated in dollars. The notes would be backed by a combination of gold held by the province (25% of the value of the notes issued) and provincial government securities. The private banks would lose their power to issue bank notes. The proposal would have the double effect of providing a stable provincial currency, and also providing a guaranteed revenue source for the provincial government, estimated at ¬£30,000 per year, from seigniorage.Powell, pp. 21‚Äì22 The proposal had the support of Francis Hincks, who chaired a parliamentary committee to study the proposal, but the proposal faced strong opposition. The private banks lobbied against it, fearing the loss of profits if their power to issue bank notes was eliminated. There were also fears expressed that the new bank would make credit tighter, making it harder to borrow money. A third concern was that it would place too much power in the hands of the government. Ultimately, the committee rejected the proposal. = Province of Canada notes = Alexander Galt, Minister of Finance, who proposed the Province of Canada notes Bank of Montreal four-dollar note, 1859, over-printed as a Province of Canada note In the 1850s, there were several bank failures which shook confidence in the security of banknotes in the Province of Canada: first the Colonial Bank and the International Bank in 1859, followed soon afterwards by the collapse of the Bank of Clifton and the Bank of Western Canada.Powell, pp. 24‚Äì26. The bank failures made their notes worthless, and the resulting scandal increased pressure on the government for greater bank regulation. In 1860, the provincial Minister of Finance, Alexander Tilloch Galt, proposed that the government issue bank notes, replacing notes issued by the private banks. The banks, fearing a loss of profits, opposed the proposal and the Government quickly withdrew it. Six years later, the proposal re-surfaced, this time driven by the government's need for money. It was having trouble raising loans either in Canada or in Britain and decided to issue provincial government notes as a way to raise money. The Provincial Notes Act authorized the Province to issue notes up to the value of $8 million, backed partly by gold and partly by government debentures.An Act to provide for the issue of Provincial Notes, Statutes of the Province of Canada, 29‚Äì30 Vict. (1866), c. 10. They were redeemable in either Toronto or Montreal. Unlike Galt's proposal six years earlier, the private banks were not required to give up their power to issue bank notes, although they were offered financial inducements to do so. Any bank which did so could then act at the government's banker and its notes were deemed to be government notes. Only the Bank of Montreal did so, enabling it to act as the government's note issuer. It resumed issuing its own notes five years later. The initial issue was based on Bank of Montreal notes, over-printed with \\"Province of Canada\\". The first issue by the Province itself was on January 1, 1867, just half a year before Confederation. The Province of Canada notes served as the basis for the notes later issued by the new country.Graham, pp. 96‚Äì106. The 1867 issue consisted of a one-dollar note, featuring Samuel de Champlain and Jacques Cartier, with the provincial coat- of-arms; a two-dollar note, featuring Britannia and allegorical figures; a five-dollar note, featuring Queen Victoria, an indigenous woman, a lion and a ship under sail; a ten-dollar note, featuring Columbus, symbols of transportation, and beavers; a twenty-dollar note, featuring Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and his wife Alexandra, Princess of Wales, as well as beavers building a dam; and a fifty-dollar note featuring Mercury, the Roman god of commerce.  Confederation, 1867  Canada in 1867 Canada was created in 1867 by the British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867). A federation, it originally had four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The federal Parliament was assigned exclusive jurisdiction over \\"Coins and Currency\\", as well as \\"Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money\\".Constitution Act, 1867, s. 91 (14), (15). This resulted in major changes to the monetary system in the new country, with control over coinage and bank notes centralised in Ottawa.Powell, pp. 26‚Äì28. = Currency Acts = In 1868, the federal Parliament enacted the first Currency Act. It provided for the possibility that Canada might give its dollar exactly the same value as the United States dollar, but in the meantime, the pre-Confederation values for currency were maintained. The dollars circulating in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick continued to circulate at the same value, while the Nova Scotia dollars continued to circulate in Nova Scotia at their higher, pre-Confederation value.An Act respecting the Currency, Statutes of Canada 1868, c. 45. This situation continued for three more years, until Parliament passed the Uniform Currency Act. It provided that Nova Scotia would now use the same dollar as the rest of Canada, based on the pre-Confederation dollar. The value of the dollar continued to be set by reference to the British sovereign and the American eagle, at the rate of 4.8666 Canadian dollars equal to ¬£1, and ten Canadian dollars equal to the ten-dollar American eagle, the same rates as set in the 1853 Province of Canada legislation.An Act to establish one Uniform Currency for the Dominion of Canada, Statutes of Canada 1871, c. 4. The Uniform Currency Act applied automatically to Manitoba upon its admission to Confederation, but did not apply to British Columbia and Prince Edward Island when they joined. In 1881, Parliament passed an Act extending the Uniform Currency Act to those two provinces.An Act to extend the Act establishing one Uniform Currency for the Dominion of Canada to the Provinces of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, Statutes of Canada 1881, c. 4. = Dominion notes and bank notes = In 1868, the federal Parliament also enacted the Dominion Notes Act, to authorize the issue of government bank notes.Dominion Notes Act, Statutes of Canada 1868, c. 46. The Act was similar to the Provincial Notes Act from the Province of Canada, and the existing Province of Canada notes were continued as dominion notes. The government notes were referred to as \\"Dominion notes\\", using the term then used for the federal government, to distinguish them from bank notes issued by the chartered banks. The dominion notes were partially backed by gold. For the first $5 million in notes, the federal government was required to have gold reserves for twenty per cent of the value of the notes. The next $3 million issued notes were required to be backed by gold reserves of twenty-five percent of the value of the notes. In 1871, the federal Parliament also passed a new Bank Act which replaced all the pre-Confederation banking legislation and created a uniform system of banking regulation for the new country. One important change was that the banks could not issue low-denomination bank notes, initially being limited to notes in denominations of four dollars and over.Bank Act, Statutes of Canada 1871, c. 5, s. 8. This limit was raised to five dollars in 1881. Only the federal government could issue low value denominations. The federal government also issued high denomination notes to facilitate large transfers of cash between the banks. = First Canadian coins = Illustration of the first Canadian fifty-cent coin, showing Queen Victoria, 1871 Bank of Upper Canada, one penny token showing St George and the Dragon, 1857 In 1867, the federal government planned to issue its own coinage, in denominations of one cent, five cents, ten cents, twenty-five cents, and fifty cents. The coins were similar to the coins of the Province of Canada, with the difference that the twenty-five cent coin replaced the twenty-cent coin of the provincial currency. The twenty-cent coin had never been popular, as Canadians were used to the US twenty-five cent coin, which circulated freely in the Province.Powell, p. 29 The coins did not actually enter circulation until they arrived from the Royal Mint in London in 1870.Powell, pp. 28‚Äì32. The government did not issue the one-cent coin until 1876, given the amount of pre-Confederation pennies that were still in circulation. Francis Hincks, Minister of Finance, who oversaw the introduction of Canadian coins and currency, and dealt with the silver and copper coinage issues One issue the government faced was the large amount of United States and, to a lesser extent, British silver coins which were circulating in Ontario and Quebec. The problem was that the coins were over-rated: their face values were greater than their bullion value. Banks would only accept them at a discount, while farmers and merchants found they had to take them at par value. The difference in values affected the farmers and merchants, and also had the effect of crowding the government one-dollar and two-dollars notes out of circulation.Graham, p. 107. The solution was to collect the US and British coins and export them, while providing that in the future, their par value would be fixed by statute at only 80% of their face value. Francis Hincks, back in office as federal Minister of Finance, worked with bankers led by William WeirDictionary of Canadian Biography: \\"Weir, William\\". to successfully repatriate the silver coins to the United States and Britain. There was a similar issue with copper coinage. Prior to Confederation, a large variety of copper coins had circulated: pennies issued by the provincial governments, US and British coppers, low-value tokens issued by private banks or merchants, even brass buttons in some cases. Working with the banks, the federal government gradually had all of the pre-Confederation and foreign pennies removed from circulation. In 1876, the Canadian one-cent coin finally was issued. = First Canadian notes = Dominion note for twenty-five cents, nicknamed a \\"shinplaster\\", issued in 1870, showing Britannia Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne The new Canadian government issued its first notes in 1870. The first issue was in denominations of twenty-five cents (nicknamed a \\"shinplaster\\"), one dollar and two dollars. The twenty-five cent note featured Britannia, the one-dollar note featured Jacques Cartier, and the two-dollar note featured General James Wolfe and the Marquis de Montcalm.Graham, pp. 108‚Äì116 The twenty-five cent note was issued as a temporary expedient, while the government waited for a shipment of twenty-five cent coins from the Royal Mint in London. However, the twenty-five cent note proved so popular that it continued in circulation for the next sixty-five years, with new versions in 1900 and 1923. In 1871, the federal government issued notes for five hundred dollars and one thousand dollars, featuring Queen Victoria on the five hundred-dollar note and an allegorical female figure with the arms of Canada on the one thousand-dollar note.Graham, pp. 117‚Äì123. In 1872, the government issued a fifty dollar note, featuring Mercury, the Roman god of commerce, and a one hundred-dollar note, featuring the Centre Block of the Parliament buildings. A two-dollar note was issued in 1878, featuring the Governor General, the Earl of Dufferin. This was followed in 1882 by a four-dollar note featuring the then Governor general, the Marquess of Lorne.Graham, pp. 128‚Äì134 =Chartered bank notes= Four dollar banknote issued by the Bank of Montreal, 1870, featuring bank officials Under the new Bank Act passed in 1871, the chartered banks were limited to issuing notes in denominations of four dollars and over. To avoid using the one- and two-dollar notes issued by the government, some banks took to issuing notes in odd denominations, such as six-dollar and seven-dollar notes. This meant that they could carry out transactions without having to obtain the government notes, and maximize the circulation of their own notes. The government closed off this loophole in 1880. By an amendment to the Bank Act, Parliament provided that the banks could only issue notes in denominations of five dollars and higher, and also only in multiples of five dollars.An Act to amend \\"An Act relating to Banks and Banking\\", and to continue for a limited time the charters of certain Banks to which the said Act applies,\\" Statutes of Canada 1880, c. 22, s. 12. The amendment Act also provided, for the first time, that the bank notes were a first charge on the assets of a bank, in case of insolvency. In 1890, the banks were required to operate redemption offices for their notes across the country, which meant that bank notes no longer traded at a discount if they were far from a branch of the bank. = Dominion \\"Bank legal\\" Notes = In 1896, the federal government began to issue large denomination notes whose usage was restricted to the chartered banks. Their purpose was to assist the banks in maintaining their reserves of Dominion notes, as required by the Bank Act, and also to assist the banks in settling their cash balances with each other. The notes stated on their face that they were \\"Legal tender note for use by Banks only\\", which led to their common name, \\"Bank legals\\". Bank legals ceased to be issued after the establishment of the Bank of Canada.Graham, p. 189. The issues were as follows: * 1896: denominations of five hundred dollars (featuring the Marquess of Lorne), one thousand dollars (Queen Victoria), and five thousand dollars (John A. Macdonald); * 1901: denominations of one thousand dollars (featuring Lord Roberts) and five thousand dollars (Queen Victoria); * 1918: denominations of five thousand dollars (featuring Queen Victoria) and fifty thousand dollars (King George V and Queen Mary); * 1924: denominations of one thousand dollars (featuring Lord Roberts), five thousand dollars (Queen Victoria), and fifty thousand dollars (King George V and Queen Mary).Graham, pp. 190-199.  Establishment of the Royal Canadian Mint  The Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa One cent coin bearing King Edward VII, issued in 1908 During the British colonial period, the colonies were generally prohibited from minting their own coins. They obtained them by purchase from the Royal Mint in London. After Confederation, the first Canadian coins were also minted in London, but the possibility of a Canadian mint began to be raised in public debates.Senate Debates, Hon. Mr McInnes, March 4, 1890: \\"Motion that the Government should immediately pass a coinage act and establish a mint\\". Under the British Coinage Act, 1870, the British government could establish branches of the Royal Mint in overseas British possessions.Coinage Act, 1870 (UK) 33 & 34 Vict., c. 10, s. 11(8). In 1901, the Canadian Parliament passed an Act to pay for the expenses of a local branch of the Royal Mint, up to $75,000 annually, upon the establishment of a branch by the British government.Ottawa Mint Act, Statutes of Canada 1901, c. 4. In 1907, the British government established a branch of the Royal Mint at Ottawa, to be operated at the expense of the Canadian government, by means of a royal proclamation under the Coinage Act, 1870.Proclamation by the King under the Coinage Act, 1870: London Gazette, November 8, 1907, Issue 28076, Pages 7483‚Äì7484. At the formal opening of the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint on January 2, 1908, the Governor General, Earl Grey, struck the first coin minted in Canada: a silver 50 cent piece, bearing the effigy of King Edward VII. The second coin struck was a one cent piece.Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 4. As a branch of the Royal Mint, the Ottawa Mint was authorized to mint gold sovereigns, with the same legal status as sovereigns issued by the Royal Mint in Britain. In 1911, the Ottawa branch produced over 256,000 sovereigns. In 1931, the Canadian government took over full control of the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint, renaming it the Royal Canadian Mint and bringing it under the authority of the Minister of Finance.An Act respecting the establishment of the Royal Canadian Mint, Statutes of Canada 1931, c. 48. The British government accordingly repealed the status of the Mint as a branch of the Royal Mint.Ottawa Mint (Discontinuance) Proclamation, 1931, London Gazette, November 10, 1931, Issue 33770, Page 7240.  Relationship to the gold standard  Gold bars When first created in 1868, the Canadian dollar was partially backed by gold. Under the Dominion Notes Act, the government was required to have gold reserves of up to twenty per cent of the value of the first five million dollars of notes issued, rising to twenty-five per cent of the value of the next three million dollars issued. This followed the similar requirement which had been in place for the Province of Canada dollar since 1854.Powell, pp. 33‚Äì35. The combination of the gold standard, the fixed value of the Canadian dollar to both the pound sterling and the US dollar, and the lack of any controls on the export of gold meant that the federal government did not have much ability to implement monetary policy. As a result, Canada experienced several periods of rapid economic contraction and expansion in the period between the establishment of Canadian currency and the outbreak of World War I. In the days immediately prior to the outbreak of the war in August 1914, withdrawals from banks increased dramatically and there was a fear of bank runs, as depositors demanded gold or government notes rather than bank notes.Powell, pp. 37‚Äì40. The federal government took steps to stabilise the banks, including ending the convertibility of notes to gold for the duration of the War. Instead, the bank notes acquired status as legal tender. Canada was off the gold standard. As well, the federal government authorised the Minister of Finance to act as a lender of last resort to the banks to ensure their stability, one of the first steps towards the establishment of a central bank. Although it was widely expected that Canada would return to the gold standard after the War, it was not until 1926 that the government did so. Following the return to the gold standard, British and United States gold coins, government of Canada notes, and Canadian coins were legal tender. Bank notes ceased to be legal tender. However, the return was short-lived. Britain went off the gold standard in September 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. Canada followed suit by prohibiting export of gold on October 31, 1931, unofficially taking Canada off the gold standard. A year and a half later, the federal government ended the convertibility of government notes for gold. It was expected to be a temporary measure until the world economic situation improved, but Canada has never returned to the gold standard.Powell, pp. 41‚Äì43.  Establishment of the Bank of Canada  = Creation and functions of the Bank = The original building of the Bank of Canada, with extensive additions to the rear As the Depression continued in Canada, pressure grew on the federal government to take greater control over the economy, including monetary policy. Criticisms were levelled at the federal Treasury Board and Deputy Minister of Finance, who administered the Finance Act, suggesting that they were not sufficiently skilled in monetary policy.Powell, pp. 44‚Äì46. In response, the federal government in 1933 set up the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency to study the functioning of the Finance Act and to make recommendations about the establishment of a central bank.Report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency in Canada (Ottawa: J.O. Patenaude, 1933), p. 5.Powell, pp. 47‚Äì49. The commission, chaired by Lord Macmillan, reported later that year and recommended the establishment of a central bank, by a 3‚Äì2 division. The proposal had broad support from the two main political parties, but was opposed by the Canadian banks on monetary policy grounds, and also because of concern about loss of profits if they could no longer issue bank notes. The federal government acted on the recommendation and passed the Bank of Canada Act in 1934. It came into force on March 11, 1935. The Bank was given an array of powers, including custodian of the gold reserves of the government, lender of last resort to chartered banks, and issuer of notes on behalf of the government. The Dominion Notes Act and the Finance Act, which had assigned these functions to the Minister of Finance, were repealed. The Bank's mandate was summarised in the Preamble to the Act: > WHEREAS it is desirable to establish a central bank in Canada to regulate > credit and currency in the best interest of the economic life of the nation, > to control and protect the external value of the national monetary unit and > to mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the general level of > production, trade, prices and employment, so far as may be possible within > the scope of monetary action, and generally to promote the economic and > financial welfare of the Dominion;Bank of Canada Act, Statutes of Canada > 1934, c. 43, Preamble. The current version of the Act retains the same > wording, with the substitution of \\"Canada\\" for \\"the Dominion\\": Bank of > Canada Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, c. B-2, Preamble. One former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada has stated that the Bank implements this mandate in three ways: \\"first, by keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable; second, by supporting a safe and efficient financial system; and third, by issuing money that is safe from counterfeiting and readily accepted\\". = First issue of Bank of Canada notes = The one-dollar note of the 1935 series, featuring King George V On March 11, 1935, the first day of its operation, the Bank issued its first series of notes.Graham, pp. 201‚Äì224. There were ten notes in the 1935 series, primarily featuring members of the Royal Family: * a one-dollar note, featuring King George V; * a two- dollar note, featuring Queen Mary; * a five-dollar note, featuring Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII); *a ten-dollar note, featuring Mary, Princess Royal; * a twenty-dollar note, featuring Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II); * a twenty-five-dollar note, featuring King George and Queen Mary; * a fifty-dollar note, featuring Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI); * a one hundred-dollar note, featuring Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; * a five hundred-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister John A. Macdonald; * a thousand-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier. The previous Dominion notes, issued by the Minister of Finance, were rapidly withdrawn from circulation.Graham, p. xviii. The 1935 series was the only Bank of Canada series to include a twenty-five-dollar note and a five hundred-dollar note. The twenty-five-dollar note was a special commemorative note, for the twenty-fifth anniversary of George V's accession to the throne.Graham, p. 213. The five hundred-dollar note was a carry-over from the former government notes, which had included a five hundred-dollar note since 1871, to facilitate transfers of large sums between the banks. No subsequent series has had a note of the same denomination.Graham, p. 201. The 1935 series was also the only Bank of Canada series issued separately in English and in French. All series since then have been bilingual. To deter counterfeiting, the Bank regularly issues new series, replacing the old ones. There have been seven more series since the initial 1935 series: (1937, 1954, 1970, 1986, 2001, 2011), and the eighth series released in 2018. = Gradual elimination of chartered bank notes = A five-dollar note issued by the Bank of Montreal in 1942, showing bank officials; one of the last bank notes issued by a chartered bank in Canada. As the Bank of Canada became established, the federal government gradually reduced the power of the chartered banks to issue their own bank notes. In 1935, the banks were given ten years to reduce their notes in circulation to twenty-five per cent of their paid-up capital.Bank Act, Statutes of Canada 1934, c. 24, s. 61. A revision to the Bank Act in 1944 provided that the banks could not issue or reissue notes after the end of 1944, except outside Canada.Bank Act, Statutes of Canada 1944, c. 30, s. 61 The last note issued by a chartered bank for use in Canada was a five-dollar note issued by the Royal Bank of Canada in 1943.Graham, p. 200. The old banknotes were gradually withdrawn from circulation. In 1953, the last remaining power to issue banknotes, for use outside Canada, was abolished and the Bank of Canada became the sole issuer of Canadian notes.  Fixed and floating exchange rates  Since Canada has gone off the gold standard, it has fluctuated between fixed and floating exchange rates. The Canadian dollar currently has a floating exchange rate, since 1970. = Great Depression = As part of the reforms associated with the creation of the Bank of Canada and the economic difficulties of the Great Depression, Parliament also passed the Exchange Fund Act in 1935. The purpose of this Act was to create a fund, derived from the profits of the Bank of Canada, which would enable the government and the Bank to \\"aid in the control and protection of the external value of the Canadian monetary unit\\",Exchange Fund Act, Statutes of Canada 1935, c. 60, Preamble. i.e. to maintain the Canadian dollar at a certain rate against other currencies, if needed. However, the government did not use this power initially, allowing the dollar to float against other currencies.Powell, p. 51. = World War II and aftermath = The situation changed in the immediate run-up to World War II. Both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar began to slip against the United States dollar in August 1939, as war began to seem inevitable. Britain imposed exchange controls in early September. Canada followed in mid-September, imposing exchange controls under the War Measures Act, which gave extensive powers to the federal Cabinet.Powell, pp. 51-55. The government fixed the value of the Canadian dollar against the pound sterling ($4.43 buying and $4.47 selling) and also against the US dollar (Can$1.10 (US$0.9091) buying and Can$1.11 (US$0.9009) selling). The government also imposed strict currency controls on exchanges with foreign currencies, particularly the United States dollar. Those measures lasted throughout the war, with some changes to the fixed exchange rates. After the war ended, the government maintained the fixed rates and exchange controls for some years. However, that was balanced out by an unofficial exchange rate established by US markets, which triggered an extensive debate about the merits of a policy of floating exchange rates.Powell, pp. 56-60. = Floating rates: 1950 - 1962 = Bretton Woods participating nations display case In 1950, the federal government decided to switch to a policy of floating exchange rates, while maintaining the restrictions on currency exchanges. The rationale was a concern about an increase in inflation if the Canadian dollar continued to be fixed against the US dollar, as was required by the Bretton Woods agreement. The decision to switch to a floating rate called into question the need for restrictions on currency exchanges, and those restrictions were gradually lifted during 1951. At the end of 1951, the exchange restrictions were abolished entirely. Canada stayed on a floating exchange rate for twelve years, in spite of urgings from the International Monetary Fund to return to the fixed rate system under Bretton Woods.Powell, pp. 51-56. = Fixed rates: 1962 - 1970 = James Coyne, Governor of the Bank of Canada, 1955-1961 John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of Canada, 1957-1963 In 1961, a major policy disagreement occurred between the Governor of the Bank of Canada, James Coyne, and the government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. The Governor favoured keeping the exchange rate floating, coupled with a restrictive monetary policy. He came under criticism for that approach, since Canada was going through a period of high unemployment and low inflation. The Diefenbaker government favoured a return to fixed rates within the Bretton Woods system and a more expansionary monetary policy. The dispute escalated until Coyne resigned his position. The government introduced legislation to provide for a fixed rate, within a permitted range.Powell, pp. 66-70. Both the economic situation and the political controversies contributed to downwards pressure on the dollar. The Canadian government and the Bank of Canada negotiated with other countries and central banks for supports for the dollar. The government found it necessary to intervene in the money markets in support of the dollar. = Floating rates: 1970 onwards = In 1970, rising inflation and inflow of foreign exchange led to pressures on the dollar. The government was concerned that massive and expensive interventions in the foreign exchange market would be required to maintain the dollar within the fixed rate band. In May 1970, the government announced that it would allow the dollar to float. Although the decision was criticised by the International Monetary Fund, which continued to favour the Bretton Woods approach, within three years all major currencies were floating against the United States dollar. The Canadian dollar has had a floating exchange rate ever since.Powell, pp. 71-74. Duguay, a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, has stated that a flexible exchange rate favours a trading nation such as Canada, which produces commodities and also manufactured goods. He argues that a flexible exchange rate facilitates economic adjustment by sending important price signals to producers and consumers, encouraging prompt adjustments to changing economic circumstances. It also permits the Bank to adopt monetary policies which focus on controlling domestic inflation.  Current designs for coins and notes  = Coins = Canada's current coinage dates to 1937, when the Mint introduced new designs for the coins.Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 5. The new coins replaced the old designs which dated back to 1858, when the Province of Canada introduced its first coinage. The 1858 coinage had featured the monarch on the obverse of all coins, with a wreath of maple leaves surmounted by a crown on the reverse. The 1937 re-design continued to feature the monarch on the obverse of all coins, but introduced new patterns for the reverse of each coin: * One-cent (penny): two maple leaves; * Five-cent (nickel): a beaver; * Ten-cent (dime): the schooner Bluenose; * Twenty-five cent (quarter): a caribou; * Fifty-cent (half-dollar): Canadian coat of arms. These designs were all the work of Emanuel Hahn. With the exception of the withdrawal of the penny, these designs continue to be the basic features of Canadian coinage. This series of coins was augmented in 1987 by the introduction of a new one- dollar coin, featuring a loon on the reverse, designed by Robert-Ralph Carmichael. The coin quickly became known as the \\"loonie\\",The Royal Canadian Mint Currency Timeline, p. 8. which in turn has become a nickname for the Canadian dollar generally. The loonie was followed by the introduction of a two-dollar coin in 1996, designed by Brent Townsend. The two-dollar coin quickly acquired its own nickname, the \\"toonie\\". The effigy of the monarch on the coins was originally based on dies provided by the Royal Mint in London, first for King George VI and then for Queen Elizabeth II. The effigy of George VI was designed by Humphrey Paget. However, given the length of the Queen's reign, four different versions of her effigy have been used, updated with her age: 1953, 1965, 1990 and 2003. The 1953 and 1965 effigies were designed for the Royal Mint, by British artists: Mary Gillick and Arnold Machin. The Canadian coins using these effigies are similar to those used on other Commonwealth coins of those periods. The 1990 and 2003 effigies were designed by Canadian artists: Dora de Pedery-Hunt designed the 1990 effigy, and Susanna Blunt designed the 2003 effigy. Although these designs are the basic pattern for the coinage, the Mint regularly introduces commemorative coins, either for the entire series of coins, or on individual coins. Those commemorative issues are normally for a limited time period. = Notes = The current complete series of notes, known as the Frontier Series, is the seventh series of notes issued by the Bank of Canada. It consists of five notes: * a five-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier * a ten-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister John A. Macdonald * a twenty-dollar note, featuring Queen Elizabeth II * a fifty-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King * a one hundred-dollar note, featuring Prime Minister Robert Borden The different denominations of the Frontier Series were released individually, starting in 2011. The notes are made of polymer, rather than paper, and contain a number of anti-counterfeiting measures, such as holographic features and transparent sections.Bank of Canada Unveils Polymer Bank Note Series: Celebrating Canada's Achievements at the Frontiers of Innovation (Media Release, June 20, 2011). A new eighth series of notes began release in 2018. only one note in the new series has been released, a ten-dollar note featuring Viola Desmond. = Withdrawn coins and notes = All of the previous Dominion notes issued by the Minister of Finance, and notes of all former series issued by the Bank of Canada, are gradually withdrawn from circulation when a new series issues. That process can take some time. For example, the Minister of Finance only issued one series of one-hundred-dollar Dominion notes, in 1871. The last time a $100 Dominion note was turned into the Department of Finance was in 1918.Graham, p. 117. In addition to that routine withdrawal from circulation, there have been other withdrawals when a coin or note no longer serves a purpose: * the penny was withdrawn from circulation in 2013, because its value had depreciated so much it did not serve any true commercial purpose. Change for cash transactions is now rounded up or down to the nearest five cent.Royal Canadian Mint: Phasing out the Penny. * there has only been one twenty-five-dollar note, the Silver Jubilee note marking George V's twenty-fifth year on the throne, issued in the 1935 series. It was withdrawn from circulation on an ongoing basis.Graham, pp. 201, 213. * there has only been one five hundred-dollar note issued by the Bank of Canada, in the 1935 series. The five hundred-dollar denomination was a hold-over from the Dominion notes formerly issued by the Minister of Finance, and has not been repeated. Almost all of the 1935 five hundred-dollar notes have been withdrawn. * the last one-dollar note was issued in the Scenes of Canada series, starting in 1969-70 and continuing until the Birds of Canada series began in 1986. There was no one-dollar note in the Birds of Canada series because of the introduction of the one-dollar coin in 1987, which entirely replaced the one- dollar note.Bank of Canada Museum, Scenes of Canada Series, $1 note. * the last two-dollar note was issued in the Birds of Canada series, starting in 1986 and continuing until the Canadian Journey series began in 2001. There was no two-dollar note in the Canadian Journey series because of the introduction of the two-dollar coin in 1996, which entirely replaced the two-dollar note. * the last one thousand-dollar note was issued in the Birds of Canada series, starting in 1986. It was not included in the subsequent series because it was no longer needed for large cash transactions, in light of the growth of electronic transactions. In 2000, the Bank of Canada announced that the one thousand-dollar note was being withdrawn from circulation, on the recommendation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Increasingly, the thousand-dollar note was being used in criminal transactions, such as money laundering and organised crime.Bank of Canada Media Release, May 8, 2000: \\"Bank of Canada to Stop Issuing $1000 Note\\". Notes from previous series continue to be legal tender when in circulation. However, in the 2018 Budget, the government announced it intends to introduce legislation to change to the status of some withdrawn notes: the one-thousand dollar note, the twenty-five- dollar note, the two-dollar note and the one-dollar note will no longer be legal tender, but could still be exchanged at banks for current notes at full value.John Paul Tasker, CBC, February 28, 2018: \\"Budget says some paper currency will no longer be legal tender\\".

(formerly, The Swiss Colony, Inc.) is a mail-order and electronic retail company known for its cheese, sausage, chocolate, fruitcakes, and other food products. The company also features extensive offerings in furniture, home decor, apparel, entertainment products, and electronics. It is one of the largest direct marketers in the United States. History The company was founded in 1926 in Monroe, Wisconsin, a town with a strong concentration of Swiss immigrants and a storied history of cheese production. Ray Kubly, then a senior at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, completed a project for one of his classes by analyzing the business case for selling Green County cheese via mail order. Following graduation, Ray decided to pursue the venture and commenced operations from his family's basement. In the first year of operation, only 50 orders of cheese were shipped. The company grew steadily over time and attracted regional and national recognition. Sausage as well as bakery products and confections were added to the company's offerings. The company made its first entry into non-food merchandising in 1982. Colony Brands, Inc. and its affiliated companies now employ more than 4,500 people. Approximately 50% of these individuals work on a temporary basis during peak operations in fall and holiday seasons. In recognition of its strong roots in southern Wisconsin, the company sponsors the Swiss Colony Cheese Days Parade in Green County, Wisconsin every September in even numbered years. The company changed its name from The Swiss Colony, Inc. to Colony Brands, Inc. on June 1, 2010 in an effort to \\"better reflect its position as a parent company for our extensive portfolio of food and non- food catalogs, internet and subsidiaries.\\" Brands In addition to its namesake Swiss Colony brand, Colony Brands, Inc. operates catalog businesses under numerous names.

Produced in the liver FX when activated cleaves prothrombin to generate thrombin in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This process is vitamin K dependent and enhanced by activated factor V. The condition may be inherited or, more commonly, acquired. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may differ greatly, as apparently modifiers control to some degree the amount of FX that is produced. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms while others may experience life- threatening bleeding. Typically this bleeding disorder manifests itself as a tendency to easy bruising, nose bleeding, heavy and prolonged menstruation and bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth, and excessive bleeding after dental or surgical interventions. Newborns may bleed in the head, from the umbilicus, or excessively after circumcision. Other bleeding can be encountered in muscles or joints, brain, gut, or urine While in congenital disease symptoms may be present at birth or show up later, in patients with acquired FX deficiency symptoms typically show up in later life. Causes Inherited or congenital FX deficiency is passed on by autosomal recessive inheritance. A person needs to inherit a defective gene from both parents. People who have only one defective gene usually do not exhibit the disease, but can pass the gene on to half their offspring. Different genetic mutations have been described. In persons with congenital FX deficiency the condition is lifelong. People affected should alert other family members as they may also have the condition or carry the gene. In the general population the condition affects about 1 in 1 million people. However, the prevalence may be higher as not all individuals may express the disease and be diagnosed. In the acquired form of FX deficiency an insufficient amount of factor X is produced by the liver due to liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, buildup of abnormal proteins in organs (amyloidosis) or certain medications (i.e. warfarin). In amyloidosis FX deficiency develops as FX and other coagulation factors are absorbed by amyloid fibrils. Diagnosis Blood tests are needed to differentiate FX deficiency from other bleeding disorders. Typical are normal thrombin time, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time(PTT). FX antigen and its coagulant activity can be used to classify the severity of the condition: # Type I has low levels of FX antigen and activity. # Type II has low coagulant activity but normal or borderline FX antigen levels. The FX (F10) gene is found on chromosome 13q34. Heterogeneous mutations have been described in FX deficient patients. Treatment There are several treatments available for bleeding due to factor X deficiency. A specific FX concentrate was not available . # Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) supplies FX with a risk of thrombosis. # Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): This is relatively inexpensive and readily available. While effective this treatment carries a risk of blood-borne viruses and fluid overload. # If vitamin K levels are low, vitamin K can be supplied orally or parenterally. Treatment of FX deficiency in amyloidosis may be more complex and involve surgery (splenectomy) and chemotherapy. History The condition was described independently in the 1950s. Telfer and coworkers described a female patient named Prower in 1956 and Hougie and coworker described a male patient named Stuart in 1957. When experiments showed that serum from these two patients lacked the same factor, these two patients were the first people identified with FX deficiency and the factor was called Stuart-Prower factor, later factor X.

He became governor of West Jersey in 1697, and became governor of East Jersey in 1697. Basse was not an effective governor, however, after Andrew Hamilton returned to England in 1698, following an act of parliament which provided that \\"no other than a natural-born subject of England could serve in any public post of trust or profit.\\" Basse was unable to effectively maintain a good administration during his term of governorship, so finally Hamilton was reappointed as the governor on 19 August 1699. After being province secretary for Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury and entering the Cornbury ring, he was convicted during the governorship of John Lovelace for perjury.  Family history  Jeremiah Basse's mother was Mary Basse. Prior to her marriage to Jeremiah's father she was married to John Barkstead. Jeremiah Basse was the half brother of John, Francis and Joshua Barkstead, John Barkstead, the Barkstead's father was executed 1662, in london for regicide.New Jersey Land Registry showing family connections 1695March 30.

Jeremiah Basse also had a sister called Hester Basse. Hester married John Lofting 1659-1742 a merchant and manufacturer of engines. John Lofting Thimble and Fire Engine maker Lofting, John (c.1659‚Äì1742), merchant and manufacturer of engines, was a native of the Netherlands, one of at least two brothers. He later recorded that he 'lived seven years at Amsterdam with one of the masters of the fire engines there, and is thoroughly acquainted with the methods practised in those parts in quenching of fires' (DNB). He came to England, obtaining grants of free denization in July 1686 and August 1688. At the time of his marriage, at St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London, on 3 May 1689, Lofting was described as a merchant, aged about thirty, and resident in the parish of St Thomas Apostle, London. His wife was Hester Bass of St Michael Queenhithe, London, aged nineteen, sister of Jeremiah Basse, future governor of New Jersey. In June 1689 Lofting enrolled in the Company of Free Shipwrights, paying quarterage until January 1699, thereby becoming a citizen of London. In 1698 Lofting and Jeremiah Basse shipped goods to Perth Amboy, East New Jersey, in the Hester, a sloop owned by Basse. It discharged without calling at or paying New York customs dues, and the governor of New York seized the ship and sold it. Lofting and Basse appealed to parliament and took legal action, eventually receiving damages and costs of ¬£1890, but not before Lofting was declared bankrupt in March 1700.AN EARLY DECISION ON INTERCOLONIAL RIGHTS.

They form or have broken off from a larger cloud, and are generally sheared by strong winds, giving them a jagged, shredded appearance. Fractus have irregular patterns, appearing much like torn pieces of cotton candy. They change constantly, often forming and dissipating rapidly. They do not have clearly defined bases. Sometimes they are persistent and form very near the surface. Common kinds include scud and cloud tags.  Forms  A nimbostratus cloud in the background with a stratus fractus in the middle of the upper half of the image. Fractus are accessory clouds, named for the type of cloud from which they were sheared. The two principal forms are cumulus fractus (formerly, fractocumulus) and stratus fractus (formerly, fractostratus). Fractus clouds may develop into cumulus if the ground heats enough to start convection. Stratus fractus is distinguishable from cumulus fractus by its smaller vertical extent, darker color, and by the greater dispersion of its particles. Cumulus fractus clouds actually look like ragged cumulus clouds. They may originate from dissipated cumulus clouds, appearing in this case as white ragged clouds located at significant distances from each other. Cumulus fractus in particular form on the leading and trailing edges of summer storms in warm and humid conditions.NOAA Cloud Types - NOAA Chart of Different Cloud Types. Observing fractus gives an indication of wind movements under the parent cloud. Masses of multiple fractus clouds, located under a main cloud, are called pannus. Fractonimbus are a form of stratus fractus, developing under precipitation clouds due to turbulent air movement. They are dark-gray and ragged in appearance. Fractonimbus exist only under precipitation clouds (such as nimbostratus, altostratus or cumulonimbus), and don't produce precipitation themselves. Fractonimbus may eventually merge completely with overlying nimbostratus clouds.  Significance in thunderstorms  In rainstorms, scud often form in the updraft area where the air has been cooled by precipitation from the downdraft, thus condensation occurs below the ambient cloud deck. If scud are rising and moving towards the main updraft, sometimes marked by a rain-free base (RFB) or wall cloud, then the thunderstorm is still developing from rising scud. In addition to forming in inflow, fractus also form in outflow. Scud are very common on the leading edge of a thunderstorm where warm, moist air is lifted by the gust front. Scud are usually found under shelf clouds.

Background  His parentage is uncertain as he was either son of Bagha QaghanZizhi Tongjian, vol. 178 or Ishbara QaghanZizhi Tongjian, vol. 175. He was a subordinate khagan under Tulan Qaghan with title of Tolis Qaghan, ruling eastern tribes. He sent an ambassador to Sui dynasty in 597, requesting to marry to a Chinese princess. Pei Ju saw this as opportunity and told him to kill Tulan Qaghan's Zhou origin khatun Princess Qianjin (who was styled as Princess Dayi by Sui dynasty). Princess was murdered and emperor fulfilled his promise, sending Princess Anyi (ÂÆâ‰πâÂÖ¨‰∏ª) to marry him. However, Tolis' ambitious behaviour caused outrage to khagan. Tulan started to gather invasion party to attack Sui repeatedly in 597 and 599, only to be reported to emperor beforehand by Tolis every occasion. As a reaction, Tulan approached to Tardu to combine forces and attack Tolis. Attack was a success and Tolis had to flee to China after his brothers and nephews getting killed during invasion. In winter 599, he was created Qimin Khagan by Emperor Wen. Meanwhile Princess Anyi died and he was married to Princess Yicheng this time, a daughter of Yang Xie (Êù®Ë∞ê). Emperor also commissioned Zhangsun Sheng to build the city of Dali (Â§ßÂà©, in modern Hohhot) to house Qimin's people, and also sent an army to protect Qimin. Meanwhile Tulan was killed by his men causing Tardu to assume throne and claim title Bilge Khagan in 599/600. In winter 601, Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to command an army, in association with Qimin Khan as to attack Tardu.  Reign  After Tardu's subsequent defeat in 603, he fled to Tuyuhun. Having a cleared way Qimin assumed Turkic throne, definitely starting division between Western and Eastern wings of khaganate. In spring 607, he went to Luoyang to pay a visit to Emperor Yang. In summer, he was visited back by Yang. Khagan's display of submission and loyalty caused Emperor Yang to bestow much honor and wealth on him. When the senior officials Gao Jiong, Yuwen Bi (ÂÆáÊñáÂºº), and Heruo Bi privately expressed disapproval, Emperor Yang discovered their criticism and put all of them to death, while removing Su Wei, who also discouraged him from giving excessive rewards to khagan, from his post. In spring 609, Qimin made another visit to Emperor Yang and was rewarded with much treasure. He died later from an illness.  Family  He was married to Princess Anyi (ÂÆâ‰πâÂÖ¨‰∏ª) at first and later her death to Princess Yicheng (Áæ©ÊàêÂÖ¨‰∏ª). He also had a Tuyuhun concubine or wive.

The idea behind the promotion was to attract more fans to the game by offering 12 fluid ounce (355 ml) cups of 3.2% beer for just 10 cents each, a substantial discount on the regular price of 65 cents, with a limit of six beers per purchase but with no limit on the number of purchases made during the game.Lebovitz, Hal. \\"10,000 six packs?\\" The Plain Dealer June 9, 1974: 2C During the game, fans became heavily intoxicated, culminating in a riot in the ninth inning which caused the game to be forfeited due to the crowd's uncontrollable rowdiness and because the game could not be resumed in a timely manner. Background The Indians had previously held such promotions without incident, beginning with Nickel Beer Day in 1971. However, a bench-clearing brawl during the teams' last meeting one week earlier at Arlington Stadium in Texas left some Indians fans harboring a grudge against the Rangers. In Texas, the trouble had started in the bottom of the fourth inning with a walk to the Rangers' Tom Grieve, followed by a Lenny Randle single. The next batter hit a double play ball to Indians third baseman John Lowenstein; he stepped on the third base bag to retire Grieve and threw the ball to second base, but Randle disrupted the play with a hard slide into second baseman Jack Brohamer. The Indians retaliated in the bottom of the eighth when pitcher Milt Wilcox threw behind Randle's legs. Randle eventually laid down a bunt. When Wilcox attempted to field it and tag Randle out (which he did successfully), Randle hit him with his forearm. Indians first baseman John Ellis responded by punching Randle, and both benches emptied for a brawl. After the brawl was broken up, as Indians players and coaches were returning to the dugout, they were struck by food and beer hurled by Rangers fans; catcher Dave Duncan had to be restrained from going into the stands to brawl with fans. The game was not suspended or forfeited, no players from either team were ejected, and the Rangers won 3‚Äì0. After the game, a Cleveland reporter asked Rangers manager Billy Martin \\"Are you going to take your armor to Cleveland?\\" to which Martin replied, \\"Naw, they won't have enough fans there to worry about.\\" During the week leading up to the teams' next meeting in Cleveland, sports radio talk show host Pete Franklin and Indians radio announcer Joe Tait made comments that fueled the fans' animosity toward the Rangers. In addition, The Plain Dealer printed a cartoon the day of the game showing Chief Wahoo holding a pair of boxing gloves with the caption, \\"Be ready for anything.\\" The game =Problems from the beginning= Six days after the brawl in Texas, Cleveland's Ten Cent Beer Night promotion drew 25,134 fans to Cleveland Stadium for the Tuesday night game, twice the number expected. The Rangers quickly took a 5‚Äì1 lead. Meanwhile, throughout the game, the inebriated crowd grew more and more unruly. Early in the game, Cleveland's Leron Lee hit a line drive into the stomach of Rangers pitcher Ferguson Jenkins, after which Jenkins dropped to the ground. Fans in the upper deck of the stadium cheered, then chanted \\"Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again! Harder! Harder!\\" A woman ran out to the Indians' on-deck circle and flashed her breasts, and a naked man sprinted to second base as Grieve hit his second home run of the game. One inning later, a father-and-son pair ran onto the outfield and mooned the fans in the bleachers. As the game progressed, more fans ran onto the field and caused problems. Ranger first baseman Mike Hargrove was pelted with hot dogs and spit, and at one point was nearly struck by an empty gallon jug of Thunderbird. The Rangers later argued a call in which Lee was called safe in a close play at third base, spiking Jenkins with his cleats in the process and forcing him to leave the game. The Rangers' angry response to this call enraged Cleveland fans, who again began throwing objects onto the field. Someone tossed lit firecrackers into the Rangers' bullpen. In the bottom of the ninth, the Indians managed to rally, tying the game 5‚Äì5, and had Rusty Torres on second base representing the potential winning run. However, with a crowd that had been drinking heavily for nine innings, the situation finally came to a head. =The riot= After the Indians had managed to tie the game, a 19-year-old fan named Terry Yerkic ran onto the field and attempted to steal Texas outfielder Jeff Burroughs' cap. Confronting the fan, Burroughs tripped. Thinking that Burroughs had been attacked, Texas manager Billy Martin charged onto the field with his players right behind, some wielding bats. A large number of intoxicated fans ‚Äì some armed with knives, chains, and clubs fashioned from portions of stadium seats that they had torn apart ‚Äì surged onto the field, and others hurled bottles from the stands. 200 fans surrounded the 25 Rangers, with more fans coming. Realizing that the Rangers' lives might be in danger, Cleveland manager Ken Aspromonte ordered his players to grab bats and help the Rangers, attacking the team's own fans in the process. Rioters began throwing steel folding chairs, and Cleveland relief pitcher Tom Hilgendorf was hit in the head by one of them. Hargrove, after subduing one rioter in a fistfight, had to fight another on his way back to the Texas dugout. The two teams retreated off the field through the dugouts in groups, with players protecting each other. The teams fled into their clubhouses and closed and locked the doors. The crowd pulled up and stole the bases and anything else it found. Rioters threw a vast array of objects including cups, rocks, bottles, batteries from radios, hot dogs, popcorn containers, and folding chairs. Umpire crew chief Nestor Chylak, realizing that order would not be restored in a timely fashion, forfeited the game to Texas. He too was a victim of the rioters, as one struck and cut his head with part of a stadium seat and his hand was cut by a thrown rock. He later called the fans \\"uncontrollable beasts\\" and stated that he'd never seen anything like what had happened \\"except in a zoo\\". The rioting continued for 20 minutes. As Joe Tait and Herb Score called the riot live on radio, Score mentioned the security guards' inability to handle the crowd. Tait said, \\"Aw, this is absolute tragedy\\". The Cleveland Police Department finally arrived to restore order, arresting nine fans. Indians players escorted the Rangers to the team bus. Cleveland general manager Phil Seghi blamed the umpires for losing control of the game. The Sporting News wrote that \\"Seghi's perspective might have been different had he been in Chylak's shoes, in the midst of knife- wielding, bottle-throwing, chair-tossing, fist-swinging drunks\\".

After becoming a hospital ship in the First World War, Rohilla ran aground in October 1914 near Whitby with the loss of 83 lives. History Rohilla was ordered in 1905 by the British India Steam Navigation Company (BI) from Harland & Wolff Ltd of Belfast, at the same time as sister ship from William Denny & Bros at Dumbarton. They differed mainly in their engines: Rewa was triple-screw with steam turbines, while Rohilla had a pair of quadruple expansion steam engines, also made by Harland & Wolff, and twin screws. Rohillas engines totalled , producing on sea trials. Although ordered for the London to Calcutta service, increased competition prompted BI to design the two sisters to be suitable also as troopships. The steamship was named Rohilla in honour of the Rohillas, Pashtun highlanders who lived in Rohilkhand, east of Delhi, in the modern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. After entering service, the sisters were soon taken up for trooping, in 1908 for Rohilla as 'Troopship No.6'. Two years later they were the first BI ships to have radio receivers fitted, and were both hired in that year for the Coronation Fleet Review, carrying members of the House of Lords (Rewa) and House of Commons (Rohilla). Loss The steamship Rohilla grounded off the coast of England, 1914 Rohilla was called up at the outset of the First World War and converted into a naval hospital ship. HMHS (His Majesty's Hospital Ship) Rohilla had only a short life in that role. On 30 October 1914, sailing from South Queensferry, Firth of Forth for Dunkerque to evacuate wounded soldiers, the ship ran aground on Saltwick Nab, a reef about a mile east of Whitby, North Riding of Yorkshire, during a full North North East gale and with the lighthouses unlit due to the war. The reef is about offshore and the ship soon broke her back. The conditions made rescue extremely difficult, but six lifeboats the John Fielden, Robert and Mary Ellis (Whitby), William Riley of Birmingham and Leamington (Upgang), the motor lifeboat Bradford Middlesbrough, Queensbury Scarborough, North Yorkshire but it was the motor lifeboat Henry Vernon Tynemouth that was to take off the final souls and attempted to close on the wreck. BBC: Coast, Series 7 Over the next three days, some of those who attempted to swim to safety in the raging seas were rescued, though many were lost, and lifeboats were able to rescue others. In all, 146 of the 229 on board, including Captain Neilson and all the nurses, as well as survivor Mary Kezia Roberts, survived. Captain Nielson believed that the ship had struck a mine before grounding. An inquest jury exonerated Nielson from all blame and recommended that all passenger vessels carry rocket apparatus rather than rely on rockets fired to the ship from shore, and also that a motor lifeboat be stationed at Whitby. The Gold Medal of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the highest honour the institute could award, was presented to Superintendent Major H. E. Burton and Coxswain Robert Smith of the Tynemouth lifeboat Henry Vernon and to Coxswain Thomas Langlands of the Whitby lifeboat. The Empire Gallantry Medal (subsequently changed to the George Cross) was awarded to Burton and Smith in 1924.

It was founded in 1865 by Joseph Spiegel. Spiegel's main product is its namesake, the Spiegel catalog, which advertises various brands of apparel, accessories, and footwear. The company also distributes brands under the names of Newport News and Shape FX. Spiegel delivered its first mail order catalog to women across America in 1905. By 1925, the fashion and furniture retailer had 10 million customers. Spiegel sent buyers to Paris fashion shows, who brought European fashion trends to American homes. As of 2015, Spiegel sells women's style and fashion products, and is owned by Lynn Tilton, through her company Patriarch Partners. History =Early years= For the first 100 years of its history, Spiegel was primarily a family business. The company was founded in 1865 by German-Jewish entrepreneur Joseph Spiegel, the son of a German Rabbi and younger brother of Union Army Colonel Marcus M. Spiegel. After spending the final few months of the Civil War in a Confederate prison camp, Joseph Spiegel settled in Chicago, where his brother- in-law, Henry Liebenstein, ran a furniture business. With Liebenstein's assistance, Joseph Spiegel opened J. Spiegel and Company, a small home furnishings retail operation located on Wabash Avenue in Chicago's loop. In 1871, however, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed most of the area's business district, including the Spiegel store. After the fire, Joseph Spiegel and a partner named Jacob Cahn rebuilt the business, and by 1874 the company was prospering again under the leadership of the two men. Cahn retired from the business in 1879. In 1885 Spiegel began running regular advertisements in several Chicago newspapers, and the following year the company moved to a larger building on State Street. Joseph Spiegel's two oldest sons, Modie Spiegel and Sidney Spiegel, were brought into the business during this time. Spiegel issued its first catalogs in 1888. The catalogs were made available to potential customers who lived outside the city. Because a mail order system did not yet exist, the catalogs served instead to lure people into the downtown store. By 1892, however, the business had taken a turn for the worse, as many customers were slow to pay for their purchases. With debts mounting, the company went bankrupt. At Modie Spiegel's urging, the company reinvented itself as Spiegel House Furnishings Company of Chicago in 1893. The principal difference was that the new company, like many others in the furniture business, sold on credit. The decision to offer installment plans, and the timing of the decision, made possible Spiegel's expansion over the next several decades. =Expansion in the early 1900s= The new Spiegel was more successful, and in 1898 a branch store was opened on Chicago's South Side. Another South Side branch went into operation three years later. The company's slogan ‚Äì \\"We Trust the People!\\" ‚Äî reflected its emphasis on credit merchandising. In 1903, Joseph Spiegel's third son, Arthur, entered the business with a plan to develop mail order operations for Spiegel. After a couple years of lobbying, Arthur convinced the company hierarchy to open a mail order department, and in 1905, Spiegel became the first company to offer credit through the mail. The new service was reflected by the addition of a word to the company motto, which began to read: \\"We Trust the People-- Everywhere!\\" The response was phenomenal, and soon a huge, previously untapped base of customers was ordering from Spiegel's mail order catalog. Spiegel was the only company at that time that did not charge for credit. They continued this \\"no charge for credit\\" policy for another 50 years. In 1906, Spiegel's mail order sales were near $1 million. To handle the overwhelming success of the mail order operation, a new company ‚Äî Spiegel, May, Stern, and Company ‚Äî was formed, allowing the Spiegel House Furnishings Company to devote its limited resources to conventional retailing, rather than assume the debts associated with building up the mail order segment. Arthur was named President of the new company. In 1909, Spiegel introduced the teddy bear to the American consumer, for the first time nationwide, by offering it in its mail order catalog. The Ideal Toy Company partnered with Spiegel to launch this successful toy venture, and Spiegel continues to give its staff teddy bears to mark the company anniversary every year. Spiegel boldly began to diversify its line of products after 1910, offering apparel for the first time in 1912. After a couple of unsuccessful partnerships with independent clothing manufacturers, Spiegel, May, Stern and Company began offering its own line of women's apparel. The \\"Martha Lane Adams\\" line‚Äînamed after its fictional designer‚Äîwas so successful that it quickly became a wholly owned subsidiary of Spiegel, May, Stern, and Company and earned its own catalog. Martha Lane Adams' sales grew to nearly $2 million by 1916. That same year, Arthur Spiegel died of pneumonia at the young age of 32. Spiegel's next marketing breakthrough came in 1926, when company executive Ed Swikard introduced a promotional idea involving Congoleum floor covering. Swikard engineered a mailing to more than nine million residences, offering a pre-cut Congoleum package at a low cost. The response was again overwhelming, and company sales reached a record $16 million for the year, with a net profit of $4 million. In 1928, Spiegel, May, Stern and Company went public, although the Spiegel family retained a controlling interest, Spiegel stock prices hit $118 per share in 1928. =Great Depression= The Great Depression had a negative impact on Spiegel's business. In 1930, Spiegel's stock dropped to its lowest price of 7 cents. The following year, the Spiegels began gradually liquidating their retail furniture business. By 1932, the last Spiegel furniture store in Chicago closed its doors. After experiencing considerable economic losses in the early years of the Depression, Spiegel entered a period of growth and profits beginning in 1933. During this time, M.J. Spiegel, son of Modie, took over the leadership of the company. Spurred by a lenient credit policy (\\"no charge for credit\\"), the company's sales rose from $7.1 million in 1932, to more than $56 million by 1937. Furthermore, a $300,000 net loss was transformed into $2.5 million in profits. The aggressive marketing of easy credit as the company‚Äôs most important commodity drove the strategy behind this growth. When sales began to level off in 1938, Spiegel reacted by shifting its attention to consumers in a higher income bracket. The company began adding dozens of brand names with national reputations to its catalog. The new approach was referred to as the \\"quality concept,\\" and it brought success. =World War II and 1950s= The onset of World War II was disastrous for Spiegel. As much manufacturing had been shifted to wartime production, many of the products that were popular catalog items were no longer available in large quantities. Moreover, a shortage of labor affected the company's operations, and when buying on credit was officially discouraged by the US government, Spiegel management had to discard its \\"No Charge for Credit\\" policy. In 1942 and 1943 combined, the company lost $3.8 million. To reverse this trend, Spiegel began to open retail outlets once again in 1944, hoping to mimic the success of its larger competitors, Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward. That year, Spiegel acquired 46 Sally dress shops in Illinois. Several other chains were purchased over the next few years, and by 1948, Spiegel was operating 168 retail stores featuring a wide range of merchandise, including clothing, furniture, and auto supplies. After an initial success in retail, the costs of retail operations began to outweigh the benefits. By the mid-1950s, Spiegel was again concentrating on its former mainstay, mail order sales on credit. Although nearly all of the company's retail outlets were sold off by 1954, several catalog shopping centers were retained so that customers could ask questions and place orders with company representatives. The following year, Spiegel unveiled its Budget Power Plan, a liberal policy under which customers were offered a line of credit sometimes as high as $1,000, with very low monthly payments. The idea was to add as many names as possible to the Spiegel customer list. The company also began to include a widening range of products in its catalogs. This included outdoor products such as mowers and tillershttps://www.doovi.com/video/vintage-tiller- spiegelgilson-5hp/Hxf6QPGt_k8 and boats by the name Brooklurehttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/385761524326168636 as well as other products such as instrumentshttps://jedistar.com/old-kraftsman/. =1960s and 1970s= By 1960, sales were considerably more than $200 million and nearly two million people had Spiegel credit accounts. In addition, Spiegel was selling pets. In 1965, after a century of operation as a family business, Spiegel was purchased by Beneficial Finance Company. Spiegel stockholders received shares of Beneficial stock, and Spiegel became a wholly owned subsidiary of Beneficial. Spiegel benefited from television exposure and advertising in the form of prizes given away on several game shows, most notably The Hollywood Squares and Let's Make a Deal. Announcers emphasized Spiegel's large catalog offerings in on-air promotional announcements and included Spiegel's Chicago zip code, 60609. Often these programs would award contestants gift certificates of a certain dollar amount toward catalog items, giving winners the flexibility to choose their own prize. During the early 1970s, several charges were leveled against Spiegel by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding some of the company's marketing tactics. In 1971, the FTC accused Spiegel of failing to adequately disclose credit terms in some of its statements and catalog ads. The company also was cited for its handling of credit life insurance policies, as well as for offering free home trials without informing customers that credit approval was required before a product would be shipped. Moreover, in 1974, the FTC charged that Spiegel's debt collection policies treated customers unfairly. Most of the complaints brought by FTC during this period were settled by changes in company practices, and serious action by the government was generally avoided. Rising interest rates in the mid-1970s made financing credit accounts costly. Also during that time, Spiegel began to feel the pressure of competition from discount stores such as Kmart, which were rapidly establishing a national presence. In 1976, to help turn the company around, Beneficial hired Henry \\"Hank\\" Johnson, a veteran of the mail order operations of Montgomery Ward and Avon. One of Johnson's first moves was to streamline company management. Dozens of executives were let go, and overall employment was cut in half over the next five years, from 7,000 in 1976 to 3,500 in 1981. Johnson also closed Spiegel's remaining catalog stores. Johnson changed Spiegel's image to that of a \\"fine department store in print.\\" Accordingly, the Spiegel catalog was completely revamped; low-budget items were replaced by upscale apparel and accessories for career women. Merchandise bearing designer labels began appearing in 1980, when the company introduced a line of Gloria Vanderbilt products. =New direction in 1980s= Spiegel soon became a trendsetter in the catalog business, which was booming as a whole during the early 1980s. The company's sales grew at an impressive pace of 25 to 30 percent a year. Although Spiegel still ranked fourth in catalog sales during this time, trailing Sears, J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward, the company's strategies were being followed closely by its larger competitors. In 1982, Beneficial sold Spiegel to Otto-Versand GmbH, a large, private West German company prominent in catalog sales. Between 1982 and 1983, Spiegel's revenue shot from $394 million to $513 million, and the company's pre-tax profits more than doubled, reaching $22.5 million in 1983. The following year, control of Spiegel was transferred from Otto-Versand itself to members of its controlling family, the Ottos. Under its new ownership, Spiegel's transformation into an outlet for higher-end products continued. In 1984, Spiegel began distributing specialty catalogs in addition to its four primary catalogs; 25 of these specialty catalogs were in circulation by 1986, featuring Italian imports, plus-sized clothing, and other specialty items. That year, Spiegel mailed a total of 130 million catalogs, at a cost of $100 million, and company sales surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time. In 1987, six million shares of nonvoting stock was sold to the public, marking the first time since 1965 that Spiegel was not completely privately held. In 1988, Spiegel acquired Eddie Bauer, Inc., a retail chain specializing in sportswear and outdoor equipment from General Mills. Eddie Bauer, which also maintained a catalog operation, had annual sales of $260 million. In the first year following the acquisition, the chain was expanded from 60 to 99 stores. By 1989, Spiegel had become the number three catalog retailer in the United States, with a total circulation of about 200 million catalogs, including 60 different specialty catalogs, and an active customer base of five million. =New additions in early 1990s= In 1990, Spiegel acquired First Consumers National Bank (FCNB), which began issuing credit cards and statements to Spiegel and Eddie Bauer customers. That year, the company enhanced its image as the premier catalog for career women through an advertising campaign that featured actress Candice Bergen, who portrayed a career woman on the situation comedy \\"Murphy Brown.\\" The campaign also featured a specialty catalog promoted by Bergen, emphasizing the inconvenience of department store shopping and the relative ease of shopping by catalog. The company began to expand its retail outlet operations based on lines from its catalogs. Spiegel stores included ‚ÄúFor You From Spiegel,‚Äù which offered large-sized women's apparel, and Crayola Kids, providing a line of children's apparel first launched in 1991. In spite of these innovations, the company's growth stagnated due to the national economic recession, and earnings declined sharply in 1991. Slight gains were realized the following year as Spiegel's revenue topped $2 billion. Eddie Bauer performed particularly well, having grown to 265 stores. In August 1993, Spiegel announced its purchase of Newport News (formerly Avon Fashions), a catalog company specializing in moderately priced women's clothing. Later that year, Spiegel unveiled a new specialty catalog, E Style, featuring a clothing line aimed at African-American women. E Style represented a partnership between Spiegel and Ebony magazine that was formed as a means of targeting an untapped market of Spiegel consumers while also offering African-American women a clothing line more suited to their tastes. That same year, Sears discontinued its Big Book catalog sales operation and Spiegel and other specialty catalog retailers scurried to pick up the leftovers and increase their own share of the market. Spiegel reported total revenues of $2.6 billion in 1993. Sales at Eddie Bauer stores reached $1 billion that year, bolstered by 30 new outlets. Between Spiegel and Eddie Bauer, 81 different catalogs, with a total circulation of more than 313 million, were distributed in 1993. The company's specialty retail stores also performed well in 1993, generating $840 million in sales. =Innovations in the mid-1990s= In 1994, Spiegel formed a joint venture with Time Warner Entertainment to create two home shopping services for cable television. One of the services was named \\"Catalog 1,\\" and was planned as a one-channel showcase for a roster of numerous upscale catalog retailers, each of which would sell its goods using innovative entertainment-style shows. Participants in Catalog 1 in 1994 were The Bombay Company, Crate & Barrel, Eddie Bauer, The Nature Company, Neiman Marcus, The Sharper Image, Spiegel, Viewer's Edge, and Williams Sonoma. The channel was tested in five markets that year: Rochester, New York; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Nashua, New Hampshire; Columbus, Ohio; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Spiegel also teamed up with Lillian Vernon, Lands' End, and other catalogers in 1994 to create a computerized CD-ROM catalog. The company formed a partnership with MCI Communications Corporation that was aimed at increasing both companies' customer bases. MCI began offering a $35 Spiegel gift certificate to any customer who changed his or her long distance telephone service to MCI. MCI also offered an additional $20 certificate to any customer who remained an MCI user for at least six months. Around this time, Spiegel seriously began considering an entrance into the electronic shopping market through an online service such as America Online (AOL). In 1995, Spiegel did just that‚Äîbut at the expense of its year-old Catalog 1 venture. By this time, Catalog 1 had begun airing in three more test markets, raising its total presence to eight cities. Time Warner and Spiegel decided, however, that there was greater potential gain in launching a website for Catalog 1 and capitalizing on the increasing popularity of the Internet. Accordingly, they scaled back their cable television operation and began working on a home page through Time Warner's popular Pathfinder site. Spiegel also initiated an entrance into the Canadian market in 1995 and planned to distribute its catalog there by the spring of 1996. Previous strong Eddie Bauer business in Canada aided the company's decision to move in on a larger scale, as did the company's good distribution agreements in Canada. Meanwhile, Eddie Bauer was doing extremely well in Japan, where the company had placed numerous retail stores throughout the previous few years. The year 1996 marked the most profitable year in Eddie Bauer's history, and Spiegel's revenues benefited. Eddie Bauer's merchandise was so popular that year, in fact, the company suffered through many delays in shipping and out-of-stock merchandise occurrences that were direct results of increased consumer demand. Eddie Bauer also made headlines in 1996 when it introduced \\"Balance Day\\" to its employees, which was an extra day off per year to do anything they wanted. The addition demonstrated the company's commitment to providing innovative benefits to its workers, and employees began referring to it as \\"call in well day.\\" The company made an effort to find ways to offer its single workers benefits that were equal to those offered to its workers with families. =Late 1990s= Spiegel achieved $3.06 billion in 1997 revenue, with approximately $1.8 billion of that stemming from its Eddie Bauer operations. Regardless of Eddie Bauer's huge contribution to its parent company, however, the subsidiary had a very rough year. Following the immense demand for its products in 1996, the company mistakenly overproduced and overstocked in 1997. In addition, the new Eddie Bauer merchandise offerings did not hit home with consumers; thus the company was left with too much stock and no means of selling it all. In the August 17, 1998, issue of the Puget Sound Business Journal, Eddie Bauer's president and CEO, Rick Fersch, commented on the company's problems: \\"We were overplanned, overstocked, overstyled, overcolored--and it was overwarm (last winter) and that meant trouble.\\" The company began formulating plans to turn things around in 1998. The year 1998, however, brought additional challenges for the Eddie Bauer enterprise and, subsequently, for Bauer's parent company. Warmer than usual winter weather, brought about by a highly publicized weather phenomenon known as El Nino, once again hurt Bauer's sales figures. Spiegel's overall revenues for the year dropped to $2.94 billion as a result. Spiegel set out to halt its downward spiral and achieve profitability again. The company redesigned its Spiegel catalog, which had become something of an amalgam of differing‚Äîand often conflicting‚Äîitems and images. The company created a catalog solely to target the working woman and organized its main catalog so as not to place $1,000 designer outfits adjacent to $20 casual shirts, for example. Eddie Bauer also launched efforts to get itself back on track. By the end of the year, Spiegel announced that its efforts had been fruitful and that the company had achieved earnings once again. Although its revenue dipped during 1998, the company inked a profit and achieved positive cash flow, according to a fiscal year-end document released by Spiegel in early 1999. Eddie Bauer's performance, unfortunately, disappointed again during the year, but Spiegel's other lesser-known subsidiary catalog, Newport News, posted solid results. Late in the year, rumors surfaced that the company's positive results had led to numerous unsolicited purchase offers, including one from Arizona-based IG Holdings. As the new millennium approached, Spiegel had many obstacles to overcome. Having spent many decades in the shadow of companies such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward, Spiegel had come to be regarded as a leader in the catalog shopping industry by the 1990s. Relying on its past proven ability to adapt to changes in customer tastes and trends in competition, the company was attempting to maintain this status. =New millennium= After years of economic decline the company suffered large financial losses and changed ownership three times within ten years. The inability to stabilize management and its infrastructure crippled the billion-dollar empire. As a result, Speigel underwent numerous ownership and leadership changes. In 2003, Spiegel filed for bankruptcy and reorganization under the bankruptcy code. This included closing 60 Eddie Bauer stores.https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Spiegel-closing-stores-Eddie- Bauer-on-Post-in-2651884.php The following year, a group headed by Golden Gate Capital Partners and Pangea Holdings Ltd., purchased the Spiegel and Newport News catalog businesses. At the same time, the reorganizing company retained its Eddie Bauer unit and eventually assumed the name. From 2004, Spiegel and the women's fashion catalog Newport News operated under the name Spiegel Brands, Inc. In 2008, Spiegel was sold to an investment group led by Granite Creek Partners. In June 2009, Spiegel became a Lynn Tilton company following its sale to the private equity fund Patriarch Partners, LLC, and is currently operated under the name Spiegel LLC, having done business from 2009-2012 as Signature Styles, LLC and Artemiss LLC respectively. Spiegel's headquarters were moved to New York City. from Chicago and currently at 3500 Lacey Rd, Downers Grove, Il. In 2012, the leadership at Spiegel was replaced. The creative direction of the company was shifted to focus on digital media. In 2016, Spiegel claimed it would become the first American fashion catalog to feature a transgender model on its cover when Arisce Wanzer was selected. In 2018, Golden Gate Capital created a new company PSEB Group combining Pacific Sunwear(Pac Sun)which they acquired from bankruptcy with Eddie Bauer. Together, they had over 700 stores.https://www.retaildive.com/news/eddie- bauer-pacsun-combined-under-new-operating-company/525282/ Sometime between November 2019 and February 2020, Spiegel's website was shut down  References  External links * Official site(defunct) Clothing companies established in 1865 1865 establishments in Illinois Clothing companies based in New York City Privately held companies based in New York (state) Clothing brands of the United States Spiegel family ","title":"Spiegel (catalog)"},{"id":"4303344","text":"Bi≈Ñcze railway station is a railway station serving the village of Bi≈Ñcze, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland.

Auxier (born August 7, 1961) is a professor of philosophy and communication studies at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, a musician, environmental activist, union advocate, and candidate (2018) for the United States House of Representatives, nominated by the Green Party in the 12th Congressional District of Illinois. He is a radio host for WDBX Carbondale since 2001, a widely read author of popular philosophy, and also a co-founder and co-director of the AIPCT (The American Institute for Philosophical and Cultural Thought). Born in Leitchfield, Kentucky, Auxier is the younger of two children, the son of a veterinarian, Charles David Auxier (1931-) and a professional church musician, Eileen Gunter Auxier (1933-2016). Educated in the public schools of Memphis, Tennessee, he grew up during and was deeply affected by, the civil rights movement. He was one of the many students who were bused to integrated schools by court orders that resulted from Brown v. Board of Education. Auxier was in first grade when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and the event had a continual impact on him and the region he lived in. In philosophy, Auxier specializes in classical American thought, process metaphysics and theology, intensive logics, aesthetics, philosophical anthropology, and the philosophy of culture, of science, of religion, and of education. He teaches and writes on Giambattista Vico, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel, J.J. Bachofen, Charles Peirce, Henri Bergson, Josiah Royce, William James, John Dewey, Alfred North Whitehead, Ernst Cassirer, Susanne Langer, Charles Hartshorne, Jaakko Hintikka, Arthur Danto, and Umberto Eco.  Education and career  Auxier attended Graves Road Elementary School (1967‚Äì73), Graceland Junior High School (1973‚Äì76), and Hillcrest High School (1976-79), all belonging to the Memphis City Schools. Court ordered busing commenced in January 1973, and Auxier remained (by his own choosing) in public schools while most of his white schoolmates were sent to all-white private schools. Auxier attended Memphis State University (now called the University of Memphis) from 1979-1981, majoring in Criminal Justice. He left school in the fall of 1981, playing bass guitar and singing professionally in several local bands. He returned to Memphis State in the fall of 1984 and received an undergraduate degree in philosophy and criminal justice (magna cum laude) in 1986. He was awarded an assistantship at Memphis State to pursue a master's degree in philosophy, and began teaching in 1987. The MA was completed in 1988. He went on to receive a fellowship and assistantship to pursue doctoral work at Emory University, completing the Ph.D. in 1992. His dissertation examined the theories of signs and symbols that applied to the language of metaphysics, discussing principally the works of Cassirer, Langer, Peirce, and Eco. In the fall of 1992 he became assistant professor and chair (1992‚Äì97) of the philosophy department at Oklahoma City University, and was the founding director of the OCU Institute of Liberal Arts (1994‚Äì99). While at OCU, he also taught philosophy courses for several years at the nearby public high school Classen School of Advanced Studies. In 2000, he accepted a position at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in the philosophy department, where he remains. While he maintains his affiliation with the philosophy department at SIUC, his primary assignment moved to the department of communications studies in the fall of 2017. In 2016, Auxier was a visiting professor at the American Studies Center of the University of Warsaw, and in 2017 and 2018, he was visiting professor of philosophy in the Institute of Philosophy of the University or Warsaw. = The Pluralist = Auxier's interest in philosophical personalism led him to become editor of The Personalist Forum in 1997. The original publisher, Mercer University Press, dropped the publication that year, and Auxier was obliged to raise funds to keep the publication afloat until 2005, when the University of Illinois Press took on the publishing responsibilities for the journal. It was at this time that the title of the journal changed to The Pluralist and gained monetary support from both Oklahoma State University and Southern Illinois University Carbondale. At that time John Shook and Scott Gelfand from OSU became co-editors. After five years of publishing under the new name, The Pluralist became the official journal of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy in 2010. After this transition, Auxier continued to edit the journal until 2012. = The Library of Living Philosophers = In 2001, Auxier was appointed editor of the Library of Living Philosophers, the third in its history, following series founder Paul Arthur Schilpp (1938‚Äì1981), and Lewis Edwin Hahn (1981‚Äì2001). This series is important to scholars because it provides an opportunity to critics and supporters of a valuable philosophical figure to address the thinker, while still alive, regarding any problems or ambiguities that may have arisen around his or her thought over the course of his or her career. The central thinker then responds to these questions or concerns, and, thus, the volume provides the opportunity for a final and definitive discussion regarding the thought of a world-renowned contemporary philosopher. The series has a highly esteemed reputation as a fine scholarly publication, and it is known for its impeccable editing. During his editorship, Auxier worked with and completed volumes on Seyyed Hossein Nasr (2001), Marjorie Grene (2003), Jaakko Hintikka (2006), Michael Dummett (2007), Richard Rorty (2010),and Arthur C. Danto (2013). Figures whose volumes were completed after 2013 but for which Auxier was principal editor include Hilary Putnam and Umberto Eco. He initiated a volume on Julia Kristeva which is in progress. = The American Institute for Philosophical and Cultural Thought = In November 2016, in response to the decision of Southern Illinois University Carbondale to dismiss all staff and cease all projects of the Center for Dewey Studies. Auxier, along with John R. Shook and Larry A. Hickman (Director Emeritus of the Center for Dewey Studies) founded the American Institute of Philosophical and Cultural Thought. It is a federal 501 (c) (3) private foundation and is registered in the State of Illinois as a charitable organization. AIPCT dedicated to the continuation of the work of the Dewey Center, to the greatest extent possible, as well as to a broad range of other cultural and scholarly activities. It holds some 30,000 volumes specialized in American thought along with the papers of a number of distinguished philosophers and theologians of the 20th century. There are regular programs, seminars, public lectures, as well as fellowships and grants for long-term research and residency. AIPCT is affiliated with several scholarly organizations, including the Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought and the Foundation for the Philosophy of Creativity and works closely with the Special Collections Research Center of the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. = Works = Auxier has authored or co-authored many lectures and presentations around the United States and in other countries, has written many scholarly articles, book chapters, encyclopedia entries, and translations.A select bibliography of his edited works are included at the end of the wikipedia article. For Auxier's full list of edited works see his C.V.. He edited numerous books. Subjects on which he has published range from John Dewey and Alfred North Whitehead to the limits of evolution, biker bars, and rock music. His recent work includes Time, Will and Purpose: Living Ideas from the Philosophy of Josiah Royce, (Open Court 2013); Metaphysical Graffiti: Deep Cuts in the Philosophy of Rock (Open Court 2017), and, with Gary L. Herstein, The Quantum of Explanation: Whitehead's Radical Empiricism (Routledge, 2017). Auxier's journalism includes articles and book reviews for the Carbondale Nightlife and the Carbondale Times, and he authored articles and fiction for Empirical Magazine while it was operating. Auxier writes a regular blog for Radically Empirical, an online magazine that features essays and commentary on current and literary affairs. Auxier's creative works also include short stories, occasional poetry, and three music CDs. Auxier's areas of specialization are American philosophy, post-Kantian continental philosophy, process and systematic philosophy/theology, history of philosophy, metaphysics, moral philosophy, theology, political theory, and philosophy of education. He has been awarded the Jacobsen Prize in Process Metaphysics from the International Society for Universalism and the Douglas Greenlee Prize from the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. = Metaphysics and formal philosophy = Auxier defends a version of process-relational metaphysics called ‚Äúanalogical realism.‚Äù Built from his theory of analogy first articulated in his 1992 dissertation, he argues that the language of metaphysics should be divided into operational language and functional language.Randall Auxier, Signs and Symbols: An Analogical Theory of Metaphysical Language, PhD diss., Emory University, 1992. The former is ‚Äúsemiotic‚Äù and the latter ‚Äúsymbolic.‚Äù Semiotic metaphysical language is synchronic and derives from a prior act of spatialization in the symbolic domain. Semiotic, operational language analogizes terms by extracting relations between base term pairings that find comparison or contrast in the relations of their analogate pairings (i.e., four-term analogies that reveal relations of relations along three axes). These may be expressed as ordered pairs for some purposes, but the semiotic system of reasoning is non-monotonic and yields to W.V. Quine's critiques of under-determination and radical translation.For more of Quine's work on the radical translation problem, and related work on ontological relativity, see: W. V. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2013), 23-66; W. V. Quine, Ontological Relativity, and Other Essays (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969), 26-68. The mode of reasoning is extensional in semiotics and can be articulated (incompletely) in extensional logics of the sort devised by Gottlob Frege,For more, see: Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic a Logico-mathematical Enquiry into the Concept of Number, 2nd Revised ed. (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1980). Bertrand Russell, and Alfred North Whitehead.For more, see: Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, Principia Mathematica, vol. 1-3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1950). Symbolic language in metaphysics conveys meaning through three- term analogies in which a single base term is concretely differentiated through concrete, temporal processes. Such processes are brought to language by poetic insight which provide the ‚Äúbasis phenomena‚Äù (Cassirer's term) of human experience. These primal symbols are active and uncompletable, corresponding to ‚Äúideas‚Äù where signs correspond to ‚Äúconcepts,‚Äù a distinction drawn from Immanuel Kant's terminology. Symbol creation and symbolic consciousness operates first in mythic and expressive and exclusively social sensus communus.For more, see: John D. Schaeffer, Sensus Communis: Vico, Rhetoric, and the Limits of Relativism (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1990). Symbols grow into cultures that increasingly refine themselves through sameness and difference, and symbols are the basis of any concrete, temporal consciousness, including historical consciousness. Auxier holds that symbolic reasoning is expressive, emotive, diachronic, and largely unreflective (capable even of falling below the threshold of conscious thought). Semiotic reasoning, by contrast, is largely reflective, cognitive, representational, and synchronic. Auxier's theories of actuality, potentiality, and possibility derive from these distinctions. He argues that possibility should be thought of (hypothetically) as uncreated and unaffected by temporal passage. The same constellations of possibilities retain their intensive modes of order regardless of whether one constellation becomes an ingressing collection and informs what is actual. The same order is available, and in part intelligible to human beings, whether they are ‚Äúmight-have-beens‚Äù or ‚Äúmight be's‚Äù and are indifferent to actuality. Potency is possibility limited by past actuality and wholly included in the constellations of possibility. Potency is defined as those immanent orderings of possibility not yet eliminated by present actuality. Potency draws its form from those collections of possibility that exemplify constellations whose status relative to actuality is ‚Äúmight-be.‚Äù Auxier argues that possibility is immediately experienced by human beings, and that its form is inferred by means of contrast with the experience of the ‚Äúegress‚Äù of possibility. Actuality is cognized only indirectly.For more, see: Randall Auxier and Gary Herstein, The Quantum of Explanation: Whitehead's Radical Empiricism (New York: Routledge, 2017), 143-192. = Method and logic = Auxier is a radical empiricist in method, following James, Bergson, and Whitehead.For more, see: Randall Auxier and Gary Herstein, The Quantum of Explanation: Whitehead's Radical Empiricism, 39-50. Radical empiricists hold that experience as human beings have it includes all the relations needed to bring it into adequate, applicable, and logically rigorous form. Radical empiricism requires that disjunctive and conjunctive relations be treated as equiprimordial, and insists that nothing in experience shall be excluded from philosophical consideration, even where its place in experience is not yet clear to us. The philosophical orientation of radical empiricism also forbids that a viewpoint may rely upon ‚Äútransempirical or unempirical support for its assertions. Purely a priori or supernatural notions can be entertained as possibilities, but may form no part of the basis for a philosophy. Radical empiricism embraces fallibilism and the primacy of open-ended, non-monotonic, intensive reasoning. Auxier holds that the largely extensive forms of reasoning that characterize spatialized sign-operations are guided by reflective norms of thinking overlap with but are not identical to the norms of temporal, functional symbol-thinking. Symbolic thinking rarely yields to reflective norms except through long practice and habituation, and most reflective norms that establish criteria for evaluating good semiotic thinking are irrelevant to high-functioning symbol-thinking. One does not persuade a person of the value of a course of thinking by means of reflective norms, which are emotionally sterile. Persuasion requires the use of symbol functions. Thus, Auxier's work in logic focuses on the relation between reflective and active thinking. Intensive logic is treated as the ground of all extensional logic, and extensional logic (along with all mathematical thinking above basic counting) is grounded in rearrangements of operational sign relations. Infinitely many extensional schemes are possible of the basis of intensive symbol functions, but all are well encompassed by the four-term semiotic schema Auxier provides. He treats Bergson's qualitative calculus and Whiteheads genetic and coordinate analyses as exemplars of his sign-theory. Auxier favors and teaches the analytical syllogistics of Delton Thomas HowardFor more, see: Delton Thomas Howard, Analytical Syllogistics: A Pragmatic Interpretation of the Aristotelian Logic (New York: AMS Press, 1970). as a normative formalization of active thinking, and Susanne Langer'sFor more, see: Susanne Langer, An Introduction to Symbolic Logic, Third Revised ed. (New York: Dover, 1967). logic as an imaginative formalization of spatialized thinking, when removed from metaphysics and treated as a separate system of extensional thinking. Auxier emphasizes the role of imagination in symbol creation in line with Kantian and neo-Kantian theories, such as Cassirer's.For more, see: Randall Auxier, ‚ÄúErnst Cassirer and Susanne Langer,‚Äù in A Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, vol. 2, eds. Michel Weber and Will Desmond (Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2008), 552-570. = Philosophy of culture = Auxier's theories in the philosophy of culture derive from the ideas of Giambattista Vico,For more, see: Randall Auxier, ‚ÄúImagination and Historical Knowledge in Vico: A Critique of Leon Pompa's Recent Work,‚Äù Humanitas, 10:1 (1997), 26-49. Kant, F.W.J. Schelling, J.J. Bachofen, Friedrich Nietzsche, Cassirer and a number of post-humanist critics, such as Michel Foucault,For more, see: Randall Auxier, ‚ÄúFoucault, Dewey and the History of the Present,‚Äù in Journal of Speculative Philosophy, vol. 16:2 (2002), 75-102. and Jacques Derrida. He holds that culture is not defined by any single source, such as language, but from multiple sources of experience that are continuous with the animal world, and even the ‚Äúworlds‚Äù of plants and temporal processes that are non-biological. He argues that the organization of the cosmos in the broadest sense already includes not only the potentiality for life, but also for precisely the organizations of energies that characterize human life as dedicated to the creation of symbols and signs, as well as the modes of response we call ‚Äúconsciousness.‚Äù Thus, culture is an activity of animals (including but not limited to humans) in concert with and embedded form of potencies already characteristic of the physical universe and the modes of order it currently exhibits. Auxier follows Cassirer in holding that the human consciousness of the development of culture is conditioned by symbol creation, which proceeds along at least three fundamental lines: myth, language, and objectivating consciousness. But Auxier disagrees with Cassirer's emphasis upon the symbol as the criterion of difference between human and animal cognition, and argues that animals not only possess symbolic consciousness, but that human culture is unimaginable with the contributions of animal conscious, including human consciousness in its animal functions. Auxier also holds that consciousness wholly devoid of reflection may exist, although it would not exist in such a way as to preclude reflection in some remote temporal development. Auxier holds that mythic consciousness endures as human culture is increasingly refined and is never far from the basis of human thinking. He holds that most human thinking is communal, embodied, and active, while individual thinking is most often a pathology of symbolic consciousness. Auxier opposes both old-style humanism and every form of individualism. The individual is not the inevitable and crowning jewel of cultural development, contrary to the views of Cassirer, Dewey and other classical liberals. Rather, the active, embodied community is the primary achievement of cultural activity. Auxier does not accept views of Western superiority or triumphalism as defensible philosophically. He holds that valuable life and fully human development is evident in traditional human life and that the individualism of the Western world is a tragic development. Here his views accord with those of Whitehead and Josiah Royce.For more, see: Randall Auxier, Time, Will and Purpose: Living Ideas from the Philosophy of Josiah Royce (Chicago: Open Court, 2013), 125-162: Auxier writes widely on popular culture and defends the aesthetic and philosophical importance of so-called ‚Äúlow culture,‚Äù such as jazz, blues and rock music, popular television and cinema, and best-selling fiction. He uses the vehicle of popular culture to explain and illustrate his more formal philosophical views, especially regarding aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Auxier sees popular culture as continuous with high culture and generally to be preferred over high culture as livelier and more important to the community as a whole.For more, see: Randall Auxier, Metaphysical Graffiti: Deep Cuts in the Philosophy of Rock (Chicago: Open Court, 2017) , the selective bibliography below, and Auxier's C.V.. = Ethics and political philosophy = In ethics and political philosophy, Auxier is a personalist. Following primarily the views of Royce, Borden Parker Bowne, Edgar Sheffield Brightman, and Martin Luther King, Jr.For more, see: Randall Auxier, Royce's Conservatism,‚Äù in The Pluralist, 2:2 (summer 2007), 44-55; a special issue on Royce's ethical philosophy (the selected proceedings of the Josiah Royce Society Conference in Oklahoma City, OK, April 2006). Given that all human experience comes in the personal form, it is unproblematic to reason upon the assumption of the existence and value of persons. He does not assert that the impersonal does not exist or that person is the only value in the universe, only that all moral reasoning relevant to forming a moral philosophy is in fact conditioned by its source in the personal form of experience. Auxier holds that communities are persons in a more concrete and more enduring sense that are biological individuals. Individuals draw their personalities from the active nurture of their communities, but also come to transcend that activity and grow in directions not determined by the various agencies and institutions of their community of origin. The highest value of the community and the aim of social life is the fullest available determination of ‚Äúthe beloved community‚Äù (Royce, King),For more, see: Randall Auxier, Time, Will and Purpose: Living Ideas from the Philosophy of Josiah Royce, 243-285. For more on the relationship between Royce's and King's use of the idea, see: Gary Herstein, \\"The Roycean Roots of the Beloved Community,\\" The Pluralist 4, no. 2 (2009), doi:10.1353/plu.0.0013. which is wholly actual in the present, but left vague by the unwillingness of the community to act on it. Auxier understands the beloved community upon the transcendental logic of Jean- Jacques Rousseau's idea of ‚Äúthe general will‚Äù: that in every social circumstance there exists an optimal course of action, and that course of action is the general will (what people would each and all choose if they could discern it). The beloved community is the general will, Auxier holds. He allows that corporations and other historical institutions are indeed persons, but often dysfunctional persons whose community values and structures beget alienated and pathological individuals. Auxier holds, contrary to classical liberalism, that politics is a subdivision of ethics and cannot be divorced from human moral life. He holds that the dignity of personality is the highest value in the field of values humans are capable of recognizing, and includes the ani mal and plant worlds as forms of existence that exemplify in some degree, however slight, personality. Auxier insists that humans are morally obliged to remain open to the possibility that personality characterizes the whole order of the cosmos, not just the portion regarded as living or human, and must consider that possibility in forming and enacting their ethical (including political) values. Auxier is a communitarian and sympathizes with the ideas of such classical conservatives as David Hume, Adam Smith, and Edmund Burke, insofar as they agree that meaningful change is always slow, what happens to the least in the community happens to the whole community, that economic development must include in its very conception the entire community. He holds with Royce and Gifford Pinchot that conservation of nature is the basis of democratic life and that whatever damages nature also damages democracy. He holds that communities which produce independent individuals will both benefit from that process and suffer from the inevitable betrayals that strong individuals choose, in their tragic isolation.For more, see: Randall Auxier, Time Will and Purpose: Living Ideas from the Philosophy of Josiah Royce, 285-308. Auxier teaches and advocates a version of nonviolence that derives from both King and Mohandas Gandhi. He argues that almost every problem confronted by human beings, individually and collectively, are solved without the use of violence and that therefore resorting to violence is an aberration in human experience. This is why it requires justifications that always rely upon the logic of exceptionalism. Auxier argues that one hundred percent of human problems can be solved without violence and that the use of violence never genuinely solves any human problem. = Aesthetics = Auxier holds that aesthetic feeling is the basis for both meaning and symbol creation. He defends a view of images that draws from Bergson's account in Matter and Memory (1898). The movement of images is prior to the experience of them by localized, temporal centers of action (including human selves). A prehended feeling (or fundamental relation) is responded to by other feeling, each creating a fleeting presentational space that arrests the encounter of images. Through the creation of increasingly deep presentational spaces, images accrue histories of feelings and responses, building intensive histories of achievement. In the higher phases of this process, with intensities within intensities many times embedded in increasingly complex and temporally delicate spaces of presentation, reversions of feeling begin to create leaps between and among spatialized repositories of past feeling. To traverse these spaces, immediate encounters with possibility must be tapped to give form to a relation across primal presentational spaces.For more, see: Randall Auxier, ‚ÄúImage and Act: Bergson's Ontology and Aesthetics,‚Äù in Sztuka i Filozofia / Art and Philosophy, 45 (2014), 64-81. The active over- determination of images, their restriction within a unified space, is a condition for these leaps among base images (this is Auxier's interpretation of Cassirer's basis phenomena,For more, see: Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms: The Metaphysics of Symbolic Forms, ed. John. Michael Krois and Donald Phillipe Verene, Trans. John Michael Krois, Vol. 4 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996). joined to a Whiteheadian theory of symbolic reference).For more, see: Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, ed. David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne, Corrected ed. (New York: Free Press, 1978), 168-183. The over-determination of an image comes at the cost of ‚Äúerror‚Äù in Whitehead's sense of the word, which is the cost of transmuting temporal processes into spatial relations. The process of active thinking in human beings is a process of error by over-determination of images. The formation of symbols from fundamental feeling is the process of determination, but it can be carried out without full conceptualization. Symbols are fundamentally open and infinitely interpretable. Concepts are always erroneous over-determinations of feeling carried out as a condition of conforming the symbols to the requirements of reflection. Symbols are made into signs and signs are the basic units of reflective activity. The creative arrangement of signs follows a kind of reflective intuition (Bergson) or secondary reflection (Gabriel Marcel)For more, see: Gabriel Marcel, Metaphysical Journal (City?: Henry Regnery, 1952). that provides a feeling of creative power that is basic to the creation of art. Auxier rejects the idea that genuine art can be created without reflection. The experience of aesthetic space in reflective intuition is also the basis of the human recognition of beauty in nature. The feeling is, as Kant described, one of feeling as if nature's balanced asymmetries were already adapted to the forms of human sensation, and for the delight of the cognizing person.For more, see: Immanuel Kant, Critique of Judgment, trans. Werner S. Pluhar (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett, 1987). The development and deployment of symbols for the stimulation of the senses in accordance with the forms of reflective intuition is the basic activity of all artists, according to Auxier. Auxier has argued that music has a singular place in the formation of both human feeling and human culture.For more, see: Randall Auxier, Metaphysical Graffiti: Deep Cuts in the Philosophy of Rock. He follows the aesthetic theory of Susanne Langer in this regard, but departs from her understanding of the relation of time with rhythm and feeling, especially where Langer fails to recognize the complementarity between her views of image and Bergson's views. For Auxier the musical images are fundamentally hybrid units existing both in rhythmic repetition and acoustic space. The space is, as Langer asserts, virtual, but it is more than a ‚Äúsemblance‚Äù or ‚Äúprimary illusion.‚Äù The experience of the egress of possibility in musical experience is what forms the auditory image and then leaves behind not a sound but a tone. The existence of the tone requires reflection both to create and to hear, and is thoroughly virtual. However, the unheard context of the tone egresses and constitutes the ground of the intelligibility of the tone. Auxier holds that visual images are much more complex and mediated, by comparison, and that the most likely hypothesis about our experience of visual images and the virtual space in which they exist for our perception, is that humans learned to create this space by generalizing from their experience of the contrast between sounds and tones. Tones are concrete symbols. Musical notes are semiotic determinations of these tones. = Philosophy of science = Auxier applies his metaphysics, logic, ethics and aesthetics to the critique of science by opposing reductionist and model-centric versions of scientific knowledge. He defends the principle of evolution but writes against Darwinism and other narrow versions of the science. Where evolutionary science crosses into making philosophical claims unsupported by the science itself, Auxier calls scientific theorists back toward humbler conclusions that genuinely carry scientific warrant.For more, see: Randall Auxier, ‚ÄúThe Death of Darwinism and the Limits of Evolution,‚Äù in Philo, 9:2 (fall-winter 2006), 193-220. He also writes against Einstein's philosophical conclusions drawn from the theory of General Relativity, which Auxier regards as primarily a philosophical rather than a scientific theory. Auxier favors open and temporalist ideas in science, and sympathizes with the physics of the quantum vacuum and the evolutionary theories that see continuity between the physical creation of spaces of life and biological developments along particular lines. Auxier's theory of the quantum of explanation, developed with Gary L. Herstein, holds that all explanation (especially scientific explanation) depends upon a structure, called ‚Äúthe quantum‚Äù (following Whitehead's usage) drawn from concrete reality and hypothesized as an irreducible unit for the purposes of some determinate inquiry. While Auxier and Herstein are realists in science, they are realists about this quantum, which they hold to be basic to the structure of both cognition and understanding. The quantum is, in Auxier's view, an overdetermined image modeled precisely and carefully to serve as the exact unit which is irreducibly present in the whole which is to be explained. Explanation thus moves from the analysis of a presupposed coordinate whole by means of a genetic specification of the order immanent in the quantum. Thus, all scientific knowledge proceeds by a kind of mereotopology, by the creation of s suitable space of explanation and a re-enactment of its primary characters according to the complex features immanent in the quantum.For more, see; Randall Auxier and Gary Herstein, The Quantum of Explanation: Whitehead's Radical Empiricism, 66-81. The ability to identify and describe a quantum for these purposes is a kind of talent that some people possess as a refinement of their aesthetic reflective intuition. Thus, scientific genius is no less aesthetic in character than artistic genius, in Auxier's view.Or in Mathematics. For more, see: Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh, The Mathematical Experience (New York: Mariner Books, 1999). = Theology and philosophy of religion = Auxier holds that theology must be done in accordance with the methods and norms of philosophy and that even when theology is the source of new methods and forms of analysis (for example, Duns Scotus's theory of transcendentals or Friedrich Scheiermacher's hermeneutics), these methods and forms must be judged according to philosophical rather than theological norms. Thus, while religious practice in no ways depends upon theology, theology is completely dependent at the level of norms and methods (not content) on philosophy. Good theology must therefore be first and foremost philosophically sound. Theology takes on at the level of faith the assumption of the existence of divinity, of revelation, and of the reality of the good. Upon these three suppositions, theology may proceed along paths that philosophy does not travel. With Royce Auxier holds that doing philosophy does depend upon an act of philosophical faith in the intelligibility to us of the universe, but this requires no idea of divinity, revelation, or the good; it requires only an idea of the whole, of insight into that whole, and of the better and worse, not of good or evil. Auxier defends a pluralistic and culturally embedded ideal of human religious life, holding that ritual, which is found in the animal world in full continuity with the human world, viewed as a version of animality. Auxier argues that myth is superadded to ritual as an independent companion to it, making a second aesthetic level tinged with reflection available to humans who enact rituals. He rejects the claim that myth developed to explain ritual as an overly reductive and unknowable hypothesis. Auxier argues that the experience we call ‚Äúreligious‚Äù in the higher phases of experience is not reducible either to aesthetic or to cognitive experience and is a distinctive and nearly universal characteristic of human life. Auxier holds that religious experience can be engendered both through the repetition of rituals and through the experience of novelty (in nature or other cultures), but the novelty must be integrated into the familiar patterns in order for the feeling of value it carries to be retained. Thus Auxier believes that the religious community in which a human being is raised becomes the basis for the integration of future religious experiences that are not explicit in the experience of that community. His theology would generally be identified as liberal and Protestant, but along the Arminian and Wesleyan lines of Protestantism. Auxier commonly criticizes Calvinist views in his writings, sometimes quite harshly.  Politics and activism  Beginning with his musical explorations during his residence in Atlanta, Auxier became active in environmental causes and simultaneously in politics. These activities included protesting the First Gulf War, and every subsequent war the US has prosecuted, as well as various other forms of social injustice and oppression. His commitment to nonviolence, environmental conservation, and community localism has led him to participate, organize, speak, and perform music at hundreds of events and for many causes. He visited the imprisoned to spread music in Oklahoma and Illinois, as well as visiting nursing homes and homes for the developmentally disabled, most often as a musician. Auxier joined the Illinois Education Association in 2000 and was elected to the Departmental Representatives Council, supporting the SIU Faculty Association during collective bargaining cycles of 2001 and 2003. In 2006 Auxier was drafted to join the bargaining team for the SIUC FA and served in that role through the completion of the 2006-2010 agreement. Resuming this role for the 2010-2014 contract, Auxier was among the leaders of the SIUCFA that went on strike, November 3‚Äì9, 2011. The strike successfully produced a new agreement. the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board later adjudicated the administration and Board of Trustees of SIUC of bargaining in bad faith, bringing about the strike, and required them to pay a 1.7 million dollar settlement. Auxier testified at these proceedings and assisted the claimant's legal team, the Illinois Education Association. Auxier remains as an active member of the IEA. In 2000 Auxier joined the Green Party, Shawnee Chapter. As an environmentalist he fought road development, Walmart and other issues in the community, challenging local government and business interests over development plans. Auxier spoke from his radio show, wrote for local papers, spoke and played at rallies and meetings, and participated in the electoral efforts of the Green Party. In 2016, Auxier ran as a recognized Green Party candidate for Jackson County Board, District 3, and received 6% of the vote, establishing the Green Party in that district. In October 2017 Auxier was caucused, in Nashville, Illinois, as the recognized candidate of the Shawnee Green Party to run for US Congress, 12th District of Illinois, where the Green Party is an established party by state electoral requirements. His candidacy became official December 4, 2016 and has been endorsed by the Illinois Green Party.

Biography Fairfax was born in Sydney, the eldest son of Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax and Marcie Elizabeth (Betty) Wilson. He is the grandson of Sir James Oswald Fairfax (1863‚Äì1928) and David Wilson (1879‚Äì1965). Educated at Cranbrook School, Geelong Grammar School and Balliol College, Oxford, he became a director of John Fairfax & Sons Ltd in 1957 and took over from his father in 1977. He resigned in 1987 and sold his shares to his half brother Warwick Fairfax, during 'young Warwick's' ultimately disastrous takeover bid. Fairfax published a memoir in 1991. He died on 11 January 2017 at the age of 83. Philanthropy and honours A prominent art collector, initially of Australian art, and from the 1960s increasingly of European old masters. He was a generous supporter of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the National Gallery of Australia. A catalogue of his collection of art was published to accompany an exhibition held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, between April and July 2003. In 2015, Fairfax's net worth was estimated in the BRW Rich 200 to be 302 million, comprising a mix of property, diversified investments and an extensive collection of art and antiques. The James Fairfax Yard building in the Holywell Manor complex at Balliol College, Oxford is named in his honour for his donations to the college. He was appointed an Officer (AO) of the Order of Australia in 1993 in recognition of service to the arts and to the community; and a Companion of the Order (AC) in 2010 for eminent service to the community through support and philanthropy for the visual arts, conservation organisations and building programs for medical research and educational facilities. In 2016 Fairfax gifted his Retford Park, Bowral property to the National Trust of Australia.

His rifles feature a tubular magazine under the barrel similar to a Winchester rifle; the cartridge lifter was the key to the Kropatschek design. One of his designs was sold to the French Navy, and was later adapted by the French Army in the development of the prolific Lebel rifle, which served as France's front-line rifle from 1886 through the First World War. According to historian Roger A Pauly, some people joked that more bullets from Kropatschek-designed rifles were fired at the Austrians, than by them. Kropatschek's tubular magazine design was also adapted to the German Mauser Model 1871 rifle, resulting in the Model 71/84. Kropatschek was a contemporary of Ferdinand Mannlicher in their affiliations with the Steyr munitions company, but they had competing designs. The Steyr Kropatschek rifles featured the tubular magazine and the Steyr Mannlicher rifles featured a box magazine. The limiting factors of the tubular magazines were: a risk of pointed tip bullets firing the primer of the next cartridge in the tube, decrease in magazine capacity in short weapons such as carbines (shorter tubes), a shift in the rifle's point of balance as the magazine is depleted, and lack of any significant firing speed advantage in prolonged engagements over single-shot weapons (since cartridges had to be loaded one by one in contrast to magazines designed to use clips). An advantage of the box magazine is quick reloading by inserting a full en bloc or stripper clip.

Cumulonimbus calvus develops from cumulus congestus, and its further development, under auspicious conditions, will result in cumulonimbus incus. This cloud consists mainly of water droplets. By definition of cumulonimbus cloud, at its top water droplets are transformed into ice crystals. But for cumulonimbus calvus, content of ice crystals are meager and polar are in early stage, so cloud tops still look round and puffy. Cumulonimbus calvus is characterized by distinctive (between other types of cumulonimbus cloud) rounded shape and relatively sharp edges of its top area, unlike cumulonimbus incus or cumulonimbus capillatus, which have cirriform tops. Developing cumulonimbus calvus lose sharp outlines of the top as more water droplets transform into ice crystals. Strong updrafts may form pileus or thin vertical stripes may protrude upwards out of the cloud. When upper parts of the cloud freeze to a greater extent and clearly visible cirriforms appear, cumulonimbus calvus metamorphoses into another species of cumulonimbus. Cumulonimbus calvus arcus is a sub-form of cumulonimbus calvus, which has arcus cloud ahead of cloud's front. Hazards Like other cumulonimbus clouds, cumulonimbus calvus can cause severe weather conditions including: *Lightning; these clouds produce lightning. *Wind; these clouds may produce strong winds especially during a downburst *Hail; these clouds can sometimes produce hail The cumulonimbus calvus can further grow larger if the updraft is strong. It can form into a cumulonimbus incus, and bring more severe thunderstorms that can cause constant cloud-to-ground lightning, extensive wind damage, microbursts, hail, and occasionally a tornado.

Hazards A cumulonimbus incus is a mature thunderstorm cloud generating many dangerous elements. *Lightning; this storm cloud is capable of producing bursts of cloud to ground lightning. *Hail; hailstones may fall from this cloud if it's a highly unstable environment (which favors a more vigorous storm updraft). *Heavy rain; this cloud may drop several inches of rain in a short amount of time. This can cause flash flooding. *Strong wind; gale-force winds from a downburst may occur under this cloud. *Tornadoes; in severe cases (most commonly with supercells), it can produce tornadoes.

Architecture Distant view of Guia Hill and Guia Fortress (center left of the picture). The fort and chapel were constructed between the 1622 and 1638. The fort was already partly built during the unsuccessful attempt by the Netherlands to capture colonial Portuguese Macau from Portugal, providing an advantageous firing position for defending against naval attacks. =Lighthouse= The lighthouse was constructed between 1864 and 1865, the first western style lighthouse in east Asia or on the China coast. The lighthouse stands at Guia Hill, which stands at tall, and has a light visible for some 20 miles in clear weather conditions. The complex was built upon the highest point on Macau, Guia Hill, and named after the same location. Today, the site is a tourist destination. =Chapel= The chapel (Portuguese: Capela de Nossa Senhora da Guia; Chinese: ËÅñÊØçÈõ™Âú∞ÊÆøÊïôÂ†Ç) was built around 1622 inside the Guia Fortress.

In 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site. In 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply.Meneses, J. (2016). The Victory of Heritage. Macau Business, July 2016, pp.72-73. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city's regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.

And in the midst of all this beauty, visitors see that the wild ones not only survive in their natural habitat, but they also flourish. The zoo features a diverse collection that includes over 1731 animals, representing 300 species from around the world. The Cameron Park Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History Orangutan at Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas. Initially established in 1955 as the Central Texas Zoological Park by a group of wildlife enthusiasts who wanted to create an area for recreation and education opportunities. In 1981, a master plan was established to expand the zoo, and in 1989 a countywide bond was issued to redevelop a area of Cameron Park, into the Cameron Park Zoo. The project was completed, the old zoo was closed, and the new zoo was opened to the public on July 18, 1993. The Cameron Park Zoo features species from North and South America, Africa, Asia and Europe. Including a large reptile house, an African lion display, and Lemur Island, a large open lemur habitat. In 2005, a large new area was opened called the Brazos River Country, featuring a saltwater reef aquarium, a large swampland habitat, and many other native Texas type habitats, featuring numerous species found within the state. The exhibit is so large, it nearly doubled both the animal population and the overall size of the zoo. In 2009, the zoo added the Asian Forest, expanding its collection to include endangered species such as orangutans and Komodo dragons. These species joined the Sumatran tigers in the Asian Forest.

He saw service in Florida and became a notable artillery specialist and the first commander of Fort Monroe, located at the entrance to the harbor of Hampton Roads in Virginia. In the State of Florida, Lake Eustis and the city of Eustis were each named in his honor. Camp Abraham Eustis, a World War I-era U.S. Army base along the James River, was named for him. Later renamed Fort Eustis and now located in the independent city of Newport News, Virginia, it is part of an expanded and active facility, Joint Base Langley-Eustis. Biography Eustis was born in Petersburg, Virginia. He was the son of Abraham Eustis (1757-1786) and Margaret (Parker) Eustis (1762-1841) and the nephew of William Eustis, who served as Secretary of War from 1809 to 1812. Eustis earned the degrees of A.B. from Harvard College in 1804 and A.M. from Bowdoin College two years later. He joined the army in May 1808, and served during the War of 1812, the Black Hawk War (1832), and the Seminole Wars in Florida.Henry L. Eustis, Genealogy of the Eustis Family, Boston: David Clapp & Son, 1878, pp. 9, 15. In 1830, Eustis became the first commander of Fort Monroe, which guards the entrance to Hampton Roads at Old Point Comfort in southeastern Virginia. There for many years, he commanded the school for Artillery Practice. In May 1838, Eustis took command of Fort Butler, one of the main military posts built for the forced removal of the Cherokee known as the Trail of Tears. Nearly 5,000 Cherokee of North Carolina and adjacent Georgia were taken to Fort Butler, thence to the main internment camp at Fort Cass. The troops stationed at Fort Butler were those of Eustis's command from the Second Seminole War in Florida (Duncan 2003:190). He was the father of Brig. Gen. Henry L. Eustis. Eustis died at Portland, Maine, while in command of the 6th U.S. Military District, which was headquartered there at the time.Portland (Me.) Advertiser, 27 June, 4 July, 1843. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29646231/abraham-eustis Fort Eustis Fort Eustis was originally known as Camp Abraham Eustis when it was established during World War I on historic Mulberry Island and an adjacent portion of the mainland along the James River in Warwick County, upstream from Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. It became Fort Eustis and a permanent Army base in 1923. Fort Eustis is currently home to the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, and is now located within the corporate limits of the independent city of Newport News (which merged with the former Warwick County in 1958). An Army Aviation School is also located there. The James River Reserve Fleet of mothballed vessels, known locally as the \\"Dead Fleet\\" is located in the river offshore. With the base closure of Fort Monroe in nearby Hampton, a portion of the work there has shifted to Fort Eustis.

Sadigura is a Hasidic dynasty named for the city of Sadhora (Sadigura in Yiddish), Bukovina, which belonged to Austria. The dynasty began in 1850 with Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, a son of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn, and was based in Sadigura until 1914. During the interwar period the dynasty was led by Rebbes in Vienna and Przemy≈õl, Poland, and on the eve of World War II was transplanted to Israel, where it thrives to this day. Sadigura is one of the branches of the Ruzhiner dynasty, together with Bohush, Boyan, Chortkov, Husiatyn, and Shtefanesht. As of 2013, Sadigura has several hundred members in Israel and Europe. Its members reside in Israel in Jerusalem, Ashdod, Modiin Ilit, Beitar Ilit, and Elad, and in Europe in London and Antwerp. The dynasty is centered on the current Sadigura Rebbe's beis medrash in Bnei Brak, Israel. The 6th Rabbi, Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Friedman 65 died in Bnei Brak on 11 August 2020 following an lengthy illness.  History  =Leadership in Austria= Palatial home of the Sadigura Rebbe in Sadhora. In the early 1840s, the Ruzhiner Rebbe fled Russia to escape persecution by the Tsar. He moved his family to Sadigura. The Ruzhiner Rebbe lived in Sadigura for ten years; he built a palatial residence and an imposing synagogue, and attracted tens of thousands of Hasidim.Friedman, Yisroel. The Golden Dynasty: Ruzhin, the royal house of Chassidus. Jerusalem: The Kest-Lebovits Jewish Heritage and Roots Library, 2nd English edition, 2000, p. 15. (footnote 24) When the Ruzhiner Rebbe died at the age of 54 on 9 October 1850, his six sons established their own courts in different towns. His eldest son, Rabbi Sholom Yosef Friedman (1813-1851), remained in Sadigura to continue leading the court his father had founded, but died ten months later. At this point, the Ruzhiner Rebbe's second son,Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20. Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov (1820-1883), assumed the mantle of leadership in Sadigura, becoming known as the first Sadigura Rebbe.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 15-17. The Sadigura Rebbe maintained the grand lifestyle of his father's court, with its lavish accoutrements and showy dress, and immersed himself in the mysticism of Kabbalah, as had his father. The combination of earthly royalty and spiritual depth attracted both Jews and Christians to his court.Ewen, Isaac. \\"The Golden Dynasty: Rebbe of Sadeger\\", in The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe, Lucy S. Dawidowicz, ed. Syracuse University Press, 1967, pp. 195-196. Hundreds of thousands of Jews sought his wisdom and counsel.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 21. He also entertained visits from prominent Christians, including princes, counts, and writers who published articles about him in newspapers in Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Prague, and other locales.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 30-31. The Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue in Jerusalem, named after Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn and used by all branches of the Ruzhiner dynasty. The Sadigura Rebbe undertook the remainder of the fund-raising for the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue, the Ruzhiner synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem initiated by his father. The synagogue was completed in 1872.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 11-12. He also purchased the privilege of lighting the main bonfire at the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in Meron, Israel on Lag BaOmer from the Sephardi guardians of Meron and Safed. The Sadigura Rebbe bequeathed this honor to his eldest son, Rabbi Yitzchok, the first Boyaner Rebbe, and his progeny. After his death, his two sons, Rabbi Yitzchok (1850-1917) and Rabbi Yisrael (1852-1907), assumed joint leadership of their father's Hasidim. While they were content with this arrangement, many of the Sadigura Hasidim preferred to have one Rebbe, and in 1887, the brothers agreed to draw lots to determine who would stay in Sadigura and who would move out. The lots fell to Rabbi Yisrael to remain as the second Sadigura Rebbe, while Rabbi Yitzchok moved to the neighboring town of Boiany (Boyan) and established his court there, becoming the first Boyaner Rebbe.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 76. The Sadigura synagogue in Sadhora. Rabbi Yisrael had five sons: Rabbi Aharon of Sadigura (the author of Kedushas Aharon) (1877-1913) who had considerable musical accomplishment, Rabbi Shlomo Yosef of Chernovitz, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman of Sadigura (1884‚Äì1961), Rabbi Yitzhak of Rimanov (1887‚Äì1929), and Rabbi Shlomo Chaim (Reb Shlomenu) of Sadigura (1887-1972).Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 20, 37. After Rabbi Yisrael's death in 1907, each of his sons became Rebbes, making their courts and conducting their tishen in different halls of the great Sadigura synagogue.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 37. Rabbi Yisrael's eldest son, the Kedushas Aharon, died in 1912 and was succeeded by his 16-year-old son, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 54-57. In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov fled to Vienna together with his younger brother, Rabbi Shlomo Chaim, and his orphaned nephew, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef. Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov established his court in Vienna and led the Sadigura Hasidim from that city for the next 24 years.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 38-39. The relocation of the Sadigura Rebbes to Vienna spelled the end of the once flourishing Jewish community in Sadigura, which comprised more than 5,000 Jews before World War I. Although some Jews remained, only a few lone survivors were left at the end of World War II . =Leadership in Israel= Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, grandson of the first Sadigura rebbe, obtained a visa to Palestine shortly after the Anschluss of 1938 and re- established his court in Tel Aviv.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 39. Thousands of Sadigura Hasidim were murdered in the Holocaust, leaving the Rebbe with only a few dozen followers. Nonetheless, he continued to lead his Hasidim with princely bearing,Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 41. conducting his court in Tel Aviv for 22 years until his death in 1961. Known as the third Sadigura Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov was actively involved in Jewish communal life in the new state of Israel, being one of the first members of Agudat Israel and occupying a seat on the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. After the death of the third Sadigura Rebbe in 1961, his Hasidim asked his younger brother, Rabbi Shlomo Chaim, to succeed him, but the latter demurred. He did agree to sit in his brother's place at tischen held on Jewish holidays and on the yahrtzeits of his Ruzhiner and Sadigura ancestors.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 46. Meanwhile, the Sadigura dynasty continued through the Rebbe's nephew, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman (1897-1979), known as the fourth Admor of Sadigura, who led Sadigura Hasidim in Sadigura and Przemy≈õl (where he founded the Yeshiva ‚ÄòMeshivas Nefesh‚Äô) before emigrating to Tel Aviv in 1939. His words of Torah were compiled in ‚ÄòKnesses Mordechai‚Äô. Upon his death in 1979, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef was interred near the other Admorim of Sadigur, in the ‚ÄòNachlas Yitzchak‚Äô cemetery in Givatayim, and was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1928-2013), who moved the Sadigura court from Tel Aviv to Bnei Brak. Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov died at 84 on 1 January 2013, after being ill from pneumonia, and was buried in the Nahalat Yitzhak cemetery alongside his father. He was succeeded by his only son, the previous Sadigura Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Friedman of blessed memory (b. 1955), former av beis din (head of the rabbinical court) of Sadigura in London. Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Friedman 65 was nifter in Bnei Brak on 11 August 2020 following an lengthy illnessand was buried in the Nahalat Yitzhak cemetery in Givatayim, alongside his father and grandfather. He was succeeded by his 5th son: The Rebbe Yitzchok Yehosua Heshel Friedman Shlit\\"a who serves as the Sadigura Rebbe in his farthers holy court in Bnei Brak, On the yahr tzeit of the holy Rizhiner on the third day of the Jewish month of cheshvan in 2016, the previous Rebbe rededicated the Rizhiner Kloiz in Sadigura. The Rebbe was accompanied to Sadigura, Ukraine with roughly 400 of his followers. This was the culmination of a few year project of restoration on the Klolz's interior. The actual outer structure, is the one the holy Rizhiner oversaw himself during most of its construction.The blue prints of the Kloiz, were approved by the holy Rizhiner. Much input was added by him.

Background In the Sejarah Melayu, the boy who saved Temasek from the swordfishes is not given a name. The name Hang Nadim was only given to the character after later adaptions of the story publicized by popular culture. Hang Nadim is the name of a character in the Sejarah Melayu, however that character appears in a different chapter and is unrelated to the story of the boy who saved Temasek from the swordfishes. It is mentioned in the traditional accounts that the attacks were a curse because the reigning Maharaja had ordered the death of a pious man from Pasei called Tun Jana Khateb. Solution The initial plan of the raja to counter the attacks was to have his men stand in the sea and form a human barrier of legs along the shores of Temasek to protect the country. The number of swordfish were too numerous and it only cost more lives to be lost. After which, among the people, Hang Nadim spoke up and advised the ruler of Temasek, the Maharaja, to build the barrier with banana stems instead. The effort was successful as the swordfishes' snouts were trapped by the barricade of stems. According to legend, the place, Tanjong Pagar in modern-day Singapore, takes its name from the barricade. In the Malay language, tanjong pagar or tanjung pagar means \\"cape of stakes\\". Backlash The Maharaja was furious because he had been outwitted by a boy. So he decided to hire assassins to murder the boy. The boy lived on top of a hill so that night, the assassins murdered him in his sleep and all of his blood flowed into the hill, thus the name Bukit Merah (Malay for red hill).

He was born in Montana Territory to the Northern Cheyenne tribe but was forced with most of his tribe to remove to Indian Territory (now the State of Oklahoma). He lived most of his life on the Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation in Indian Territory and then Oklahoma. He graduated in 1884 as one of the early attendees of Carlisle Indian Industrial School, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, one of 249 students from his tribe to attend that school over the years of its operation. He returned to the Darlington Agency in Oklahoma after his schooling, and during his twenties, he was an Indian scout in the detachment of scouts headed by Edward W Casey.The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation When he was 40, he was the victim of a deliberate libel of murder by a Wichita newspaper writer, W. R. Draper, in 1902, which saw Draper arrested and arraigned for the libel case. Prior to the perpetration of this libel, White Buffalo had risen to chief status for his tribe. This status is evidenced by his portrait, taken by Frank Rinehart, official photographer at the 1898 Indian Congress held in Omaha, Nebraska. That Congress was held in conjunction with the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition and was attended by 500 tribal members from 35 different tribes. Rinehart took a series of photographs of the chiefs of the various tribes during that Indian Congress, labeling White Buffalo as one of the chiefs. In 1929, he was listed in numerous newspapers as the head of a delegation of 108 Oklahoma Indians from 23 tribes who traveled to Washington, DC, to escort Charles Curtis, of Indian blood, to his inauguration as Vice President of the United States. White Buffalo was married to Medicine Woman, a widowed full blood Northern Cheyenne, and at that time in 1910, they had 3 surviving sons of seven children total. He died in late June 1929, and is buried in the Indian Mission Church on the reservation. He was survived by his wife and children. Early life White Buffalo was born in Montana as were his parents, according to the 1910 U. S. Federal Census records. The Cheyenne were wide-ranging in their hunting grounds, ranging from Montana to Texas. After the Medicine Lodge Treaty in 1867, in which the U. S. proposed first a reservation in Kansa then one in Indian Territory, most of the Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho were forced to move south to the Indian agency near Fort Supply in present-day Oklahoma. The agency was shortly moved to approximately six miles northwest of the present-day El Reno, Oklahoma and remained there. The tribe lived in tipi villages in various locations on the reservation but faced starvation due to inadequate provisions from the Indian agency. A large part of his tribe \\"broke out\\" of the reservation and walked back to their home lands in the Dakota Territory. White Buffalo was about 15 when the Battle of Little Big Horn was fought, in which about half of the Montana tribal members participated. Education The first school opened on the Darlington agency in 1875, run by John Seger, and it is likely that White Buffalo was one of the students. He was later sent to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania after that school opened in the 1870s. He graduated in 1884, after 5 years. White Buffalo returned the Darlington agency and worked initially at the agency's sheet metal shop. As a Carlisle graduate, he was harassed at Darlington by the Cheyenne Dog Soldier society, who were determined not to allow any of the tribe to live in the white man's way, or to farm, as the agency desired. Family Life He was described in newspaper articles in 1902 as being of striking appearance, as his hair had turned completely white when he was very young. His photo from his Carlisle days, dressed in a suit with a short haircut in the white man's style, shows that to be true. In 1888, when he was 26, he married a full-blood Northern Cheyenne widow. Medicine Woman, who was 30 at the time. She had also been born in Montana as had her parents. On the 1905 Indian Census for their reservation, they had four children listed: Emma White Buffalo, son Receiving Roots, Paul White Buffalo and Pratt White Buffalo - named for the Carlisle School founder. On the 1910 U. S. Federal Census, they are listed with only three of seven surviving children: John White Buffalo, James White Buffalo and Fred White Buffalo. According to the 1910 census, the mother of Medicine Woman also lived with them as well, 76 at the time, widowed and named Siege Woman. Medicine Woman is listed on this census as illiterate, as is her mother. His son, John White Buffalo enlisted for service in World War I. As full blood Cheyenne, both White Buffalo and Medicine Woman received land allotments on the reservation in 1891 in Lincoln Township in present-day Blaine County, Oklahoma. These are listed on several of the Indian Census lists as allotments number 966 and 967. White Buffalo lived to be 67 years old, and passed away on June 23, 1929, per the 1930 Indian census for the reservation.June 30, 1930 Indian Census of Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation According to his obituary in the Watonga Republican newspaper dated June 27, 1929, he is buried at the Indian Mission Church on the reservation and was survived by his wife and sons. Tribal Work White Buffalo was one of several Carlisle alumni chosen by the Darlington agency to attend additional training in farming soon after his return. Sometime during his twenties, he enlisted and served as an Army scout in the detachment headed by Edward W. Casey. After receiving his land allotment, he began farming his own land and built his home for his family. This is according to the 1910 U. S. Federal Census which had additional questions for Indian families, one of which asked if the family was living in primitive or civilized housing. He also rose to chief status (there were many chiefs) as evidenced by his attendance at the Indian Congresses, held in 1898, 1901 and 1904. His position as a Carlisle graduate would have given him much opportunity to work for his tribe with the agency leaders as most of the tribe was illiterate and a disadvantage in any such dealings. In early March 1929, only three months before he passed away, he was listed as chief and head of a delegation of 108 Oklahoma Indians from 23 tribes who went to Washington, DC, to act as escort for Charles Curtis for his inauguration as Vice President of the United States. Curtis was of Indian blood.Miami News-Record National Libel Scandal When he was 40 years old, in 1902, a white free lance newspaper writer in Wichita, W. R. Draper, wrote a completely fictitious article , naming Carlisle graduate White Buffalo of the Darlington reservation, as the lover and confessed murderer of three white women: Maude Ellis, Margaret Andrews and Annie Dennis. The article stated that White Buffalo had honed his hatred of whites during his time as a student at Carlisle and was then awaiting trial in the Darlington area jail. Draper mailed the article to the Philadelphia North American newspaper where it was purchased and first published on July 27, 1902. The sensational article was picked up and reprinted by newspapers all over the country. Carlisle founder and head, Lt Colonel Richard Henry Pratt sent for White Buffalo to return to Carlisle and together they went to the Philadelphia North American to refute the article. The newspaper took this fraud very seriously, printed a full retraction and later had W. R. Draper arrested in St Louis where he had fled. The newspaper was the plaintiff in the case against Draper as it was felt the court would take the charges more seriously and they also wanted to set a precedent for other writers who submitted articles. In St Louis, Lt. Colonel Pratt, White Buffalo, Judge James Gay Gordon (attorney for the North American), plus two editors for the newspaper appeared for the task of having Draper returned to Kansas for prosecution on the charge of criminal libel. The Wichita Daily Eagle printed a lengthy article regarding the fraud and libel on November 27, 1902. The retractions of the original article were reprinted as well by other newspapers as far away as New England, Utah and California. White Buffalo was quoted as saying that he had traveled several times to Pennsylvania as well as to Missouri and Kansas to be a witness for the newspaper's libel charges against Draper. The initial trial was postponed after which Draper was eventually released by the second judge in the case.

History On November 20, 1818, the Georgia General Assembly approved the formation of the co-educational school to be called Jackson County Academy in Jefferson, Georgia. The Jackson County Academy operated under this name, and informally as the Jefferson Academy, until December 1859 when a judge in the Inferior Court of Jackson County from 1819‚Äì1827, William Duncan Martin, willed upon his death a substantial endowment to the school; the name was soon changed to the Martin Institute. The Martin Institute was the first privately endowed educational institute in the United States of America. In 1874 the Martin Institute was granted collegiate status, which is roughly equivalent to high school or lower undergraduate today. Between 1870 and 1882, the number of students in attendance ranged from 120 to 270. In October 1883, the old building was burned down. The new building was completed in 1886 at a cost of $15,000. It was a two-story brick building on a hill north of and just outside the city of Jefferson, with classroom (then called recitation room) seating for nearly 300 students comprised the first floor, with a large chapel, vestibule, stage, and music rooms occupying the second story. The building was crowned with a belfry, from which ringing was said to be audible for miles. When the school burned again on January 13, 1942, it was a student, the son of the police chief of Jefferson, who had intentionally set the blaze to avoid coming to school. The students and teachers met in local churches until a new building on a newly donated site was completed in 1946. The name was then changed to Jefferson Elementary and High School as part of the Jefferson City School District. Notable students, teachers, and administrators The school had a significant reputation for its fine scholarship and excellent teachers, attracting students from several neighboring states and a few foreign countries. Among its most notable students: *Damon Jesse Gause - United States Army Air Corps Officer (1915-1944), was captured and escaped from Bataan, then Corregidor and became a hero of World War II.Benson, Kit and Benson, Morgan.

Deposition is the phase transition in which gas transforms into solid without passing through the liquid phase. Deposition is a thermodynamic process. The reverse of deposition is sublimation and hence sometimes deposition is called desublimation. One example of deposition is the process by which, in sub- freezing air, water vapor changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid. This is how frost and hoar frost form on the ground or other surfaces. Another example is when frost forms on a leaf. For deposition to occur, thermal energy must be removed from a gas. When the air becomes cold enough, water vapor in the air surrounding the leaf loses enough thermal energy to change into a solid. Even though the air temperature may be below the dew point, the water vapor may not be able to condense spontaneously if there is no way to remove the latent heat. When the leaf is introduced, the supercooled water vapor immediately begins to condense, but by this point is already past the freezing point. This causes the water vapor to change directly into a solid. Another example is the soot that is deposited on the walls of chimneys. Soot molecules rise from the fire in a hot and gaseous state. When they come into contact with the walls they cool, and change to the solid state, without formation of the liquid state. The process is made use of industrially in combustion chemical vapor deposition. There is an industrial coatings process, known as evaporative deposition, whereby a solid material is heated to the gaseous state in a low-pressure chamber, the gas molecules travel across the chamber space and then deposit to the solid state on a target surface, forming a smooth and thin layer on the target surface. Again, the molecules do not go through an intermediate liquid state when going from the gas to the solid. See also physical vapor deposition, which is a class of processes used to deposit thin films of various materials onto various surfaces. Deposition releases energy and is an exothermic phase change.

Career Born in New Zealand and trained as a journalist, Currie emigrated to the UK in 1977. Currie squatted in various places in South West London, ending up in Lillieshall Road, Clapham Old Town. In 1979, with her across-the-road neighbour, Trace Newton-Ingham (Traci Newton), she co-founded the dread-punk-improvising group, The Unfuckables. The Unfuckables performed one \\"gig\\" at an anti-psychiatry conference in early 1980, held in the Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, London. For this particular gig the group comprised the two co-founders, plus an array of musicians from London's \\"underground\\" music scene ‚Äî Viv Albertine (The Slits), Gareth Sager (The Pop Group), Charles Bullen and Charles Hayward (This Heat), Tom Bailey (of Thompson Twins, whom she would later marry), Jimmy Cauty (later of The KLF, and her current husband) and improviser Steve Beresford, amongst others. In 1981, Currie joined Tom Bailey, Joe Leeway, and others to form part of the Thompson Twins, the line-up of which included up to seven members in its early days. The Thompson Twins became a trio in 1982 and signed two major record contracts with Arista Records before signing with Warner Bros. Records. Currie was a lyricist, percussionist, visual stylist and singer in the band and co- wrote and recorded 6 albums which included gold and platinum records and the hits \\"Doctor! Doctor!\\", \\"Hold Me Now\\", and \\"You Take Me Up\\". The band performed at the JFK Stadium, Philadelphia for the 1985 Live Aid concert and worked with artists including Nile Rodgers, Madonna, Grace Jones, Alex Sadkin and Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads amongst others. In 1984 the band participated in the \\"first international satellite installation\\" by Nam June Paik, Good Morning, Mr. Orwell.Good Morning Mr Nam June Paik, frieze (magazine), Issue 116 June‚ÄìAugust 2008, Her songwriting credits also include \\"I Want That Man\\", an international hit for Deborah Harry in 1989. By 1992, Currie and her husband, fellow Thompson Twins band member Tom Bailey, elected to form Babble, featuring Currie as lyricist, percussionist and visual artist, as a means of creating music without the commercial expectations that were placed on the Thompson Twins. By 1994 Babble had released their first album. Currie later returned to New Zealand working primarily as a glass artist and environmental activist. She was founder of the women's anti-genetic engineering movement Mothers Against Genetic Engineering in Food and the Environment (MAdGE). In 2004 she designed a series of protest billboards that caused controversy in New Zealand but won several international art/science awards. In 2004 she returned to London where she now works under the name Miss Pokeno and continues to make art that fuses ‚Ä≥joyful dissent‚Ä≥ with disruptive/uncomfortable narratives.

The majority of the Court held that in civil cases in the New Brunswick courts, the parties have the right to use either French or English in all submissions and pleadings. However, they do not have a right to have the matter heard by a judge who understands them in the language they choose to speak. It is sufficient if there is simultaneous translation. In addition to the majority decision, two other justices of the Court held that the parties did have the right to be heard and understood by the judge in the language of their choice, but on the facts of the case, that standard was met. Decision Justice Beetz, writing for the majority, held that the language rights of section 19(2) were different from most other rights in the Charter as they were the result of a political compromise and so must be read restrictively. The right to be tried in court in French does not even imply a right to an interpreter. The only right to be understood would be provided by fundamental justice and sections 7 and 14 of the Charter rather than language rights.Para. 60-61. Aftermath The decision inspired criticism. Professors Leslie Green and Denise R√©aume call it \\"troubling,\\" noting the division of the Charter between rights to be read conservatively and liberally was not specific and so other rights besides the language rights were at risk of being conservatively read.Green, Leslie and Denise R√©aume, \\"Second-Class Rights? Principle and Compromise in the Charter,\\" The Dalhousie Law Journal, vol. 13 (1990), p. 566. Moreover, they questioned the meaning of conservative readings and said that even with supposed generous readings of the Charter, it is expected that courts are not making law.Green and Reaume, p. 569. Green also argued that when it comes to diminishing rights due to compromise and politics, This decision was eventually reconsidered in R v Beaulac, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768 where the Court rejected the Beetz interpretation in favour of the case's minority decision of Dickson and Wilson.

History Mulberry Island, settled shortly after Jamestown, was established a few miles downriver in 1607. It was at Mulberry Island where the colonists who were preparing to leave Virginia during the Starving Time in 1610 were met by Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr with fresh provisions from England. By 1614, thousands of acres were under cultivation with tobacco, the export crop introduced by John Rolfe which saved the Virginia Colony financially. In 1619 Mulberry Island was part of the plantation held by William Pierce, father-in-law of Rolfe. During the American Civil War, Mulberry Island was the southern end of the Warwick Line, a series of defensive works built across the Virginia Peninsula to Yorktown manned by troops of Confederate General John B. Magruder during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. From 1898 to 1918 Mulberry Island was home to David & Kimpton Brickyard.Newport News Historic Sites The brickyard sat on the west bank of the Warwick River. Prior to its acquisition by the U.S. government for $538,000 Mulberry Island was primarily farmland. During the first World War, Camp Abraham Eustis was established on the historic island and adjacent land in Warwick County, upstream from Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Named for Abraham Eustis, a famous U.S. Army General from Petersburg, the camp had balloon observation school, and an artillery school that remained in operation through the end of World War II. Camp Eustis became Fort Eustis and a permanent Army base in 1923. In 2010, it was combined with nearby Langley Air Force Base to form Joint Base Langley‚ÄìEustis. Modern times One of several rows of ships in the Ghost Fleet Fort Eustis is currently home to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Since 1958, following a political consolidation of the former Warwick County with the independent city of Newport News, almost all of the base and all of Mulberry Island are located within the corporate limits of Newport News. An Army Aviation School is also located at Fort Eustis. An array of ships part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet are anchored adjacent to Mulberry Island in the middle of the James River. Considered an environmental hazard, the numbers of this reserve fleet are being reduced each year as ships are transported away as scrap. These ships are termed the \\"Idle Fleet\\" in local parlance.

Cofer was launched on 6 September 1943 by Charleston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. M. J. Cofer, mother of Seaman First Class Cofer; and commissioned on 19 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander Alvin P. Chester in command. Service history Cofer escorted convoys on two transatlantic crossings, between New York and Gibraltar and Norfolk, Virginia and Bizerte, Tunisia, from 23 March to 30 June 1944, returning to New York for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport. She was reclassified APD-62 on 5 July 1944. Cofer sailed from New York on 26 September 1944, and arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea, 4 November for duty with the 7th Fleet. She carried troops in one of the first resupply convoys for landings on Leyte, sailing with a group which fought its way through Japanese air attacks to arrive off the beaches on 24 November. Unloading at furious pace, Cofer was cleared the same day for Palau, where she embarked additional troops for the landings at Ormoc Bay on 7 and 8 December. On the first day, as suicide planes attacked in great number, Cofer joined in general firing, and went to the aid of sister ship , when she was damaged by a kamikaze. Cofer next came under enemy air attack on 15 December, as she landed assault troops on Mindoro. Continuing in her role in the return to the Philippines, Cofer landed reinforcements at Lingayen Gulf on 11 and 12 January 1945, and then in a series of unopposed landings on Luzon, and in assaults on Palawan on 28 February, Zamboanga on 10 March, and Cebu on 26 March, the last under heavy mortar fire from the beach. Between 27 April and 8 May 1945, Cofer operated as flagship and covering vessel for minesweepers clearing the waters off Tarakan, Borneo, in support of the invasion on 1 May. On 2 May, as the group swept the straits to prepare for motor torpedo boat operations off Cape Djoeata, concealed shore batteries sank YMS-481. According to the FInal Muster Roll from the YMS-481, Cofer destroyed the batteries and rescued 18 survivors of YMS-481. She continued to participate in minesweeping preceding the invasion of Brunei Bay from 7 to 11 June and Balikpapan from 15 June to 10 July. On 8 June, she assisted minesweeper who had struck a mine, and rescued 59 survivors, 42 of whom were injured. On 18 June, she rescued 23 survivors of YMS-50. Cofer departed San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 29 August and arrived at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 1 September. She voyaged to Nagasaki in September to evacuate former prisoners of war, then returned to Sasebo, on 28 September, to operate with the 7th Fleet on various duties in support of the occupation at Okinawa and Fusan, Korea. She embarked passengers at Okinawa and departed on 26 November for San Diego, arriving on 16 December. Unloading her passengers, she sailed on 26 December for the east coast, arriving at Brooklyn on 9 January 1946. Cofer was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 28 June 1946, berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida.  Awards  Cofer received eight battle stars for World War II service.

It is located in central Belgrade area, near Obiliƒáev Venac Square and central high street Knez Mihailova. The history of synagogue The history of the Jews in Belgrade can be documented since the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade in 1521; not long afterwards, in the mid 1500s, Sephardic Jews began to settle in larger numbers: according to the census data for 1567 and 1573, there were several Jewish congregations and three synagogues. During the 17th century the Jewish community settles in the area near the Danube riverfront known as Jalije (from Turk. yalƒ±, lit. ‚Äúshore‚Äù). The life of the Jews began to improve after Serbia was set on the path to independence in the first half of the 19th century, and they were granted equal civil rights after the Congress of Berlin (1878). The settlement of Ashkenazi Jews in Belgrade can be traced back to the 18th century, but the community considerably grew in the mid-19th and the first half of the 20th century. In 1869, on 1 October, a separate Ashkenazi community was founded and the ‚ÄúRule of the Ashkenazi Jewish Congregation‚Äù (as the community in the making was called) was laid down in twenty articles, which, among other things, envisaged the founding of a school and a place of worship. Its approval by the city administration laid the formal groundwork for the new Ashkenazi community. At first the community rented a building in Kosmajska (present-day Mar≈°ala Birjuzova) Street for its religious, administrative, cultural and other needs. Fundraising to support the construction of a purpose-built, more functional building began on the eve of the First World War, but the cornerstone, with a charter on parchment signed by King Alexander and Queen Maria sealed within it, was solemnly laid only after the war, on 15 June 1924. The ceremony was attended by the envoys of the King and the government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the representatives of the Jewish congregations, of various corporations, the President of the National Assembly, and the Chief Rabbi Dr. Alkalaj. Architecture David's shield The construction plan was approved in 1923. Construction began on 15 May 1924 and lasted until 27 November 1929. The synagogue building, designed by the architect Franjo Urban assisted by Milan ≈†lang, was completed in 1926. In 1929 the interior was remodelled after the design of the architect Milutin Jovanoviƒá. It functioned as the place of worship for the Serbian-Jewish Congregation of the Ashkenazi rite until 1941. In 1941‚Äì44, during the Nazi occupation of Belgrade, it was desecrated and turned into a brothel. After the war it was restored to its original function as a place of worship for both congregations of Belgrade‚Äôs Jews. The building was designed in the style of academism with predominant neo ‚ÄìRenaissance elements. In elevation it shows a semi-basement, the ground floor, the ground- floor gallery and two upper floors. The interior was designed to combine multiple functions in response to the Jewish community‚Äôs various needs: worship, education, office and dwelling spaces. This concept is based on the religious and social role of a synagogue, which needs to combine three basic functions: as a place of worship, a place of study and a place for community meetings. The semi-basement houses a kosher kitchen, a dining room and service rooms. The central ground-floor area with the gallery, being intended for ritual purposes, is preeminent both symbolically and religiously. At its side, separated by a wall, are offices, a study room and a meeting room. The two upper floors contain living quarters. The prayer space is partitioned with two rows of columns which support the gallery. The front fa√ßade is symmetrical and well-proportioned, with the decorative accent placed on the gable with David‚Äôs shield, a six-pointed star enclosed in an oculus. The central portion of the fa√ßade features four tall round-arched windows rising through the ground-floor and gallery levels. The first-floor zone, separated from the lower by a shallow stringcourse, is set back, providing a parapeted terrace. It is fitted with four regularly spaced round-arched windows between which, according to the original blueprints of 1923, were ornamental medallions. The most simply articulated second-floor zone with its eight round-arched windows is separated from the first floor by a decorative stringcourse. In addition to these elements of the front elevation which lend an impression of well-balanced horizontality, verticality is accentuated by two protruding two-storey end bays topped with small towers lightened by arched openings on three sides. The towers, a clear allusion to a fortification and the character of Solomon's temple, are a frequently used motif in synagogue architecture, symbolising Jachin and Boaz, the pillars of Solomon's Temple. The gable above the second floor provides the final vertical accent. The wide central staircase of three flights, adorned with a simple balustrade and two lampposts, adds to the overall impression of the building‚Äôs dignified and ceremonial character. In terms of layout and style, the staircase is a reference to French neoclassicism, i.e. to the northern fa√ßade of the Petit Trianon at Versailles. The architectural and aesthetic articulation of elevations gives precedence to the front fa√ßade, which is harmonious and well-balanced. The decorative accent is on the gable, which features David‚Äôs star enclosed in an oculus. Verticality is accentuated by the tall round-arched windows in the zone of the ritual space of the synagogue, and by the projecting tower-topped end bays that flank the central portion of the fa√ßade. The prayer hall is the central and essential part of the synagogue. The elongated hekhal of the Sukat Shalom synagogue, encompassing the ground-floor and gallery levels, is orientated east to west and divided with two rows of eight-sided columns with ornamented capitals. The columns support the gallery, thus combining aesthetic, symbolic and structural functions. The coffered ceiling is decorated with a floral border. The holiest and most ornate element is the aron hakodesh against the east wall of the temple, which enshrines the Ashkenazi and Sephardic. Torah scrolls and Hebrew Scriptures. It is flanked by two columns which differ from those in the hekhal only in being circular-sectioned. They carry a large marble cube which symbolises the Ark of the Covenant containing the Decalogue. These decorative architectural elements date from the period of post-World War II reconstruction of the desecrated and despoiled interior. In terms of disposition, the synagogue is a free-standing building in the rear of the lot, and therefore not fully visually graspable from the street. This disposition was determined primarily by the historic urban matrix of the district, characterised by an irregular street pattern and elongated lots. The \\"Sukkat Shalom\\" synagogue has been declared a cultural monument in April 2013. Jews in Belgrade The Sephardic synagogue of Belgrade, built in 1905-08 in a Moorish revival style, and destroyed in 1941 The first written records of the presence of Jews in Belgrade date back to the 16th century when the city was under Ottoman rule. At that time Belgrade boasted a strong Jewish Ladino- speaking Sephardic community mostly settled in the central Belgrade neighborhood called Dorƒáol. The city's Ashkenazi Jews, many of them from Central Europe and nearby Austria-Hungary, mostly lived near the Sava river in the area where the current active synagogue stands. The Jewish community in Belgrade flourished most notably in the 17th century when Belgrade had a yeshiva (a Jewish religious school), numerous community and cultural centers, Jewish charitable organizations, societies and shops. A beautiful early-20th century Sephardic synagogue, then one of the most prominent buildings in the city, stood in today's Cara Uro≈°a Street (see image right) complete with ritual bathing quarters. Before World War II some 12,000 Jews lived in Belgrade, 80% of whom were Spanish- or Ladino-speaking Sephardim, and 20% Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim. Most of the Jewish population of Serbia was exterminated during the German occupation, and only 1,115 of Belgrade's twelve thousand Jews would survive. There were three concentration camps for Jews, Serbs and Gypsies in the city at the time. Most Jewish men perished at the Autokomanda site near the city center, apart from those killed at the Banjica camp; the camp at Sajmi≈°te was on Independent State of Croatia territory and it mostly saw the killing of women and children. Wartime bombing destroyed most of the Jewish monuments as well as much of the city. According to some reports, the current synagogue was used by the occupying forces as a brothel. The building was re-consecrated after the war. Since 1944 there has only been a very small Jewish community in Serbia and Belgrade. Many of them emigrated to Israel after the war. Belgrade currently has a very active Jewish community center housing the Federation of Jewish Communities of Serbia and the Jewish Historical Museum.

Hollimon grew up in the Chicago housing projects of Cabrini‚ÄìGreen, growing up alongside Ozone from Breakin'. In 1986, he began taking improvisation classes at Players Workshop, where he met Paul Dinello and, some time later, Amy Sedaris. Hollimon then began doing stand-up at a few local comedy clubs and dabbled in comedy writing, while honing his craft of improvisation at Players Workshop. Hollimon graduated from Players Workshop in 1988 and enrolled in classes at Chicago's famed The Second City. While still taking classes, he was hired into Second City's National Touring Company, where he met Stephen Colbert. A year later, Sedaris, Dinello, Colbert & Hollimon were all touring together, performing nightly improvisational theatre at colleges & universities all over America. After leaving Second City in 1993, he then wrote and performed in a two-man play called The RIC Show- Revelations, Indictments and Confessions with his friend and fellow actor Michael McCarthy. They performed the play to rave reviews at the Dublin Theater Festival and eventually staged the show in Los Angeles where it garnered similar accolades. When the play closed, Hollimon returned to Chicago to work in the theater. He performed in plays, including Eugene Lee's East Texas Hot Links and Pearl Cleage's Flying West.\\" He then moved on to film, appearing in Stephen Gyllenhaal's Losing Isaiah and Richard Pearce's A Family Thing. Sedaris, Dinello, and Colbert created the role of Principal Blackman with Hollimon in mind for the Strangers with Candy TV series. Blackman's deep, oratorial speaking style is actually quite different from Hollimon's actual speaking voice. The second season Strangers DVD contains video of the cast's appearance at The Museum of Television and Radio; during this appearance Colbert imitates Blackman, describing his \\"hubris and overweening pride.\\" (A line that's actually a Blackman quote about Jerri Blank.) Hollimon objected to the imitation, insisting that he didn't sound like that, but Colbert assured him that he did. The same DVD also features a commentary track where it is revealed that Hollimon is a very skilled rollerskater, so Sedaris, Dinello, and Colbert incorporated this talent into the show.

A golygon is any polygon with all right angles (a rectilinear polygon) whose sides are consecutive integer lengths. Golygons were invented and named by Lee Sallows, and popularized by A.K. Dewdney in a 1990 Scientific American column (Smith). Variations on the definition of golygons involve allowing edges to cross, using sequences of edge lengths other than the consecutive integers, and considering turn angles other than 90¬∞.  Properties In any golygon, all horizontal edges have the same parity as each other, as do all vertical edges. Therefore, the number n of sides must allow the solution of the system of equations :pm 1 pm 3cdots pm (n-1) = 0 :pm 2 pm 4cdots pm n = 0. It follows from this that n must be a multiple of 8. The number of golygons for a given permissible value of n may be computed efficiently using generating functions . The number of golygons for permissible values of n is 4, 112, 8432, 909288, etc. Finding the number of solutions that correspond to non-crossing golygons seems to be significantly more difficult. There is a unique eight-sided golygon (shown in the figure); it can tile the plane by 180-degree rotation using the Conway criterion. Generalizations A serial-sided isogon of order n is a closed polygon with a constant angle at each vertex and having consecutive sides of length 1, 2, ..., n units. The polygon may be self-crossing.

It was founded in 1920 and its Secretariat is based at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, United States. Activities Through Congress and Inter-Congress meetings, and ongoing scientific Working Groups, PSA provides an interdisciplinary platform for scientists to discuss and review common concerns and priorities in the region. Through our scientific network, PSA links scientists from developed countries with those from developing countries, including the archipelagic and more remote states of the Pacific. PSA facilitates research initiatives on critical emerging issues for the region, such as biodiversity loss, climate change, infectious diseases, and the social implications of globalization, in which science can provide crucial information in a way that is required by both society and policymakers to make sound and informed decisions. PSA is a Scientific Associate of the International Council for Science (ICSU). PSA's ongoing activities include: Multi-symposia Pacific Science Congresses, held in a different location every four years. Somewhat smaller and more topically focused Inter-Congress meetings are also held in between each Congress. There have been 23 Congresses and 12 Inter-Congresses held since 1920, at venue ranging from Tokyo, Honolulu, Vancouver, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Tahiti, Fiji, Khabarovsk, and Valparaiso. The most recent 23rd Congress was held at the campus of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan in June 2016.

Membership The Pacific Science Association is composed of national, individual, and NGO/corporate members. National members (i.e. 'adhering organizations') are typically represented by the National Academies of Science from each country, but some national members are universities located within countries which are also national members (for example, the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan is a 'national member', although Japan itself is also a member). Individual and NGO/corporate memberships also form an important part of PSA's constituency. The Pacific Science Council is the governing body of PSA, and is composed of one or several representatives from each Adhering Organization to PSA. Current national members to PSA include Australia, China-Beijing, China-Hong Kong, China-Taipei, France, Guam, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Okinawa, Pacific Islands (Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu), Russia, Singapore, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam.

He is dubbed the best jockey never to have won the Grand National. After retiring, Francome was awarded the MBE in 1986 for services to racing. He was a trainer for 18 months before becoming a TV presenter for Channel 4's horse racing broadcasts. Like another former jockey, Dick Francis, Francome has taken to writing works of fiction. His books have featured on the bestseller lists. Francome ceased appearing on Channel 4 Racing at the close of 2012 when the Highflyer Production term ended. He stated in a Racing Post interview that he had only continued to work on TV for so long out of loyalty to producer Andrew Franklin.

He is notable for being a longtime veteran of the Puerto Rico-based World Wrestling Council as well as for his appearances in World Championship Wrestling and Pacific Northwest Wrestling during the 1980s and 1990s. He wrestled under the name The Cuban Assassin towards the end of his career.  Early life  Sierra was born in Cuba, but moved to the United States with his family when he was a year old. His mother was Cuban and his father was Spanish.  Professional wrestling career  Sierra was trained by Hiro Matsuda in Tampa, Florida.

Sierra would make two more appearances on WWF television in 1995 as 'David Sierra', losing to Aldo Montoya on the January 30 episode of Monday Night Raw and once again teaming with Barry Horowitz to lose to Men on a Mission on the February 9 edition of WWF Wrestling Challenge. In 2000,as Fidel Sierra,he feuded over (although never winning)the WCW TV title with Jim Duggan on WCW Saturday Night. While wrestling in Canada as \\"Crazy\\" David Patterson, Sierra asked permission from the original Cuban Assassin, √Ångel Acevedo, to use the 'Cuban Assassin' character, to which Acevedo agreed, on the condition that Sierra did not use the name or gimmick in Japan.  Personal life  Sierra is married to Fantasy, his long-time manager. She is his fourth wife, and as of 2011, the pair have been married for 19 years. Sierra has two daughters and a son.

This was more than the owner of the Fisher Building paid to buy the building one year earlier. The district's emergency financial manager, Robert Bobb, said in 2009 that he was investigating how the school board agreed to the lease in the Fisher Building. () Reginald Turner, who served on Detroit School Board from 2000 to 2003, said that he was told that it would be less expensive to occupy the Fisher Building than it would to remodel the Maccabees Building. () In November 2004 an election in Detroit was held since the state takeover was sunsetting. On a 66% margin the voters agreed to return to having an elected school board. The board was selected in November 2005 and began its term in January 2006. The final full year that the board was in full control was the 2007‚Äì2008 fiscal year. By that time DPS had a $200 million deficit. The district's deficit was $369.5 million by the end of the 2007‚Äì2008 fiscal year, and its long-term debt was $1.5 billion. In January 2009 Governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm installed Robert Bobb as the emergency manager of DPS. She used Public Act 72 to appoint an emergency manager. In May 2011, Roy Roberts was appointed DPS's emergency manager by Governor Rick Snyder. By the time Roberts was appointed the DPS deficit was $686.5 million. In September 2011, a new statewide district, Education Achievement Authority, was to take over some of Detroit's failing schools as selected by the emergency manager with up to 16 expected. The deficit was $763.7 million by the end of the 2013‚Äì2014 fiscal year, and at that time its long-term debt was $2.1 billion.

Cass Technical High School, Renaissance High School, and Detroit School of Arts rank highly both statewide and nationally. However, at many schools some students still do not meet adequate yearly academic progress requirements. Students that fail to meet those requirements struggle in both language and mathematics. A team of DPS students from Western International High School and Murray-Wright High School took second place out of 552 teams from 25 countries in a robotics competition in Atlanta, Georgia. DPS students, most notably Bates Academy students, did well at the 42nd annual Academic Olympics in Eatonton, Georgia, winning many honors.

Wednesday March 17, 2010. When charter school and Detroit Public Schools enrollments are combined, the total number of children in public schools in Detroit has increased. If growth trends continue, Detroit's charter schools enrollment will outpace the Detroit Public Schools by 2015. Officials at the Detroit Public Schools and Detroit Federation of Teachers oppose the expansion of charter schools. The Thompson Educational Foundation financed a new University Preparatory Academy High School, and provides yearly scholarships on condition of meeting student performance goals. Follow up studies of the University Prep Academy class of 2007 shows that at least 90% went on to college, 83% of those who attended a four-year university re-enrolled for a second year, and 57% of those who attended a two-year college re-enrolled for a second year, beating national re-enrollment averages. However, these scores are below high performing DHS schools with selective enrollment such as Bates Academy, Burton International and Renaissance High School. There have been significant calls for the Detroit Public Schools to cooperate more with charters, including renting unused schools to charters. In May 2008, the DPS board renewed contracts with six charter schools for two years. DPS leases some closed school buildings to charter school operators. Leadership DPS is headquartered in the Fisher Building in New Center =Superintendent= In March 2007, the DPS board removed Superintendent William Coleman and replaced him with Dr. Connie Calloway. Lamont Satchel was named as Interim Superintendent. Coleman was still paid for the remainder of his contract. Dr. Connie Calloway was removed after 18 months after accusations by the school board that she was behaving unprofessionally and exercising poor judgment. She later won a lawsuit for wrongful termination, and termination without due process in retaliation for filing a whistle-blowing lawsuit when the treasurer reported ongoing misappropriation of more than 77 million dollars per year in funds intended for the children of Detroit. =Emergency financial manager= The District has been under a state-appointed Emergency Manager since 2009. The Emergency Manager has powers to make unilateral changes. All financial decisions have been made by the Emergency Manager. From 2009 to 2011, DPS finances were managed by Robert Bobb who was appointed by former Governor Jennifer Granholm, and from 2011 to January 2015, by Roy Roberts who was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder. In January 2015, Governor Snyder appointed Darnell Earley as Roberts' successor. Earley resigned in February 2016 in the wake of criticism of his decision, when he was Emergency Manager over Flint, Michigan, to switch that city's water supply to the Flint River, resulting in the Flint water crisis. As of March 2016, financial matters are under the control of a Transition Manager appointed by Governor Snyder, retired bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes. =Current Board of Education= * Iris Taylor, Ph.D. * Angelique Peterson-Mayberry * Misha Stallworth * Deborah Hunter-Harvill, Ed.D. * Georgia Lemmons * Bishop Corletta J.

On March 3, 2009, Bobb estimated that DPS's current year deficit would be greater than $150M, and requested early payments from the state to meet payroll. He declared that additional outside auditors would be required to properly assess the district's financial situation. Twenty million dollars of the March 2009 debt was owed to the district's pension system. The DPS school board complained in 2009 that the deficit of $65 million for 2007‚Äì2008 school year was caused by accounting irregularities, including fringe benefits and paying teachers off of the books.

Digital programs On February 4, 2010, the Detroit Public Schools announced that it wants to digitize all its teaching and learning as part of the comprehensive plan to accelerate student achievement, within five years. Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the district's chief academic and accountability auditor, said the district is investing in high-tech tools to equip all 6th- to 12th-graders with computers and digitize all curriculum, textbooks and lessons plans district-wide. The $15 million product is part of a $40 million contract with Boston's Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which marks the largest single deal for the book publisher. The first step will be interactive Web- based portal called Learning Village that would be fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability to digitize its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. Teachers will have access to students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents can log into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is to serve as a unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents and principals, and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6‚Äì12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is setting up a Detroit-based office with at least 13 employees for technical support, training and outreach. Detroit is the company's largest client.

The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes magnetic induction damping rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation. Although Brunton, Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate navigational and slope-angle measurements in the field. Users are primarily geologists, but archaeologists, environmental engineers, mining engineers and surveyors also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The United States Army has adopted the Pocket Transit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served artillery. Overview The Pocket Transit may be adjusted for declination angle according to one's location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements (azimuth) through use of the Earth's magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of geological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). Strike is measured by leveling (with the bull's eye level) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance. As with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the Earth's magnetic field. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic interference. For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains magnetite or some other iron-bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the outcrop to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field). Since they are measured with a rotating level, dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference. Other compasses There are numerous other compasses used by geologists: The Breithaupt compass is one example. Portable electronic devices are changing the way geologists conduct field work. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies on an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and may provide information about the reliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and performing statistical analysis).  Uses  # Taking a bearing # Measuring vertical angles with clinometer # Defining points of the same elevation # Measuring strike and dip.

She is best known for representing Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with the song \\"Why Angels Cry\\", as well as co-writing the worldwide hit \\"Everytime\\" with Britney Spears. Artani was signed to Ultra Records and her debut single \\"Alive\\" was released in March 2009. Early life Artani was born Annette Denise Stamatelatos in Flushing, New York to Gregory and Julia Stamatelatos. Her family originates from the village of Karavados on the island of Kefalonia, Greece. She is named after her maternal grandmother, Anneta, and she chose to use her paternal grandmother's first name, Artani, in her stage name, as a dedication to both of them. She graduated from Queens College and received an associate's degree from Five Towns College. Artani and her older sister Diana, who also sings, formed a rock band named Nootropia (Mindset), singing in Greek, and promoted on National Greek TV (NGTV) and Aktina FM. The group sang Greek rock songs which were fused with classical elements. Musical career =1994-2002: Beginnings= Artani expressed her interest and love for music at a young age, particularly in offerings of such greats as Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, and Madonna. After her early days singing with her sister, Artani decided that a solo career would suit her best. She received a scholarship from BMG for writing and performing her original song titled \\"Summer Days\\", and has also won several talent titles in America's Favorite Pageants, the New York Star Pageant, the Ophelia Devoure Talent Connection, and has been featuring in both Pageantry and Billboard Magazine. Over the years, Artani incorporated influences of singing in her college Gospel choir, as well as listening to R&B;, pop and rock music. She started off her singing career as an opening act for Mando, a Greek pop star, and was featured in her own summer concert in 1995. She collaborated with several accomplished writers in New York such as Jeff Franzel, who's written for NSYNC and played with Frank Sinatra, and Alex Forbes who has written for Taylor Dayne and Cyndi Lauper, among others. =2002-2004: Working with Britney Spears and \\"Everytime\\"= While singing as a singer-songwriter in clubs all over New York City, Artani received a phone call from a friend saying that she should audition to be a backing vocalist for Britney Spears. She was called back and informed that she would be on The Rosie O'Donnell Show with Spears and would subsequently be a part of the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well by the end of the tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, \\"Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me\\". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, \\"Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [Timberlake]. Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like‚ÄîI think we kind of needed each other.\\" Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, \\"It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well\\". According to Artani, \\"Everytime\\" was written in large part as a response to \\"Cry Me a River\\" as well as various radio interviews. Artani explained, \\"He was getting personal. Here, she had a different type of image, and he was really exposing some stuff that she probably didn't want out there, and in front of her little sister ... I remember her sister being mortified and her being mortified. I'm sure that that really hurt her.\\" \\"Everytime\\" was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles and mixed at Frou Frou Central in London, England.In the Zone liner notes. Jive Records (2003) \\"Everytime\\" was released as a single on May 17, 2004 through Jive Records, and was positively received by critics, who complimented its simple lyrics and the organic feel of the song. The single also achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top five in most countries, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom. =2004-2006: Start of solo career and Eurovision 2006= In 2004, Artani entered the third edition of the Greek reality singing show Fame Story. She was brought in along with three others after the show had already started. A month into her participation, Artani \\"walked off the show\\" after refusing to sign a multi-year contract which she was being pressured into signing during her time on the show. She stated that her departure was a \\"huge scandal at the time in Greece\\". Although she didn't win, she had established a large fan base and signed a record deal with Virus Music, which led to the release of the single \\"Goodbye Amor\\", which became popular. In 2006, she was invited by Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation to take part in the Cypriot selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. On February 22, the public selected its entry from 20 songs during the final round of a show entitled \\"A Song For Europe\\" where Artani won the majority of the votes for her ballad \\"Why Angels Cry\\", even though she was suffering from laryngitis. After the show, the song was tweaked a bit for Eurovision by adding the Russian philharmonic in its orchestration. She represented Cyprus in Athens at the Contest's semi-final. She later released her first studio album Mia Foni, which featured songs in both Greek and English; the album reached the top ten on the Greek Albums Chart. =2007-present: \\"Alive\\" and new album= In December 2007, Artani was approached by Greece's Hellenic Radio and Television to be considered as one of the possible entrants to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. She wrote three candidate songs, however, she never submitted them after talking it over with the network and realizing the strings attached. She had already left her Greek record label Virus Music and had signed to a label in the United States, but by submitting the songs, she would have to be signed to a Greek label once again, which would have meant unsigning in the US. Artani felt that it would be better to be obligated to her US label instead as it could do more for her career. Artani signed with Ultra Records in the United States, and began recording her first English language album. The first single is \\"Alive\\" which she performed at club Duvet on December 19 for her then management company SWAP's holiday party. \\"Alive\\" was released as an eight-track digital download on March 31, 2009 through iTunes and was accompanied by a music video in the months succeeding. It was then licensed by Ultra Records worldwide and became available in all iTunes music stores. In an interview with Radio International on November 18, 2009, Artani announced that she was working on her second single which was produced by Swedish producer Ishi Mughal and described it as a \\"sort of\\" remake of The Supremes 1966 hit \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\". During the interview, she played an exclusive clip of the unfinalized song as well as the previously unheard song \\"Nothing Lasts\\". She ended the interview by playing a new version of her song \\"Too Late\\" which was remixed by her friend Greg Christos. In 2010, Artani also wrote the song \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" with Canadian producers C2, which became a hit in Korean Pop, performed by Korean pop group, Girls Day. In 2011, Artani released \\"Mouthful of Me\\", shot in Joshua Tree National Park by Norwegian director Torgeir Ensrud, which went viral. In 2012, Artani signed with American Bombshells Entertainment, under the alter ego of \\"Nettie\\" and performed for veterans and troops all over the world, as well as on NBC's \\"The Winner Is\\" on July 11, 2013. In 2013, Artani was signed with Notting Hill Music Publishing in the United Kingdom and was writing songs for artists internationally. She is also a member of Identity Crisis, a funk fusion band based in New York, which toured the east coast. In 2019, Artani was a political activist and lead singer of Citizens United Protest Band. Personal life Artani married talent agent Kirk Ceballos in a Greek Orthodox ceremony held on 3 July 2010 at Saints Constantine and Helen Cathedral in Brooklyn, with their nuptials covered by Greek People Magazine, among other media from Greece. The two had been dating since May 2008. However, Artani filed for divorce in 2011 that was issued in 2012.

It connects Interstate 35 at its west end to US-77 in Paoli at its east end. It does not have any spur routes. Route description State Highway 145 begins at Exit 79 along Interstate 35 in northern Garvin County. From this point, it heads east along Davis Avenue until it reaches the town of Paoli. The route ends at US-77 in the center of the town. \\"TO Interstate 35\\" signage is also present along westbound SH-145. History State Highway 145 was added to Oklahoma's highway system in 1958. The original western terminus of the highway was at State Highway 19 east of Maysville. The eastern terminus was in Paoli. The highway was entirely gravel when it was commissioned, and did not yet have an interchange with I-35, as that highway had not yet been built south of Purcell in McClain County. By 1961, SH-145 had been extended eastward to meet SH-19 once again east of Paoli. At this point, the highway served as a de facto Pauls Valley bypass, as SH-19 dipped down to the south to run through the Garvin County seat, while SH-145 continued on a straight course. The highway had also been nearly- entirely paved by this point, with only a short section near the eastern terminus still gravelled. SH-145 was decommissioned between July 1968 and June 1969. However, some time between September 1970 and 1972, the highway had been reinstated with its present-day termini. No changes have taken place since 1972. =Bridge over I-35= SH-145's bridge over I-35 at its present-day western end was the site of a deadly accident on 8 June 2004, when a chunk of concrete crumbled off the bridge and fell on a car passing under the bridge on I-35. Yvonne Osborne, the driver of the car, was killed. The accident was cited by political action committees such as Oklahomans for Safe Roads and Bridges as a result of poor funding for Oklahoma roads. Osborne's death served as a catalyst for the state legislature to allocate extra funding for ODOT ‚Äî as a result of the bridge incident, $100 million was appropriated to the agency for bridge repair, and was eventually exhausted after having been used to repair or replace 68 Oklahoma bridges. The event also led to the passage of House Bill 1176, which added either $50 million or $17.5 million to ODOT's annual budget, depending on the state's revenue for the fiscal year.The Oklahoman Editorial.

It enters Oceanport still within the confines of Fort Monmouth traveling along Saltzman Avenue and Hildreth Avenue before ending at a signalized intersection with CR 11 (Oceanport Avenue). Signage for CR 537 at its eastern terminus along Oceanport Avenue (CR 11) History From Mount Holly to Moorestown, the road was part of a King's Highway extending from South Amboy to Salem, chartered in 1681. In the mid-19th century, several turnpikes maintained what would become CR 537: * Moorestown and Camden Turnpike: Camden to Moorestown, chartered in 1849, following what is now CR 551 to Camden * Mount Holly and Moorestown Turnpike: Moorestown to Mount Holly, chartered in 1852, built on the road built as part of the King's Highway * Mount Holly and Jobstown Turnpike: Mount Holly to Jobstown, chartered in 1853 * Freehold and Smithville Turnpike: Smithburg to Freehold, chartered in 1858 * Freehold and Colt's Neck Turnpike: Freehold to Colt's Neck, chartered in 1859 * Tinton Falls Turnpike: Colt's Neck to Shrewsbury, following Sycamore Avenue to Shrewsbury Village, with a branch to Eatontown, chartered in 1866 The road from Camden to Sykesville was signed as part of the Camp Dix Way, an auto trail extending from Camden to Point Pleasant. The road from Camden to what is now US 206 was part of Route 38 until a bypass route was built. Another County Route 537 Spur previously existed, which is now Burlington County Routes 613 and 614. The former eastern terminus of CR 537 in Long Branch still signed as CR 537 as of November 2017 The road that now carries CR 537 through the former Fort Monmouth was originally open to the public but closed after the September 11 attacks. Following the base's closure in 2011, the gates across the Avenue of Memories were locked. As a requirement for the issuance of bonds by Monmouth County for use in redevelopment of the former base, the county required the allowance for public through traffic on the road. In 2016, the county started reconstruction on the road through the base. The completed reconstructed road was opened to the public on January 17, 2017 and subsequently made part of CR 537. Upon opening, both directions of travel will use Saltzman Avenue and Hildreth Avenue on the Oceanport side of the fort. However, in the future, the roads will be reconfigured as a one-way pair similarly to how the roads operated when the base was in use. Eastbound traffic will use Saltzman and Hildreth avenues while westbound traffic will use Russel Avenue, Sherill Avenue, and Wilson Avenue. Prior to 2017, CR 537's eastern terminus was in Long Branch at the intersection of Broadway and Myrtle Avenue. From its present intersection with Route 35 outside of Fort Monmouth in Eatontown, it traveled south on Route 35 running concurrent with it for just under , ran along Route 71 from its northern terminus in downtown Eatontown to the Oceanport boundary, then along Eatontown Boulevard and Broadway through Oceanport, West Long Branch (where it intersected Route 36), and Long Branch. On February 23, 2017, the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders passed a resolution officially making the road through Fort Monmouth part of CR 537 while the old county-maintained portions of Eatontown Boulevard and Broadway became an extension of CR 547 (which previously ended at Route 71 and CR 537 in Eatontown). However , signage for CR 537 still appears along the former section of the road from Fort Monmouth's entrance to Long Branch.

It was designed to lend money to the states or communities for low-cost construction. History Units for about 650,000 low-income people, but mostly for the homeless, were started. Progressives early in the 20th century had argued that improving the physical environment of poorer citizens would improve their quality of life and chances for success (and cause better social behavior). As governor of New York, Al Smith began public housing programs for low income employed workers. New York Senator Robert F. Wagner carried those beliefs into the 1930s, when he was a power in the United States Congress. From 1933-37, the Public Works Administration (PWA) under Harold Ickes razed 10,000 slum units and built 22,000 new units, with the primary goal of providing construction jobs. Ickes was a strong friend of African-Americans and reserved half the units for them. The courts ruled the PWA lacked eminent domain power to condemn slums, so the Housing Act of 1937 envisioned a long term federal role under the new agency, the USHA. This Housing Act of 1937 was strongly influenced by Catherine Bauer. She became its Director of Information and Research, a position she held for two years. The private sector saw an economic danger in nationalized housing, and insisted that there be a clear differentiation between the main housing industry and welfare programs focused on people too poor to buy but who were worthy and deserved help. There was a concerted effort, in the words of Senator Wagner, at \\"avoiding competition\\" between the private and public sectors. The law required a 20 percent gap between the upper income limits for admission to public housing projects and the lowest limits at which the private sector provided decent housing. Wagner obtained support from conservative leaders Robert A. Taft and Allen Ellender to guarantee a bipartisan approach. Ellender insisted and civil rights groups accepted, that the units be racially segregated. Critics eventually pointed to the culture of poverty, violence, drugs, crime and hopelessness that thrived in the \\"vertical ghetto\\" as a refutation of the original Progressive theory. Defenders of public housing point out that the program was beset with limitations at its outset, has never been truly fully funded, and continues to serve a limited income population that the private real estate sector has never tried to serve. Organizational history USHA poster, \\"Cross out slums\\" The Housing Division of the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works was established pursuant to the National Industrial Recovery Act, June 16, 1933. It assumed, from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, administration of the limited dividend program under the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, July 21, 1932. It also administered a program of direct federal grants and loans to local housing authorities. The United States Housing Authority (USHA) was established in the Department of the Interior by the Housing Act of 1937, September 1, 1937, assuming responsibilities of the Housing Division in 1939. It was transferred to the Federal Works Agency by Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939, effective July 1, 1939. The USHA was renamed the Federal Public Housing Authority (FPHA) and transferred to the National Housing Agency by (using authority granted under the First War Powers Act), February 24, 1942, also consolidating functions relating to public housing formerly vested in the Public Buildings Administration, Division of Defense Housing, and Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division, FWA; the War and Navy Departments; and the Farm Security Administration. The FPHA was replaced by the Public Housing Administration (PHA) within the Housing and Home Finance Agency pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947, effective July 27, 1947. The PHA was abolished and superseded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development by the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (), September 9, 1965. References * Aaron, Henry.

Standard tubular levels only consider one dimension. Bull's eye levels are used primarily by carpenters in construction, but can also be found as features of compasses or other devices that need to be kept from tipping in certain directions (whether it be for functionality or precision of measurements). Small bull's eye levels are also found incorporated into tripods. Another name for a bull's eye level is a \\"circular bubble\\" which is the name used by surveyors in the United Kingdom. Surveying instruments such as theodolites (transits) and total stations often have a circular bubble as well as a tubular level or \\"plate level\\". The circular bubble is used to roughly level the instrument in two dimensions and then the plate level, being more precise, is used to level the instrument more precisely in each dimension separately by leveling the plate level, then spinning the instrument 90 degrees and leveling the plate level again. The Fell All-Way precision level, one of the first successful American made bull's eye levels for machine tool use, was invented by William B. Fell, Rockford, Illinois prior to World War II in 1939. The device was unique in that it could be placed on a machine bed and show tilt on the x-y axises simultaneously; eliminating the need to rotate the level 90 degrees. The device set a new standard of 0.0005 inches per foot resolution (five ten thousands per foot or five arc seconds tilt). The level's production stopped around 1970. Production restarted in 1980s by Thomas Butler Technology, Rockford, Illinois, but finally ended in the mid 1990s. However, there are still hundreds of the highly prized devices in existence.

She is best known for her appearances with the American professional wrestling promotions the United States Wrestling Association and World Championship Wrestling from 1990 to 1991 under the respective ring names Jeanie Adams and Lady Blossom as the valet for \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin. In 2016, Clarke released her autobiography Through the Shattered Glass. Early life Clarke originally worked as a model. She travelled to the United States alongside her then-boyfriend, professional wrestler Chris Adams. The couple split up in the early 1980s, and in 1990 Clarke began a relationship with wrestler \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin. Professional wrestling career =Joint Promotions (1979‚Äì1981)= In 1979, Clarke started her wrestling career as a ringside second for her then-boyfriend Chris Adams for the British-based company Joint Promotions. =World Class Championship Wrestling / United States Wrestling Association (1990‚Äì1991)= In 1990, Clarke's ex-boyfriend Chris Adams suggested bringing her to the Dallas, Texas-based promotion World Class Championship Wrestling and the Memphis, Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association as a valet for \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin. Clarke was billed as Chris' ex-wife \\"Jeanie Adams\\" to add an extra dimension to his feud with Austin, a wrestler he had trained at his wrestling school at the Sportatorium. During later bouts between Austin and Adams, Clarke would often catfight with Adams' valet and then-wife, Toni Adams. Clarke also wrestled Adams in a number of intergender tag team matches and a high-profile singles match at the Sportatorium. The original idea of the angle came about in the beginning of 1986 when Adams began his storyline feud with Gino Hernandez. In 1991, Austin and Clarke left WCCW and the USWA and would later join World Championship Wrestling. =World Championship Wrestling (1991)= In 1991, Austin was hired by World Championship Wrestling, where Vivacious Veronica became his valet. After several weeks, Clarke was hired to replace Vivacious Veronica. She was given the name by Dusty Rhodes, who said it was because her \\"chest was blossoming out of her top\\".Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.85‚Äì86) Lady Blossom debuted on 1 June 1991 episode of WCW Worldwide by helping Austin defeat Bobby Eaton for the WCW World Television Championship. The duo did not have a distinctive gimmick, but they tried to portray themselves as being a couple of high society. Austin came down to the ring in an extravagant robe, whereas Lady Blossom frequently donned a luxurious cleavage-baring evening gown. In a sharp contrast to her time in World Class Championship Wrestling, Lady Blossom did not get an opportunity to speak much on camera‚Äîshe spoke on camera on less than a handful of occasions throughout her WCW tenure. Blossom used her actions instead of her words as she did not hesitate to involve herself in Austin's matches in order for him to retain his WCW Television title. Blossom frequently interfered in his matches, although her interference backfired from time to time, and she occasionally took bumps. On one occasion, Lady Blossom hopped onto the ring apron in an attempt to distract the referee from the action in the ring. As she was arguing with the referee, Tracy Smothers inadvertently ran into her just as Austin had moved out of the way. Smothers' collision with Blossom jostled her and she fell to the floor mat a few moments later. Also, Lady Blossom constantly interfered in Austin's TV title matches with P.N. News and thus he retained his title again due to her interference. Right when the 10-minute time limit was drawing near, Blossom interfered in the match just as Austin was about to be pinned, thus causing a disqualification. Blossom's most frequent method of a disrupting a match was to jump on the back of Austin's opponent just as he was about to be pinned. She then scratched Austin's opponent's face with her fingernails. Another instance in which Lady Blossom's interference backfired took place in August 1991 on an episode of WCW Power Hour during a TV title match pitting Austin and Ron Simmons. Simmons was on the verge of victory in the match, but Lady Blossom entered the ring and jumped on his back to cause a disqualification. For a string of weeks in October 1991, both Blossom and Austin did an angle involving a pair of brass knuckles. During Austin's matches, Lady Blossom pulled out of a pair of brass knuckles that was underhandedly hidden underneath her cleavage and tucked inside one of the cups of her bra. When the referee's attention was drawn elsewhere, she pulled the brass knuckles out of her bra and hand the weapon over to Austin so that he could use them on his opponent. Unbeknownst to the official, Austin struck his opponent with the knuckles and then quickly handed them back over to Blossom. Lady Blossom then cleverly concealed the brass knuckles inside of her bra again and behave as if nothing ever happened. Austin then pinned his unconscious opponent for the victory. The couple's shenanigans worked for a few weeks, but they were caught within due time. At the conclusion of a match between Steve Austin and PN News on WCW Saturday Night, Lady Blossom helped Austin cheat to win yet again. After the match, an enraged Dustin Rhodes came down to ringside to explain to the referee that Austin had cheated in his match by striking his opponent with a pair of brass knuckles and that the weapon was hidden inside of Lady Blossom's dress. Both Blossom and Austin egged Rhodes on to prove to the referee that they had cheated in the match, but he reluctantly refused to place his hand down her dress knowing the potential sexual harassment issues his action caused. Moments later, Madusa arrived on to the scene to confront the perpetrators and attempt to verify Rhodes' claims. Madusa then did what Rhodes was much too uncomfortable to do by literally taking matters into her own hands and sticking her hand inside of Blossom's dress. Madusa was quickly able to pull the concealed weapon out of Blossom's dress and show off her discovery to the crowd. Considering that the referee now had visible evidence that Austin did in fact cheat to win the match, he reversed his decision in favor of News. Blossom retired from professional wrestling in late 1991 after becoming pregnant with her second daughter. She made her final appearance with WCW on 19 November 1991 at Clash of the Champions XVII, accompanying Austin to ringside for his title defense against P.N. News. Personal life Clarke had a relationship with professional wrestler Chris Adams for five years, with the couple having a daughter, Jade. Clarke and Adams split up in the early 1980s. Contrary to the wrestling storyline, the two were never actually married in real life. In 1983, in order to stay in the United States, Clarke married professional wrestler William \\"Billy Jack\\" Haynes, with the couple later divorcing. In 1990, Clarke began a relationship with professional wrestler Steve Austin. The couple married on 18 December 1992 and had two daughters, Stephanie Britt (born 1992) and Cassidy Skye (born 1996). Clarke and Austin divorced in 1999, with Clarke and her children later returning to the United Kingdom in 2001. Clarke is credited with helping Austin develop his \\"Stone Cold\\" persona. While he was contemplating a change in ring name from \\"The Ringmaster,\\" she told him to drink his tea before it got \\"stone cold,\\" and suggested he use the nickname. She was also instrumental in the creation of the \\"Austin 3:16\\" catchphrase. On 4 May 2016, Clarke released her autobiography, Through The Shattered Glass through Amazon. In August 2016 Clarke was presented with an award at the Annual British Wrestlers Reunion in Kent, UK. References * Jeanie Clarke; Bradley Craig; Neil Cameron (4 May 2016).

The point of origin of the Kumano cult is the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex in Wakayama Prefecture, which comprises (Shing≈´, Wakayama), Kumano Hong≈´ Taisha (Tanabe, Wakayama) and Kumano Nachi Taisha (Nachikatsuura, Wakayama Prefecture). Kumano Sanzan  Nachi Falls and Seiganto-jiThe three Kumano Sanzan shrines are the S≈çhonsha (\\"head shrines\\") of all Kumano shrines and lie between 20 and 40 km from each other. They are connected to each other by the pilgrimage route known as . The great Kumano Sanzan complex also includes two Buddhist temples, Seiganto-ji and Fudarakusan-ji. The religious significance of the Kumano region goes back to prehistoric times and therefore predates all modern religions in Japan.Kumano Sanzan The area is still considered a place of physical healing. Each shrine initially had its own separate form of nature worship, but in the 10th century, under the influence of Buddhism, the three came to be worshiped together as the three deities of Kumano. Because at the time Japanese kami were believed to be emanations of buddhas (honji suijaku theory), the three came to be associated with Buddhas. Kuniyasutamahime became associated with Sahasrabh≈´ja Avalokite≈õvara (Senju Kannon, \\"Thousand-Armed Avalokite≈õvara\\"), Bhaisajyaguru (Yakushi Ny≈çrai) and AmitƒÅbha (Amida Ny≈çrai). The site became, therefore, a unique example of shinbutsu-sh≈´g≈ç, the fusion between Buddhism and Japanese indigenous religion. Thereafter the Kumano Sanzan site attracted many worshipers and became a popular pilgrimage destination. In the 11th century pilgrims were mostly members of the imperial family or aristocrats, but four centuries later they were mostly commoners.

Already one of the city‚Äôs most important wine bars by the 16th century, it owes its worldwide reputation to Goethe's play Faust as the first place Mephistopheles takes Faust on their travels. History A wine bar at the site was already mentioned in a historical record dated 1438. The present-day restaurant is located below the M√§dlerpassage, a historic covered passage built from 1912 to 1914 at Grimmaische Stra√üe 2 in Leipzig's historical district near the market. The restaurant has five historical dining rooms: the Fasskeller (Barrel Cellar), Lutherzimmer (Luther Room), Goethezimmer (Goethe Room), Alt-Leipzig (Old Leipzig), and, since 1913, the Gro√üer Keller (Large Cellar). There is also the Mephisto Bar on the floor above available for drinks. Auerbach's Cellar, depiction from 1844 The M√§dlerpassage replaced the former Auerbachs Hof, a trade fair building complex, erected about 1530 at the behest of Heinrich Stromer (1482‚Äì1542), city councillor, professor of medicine, and rector of Leipzig University. He was the personal physician of several princes, such as Duke George of Saxony or the Hohenzollern brothers Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg and Archbishop Albert of Mainz. Stromer was familiarly called Doctor Auerbach after his birthplace, the town of Auerbach in the Bavarian Upper Palatinate region. When he re-opened the already existing wine vault in the basement rooms, the bar quickly adopted his name. Young Goethe often visited Auerbach‚Äôs Cellar while studying at Leipzig University from 1765 to 1768 and called it his favorite wine bar. He saw there two paintings on wood dating from 1625, one depicting the legendary magician and astrologer Johann Georg Faust drinking with students and the other showing him riding out the door astride a wine barrel, something he could have accomplished only with the help of the Devil. Goethe was already familiar with the Faust legend from his youth, since a puppet show Dr. Faust, was frequently performed at local street fairs. The scene Auerbach‚Äôs Cellar in Leipzig in his drama Faust I is his literary memorial to his student tavern and to the city, albeit an ironic one. Between 1912 and 1913 much of Auerbach‚Äôs Cellar was reconstructed and expanded as part of the demolition of the medieval construction above it and the erection of the M√§dlerpassage. It was reopened on 22 February 1913, which is also the date when the two sculptures Mephisto and Faust and Bewitched Students were placed at the entrance. Since German reunification, the whole passage with numerous shops and office floors has been extensively renovated.

According to the U.S. government, the intention had been to bomb the nearby Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement. President Bill Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet testified before a congressional committee that the bombing was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency, and that the CIA had identified the wrong coordinates for a Yugoslav military target on the same street. The Chinese government issued a statement on the day of the bombing, stating that it was a \\"barbarian act\\".  Sequence of events  In the days prior to the bombing, an attack folder labelled \\"Belgrade Warehouse 1\\" was circulated for command approval. The folder originated within the CIA and described the target as a warehouse for a Yugoslav government agency suspected of arms proliferation activities. In this form, the strike was approved by President Clinton. It is unclear if other NATO leaders approved the strike. A report by the French Ministry of Defense after the war stated that \\"part of the military operations were conducted by the United States outside the strict framework of NATO\\" and that a dual-track command structure existed. NATO had no authority over the B-2 stealth bombers that carried out the strike. According to the CIA account, the target was checked against 'no-strike' databases but these raised no alarms; these are lists of protected sites such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. The joint Observer/Politiken investigation later reported its journalists had interviewed various NATO and US officers who had checked the databases the morning after the attack and found the embassy listed at its correct location. On the night of May 7‚Äì8, the strike was carried out by bombers of the United States Air Force's 509th Bomb Wing flying directly out of Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The bombers were armed with JDAM GPS-guided precision bombs but the geographic coordinates provided by the CIA and programmed into the bombs were those of the Chinese embassy away. At around midnight local time 5 bombs landed at the location indicated, striking the south end of the embassy almost simultaneously. The embassy had taken precautionary measures in view of the ongoing bombing campaign, sending staff home and housing others in the basement, but the attack still resulted in 3 fatalities, Shao Yunhuan (ÈÇµ‰∫ëÁéØ) who worked for the Xinhua News Agency, and Xu Xinghu (ËÆ∏ÊùèËôé) and his wife Zhu Ying (Êú±È¢ñ) who worked for Guangming Daily, and 27 injuries.  Chinese reaction  On May 12, to mourn the deaths of the bombing victims, American flags were ordered to be lowered to half-staff at U.S. diplomatic missions in mainland China and HKSAR. The photo above shows the lowered American flag at the American consulate in Hong Kong. (no longer available at source, text can be found here ) \\"The lives of those killed and injured was secondary to the escalating tensions between the two powers,\\" states a study of the diplomatic exchanges surrounding the affair. \\"US officials to the families of the deceased were only incidental and, at best, pro-forma.\\" An anti-American Protest in Nanjing The raid caused a dramatic rise in tension between China and the United States. An official statement on Chinese television denounced what it called a \\"barbaric attack and a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty\\". China's ambassador to the UN described what he called \\"NATO's barbarian act\\" as \\"a gross violation of the United Nations charter, international law and the norms governing international relations\\" and \\"a violation of the Geneva convention\\". Large demonstrations erupted at consular offices of the United States and other NATO countries in China in reaction to news of the bombing. On May 9, 1999, then vice-president Hu Jintao delivered a national televised speech condemning the \\"barbaric\\" and \\"criminal conduct\\" of NATO, which \\"incited the fury of the Chinese people.\\"(Chinese) \\"ËµÑÊñôÔºö1999Âπ¥5Êúà9Êó•ËÉ°Èî¶Ê∂õÂ∞±ÊàëÈ©ªÂçó‰ΩøÈ¶ÜÈÅ≠Ë¢≠ÂáªÂèëË°®ËÆ≤ËØù\\" Accessed July 1, 2011 He said the unauthorized demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang reflected the anger and patriotism of the Chinese people, and which the Chinese government fully supported, but urged against extreme and illegal conduct.\\"Chinese in Belgrade, Beijing protest NATO embassy bombing\\" May 9, 1999 The protests continued for several days, during which tens of thousands of rock-throwing protesters kept US Ambassador James Sasser and other staff trapped in the Beijing embassy. The residence of the US Consul in Chengdu was damaged by fire and protestors tried to burn the consulate in Guangzhou. There were no reported injuries. President Clinton's apologies and those of the US State Department were not initially broadcast by Chinese state-run media outlets. The demonstrations continued for four days before the Chinese government called a halt, eventually broadcasting President Clinton's apology on television and ordering the police to restrain the demonstrators. For a week, President Jiang Zemin declined phone calls from President Bill Clinton, eventually accepting a 30-minute apology call on Friday, May 14, in which Clinton expressed \\"regret\\" over the incident. Jiang had chosen to leave US- China leadership communications channels unused as he waited for the Politburo Standing Committee to reach a consensus. The time it took for the Politburo to gather necessary information and reach a decision about China's responses motivated Party leadership to revisit a proposal to establish a centralized National Security Commission, although this was ultimately not implemented. =Settlement= By the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In August, the U.S. government made a \\"voluntary humanitarian payment\\" of $4.5 million to the families of the three Chinese nationals who were killed and to the 27 injured in the bombing. On December 16, 1999, the two governments reached a settlement under which the United States agreed to pay $28 million in compensation for damage to the Chinese Embassy facility, and China agreed to pay $2.87 million in compensation for damage inflicted to the U.S. Embassy and other diplomatic facilities in China. Official investigation and reporting in the aftermath Late on May 8, US Defense Secretary William Cohen and George Tenet issued a joint press release stating neither the aircrew involved nor the equipment were to blame for the incident. The first attempt to explain the bombing came on May 10. William Cohen told reporters \\"In simple terms, one of our planes attacked the wrong target because the bombing instructions were based on an outdated map\\". The statement made no mention of the CIA. It was subsequently revealed that the CIA possessed maps showing the embassy. While US officials then began, on the record, to deflect questions pending the outcome of further enquiries, they continued to brief journalists off the record. For example, also on May 10 Eric Schmitt published an account with most of the elements that were to feature in DCI Tenet's later admissions. The officials briefed Schmitt that \\"the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency ... look very similar: same size, shape and height\\", and that the buildings were apart, which was less than half of the measureddistance. Media criticism focused on the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), which issued a press release to counter the attacks stating that \\"recent news reports regarding the accuracy of NIMA maps have been inaccurate or incomplete\\" and that \\"a hardcopy map is neither intended, nor used, as the sole source for target identification and approval\\". CIA Director George Tenet later acknowledged that the map used should never have been used for aerial bombing target selection. =Official State Department account= In June, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering led a delegation to China to present the US version of events. According to the official account, CIA analysts knew the address of the Yugoimport office to be Bulevar Umetnosti 2 (2 Boulevard of the Arts). Using this information, they attempted to pinpoint its geographic location by using the known locations and addresses of other buildings on parallel streets as reference points. Pickering referred to this technique as intersection and resection, not related to the method of resection and intersection. Parallel lines were drawn from known addresses and locations on a parallel street. With this information it was attempted to reconstruct the pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti, which was information unknown to the targeters. The pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti was not as expected, and the targeter erroneously pinpointed the embassy \\"located on a small side street at some distance on Bulevar Umetnosti\\" from the intended target. This was not true as Ulica Tresnjevog Cveta (Cherry Blossom St, the small side street where the embassy was located) does not connect with Bulevar Umetnosti which ends short of the junction with Cherry Blossom St. A procedure designed to determine the coordinates of a known address on a known street produced the coordinates of a different address on a street neither a continuation of nor connected to the street targeted. Multiple checks designed to prevent attacks on sensitive targets each failed as the location of the embassy had not been updated since the embassy moved to New Belgrade three years earlier. As a result, the bombers took to the air with the coordinates of the Chinese embassy programmed into the bombs on board. This account did not draw a connection between the use of an old map and the targeting of the embassy and did not address the reason that target authorization listed the objective as a warehouse instead of an office building. =George Tenet statement= On July 22, George Tenet made a statement before a public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. Covering the same ground as Under Sec. Pickering's statement in China, he additionally acknowledged the target package originated within the CIA and that it was the sole CIA-directed strike of the war, stated that he had been personally unaware that the CIA was circulating strike requests and recognised that the CIA possessed maps correctly displaying the embassy. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre, giving evidence the same day, stated that \\"NIMA is not at fault\\". =Chinese reaction= Few Chinese politicians believed the US version of events, believing instead the strike had been deliberate. Former ambassador Li Daoyu stated \\"we don't say it was a decision of Clinton or the White House\\", but the Chinese government describes the US explanation for \\"the so-called mistaken bombing\\" as \\"anything but convincing\\" and has never accepted the US version of events. The incident left a toxic legacy on China- NATO relations and kept them frozen for years. In a 2011 meeting with US officials in the aftermath of the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan, Chinese general Ma Xiaotian directly referred to the embassy bombing by asking \\"Were you using the wrong maps again?\\" Observers immediately noted the \\"cutting\\" nature of the remark, describing it as \\"jibing\\" and \\"priceless\\". Observer and Politiken investigation Acting on a tip-off, Jens Holsoe of Danish newspaper Politiken contacted UK paper The Observer with a view to conducting a joint investigation. Holsoe, together with John Sweeney and Ed Vulliamy of The Observer, interviewed numerous sources including a NATO officer \\"serving in an operational capacity at the four-star level\\", a staff-officer serving at a two-star level, a \\"very high-ranking\\" former US intelligence officer, a NATO flight controller at the Naples HQ for Kosovo air operations, and a US NIMA official. After a four-month investigation, they published their findings on Oct 17. According to the journalists' investigation the embassy bombing was a deliberate attack, which is consistent with the pattern of strikes that night where, according to NATO's official briefing of May 8, \\"the focus was wholly on disrupting the national leadership [of Yugoslavia]\\". Apart from \\"the FDSP weapons warehouse\\", every target that night was a command and control (C2) center. A further report in The Observer of November 28, 1999 added more details. According to the report, American officials indicated that the reason behind the bombing of the embassy, was because they believe the embassy had provided signals facilities for ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá, commonly known as Arkan, a Serb paramilitary leader wanted by the ICTY for war crimes. NATO's briefing of May 8, which stated Arkan's HQ was at the Hotel Yugoslavia away, is consistent with this interpretation. Representatives of NATO governments dismissed the investigation. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described it as \\"balderdash\\" and UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there wasn't a \\"shred of evidence to support this rather wild story\\". Initially, the New York Times refused to report on the investigation until its findings could be corroborated. Subsequently, Andrew Rosenthal informed letter-writers by post that the Times hadn't found evidence to support the allegations. The Times didn't contact the authors or their sources. Other sources, including major American media such as the Washington Post, New York Times, and Chicago Tribune maintained that while responsibility was found in the inaccurate planning of air strikes, the attack was not deliberate. International News wires like The Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France Press (AFP) published numerous reports supporting both the accidental and deliberate attack theories. The American media was criticized for devoting little attention to the incident, as well as for consistently referring to the incident as an \\"accidental bombing\\", where China contested that belief. A 2010 Salon article by Laura Rozen featured an interview of Washington Post columnist and former intelligence officer William M. Arkin, who was dismissive of the investigation. While acknowledging that investigators had spoken to signals intelligence officers in NATO, Arkin told Rozen: \\"The Chinese Embassy and the Hotel Yugoslavia, where Arkan's generals were believed to be commanding his paramilitary Tigers, are right across the street from each other, and in fact both were bombed the same night ... I think there were communications emanating from the Hotel Yugoslavia across the street. And I think that stupid people who are leaking rumors to the Observer have made that mistake.\\" The Hotel Yugoslavia was attacked on May 7, but NATO was aware of its function and connection with Arkan. Arkin did not discuss the way that NATO planners could be aware of the HQ and target it successfully if they were confused about its location. ICTY investigation A report conducted by the ICTY entitled \\"Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\" after the Kosovo War examined the attack on the Chinese embassy specifically and came to the conclusion that the OTP (Office of the Prosecutor) should not undertake an investigation concerning the bombing. In reaching its decision, it provided the following observations: *That the root of the failures in target location appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer in an effort to pinpoint the location of the FDSP (Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement) building at Bulevar Umetnosti 2. The officer used techniques known as \\"intersection\\" and \\"resection\\" which, while appropriate to locate distant or inaccessible points or objects, are inappropriate for use in aerial targeting as they provide only an approximate location. Using this process, the individual mistakenly determined that the building which we now know to be the Chinese Embassy was the FDSP headquarters. *The USA has formally apologized to the Chinese Government and agreed to pay $28 million in compensation to the Chinese Government and $4.5 million to the families of those killed or injured. The CIA has also dismissed one intelligence officer and reprimanded six senior managers. The US Government also claims to have taken corrective actions in order to assign individual responsibility and to prevent mistakes such as this from occurring in the future. *The aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency. Amnesty International report Amnesty International examined the NATO air campaign and assessed the legality of its actions. In the case of the embassy bombing Amnesty reported both on the official explanation and to the Observer/Politiken investigation without arbitrating as to which was true. NATO was criticised for continuing its bombing campaign uninterrupted when its safeguards to protect civilians were known to be faulty. A genuinely accidental attack would not imply legal responsibility, but the report stated that \\"the very basic information needed to prevent this mistake was publicly and widely available\\" and that \\"NATO failed to take the necessary precautions required by Article 57(2) of Protocol I\\" of the Geneva Conventions.\\"COLLATERAL DAMAGE\\" OR UNLAWFUL KILLINGS? p. 52 Aftermath =Future of the location= Marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing, on May 7, 2009, mayor of Belgrade Dragan ƒêilas and Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Wei Jinghua dedicated a commemorative plaque on the location. The author of the plaque was Nikola Kolja Milunoviƒá. During the visit of the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping to Serbia in June 2016, he and his Serbian counterpart Tomislav Nikoliƒá visited the location, declared the nearby turnaround a Square of the Serbian-Chinese Friendship and announced the construction of the Chinese Cultural Center on the location of the former embassy. The construction of the center began on July 20, 2017, in the presence of mayor Sini≈°a Mali and Chinese ambassador Li Manchang. The center will have ten floors, two below the ground and eight above, with the total floor area of . The project will cost 45 million euros. In 2020, the Milunoviƒá's plaque was replaced by the new, \\"modest\\" square memorial. While the inscription on the original plaque gave explanation why it was placed there, had the date of the bombing and number of victims, the new one has a generic text, inscribed in Serbian and Chinese: As a token of gratitude to PR China for support and friendship in hardest moments for the people of the Republic of Serbia, and in memory of the killed. This sparked objections by the Belgraders, who called the new memorial \\"a shame\\" and a \\"table which says nothing\\", asking for the reinstatement of the old plaque. =Rise of anti- Western sentiment= Given Serbia's strong relationship with Russia over history, this had led a very catastrophic consequence, the surge of anti- Western sentiment together in Russia and China increased, serving as a prelude to the future alliance between the two countries.https://pittnews.com/article/121917/opinions/analysis-1999-nato- operation-turned-russia-west/ Both Russia and China had condemned the attack on Serbia and still saw this as a deliberate act caused by the U.S. Government, leading to the re-militarisation of both countries and the warm-up of China‚ÄìRussia relations.https://www.chinausfocus.com/peace-security/we- remember-1999-very-well--the-nato-bombing-of-the-federal-republic-of- yugoslavia-and-its-impacts-on-sino-russian- See also * Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force *Yinhe incident *Hainan Island Incident References  External links  * NATO bombed Chinese deliberately * Fresh evidence that NATO's bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade was deliberate * No, the CCP Has Not Forgotten How the US Bombed the Chinese Embassy in 1999 ‚Äì By Peter Lee * CIA takes rap for embassy attack by Martin Kettle, The Guardian, April 10, 2000 * Chinese Embassy Bombing‚ÄìMedia Reply, FAIR Responds * China's intelligence might have been collecting pieces from the F-117 shot down in Yugoslavia \\"China's New Stealth Fighter May Use US Technology\\", January 23, 2011 * Former Chinese ambassador about persons killed an injured when embassy bombed * Xi Jinping pays homage to Chinese martyrs killed in NATO bombing * CCTV Xinwen Lianbo report on * BBC News essay: The night the US bombed a Chinese embassy Explosions in 1999 China‚ÄìUnited States military relations Accidents and incidents involving United States Air Force aircraft Aerial operations and battles of the Kosovo War 1999 in Serbia 1999 in China May 1999 events in Europe Airstrikes conducted by the United States War-related deaths People killed during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia Journalists killed while covering the Yugoslav Wars Combat incidents Attacks on diplomatic missions of China 1990s in Belgrade Civilian casualties in the Kosovo War NATO airstrikes Incidents involving NATO Attacks on government buildings and structures Office buildings in Serbia ","title":"United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade"},{"id":"4304051","text":"The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (ICCB) was a camel-mounted infantry brigade that the British Empire raised in December 1916 during the First World War for service in the Middle East. From a small beginning the unit eventually grew to a brigade of four battalions, one battalion each from Great Britain and New Zealand and two battalions from Australia. Support troops included a mountain artillery battery, a machine gun squadron, Royal Engineers, a field ambulance, and an administrative train. The ICC became part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and fought in several battles and engagements, in the Senussi Campaign, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, and in the Arab Revolt. The brigade suffered 246 men killed. The ICC was disbanded in May 1919 after the end of the war. Formation =Background= Australian camel company The advantages of camels in a desert environment are well known, and the British Army had raised the Somaliland Camel Corps in 1912.Clayton, p.205 However the British Army forces serving in Egypt at the start of the First World War did not possess their own camel formation. The first units of what became the Imperial Camel Corps were four company-sized formations that conducted long- range patrols around the Suez Canal and the Sinai Desert. The companies were raised in Egypt in January 1916 from Australians returning from the failed Gallipoli Campaign. The Indian princely state of Bikaner supplied the first camels as the Bikaner Camel Corps already used camels. These camels were later only used as draught animals and the lighter Egyptian camel became the mount chosen for carrying troops. The camels could cover an average distance of an hour, or an hour trotting, while carrying a soldier, his equipment, and supplies. The camel companies consisted of a small headquarters and four sections, each of seven groups of four men. The establishment of a company was 130 men, all armed with Lee‚ÄìEnfields, the standard British bolt action rifle of the time. However the move from patrol to a more active combat role in August 1916 led to a re-organisation. Each company added a machine-gun section of fifteen men with three Lewis guns; the company headquarters also received extra staff. All this increased company strength to 184 men. The four companies were expected to operate as independent units that travelled by camel but then dismounted to fight as infantrymen. Following the practise of cavalry and mounted infantry units, one man of each group of four held the camels when the team was in action, which reduced a team's firepower by a quarter. However it was soon discovered that camels were not as nervous as horses when faced with artillery and rifle fire, and one man would look after twelve to sixteen camels once the troopers had dismounted. In March 1916 six new companies were raised from British yeomanry regiments. Then in June another four Australian companies were raised from reinforcements intended for the Australian Light Horse regiments. Reinforcements from New Zealand intended for the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade formed two companies, one created in August and the second in November. =Brigade= The Hong Kong and Singapore (Mountain) Battery The Imperial Camel Brigade was formed on 19 December 1916,Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 252. under the command of Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith VC. The brigade originally comprised three battalions, 1st (Australian), 2nd (British), and 3rd (Australian), plus supporting units. Each of the battalions had an authorised strength of 770 men and 922 camels. A battalion comprised four companies and a headquarters. The 4th (ANZAC) Battalion was raised in May 1917, but instead of increasing the brigade fighting strength, it was decided one battalion would always be resting and refitting, while three battalions served at the front. To complete the brigade structure and supply added firepower, the brigade received some other units: the 265th (Camel) Machine Gun Squadron, with eight Vickers machine guns, and the Hong Kong and Singapore (Mountain) Battery, armed with six BL 2.75 inch Mountain Guns. Despite their title, the battery was formed by men from the British Indian Army. The brigade also had its own Royal Engineers (the 10th (Camel) Field Troop), a signal section, the Australian (Camel) Field Ambulance, and the 97th Australian Dental Unit, which with only four men was the brigade's smallest unit. The brigade included the ICC Mobile Veterinary Section, and the brigade's logistic units were the ICC Brigade Ammunition Column and the ICC Brigade Train, which carried enough supplies for five days. The total brigade strength was around 4,150 men and 4,800 camels. Operational history =1916=  Battalions  Imperial Camel Corps at the Battle of Magdhaba In March 1916, after two months of training, the first camel patrols left their depot at Abassi on the outskirts of Cairo to patrol the Libyan Desert. In 1915 the Senussi had attacked British and Egyptian outposts along the Suez canal and the Mediterranean coast. The resulting Senussi Campaign was largely over by then, but the patrols were to show the Senussi that the British were watching them, and to protect the border areas. Around the same time long-range patrols, each of about thirty men, went into the south and south-east of the Sinai desert to detect any Ottoman incursion into the area. When the patrols discovered Ottoman outposts, the brigade organized a company-strength raid against the outposts. The ICC undertook similar patrols in the north to protect the rail and water lines, which were vital for any British attack.  Brigade  The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) went over to the offensive in the Sinai Desert in August, winning the Battle of Romani. In support of these operations in December the brigade moved into the Sinai; their first large battle came during the Battle of Magdhaba on 23 December, two days after the brigade was formed. =1917= On 9 January 1917 the ICC was involved in another victory during the Battle of Rafa, which forced the Ottomans to withdraw the Sinai outposts towards Gaza. This also reduced the need for independent camel patrols across the Sinai; in May the EEF consolidated the now-surplus companies into a new unit, the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion. The intensity of operations grew and the ICC were next involved in the capture of the Turkish force at Bir el Hassana,The 2nd Battalion of the ICC, together with the Hongkong and Singapore Mountain Battery marched some 30 miles from El Arish, surprising the Turkish forces at Bir el Hassana, who surrendered without resistance. Some local Bedouin fired on the British, who suffered one casualty, a soldier who was shot in the ankle. Because he could no longer ride, the British evacuated him by aeroplane, in the first recorded case of aeromedical evacuation. the defeats during the First Battle of Gaza in March, and the Second Battle of Gaza in April and a raid on the Sana redoubt in August. They then had a break to refit. Subsequently, they participated in the victories in the Battle of Beersheba, the Third Battle of Gaza, and at the Battle of Mughar Ridge during October and November. By the end of the year the advance had crossed the Sinai and entered Palestine. =1918= ICC troops crossing the River Jordan to attack Amman April 1918 Early in 1918, the ICC moved to the area of the Jordan valley and took part in the attack in March and April. The First Battle of Amman was unsuccessful; after three days of battle the British were unable to break through the Ottoman defences around the city and had to withdraw. The 4th (Anzac) Battalion did succeed in capturing Hill 3039 overlooking the city and managed to hold out for twenty- four hours in the face of artillery and infantry attacks, until ordered to withdraw. During the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt, the camel brigade were assigned the western defence of the Jordan River ford at Umm esh Shert defending the left flank of the 4th Light Horse Brigade. The camel brigade was unable to support the light horsemen, which were attacked on the left flank and forced to withdraw.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 368, 375 When the EEF advanced out of the Sinai and into Palestine, the change in terrain led to the disbandment of the ICC. In June 1918, the Australian troops were used to form the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments. The New Zealand troops formed the 2nd New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron. All three units became part of the 5th Light Horse Brigade. The six British companies remained part of the ICC for a while longer. Two of them fought with T.E. Lawrence in the Arab Revolt, and in July 1918 carried out operations sabotaging the Hejaz railway line. However, no reinforcements were assigned and the six remaining companies were reduced in strength to two before they were eventually disbanded in May 1919. Brigadier-General Claude Stuart Rome took over as Colonel of the corps in June 1918. Aftermath Imperial Camel Corps Memorial in London Over two years of service cost the ICC 240 deaths: 106 British, 84 Australians, 41 New Zealanders, and nine men from India. A memorial to the Imperial Camel Corps was unveiled on the 22 July 1921, on the Thames Embankment in London. On one side it is inscribed with the names of all the members of the corps who died during the war, while on the front is the sentiment; > To the Glorious and Immortal Memory of the Officers, N.C.O's and Men of the > Imperial Camel Corps ‚Äì British, Australian, New Zealand, Indian ‚Äì who fell > in action or died of wounds and disease in Egypt, Sinai, and Palestine, > 1916, 1917, 1918.

Prior to closing in 2009, the RIS weekly audience was 1,200 listeners with two-thirds of the audience over 60 years of age. Most listeners lived in Allegheny, Washington and Westmoreland Counties but RIS also served nine other counties in the region, including Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence and Somerset. RIS also serves parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Listeners accessed RIS through a special FM radio receiver, over the Internet, on Comcast Cable systems or through the RIS Telephone Dial-In Service. Programming RIS based its programming on its motto \\"Independence Through Information\\". Given that many visual impairments tend to be age-related, RIS's services were specially tailored to their needs. One of the most popular programs was the daily newspapers where a pair of narrators read local and regional newspapers, including the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Other programming included popular magazines, ads from grocery, drug and department stores, TV listings and other special interest publications. Additionally, RIS provided translations of printed material to Braille or audio recording. History At its founding in 1976 RIS was broadcast from the campus of Duquesne University to whom it paid rent for space and a small fee for transmitter use on WDUQ-FM. Around 1991, the University told the small non-profit that it no longer had room for them on its campus and gave it 30 days to vacate. Protesting loudly, the service was able to convince the University that 30 days was not ample time to relocate. Following a year of emergency fund raising, design, and build-out, the station moved to the Birmingham Towers on the Southside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 2004, facing a lack of funding and a possible shutdown, the board of RIS began exploring possibilities of partnering with another organization. On November 1, 2005, RIS entered into a Management Agreement with WDUQ. This agreement allowed the reading service to remain a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a governing board responsible for all fundraising and community outreach while WDUQ was responsible for the day-to- day RIS business operations, including programming, services, personnel and volunteer management. However, by 2009, the service was no longer able to sustain operations, and the service went inactive on August 14, 2009.

It was produced by El-P and released on his Definitive Jux label on May 15, 2001. The album has since been reissued by iHipHop Distribution. Release The Cold Vein was the first full-length album to be released on former Company Flow member El-P's newly founded Definitive Jux record label, and its release was preceded by a significant amount of hype, particularly within the hip hop community. In late 2000, a split double vinyl single was released by Definitive Jux, containing three new songs by Company Flow and two tracks taken from The Cold Vein: \\"Iron Galaxy\\" and \\"Straight Off the D.I.C.\\". These songs also appeared on the label compilation album Def Jux Presents, released on March 20, 2001. The first single, \\"Vein\\", was released in April 2001 with \\"A B-Boy's Alpha\\" serving as its b-side. The album was eventually released on May 15, 2001. An instrumental companion to the album entitled El-P Presents Cannibal Oxtrumentals was released on March 19, 2002 on Definitive Jux. AllMusic contributor Victor W. Valdivia wrote: \\"Mainly, the album sounds as if it were the soundtrack for an unmade film, much as the work Eno made in the 1970s, since the tracks have a distinct cinematic quality that allows them to cohere and flow beautifully.\\" Critical reception The Cold Vein was well- received by critics, drawing many favorable comparisons to the 36 Chambers-era Wu-Tang Clan. Many praised El-P's production work, with CMJ contributor Brian Coleman writing, \\"Producer El-P of Company Flow gives this Harlem-bred and Brooklyn-based vocal duo of Vast Aire and Shamar what usually sounds like a full goth orchestra perched in a dank basement, with thick synth strings, simulated outer-space found-sounds and choppy, pounding drums.\\" AllMusic contributor Sam Samuelson wrote, \\"El-P (a serious candidate for producer of the year) lays out some of the most lushly intriguing sounds and beats that feel as herky-jerky as they sound gilded with silk.\\" The album was also noted for its profound lyrical content; many critics and fans felt Vast Aire's and Vordul Mega's lyrics painted a vivid picture of a poverty-stricken New York. Gavin Mueller of Stylus Magazine wrote about \\"The F-Word\\", a song addressing unrequited love: \\"Moments like these show not only the skill of Can Ox's MCs, but the potential for hip hop lyrics to work on as many levels as the finest English poetry.\\" Later placing the album at number 17 on its list of the top 50 albums of 2000‚Äì2005, the publication wrote: =Accolades= The Cold Vein was included on several publications' year-end and decade-end lists of best albums. Online music magazine Pitchfork placed The Cold Vein at number 152 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

HipHopDX listed it among the 30 best underground hip hop albums released since 2000. Legacy The Cold Vein only broke through to the mainstream on a small level. However, its legacy has grown significantly over the years and the album is today widely considered as one of the best independent hip hop albums of the 2000s as well as perhaps the best album released on Definitive Jux.

John Flanagan was born in the townland of Kilbreedy East, near Martinstown in County Limerick, Ireland. He emigrated to the United States of America in 1896. At that time he already held the world record for the hammer throw. He competed for both the New York Athletic Club and the Irish American Athletic Club, and was part of a group of Irish-American athletes known as the Irish Whales. In 1900 Flanagan represented his new country at the Olympic Games. Flanagan, the only non-college man to medal for the Americans, outdistanced American athlete Truxtun Hare by 4.75 meters in the hammer throw. Hare and Josiah McCracken, both college football players from Pennsylvania, took silver and bronze. Flanagan also competed in the discus throw, finishing seventh. Flanagan joined the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in 1903, and his first assignment was to the Bureau of Licenses, where he had a lot of time on his hands, which was mostly used to train at the Irish American Athletic Club in Queens. It was during that time that he became one of the masters of the three-turn technique. In the 1904 Olympic Games, sporting the Winged Fist of the Irish American Athletic Club, Flanagan set a new world record of 168 feet, 1 inch. He placed second to the Canadian, √âtienne Desmarteau, in the 56-pound throw event. In 1905, while attached to the 37th Precinct, Flanagan competed in the Police Athletic Association games held at Celtic Park in New York. \\"Not only did he win four of weight-throwing events, but, as if to show that he could do a little sprinting as readily as he can outclass his competitors with the 16 and 56 pound weights, he not only had the temerity to enter the fat men's race, but actually won it,\\" giving him a total of five first place victories, \\"a most commendable showing, for there were many mighty policemen arrayed against him.\\"\\"Athletic Policemen in Celtic Park Games; World's Champion Weight Thrower, J. Flanagan, Takes 5 Firsts.\\" New York Times, Oct. 22, 1905. In the 1908 Olympics in London, Flanagan broke his own record with a hammer throw of 170 feet, 4.5 inches. The silver that year went to another New York City police officer, the former record holder Matt McGrath. John Flanagan competed in the tug-of-war as well. On July 24, 1909, at the age of 41, Flanagan set his last world record in the hammer, with a throw of 56.18 meters. Flanagan quit the police force in 1910, after his public office squad was abolished and he was transferred to the West 68th Street Station and forced to walk a beat along Central Park West, giving him no time to train and compete. He returned home to Limerick in 1911 and took over the family farm following the death of his father in 1912. He continued to compete in Ireland and won his final international event when competing against Scotland in 1911. He also won the Irish Hammer Championships of 1911 and 1912. Following his retirement, he coached a number of athletes, including Patrick O'Callaghan, who went on to win two Olympic gold medals in the hammer throw at the 1928 and 1932 games. He died at home in Limerick, aged 70, on 3 June 1938.Obituary in New York Times, June 5, 1938. A statue of Flanagan was erected beside Martinstown Church in Limerick in 2001.

Inari is a popular deity associated with foxes, rice, household wellbeing, business prosperity, and general prosperity. Inari shrines are typically constructed of white stucco walls with red-lacquered woodwork, and their entrances are marked by vermilion torii. Both Buddhist and Shinto Inari shrines are located throughout Japan.  Origins  The original legend of Inari as described in the Yamashiro fudoki is the story of Hata no Irogu, a Korean immigrant, who used sticky rice for target practice. Legend states that once an arrow pierces the rice, the rice would transform into a white bird and fly to the peak of Mount Mitsumine. Upon its arrival to the mountain, the white bird changed back into rice plants. The development of Inari shrines began in the ninth century when Inari was appointed the protector kami for the Toji temple at Kyoto by Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism. Kobo Daishi's recognition of the deity played a large part in the advancement of Inari worship. Recorded legend describes Kobo Daishi's ascent of Inari mountain, where he meets an old man and recognizes him as the rice kami, Inari. Kobo Daishi understood Inari's significance and built a shrine for the kami and inscribed on it the Chinese characters for \\"rice\\" and \\"sack\\". The spread of Inari worship first began through the kami's adoption as a yashikigami, which functioned as an estate deity that are commonly enshrined on family land. Inari worship expanded further as it was adopted by merchants of developing cities and became the kami of business. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the practice of dividing and re-enshrining deities became a common practice, especially in the case of Inari. The reason for this was to increase the status of the deity's town or patron. This practice continues today, and the Motomiya festival is held annually in celebration of the roughly one thousand enshrinements of the Inari kami. This number includes small household shrines and shrines belonging to other public institutions. There are many different variations of Inari origin myths, many of which developed and changed based on local and personal worship practices. The function of Inari as a deity is fluid as over time, the term \\"Inari\\" has begun to encompass a wide variety of deities and beliefs.  Enshrined Deity  Inari Okami Japanese fox (kitsune) deity (kami) Inari or Inari Okami is the Japanese kami of improvement in the performing arts, household wellbeing, business prosperity, and general prosperity. Inari is also attributed to rice, sake, tea, fertility, foxes, agriculture, and industry. The word ‚ÄúInari‚Äù is an abbreviated term for ‚ÄúIne Nari‚Äù or ‚ÄúIne ni naru‚Äù, which translates to ‚Äúreaping of rice‚Äù. The ancient Japanese word stems from the importance of rice in the daily Japanese diet and symbolizes the miracles of heaven and earth. As one of the principal deities of Shinto, Inari houses, feeds, and protects all people so that they may live a fulfilling life. Inari is one of the most widely venerated kami in Japanese culture. Shrines and offerings = Architecture = Thousand-Torii Path at Inari's main shrine at Fushimi in SE Kyoto. Inari is a popular deity associated with both Shinto and Buddhist shrines located throughout Japan. According to a 2007 report from Kokugakuin University,Okada, Sh≈çji. \\"Gendai Jinja no Shink≈ç Bunpu\\", Kokugakuin University, 2007 2970 shrines are dedicated to Inari. This number includes only Shinto shrines that are registered as religious corporations and are a part of the Association of Shinto Shrines. Small roadside or field shrines, shrines kept in a home or corporate office, and Buddhist temples were not included in this statistic but, if they were the number might increase by a large amount.Gorai, Shigeru. Inari Shink≈ç no Kenky≈´. Okayama: Sany≈ç Shimbunsha, 1985 Inari worship continues to center around folk-religion practices and remains unchanged by Meiji Restorations. Inari shrines are well known and remain some of the most familiar and recognizable shrines to the Japanese people. The entrance to an Inari shrine is typically marked by one or more vermilion torii and images of foxes, which are often adorned with red yodarekake (votive bibs) by worshippers out of respect. The color red has come to be identified with Inari because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their torii.Smyers, Karen Ann. (1999). The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. ; ; OCLC 39523475 The main Inari shrine is the Fushimi Inari-taisha in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, where the path to the shrine is marked by around a thousand torii. Inari shrines typically possess guardian figures in the form of foxes or kitsune. These guardian figures are messengers of Inari but are commonly thought of as the deity itself. The kitsune statues typically come in pairs, and each represent a male and female. Often these fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw. The items may include a jewel or a key which are most common but, a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are also popular. Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary. The statues are rarely realistic; they are typically stylized, portraying a seated animal with its tail in the air looking forward. Despite these common characteristics, the statues are highly individualistic in nature and no two are exactly the same.Hearn, Lafcadio. Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan. Project Gutenberg e-text edition, 2005. 152-153. Retrieved on February 19, 2007. Today, fox statues found at entrances signify the presence of an Inari shrine. Kitsune holding a key in its mouth, at the main gate of the Fushimi Inari shrine = Offerings = Offerings of rice, sake, and other foods are given at the shrine to appease and please these kitsune messengers, who are then expected to plead with Inari on the worshipper's behalf. Inari-zushi, a Japanese sushi roll of rice-packed fried tofu, is another popular offering. Fried tofu is believed to be a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari- zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association. Priests do not normally offer food to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to purchase and use as an offering. Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple. At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice. The Toyokawa Inari temple has a sign noting that live foxes were kept on site in the 1920s.

For the town in northwestern Wisconsin, see Apple River, Wisconsin. The Apple River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed October 5, 2012 tributary of the St. Croix River in northwestern Wisconsin in the United States. Via the St. Croix, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. It issues from Staples Lake in Barron County and flows generally southwestwardly through Polk and St. Croix counties. In northern Polk County, it gathers the Fox Creek near White Ash Lake and traverses several lakes throughout its course. The river flows through the city of Amery and the villages of Star Prairie and Somerset. It joins the St. Croix River northeast of Stillwater, Minnesota. In the Ojibwe language, the Apple River is called Waabiziipinikaan-ziibi, meaning \\"River Abundant with Swan Potatoes\\". This name was translated into French, but only pomme (apple) of the French word for \\"potato\\" (pomme de terre - apple from the earth) was translated into English. The Apple River was once an important route of trade for the logging industry; timber was floated downstream from logging camps in the north to a sawmill in Amery, Wisconsin where it was cut, loaded onto trains and transported throughout the region. Today, the river generates tourism revenue through recreation and resorts. Its relatively gentle rapids make it very popular for canoeing, tubing, camping, concerts, and is a popular fishing spot through all seasons.

In the 9th-10th centuries, it was also the name of a Byzantine military-civilian province (or thema) known as the Theme of Longobardia located in southeastern Italy. History The term was traditionally used for the Lombard possessions, with the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor distinguishing between \\"Great Longobardia\\" (Greek: ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ ŒõŒøŒ≥Œ≥ŒøŒ≤Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒØŒ±; Latin: Longobardia major), namely the Lombard kingdom in northern Italy, and \\"Lesser Longobardia\\" (Latin: Longobardia minor), which comprised southern Italy, with the Lombard duchies of Benevento, Spoleto, Salerno and Capua, the Byzantine possessions, and the city-states (Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi) under Byzantine suzerainty.. In its strictest and most technical sense, the name referred to the province (thema) which encompassed the modern Italian region of Apulia and parts of Basilicata, with Bari as its capital.. Its exact origin and evolution are not entirely clear. After a century of almost complete absence from the affairs of the Italian peninsula, Byzantium once more began to intervene actively under Basil I the Macedonian (reigned 867‚Äì886), whose western policy aimed to clear the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raiders, re-establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia, and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy. In this process, Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873, and in 876 the Byzantines took over Bari, which had been captured from its Saracen rulers in 871 by Louis II of Italy. It was probably at this juncture that the foundations of the later theme were laid, perhaps in the form of a subordinate division (tourma) of the thema of Cephallenia.. The campaigns of Nikephoros Phokas the Elder in the mid-880s and of his successors greatly expanded the area under Byzantine control, which came to include all of Calabria, Apulia, and the Basilicata. Even Benevento, the centre of Lombard power in southern Italy, was captured in 891. The first reference to Longobardia as a theme dates to precisely this time, but at first it appears that it was administered jointly with other European themata of the Byzantine Empire: in 891 the first known strategos (military governor) of Longobardia, Symbatikios, was also governor of Macedonia, Thrace and Cephallenia, while his successor George administered Longobardia jointly with its parent thema, Cephallenia. A dedicated strategos solely for Longobardia is only attested from 911 on. In 938 and 956, it also appears united with the thema of Calabria, although the duration of this arrangement is unclear. At any rate, after c. 965, the two themata were permanently united into the new Catepanate of Italy, with the catepan's seat again at Bari. The Varangian Guard fought as part of the Byzantine army in several campaigns in the area, known to them as Langbardland; in their Scandinavian homeland, their exploits are commemorated in the Italy runestones.

Professional career =NFL= Manley was drafted in the fifth round (119th overall) of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, where he played for nine seasons. During his career with the Redskins, Manley won two Super Bowl titles and was a Pro Bowler in 1986 when he recorded a Redskins single-season record of 18.5 sacks. In 1989, Manley failed his third drug test, with an opportunity to apply for reinstatement after one year. He then played for the Phoenix Cardinals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, after he failed his fourth drug test, he retired on December 12, 1991. Officially, Manley had 97.5 quarterback sacks in his career. His total rises to 103.5 when the six sacks he had his rookie year of 1981, when sacks were not yet an official statistic, are included. After his career in the United States ended, he revealed that he was functionally illiterate, despite having studied at Oklahoma State University for four years. =CFL= Manley also played two seasons in the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1992 and 1993 after being banned from the NFL.

V1AR is also known as: * V1a vasopressin receptor * antidiuretic hormone receptor 1A * SCCL vasopressin subtype 1a receptor * V1-vascular vasopressin receptor AVPR1A * vascular/hepatic-type arginine vasopressin receptor  Structure and function  Human AVPR1A cDNA is 1472 bp long and encodes a 418 amino-acid long polypeptide which shares 72%, 36%, 37%, and 45% sequence identity with rat Avpr1a, human AVPR2, rat Avpr2, and human oxytocin receptor (OXTR), respectively. AVPR1A is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with 7 transmembrane domains that couples to Gaq/11 GTP binding proteins, which along with Gbl, activate phospholipase C activity. Clinically, the V1A receptor is related to vasoconstriction compared to the V1B receptor that is more related to ACTH release or the V2 receptor that is linked to the diuretic function of ADH.  Ligand binding  In the N-terminal juxtamembrane segment of the AVPR1A, the glutamate residue at position 54 (E54) and the arginine residue at position 46 (R46) are critical for binding with AVP and AVP agonists, with E54 likely to interact with AVP and R46 to contribute to a conformational switch. Competitors of [125I]Tyr-Phaa-specific binding to AVPR1A include: * Linear V1a antagonist phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-NH2 (Ki = 1.2 ¬± 0.2 nM) * Relcovaptan (SR-49059) (Ki = 1.3 ¬± 0.2 nM) * AVP (Ki = 1.8 ¬± 0.4 nM) * Linear V1a antagonist phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-Tyr-NH2 (Ki = 3.0 ¬± 0.5 nM) * V2 antagonist d(CH2)5-[D-Ile2, Ile4, Ala-NH2]AVP (Ki = 68 ¬± 17 nM) * Oxytocin (Ki = 129 ¬± 22 nM) The AVPR1A is endocytosed by binding to beta arrestin, which dissociates rapidly from AVPR1A to allow it to return to the plasma membrane; however, upon activation, AVPR1A can heterodimerize with AVPR2 to increase beta-arrestin-mediated endocytosis (and intracellular accumulation) of AVPR1A, since AVPR2 is far less likely to dissociate from beta-arrestin.  Role in behavior  The activity / genetic variants of the AVPR1A gene might be related to narcissism and gentle behavior. NatureNews has referred to AVPR1A as the \\"daring gene\\". The term \\"ruthlessness gene\\" has also been coined by Nature.comRuthlessness gene = Prairie vs. montane voles = The injection of oxytocin (OXT) vs. oxytocin antagonist (OTA) at birth has sexually dimorphic effects in prairie voles later on in life in various areas of the brain. Males treated with OXT showed increases in Avpr1a in the ventral palladium, lateral septum, and cingulate cortex, while females showed decreases; males treated with an OTA showed decreases in AVPR1A in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, and lateral septum. Although the Avpr1a coding region is 99% identical between prairie and montane voles, and binding and second messenger activity does not differ, patterns of distribution of Avpr1a differ drastically. = Mice = Male knockout mice in Avpr1a have reduced anxiety-like behavior and greatly impaired social recognition abilities, without any defects in spatial and nonsocial olfactory learning and memory tasks, as measured by the elevated plus maze, light/dark box, Morris water maze, forced swim, baseline acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition (PPI), and olfactory habituation tests. Some studies have shown Avpr1a knockout mice to have deficits in their circadian rhythms and olfaction. Avpr1a‚Äôs role in social recognition is particularly important in the lateral septum, as using viral vectors to replace inactivated Avpr1a expression rescues social recognition and increases anxiety-related behavior. However, conflicting results have been found in another study. Also, unlike vasopressin 1b receptor and oxytocin knockout mice, Avpr1a KO mice have a normal Bruce effect (appropriate failure of pregnancy in presence of novel male). Although activation of Avpr1a is a major mediator of anxiogenesis in males, it is not in females. = Rats = Avpr1a transcripts are diurnally expressed 12 hours out of phase from vasopressin expression in vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in both vasopressin-normal Sprague-Dawley rats, as well as vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats. Rats with reduced Avpr1a in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have increased incidences of the isolation potentiated startle, a measure of isolation-induced anxiety. Subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment (which induces symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia) reduces Avpr1a density in many brain regions, implying there might be a role for AVPR1A in schizophrenia. Avpr1a is present in the lateral septum, neocortical layer IV, hippocampal formation, amygdalostriatal area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal cord, and inferior olive, while mRNA transcripts for Avpr1a are found in the olfactory bulb, hippocampal formation, lateral septum, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, arcuate nucleus, lateral habenula, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra (pars compacta), superior colliculus, raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, inferior olive, choroid plexus, endothelial cells, area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract. = Humans = Although vasopressin cell and fibre distribution patterns are highly conserved across species (with centrally projecting systems being sexually dimorphic), the vasopressin receptor AVPR1A distribution differs both between and within species; vasopressin production occurs in the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the medial amygdala (projecting to the lateral septum and ventral pallidum), while vasopressin binding sites in humans are in the lateral septum, thalamus, basal amygdaloid nucleus, and brainstem, but not cortex. Human AVPR1A is situated on chromosome 12q14-15, and the promoter region does not have repeat sequences homologous to those found in prairie voles. Three polymorphic repetitive sequences have been found in humans in the 5‚Äô flanking region: RS3, RS1, and a (GT)25 dinucleotide repeat. A 2015 study found a correlation between AVPR1A expression and predisposition to extra-pair mating in women but not in men.  Polymorphisms  = RS3 = The AVPR1A repeat polymorphism RS3 is a complex (CT)4-TT-(CT)8-(GT)24 repeat that is 3625 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Homozygosity in allele 334 of RS3 is associated in men (but not women) with problems with pair-bonding behavior, measured by traits such as partner bonding, perceived marital problems, marital status, as well as spousal perception of marital quality. In a study of 203 male and female university students, participants with short (308-325 bp) vs. long (327-342) versions of RS3 were less generous, as measured by lower scores on both money allocations in the dictator game, as well as by self-report with the Bardi- Schwartz Universalism and Benevolence Value-expressive Behavior Scales; although the precise functional significance of longer AVPR1A RS3 repeats is not known, they are associated with higher AVPR1A postmortem hippocampal mRNA levels. Relative to all other alleles, the 334 allele of RS3 shows overactivation of left amygdala (in response to fearful face stimuli), with longer variants of RS3 additionally associated with stronger amygdala activation. = RS1 = The AVPR1A repeat polymorphism RS1 is a (GATA)14 tetranucleotide repeat that is 553 bp upstream from the transcription start site. Allele 320 in RS1 is associated with increased novelty seeking and decreased harm avoidance; additionally, relative to all other alleles, the 320 allele of RS1 showed significantly less activity in the left amygdala, with shorter variants showing a trend of stronger activity. = Other microsatellites = The AGAT polymorphism is associated with age of first intercourse in females, with those homozygous for long repeats more likely to have sex before age 15 than any other genotype. However, there is no evidence of preferential transmission of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking. Polymorphisms in AVPR1A have also been shown to be associated with social interaction skills, and have been linked to such diverse traits as dancing and musical ability, altruism and autism. Chimpanzees populations have individuals with single (only (GT)25 microsatellite) and duplicated (the (GT)25 microsatellite as well as the RS3) alleles, with allele frequencies of 0.795 and 0.205, respectively.

During the 1980s he was the singer, songwriter and guitarist for the Toronto punk band The Government, which released several records and appeared in video work by Paterson, as well as other video artists. Paterson is also an actor who has appearing in numerous videos and films, such as Boy, Girl by Bruce LaBruce and Zero Patience by John Greyson. Controlled Environments, from 1994 is one of his many works on video. Paterson's MONO LOGICAL is a series of seven monologues, plus clips from his narrative and performance-based video works (from the early eighties up until the early nineties). These clips are presented in tandem with his shorter digital new-media works and his more recent Super-8 tone poems. Paterson's media works, tapes, and films combine photographic tracking shots, montages of mediated found images, and voice-over discourses concerning urban space, global economics, and sexual possibilities. MONO LOGICAL plays on the tensions between language intended to be communicative and language that isn't. An academic, student, poet, police officer, entrepreneur, musician, and cleric all either lecture or perform. Their theatrical trappings might beg their sincerity, but their orations are to be taken very seriously. MONO LOGICAL throws curve balls and suggest parallel U-turns.

He is a switch hitter who is 6'0\\" tall, weighs 195 pounds, and throws right-handed. Career Latham played baseball at Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada, and in 1991 the Los Angeles Dodgers selected him in the June amateur draft, taking him with the 300th overall pick as part of the draft's 11th round. Latham enjoyed a breakout season with the Yakima Bears of the Northwest League in 1994, setting a club record with a .340 batting average . Latham also made the Northwest League's All-Star team that season, establishing himself as a prospect. The Major League Baseball Players Association went on strike late in 1994, and as a result major league organizations attempted to field teams of replacement players in the spring training before the 1995 season. Latham was one of the Dodgers' replacement players that spring, but the two sides reached a deal before any regular- season replacement games were played. On October 30, 1995, Latham was chosen as the player to be named later in a deal that had been concluded on July 31. Los Angeles received pitchers Kevin Tapani and Mark Guthrie from the Minnesota Twins, with Latham, Ron Coomer, Greg Hansell and Jos√© Parra going the other way. Latham made his major league debut with the Twins on April 12, 1997, appearing as a pinch runner for Todd Walker in an 11-6 win over the Kansas City Royals . He spent parts of the next three seasons with the Twins, but struggled to establish himself in the major leagues, and was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Scott Randall on December 7, 1999. Latham spent all of the 2000 season at the AAA level, then signed with the Toronto Blue Jays organization as a minor league free agent.

He was created 1st Baron Cunliffe in 1914. He chaired the Cunliffe Committee which reported in 1918 with a plan for the monetary policy of the central bank and government after the war, which helped to shape fiscal policy. Early life and family Cunliffe was born in London in 1855, the second eldest of four brothers and two sisters.

With both of his brothers, Arthur Robert and Leonard Daneham, he founded the merchant bank Cunliffe Brothers in 1890. On 1 January 1920, it merged with Fruhling and Goschen to become Goschens and Cunliffe, which failed in December 1939. Cunliffe became a director of the Bank of England in 1895 and its governor in 1913, working under Chancellors of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna, and Bonar Law. Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, he calmed the money markets by preventing both the suspension of payments in gold and the removal of foreign securities. He was created Baron Cunliffe, of Headley in the County of Surrey, in December 1914. In April‚ÄìMay 1917, he was a member of the Balfour Mission to promote co-operation with the United States during the war. Cunliffe was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in June 1917; he disagreed with Bonar Law later that year by feeling that the Treasury was taking too much of a role in maintaining the pound sterling's exchange rate. By November, Cunliffe had been forced to announce his imminent retirement, which occurred in March 1918. At the Bank of England, Cunliffe personally wrote one of the first office dress codes for women and noted that he was \\"pained by some of the costumes he encountered\\" in the hallways. His policy was conservative: \\"During the summer, white blouses are allowed but they must be absolutely white without coloured pattern or design upon them\\". He was appointed a director of North Eastern Railway in 1905 and of P. & O. Line in November 1919. He also received foreign decorations, including the Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur (France), the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (Japan), and the Order of St. Anna (first class, Russia). Something of his style is conveyed by the following anecdote from Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks: > Lord Cunliffe, giving evidence before a Royal Commission, at the special > request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would only say that the Bank of > England reserves were \\"very, very considerable\\". When pressed to give even > an approximate figure, he replied that he would be \\"very, very reluctant\\" to > add to what he had said.J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madan's > Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981 Throughout his tenure, as both a Director and a Governor of the Bank of England, he had a reputation not just for abrasiveness, but as a bully.David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pp. 259, 287 Cunliffe's manner was so arrogant and abrasive that, whilst Governor of the Bank of England, he had a strained relationship with two of the three Chancellors of the Exchequer with whom he worked (Reginald McKenna and Bonar Law).David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pp. 283-287 Cunliffe's arrogance did not only create tensions between the Bank of England and the Treasury, but also created animosity within the Bank of England itself. In the autumn of 1916, his colleagues within the Court of Directors were surreptitiously planning to force him out of the Bank's Governorship, but all the talk did not translate into effective action. David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pg. 285 The following November, however, the directors were organised effectively enough to ensure the election of Brien Cokayne as Governor and Montagu Norman as Deputy Governor. His dismissal \\"was a decision that Cunliffe found impossible to accept, mounting a vain campaign over the rest of 1917 to persuade bankers, press and senior figures at the Treasury to try to get Bonar Law to apply pressure on the Court to reverse its vote\\". This futile last stand Montague Norman describing Lord Cunliffe's efforts as \\"a clear case of megalomania\\" and accusing him of \\"behaving life a spoilt child\\", David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pg. 287 achieved nothing beyond Cunliffe's own humiliation.David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pg. 287 Cunliffe Committee As Governor of the Bank of England, Cunliffe chaired the Cunliffe Committee to recommend on the postwar transition of the British economy. The committee reported in 1918 that \\"it is imperative that after the war, the conditions necessary for the maintenance of an effective gold standard should be restored without delay\\". Prior to the committee's creation, Cunliffe had criticised the young John Maynard Keynes: \\"Mr. Keynes, in commercial circles, is not considered to have any knowledge or experience in practical exchange or business problems\\". Personal life In 1880, he was given the original farmhouse estate of Headley Court, formerly the main manor of the village, and its remaining , by his father, on the condition that he would make a career in banking, rather than become a farmer. L He redeveloped it in 1898. The family fortune had been made by his grandfather, James Cunliffe, with his development of the North Eastern Railway (UK). He had the new house built in 1898 by Edward Prioleau Warren. He employed Lawrence Turner for the ceilings and plasterwork.Headley Court - Cunliffe married Mary Agnes (died 1893) in 1890, younger daughter of Robert Henderson, and then Edith Cunningham, fifth daughter of Colonel Robert Tod Boothby, in 1896. They together had three sons and three daughters. His son, Hon. Geoffrey Cunliffe, married actress Barbara Waring. He died at his home, Headley Court, in January 1920 after he had suffered from septicaemia. His son Rolf succeeded to his title.

Metal Saga is the fifth game in the Metal Max series counting remakes and the third game not counting remakes, the first one to reach the United States. Like previous games in the series, it follows an open, non-linear style of gameplay. The game received a mixed reception for its unconventional gameplay and dated graphics. Gameplay The game mechanics are similar to that of most role- playing video games. Players travel between points of interest on an overworld map, during which point in time they can be attacked by randomly encountered foes. Within towns, players can rest, repair vehicles, sell items, and other typical activities. The \\"dungeons\\" in the title are usually caves or abandoned buildings. Such hostile locations are relatively small, with much of their complexity being due to their maze-like nature (and the lack of an auto- mapping feature). Combat is individually turn-based, utilizing a staggered initiative system (e.g., characters on foot are faster than those in tanks). Any canine member of the party acts on his or her own, automatically attacking foes at random. For the remaining characters, players choose among a limited number of actions. While characters do have some skills which can be used during combat, these cost money to use (rather than using a separate mana/skill point pool) and often cannot be used when within a tank. As a result, skills are not necessarily as attractive as in other such games. Although certain weapons are clearly intended to be used against certain foes, characters cannot change arms or armor during combat. =Tanks= All of the characters, with the exception of the dogs, can be placed within tanks to further improve their combat performance. While fighting from within a tank, characters use the on-board weapons instead of their hand weapons, and suffer damage to the tank, rather than to their person. This provides an additional layer of defense, in that characters can exit the tank and continue to fight if the tank becomes inoperable. When not in combat, one additional tank can be towed and used to store spare parts or used as a spare vehicle. There are a total of 15 tanks in the game. While the game uses the term \\"tank\\" to refer to all such vehicles, several of them are not actually tanks. These include a fire truck (complete with ladder) and a bus. Nonetheless, most of the tanks are more traditional, such as a German Panzer, or two anti-aircraft tanks. While the different tank models are generally similar in practice, they each have slightly different innate characteristics. The tanks can not only be equipped, but also customized on a very sophisticated level. Players select and purchase primary guns, (Referred as MAIN‚Äîlimited in ammunition) secondary guns, (Referred as SUB or Sub Gun‚Äîunlimited ammunition) and special-purpose weaponry (Referred as SE or Special Equipment‚Äîvery limited in ammunition). Each item includes a weight value, with the tank's engine only able to drive a certain total amount of weight. As such, a balance must be struck, since every unit of weight not used for weaponry can be used to add additional armor tiles. Furthermore, money can be spent to modify each part of the tank, e.g., to increase the amount of ammunition which a given weapon carries (again at the cost of a further weight increase). Vehicle parts are categorized into several different categories; *Chassis: The vehicle chassis. This is the outer casing that holds everything together. Different chassis offer different levels of protection and speed. (FAVs will offer less protection but the highest speed, whereas main battle tanks will offer the highest degree of defense at a lower mobility.) *Engine: The engine determines the maximum loadout for the vehicle. The lower the rating, the less tonnage that the engine can handle. Engines do not affect the mobility of the vehicle. *C Unit: The computer unit enables vehicles to be handled by a single crew member. Without it, the vehicle cannot function, as it combines various aspects of vehicle controls, such as weapons systems, so that a single crew can operate the vehicle. It is mentioned by one of the NPCs in the game that a vehicle can be operated without a C Unit although that would require three people to operate the vehicle. C Units also provide additional defenses for the vehicle, which is combined with the defensive rating of the chassis to form the total amount of defense rating of the vehicle. *Accessories: Accessories are optional components for vehicles that are not required for the vehicles to operate. They range from Teleporters, which allow the players to travel between towns and get them out of hostile area (such as tunnels and dungeons crawling with enemies) to decorative decals to special add-ons which, when combined with special ability of the player, can damage the enemy. (For example, dozer blades.) *Weapons: Although vehicles can function without any weapons mounted, the vehicles will not be able to attack the enemy effectively, if at all. Many of the weapons have distinct capabilities. For example, anti-tank main guns offer the most balanced attributes in terms of firepower, range and accuracy, while anti-aircraft main guns allow for very accurate and reliable engagement of low-altitude airborne opponents. Others include MLRS mounts that can reach out and hit enemies that are out of range for other weapons, CIWS for devastating counter against enemies that are flying at high-altitude, huge rockets that can damage enemies even through the toughest defenses, beam weapons for hitting cloaked enemies, and other various weapons that allow for the vehicles to become tremendous force-multipliers to the player. *Armor tiles: Armor tiles are the first line of protective layer for the vehicle. Armor tiles will absorb a limited amount of damage before being worn out and prevent other internal components mentioned above from being damaged by enemy attacks. Although effective against most attacks, it will not protect the components against specialized attacks that are designed to either bypass or penetrate the armor, such as enemy armor-piercing warheads or intense freezing temperature. Armor tiles can be replenished on the field by using armor tile kits, or in repair shops. Some vehicles can mount special designated weapons while others cannot; for example, Flakpanzers Wirbelwind and Gepard can mount anti-aircraft main guns, but cannot mount anti-tank main guns, while main battle tanks and other AFVs can mount anti-tank main guns while being unable to mount anti-air main guns. Tanks can also be equipped with teleportation devices, which allow the entire party to instantly exit an indoor area or travel to a previously visited town. The list of the vehicles that can be \\"owned\\" by the player is as follows; #Buggy (Dune buggy) #Demag (Sd.Kfz. 250) #Mosquito (Wiesel 1) #Gepard (Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard) #Wild Bus (armored passenger bus) #Panzer (Sturmgesch√ºtz IV) #Barbarossa (Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. H) #Tiger (Panzerkampfwagen V Ausf. E Tiger I) #Wirbelwind (Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer IV Wirbelwind) #Rodina (T-34/76) #Abrams (M1 Abrams) #Leopold (Leopard 2A5/6) #Type Zero (Type 90) #Lulubel (M3 Lee) #Rommel (Jagdpanther) #Fire Truck (Fire Truck) #S Tank (Stridsvagn 103) #Merkava (Merkava Mk. IV) #Maus (Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus) Furthermore, there are other vehicles of same designs but fixed specifications that can be \\"rented\\" from various rental shops inside the towns. A miscellaneous vehicle includes the Cargo Ship which lets players roam across the huge lake in middle of the map. Plot =Setting= The title takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, though presenting a less serious take on the genre, compared to the harsher representations seen in role-playing games such as Final Fantasy VI or Fallout, or movies such as Mad Max or Nausicaa. The environment of Metal Saga seems to be relatively unscathed, with a generally healthy ecosystem and no apparent areas of radioactive contamination, perhaps since the apocalypse (referred to as the Great Destruction) happened in the first place in an attempt to destroy humanity to actually save the planet. Rather than focusing extensively on mutants and ruffians, many of the enemies encountered are merely machines gone haywire. As a result, scavenging such machines and using scavenged parts to build equipment appear to be common activities. Additionally, the game includes a good dose of militaristic qualities, with most of the game's battles being fought from within tanks, or other tank-like armored vehicles. In essence, the game has very little storyline and mostly non-linear gameplay. Like its predecessors, one may choose to take on whichever informal quests one wants, or none at all, but cannot choose to slaughter the entire population of a town on a whim. The title features more than half a dozen possible endings, several of which can be obtained less than an hour into the game. One ending can even be obtained minutes into the game, making it the shortest possible RPG.Metal Saga - Impression , RPGamer, Spring 2006 =Characters= Players can organize a team of up to four characters: the main hero (the \\"Hunter\\"), a Mechanic, a Soldier and a mechanized dog. Players are free to choose their own party from the available characters and to switch between them during the game. There are two mechanics in the game, three fighters (one of these is hidden, and can only join during the later parts of the game) and four dogs. Most of the characters in the game have some unique dialogue and further story development during certain side quests. During the game, players frequently have the option to purchase home furnishings and gifts which can be sent to both playable and non-playable (female) characters. These generally have no effect on gameplay. Here is the list of the playable characters; *Syu (His name is not mentioned in the English version): The Hunter of the group, and also the main character. *Misha (called Mika in the Japanese version): One of the Mechanics in the game. Can repair vehicles. She is Kiriya's little sister, although not blood-related. *Kiriya: The second Mechanic in the game. Can repair vehicles. He is Misha/Mika's big brother, although not blood-related. Kiriya's real father is the Disassembler, one of the bounties you fight during the game. If you defeat him with Kiriya in your party, a chain of events will occur, with Kiriya finding a picture of him as a young boy with the Disassembler, Kiriya leaving the party and going back to his home, and rejoining your party upon visiting him in his room. *Charlene (called Shirley in the Japanese version): One of the Soldiers in the game. Specializes in firearms and can wield guns that other characters cannot use. *Rashid: The second Soldier in the game. Specializes in melee weapons and can wield swords and other cutting weapons that other characters cannot use. *Alpha: The third and hidden Soldier in the game. She is a cyborg. Cannot wield any weapons, but can use its internal weapons system to devastate almost any opponents encountered. If she dies in battle a certain number of times, she can be brought to Dr. Palm to be manufactured into a very powerful tank part. Furthermore, there are four different breeds of dogs, each with their unique combat and non-combat abilities, such as beam weaponry and medical kits. The breeds are Shiba Inu, (nicknamed as Shiba) St. Bernard, (nicknamed as Bernie) Boston Terrier (nicknamed as Terry) and Tosa. Development Since the first game was published in 1991 by Data East, the series was famous for having a \\"high degree of freedom\\". However, in 2003, Data East became bankrupt, and the trademark \\"Metal Max\\" was registered by Shinjuku Express, so this entry of the series had to use a new trademark ‚Äî \\"Metal Saga\\". The series' producer, Hiroshi Miyaoka was not involved in the development from the beginning and said \\"I can't make anymore with Metal Max, I thought it was really dying.\\" The game was published in June 2005 in Japan; and in March 2006, a \\"Best\\" version of the game was published and was cheaper than the original. The game received a Lite/Demo version that was published in North America in April 2006. Reception Although the game's sense of humor, music and solid hours of gameplay won it some positive marks, the overall impression of the title was decidedly mediocre. Reviewers scoffed at the dated graphics, lack of plot, and missing feeling of progression. As a result, a considerable amount of time was often spent by reviewers and gamers alike simply wandering around, trying to figure out what to do next. While the game had all the classic trappings for the genre, complete with its own quirky style, it seemed to lack the polish required to stand-out. GameSpot noted \\"Metal Saga has the makings of a good role-playing game, but there's nothing to tie it all together.\\" In Japan, Metal Saga received a respectable 30 out of 40 from Famitsu magazine. Media Create reported that it was the top selling game in Japan during its week of release at 63,219 copies. By the end of 2005, the Japanese version of the game had sold 99,374 copies in the region.  Sequels  There are four sequels of Metal Saga, none of them released in western world. The first sequel Metal Saga: Season of Steel was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS, it follows the story of the first Metal Max. The second sequel is a cellphone game and released in 2007. The third sequel, Metal Saga New Frontier, was an online browser game released in 2010. The forth sequel is Metal Saga: The Ark of Wastes.

His work that includes drawing, sculpture, performance and installation, often incorporating slide and film projections, lighting effects, computer and electronic technology. He is associated with London Regionalism. Life and work Favro's work deals with the nature of perception, reality and art itself, as well as with the insistent presence of the machine environment. He is an important figure among a significant generation of artists ‚Äì Jack Chambers, Greg Curnoe and Ron Martin among them ‚Äì who became active in that city in the early 1960s and drew national attention as the London Regional School of artists. He is also well known as a founding member of the Nihilist Spasm Band. As a teenager he moved to London where, from 1958 to 1962, he studied at H.B. Beal Technical and Commercial School, after which he enrolled in the specialized art classes offered at Beal (at the time, one of the few training schools for artists in Canada). Early on, he showed an interest in machines of all kinds, an interest that was encouraged by an uncle who was a tinkerer and inventor. Favro began his career painting brightly coloured works on masonite. A Canada Council Arts Bursary in 1970 allowed him to devote himself to quit painting to pursue his other interests ‚Äì guitars, machines, airplanes, and experiments with film images and inventions. That year he developed his first successful \\"projected reconstruction\\", in which images on a slide are projected onto their wooden, white, life-sized counterparts, giving them colour, detail and identity. The formative years of Favro‚Äôs practice in the 1960s were marked by a growing desire to collapse the boundaries between art and life. In contrast to Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory led the American Pop Art movement of the period, Favro resisted the mass-produced image and object. He was determined instead to build, even replicate, his own 'things' from the materials at hand, repurposing the readymade and reasserting the relationship between object and maker. Significant works over the course of his eclectic career include \\"projected paintings\\" such as Country Road (1971‚Äì72), Synthetic Lake (1972‚Äì73) and Van Gogh‚Äôs Room (1973‚Äì74), reconstructions such as Sunlight on Table and Floor (1990) and Hydro Pole (1995‚Äì96), and a series of drawings and mechanically-improvised constructions of flying machines, their parts and hand tools, that include Sabre Jet, 55% Size (1979‚Äì83) and Air Compressor and Turbine (1996‚Äì97). Favro's work has been acquired for numerous public galleries and countless private collections across Canada, and has twice been the focus of comprehensive exhibitions, organized by the Art Gallery of Ontario (1983) and collaboratively by the former London Regional Art and Historical Museums and the McIntosh Gallery (1998). In 1997, he received the Gershon Iskowitz Award for career achievement. He is a 2007 recipient of the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. He is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Favro is represented by the Christopher Cutts Gallery in Toronto.

Characters * Jimutavahana ‚Äì The Hero and Vidhyadhara Prince * Jimutaketu ‚Äì The father of hero * Vidushaka (Atreya) ‚Äì The friend of the hero * Mitravasu ‚Äì Son of Vishvavasu and brother of the heroine * Shankachuda ‚Äì A serpent, intended to be the victim of Garuda * Garuda ‚Äì King of birds and enemy of the serpents * Kanchukin ‚Äì Superintendent of the harem * Malayavati ‚Äì The heroine and daughter of king Vishvavasu * Devi ‚Äì The mother of the hero * Vriddha ‚Äì The mother of Shankhachuda * Gauri ‚Äì The Goddess * Chaturika ‚Äì Maid of Malayavati * Manoharika ‚Äì Maid of Malayavati * Navamalika ‚Äì Maid of Malayavati Synopsis The first act of the play opens in the penance-grove near the temple of Gauri. Jimutavahana with his friend Atreya, the Vidushaka is in search of a suitable place of residence on the Malaya Mountains, southern part of the Western Ghats, as his old parents have expressed a desire to stay there. He would spend his youth in serving the parents, as he considers such a service far above the enjoyment of the pleasures of kingdom. He had done everything in his power to make his subjects happy and had made the kingdom secure. Moving about, both of them are struck by the grandeur of the mountain and decide to stay there. Here, they happen to hear the ravishing tunes of melodious music. They enter the temple of Gauri but hide themselves to find out who was singing. Through her conversation with her maid they learn that she is a maiden and that Gauri revealed herself to her in a dream and conferred a boon that the Emperor of Vidhyadharas, Jimutavahana will marry her. The two friends reveal themselves only to make Malayavati embarrassed. Malayavati leaves the temple with a hermit without knowing Jimutavahana's true identity. The hero and heroine fall in love with each other, though they are yet strangers to each other. Sources The story of Jimutavahana is found in the Kathasaritsagara of Somadeva and Brihatkathamanjari of Kshemendra both written in the 11th century A.D. The story of Nagananda follows closely the shorter narrations in both these books. Both these books are the Sanskrit versions of the Brihatkatha of Gunadhya in Paishachi language, composed about the 1st century A.D. But neither the Kathasaritsagara nor the Brihatkathamanjari, both composed in the 11th century A.D. can be accepted as the source of Nagananda which was composed in the 7th century A.D. Sri Harsha has added his own ideas and has deviated from the main story in Brihathkatha in many places. It must be admitted that the treatment of it at Harsha's hands is quite original and that the play on the whole is a very charming and fascinating one . Performance history The play was produced in January 2008 at Panaji ;Goa ( India ) in Marathi by Prabhakar Sanskritic Sanstha following the conventions propagated in the Natyasastra. Nagananda play was designed by Saish Deshpande, translated & directed by Anagha Deshpande whereas the Natyadharmi Abhinaya was conceived by Dr. Sharmila Rao. The play is now also available in Marathi text. the 2008 production of \\"Nagananda\\" was adjudged as the best experimental theatre production along with best research based production both by Maharashtra state Dept. of Art & Culture as well as Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad. this product by the young theatre artistes from Goa has been documented for archival purpose by All India Radio, Panaji & also by Doordarshan; Goa.

Background Jack Rafuse and Franklyn Cordon were solicitors hired by a company that had purchased the shares of Stonehouse Motel and Restaurant Ltd. The agreement of sale required that the purchasers take out a mortgage on the property and use the assets used as part of the purchase price of the shares. The solicitors had been retained in order to complete the mortgage transaction. Eight years later, the creditor for the mortgage, Central Trust Co., initiated a foreclosure of the mortgage. The creditor, Irving Oil Ltd., tried to prevent the foreclosure by claiming the mortgage was invalid. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada and in the decision of Central and Eastern Trust Co v Irving Oil Ltd,[1980] 2 SCR 29. the mortgage was invalidated. Having lost the case, Central Trust brought an action against the lawyers for negligence and breach of contract. In their defence, Rafuse and Cordon claimed: *that their liability, if any, was in contract only and not in tort; *that they had not been negligent, particularly in view of the conflicting judicial opinion on the question of the validity of the mortgage; *that there was contributory negligence on the part of the Nova Scotia Trust Company or those for whom it was responsible because of the approval of the mortgage loan and the instructions to the respondents by persons of legal training; * that the contract between the Nova Scotia Trust Company and the respondents, having as its object an illegal transaction, was itself illegal and could not therefore be the basis of an action in damages; and * the appellant's action was barred by The Statute of Limitations. The issues before the Court were: # Can a solicitor be liable to a client in tort as well as in contract for negligence in the performance of the professional services for which the solicitor has been retained? # Were the respondent solicitors negligent in carrying out the mortgage transaction for the Nova Scotia Trust Company? # Was there contributory negligence on the part of the Nova Scotia Trust Company or those for whom it was responsible? # Is the appellant prevented from bringing its action because of the illegality of the mortgage? # Is the appellant's action barred by The Statute of Limitations? Reasons of the court LeDain J wrote the reasons for the majority. On the first issue, he held that the duty in tort and in contract are two entirely separate duties and can be held concurrently by a defendant. On the limitations issue, it was held that the plaintiffs were not statute-barred from commencing an action. The commencement of the limitation period was postponed pursuant to the common law \\"discoverability principle\\": \\"A cause of action arises for purposes of a limitation period when the material facts on which it is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\\" References External links * Canadian tort case law Supreme Court of Canada cases 1986 in Canadian case law ","title":"Central Trust Co v Rafuse"},{"id":"4304500","text":"In mathematics, two positive (or signed or complex) measures Œº and ŒΩ defined on a measurable space (Œ©, Œ£) are called singular if there exist two disjoint sets A and B in Œ£ whose union is Œ© such that Œº is zero on all measurable subsets of B while ŒΩ is zero on all measurable subsets of A. This is denoted by mu perp u. A refined form of Lebesgue's decomposition theorem decomposes a singular measure into a singular continuous measure and a discrete measure. See below for examples. Examples on Rn As a particular case, a measure defined on the Euclidean space mathbb{R}^n is called singular, if it is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on this space. For example, the Dirac delta function is a singular measure. Example. A discrete measure. The Heaviside step function on the real line, : H(x)  stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} begin{cases} 0, & x < 0;  1, & x geq 0; end{cases} has the Dirac delta distribution delta_0 as its distributional derivative. This is a measure on the real line, a \\"point mass\\" at 0. However, the Dirac measure delta_0 is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure lambda, nor is lambda absolutely continuous with respect to delta_0: lambda ( { 0 } ) = 0 but delta_0 ( { 0 } ) = 1; if U is any open set not containing 0, then lambda (U) > 0 but delta_0 (U) = 0. Example. A singular continuous measure. The Cantor distribution has a cumulative distribution function that is continuous but not absolutely continuous, and indeed its absolutely continuous part is zero: it is singular continuous. Example. A singular continuous measure on R2. The upper and lower Fr√©chet‚ÄìHoeffding bounds are singular distributions in two dimensions.

He is happily married to Vasavadatta, princess of a neighboring kingdom, and the story of their courtship and wedding is the subject of an earlier work, Svapnavasavadattam, written by BhƒÅsa. Udayana is well-served by Yaugandharayana, an extremely loyal and astute, if rather presumptuous and devious minister. Yaugandharayana now wishes the king to marry Ratnavali, princess of the distant island kingdom of Simhala (presumably Sri Lanka). This is because a sage had prophesied that the man who marries Ratnavali would become a Sarvabhauma (Emperor). Incidentally, Ratnavali's father, king Vikramabahu of Simhala, is Vasavadatta's uncle. He is aware that Udayana and Vasavadatta are unusually close to each other (because they had married for love), and that a second wife would either be unhappy herself or make his niece Vasavadatta unhappy. He is therefore initially reluctant to accept the proposal of marriage which the minister makes to him. While the envoys from Kaushambi are still in Simhala with the proposal, the news reaches them that Queen Vasavadatta is dead, having perished in a fire which engulfed a hunting camp at Lavanaka. This news is in fact a falsehood initiated by the devious minister in order to facilitate the second marriage. King Vikramabahu is however taken in by the ploy, and agrees to give his daughter in marriage to Udayana. The necessary preparations are made, and Princess Ratnavali embarks on a ship to make the voyage to Kaushambi and her new life as queen of that kingdom. Unfortunately, a storm crosses their path and the ship gets wrecked. Ratnavali alone is rescued by a passing merchant ship, and reaches the mainland safely. She however does not reveal her identity as princess of Simhala to the people who rescue her, because she is fearful of being held for political ransom, that her father or fianc√©e will be made to give up territories to secure her release. She therefore pretends to be suffering from amnesia. The merchants who rescue her are impressed by her rich garments, her refined speech and cultivated manners. They infer from all this that she is a lady of noble birth. Therefore, when they reach their native land (which is Kaushambi, by a coincidence), they place the nameless maiden in the custody of minister Yaugandharayana. By this time, news of the shipwreck and the loss of Princess Ratnavali has reached Kaushambi. The minister immediately recognizes that the girl rescued from the sea and suffering from amnesia is almost certainly the princess. He also sees the situation as an opportunity to reconcile Vasavadatta to the idea of receiving a co-wife. He gives the rescued girl a new name, \\"Sagarika,\\" (\\"Ocean-lady\\"), takes her to the queen and asks her to keep the homeless waif as a maid. The queen agrees, and \\"Sagarika\\" becomes Vasavadatta's maid. Once, in the cupid festival, Sagarika sees Udayana and instantly falls in love with him. Sagarika sits in a grove and keeps herself occupied in drawing Udayana's picture and fantasizing about him. Her shrewd friend Susangatha finds her, takes the picture into her hands and draws the picture of Sagarika by the side of the king. Sagarika confesses her love to Susangatha and a bird Sarika hears the conversation. Suddenly, there is a panic in the grove because of an escaped monkey and the maidens run away from there. After a while, the Udayana and his jester enter the grove and hear the bird Sarika reproduce the ladies' conversation. They find the picture Sagarika and Susangatha have drawn, and Udayana finds it alluring. By this time, the two maidens return and overhear the conversation of the king and his jester, and see that Udayana is interested in Sagarika. Susangatha then makes a plan to bring Udayana and Sagarika together, but Vasavadatta (Udayana's first wife) also finds the picture when walking in the grove. Susangatha's plan is destroyed by the angry Vasavadatta and she leaves the grove without accepting Udayana's words of appeasement. In the third act, the jester and Susangata hatch a plan to make Udayana and Sagarika meet. Sagarika disguises herself as Vasavadatta, and Susangata as her maid. They go to meet Udayana, who has been told of the plan and is expecting Sagarika to come in Vasavadatta's disguise. But the real Vasavadatta comes to know of this plan and also sets off to meet Udayana. Vasavadatta reaches him first, but Udayana mistakes her for Sagarika and declares that he loves her. Vasavadatta is very angry at Udayana for the second time, and reproaches him and walks away. Sagarika comes to know that their plan is foiled again, and ties a noose to her neck wanting to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Udayana is frantically searching for the real Vasavadatta, and finds Sagarika about to die. He mistakes her for the real Vasavadatta, and saves her. Afterwards, the two recognize each other and finally they have a chance to declare their love. But at exactly the same moment, Vasavadatta, having calmed down, comes back to Udayana ready for appeasement. She is outraged for the third time on seeing Sagarika and Udayana together, and throws Sagarika into prison. In the fourth act, no one knows where Sagarika is imprisoned by Vasavadatta. Suddenly, there is heard a news of the royal harem catching fire. It turns out that Sagarika is kept there, and Vasavadatta turns remorseful. She implores Udayana to run to her rescue. Udayana comes out safely from the fire with Sagarika. It is later revealed that the entire fire was a trick by a magician. At this tense moment, Babhravya and Vasubhuti recognize Sagarika to be the Simhala princess. Yaugandharayana enters and reveals himself to be the plotter. Vasavadatta now gladly brings about the marriage of Udayana and Ratnavali, her cousin, relying on the prophecy.

The Udayana legend is found in both Jaina and Bauddha literature besides the Kathasaritsagara, Brihatkathamanjari and Brihatkathalokasangraha. The Jaina legends are not earlier than the 12th century, while the Bauddha ones are of about 4th century. Many distinguished poets of ancient India, who flourished before Harsha, have referred to the love of Udayana and Vasavadatta, and the devotion of Yougandharayana for his master Udayana. This shows how popular the story of Udayana was even in Ancient India. Kalidasa has referred to Udayana in his Meghaduta. ≈öudraka refers in his Mricchakatika to the devotion of minister Yaugandharayana to Udayana. BhƒÅsa has dramatized the story in his two plays Pratignayougandharayanam and SwapnavƒÅsadattam. In conclusion, it can be said that it is not unlikely that Harsha took the frame-work of the Udayana story from either the Bauddha literature or some early version of the Brihatkatha and dramatized it in his own way. Although the story is not entirely invented, it must be admitted that the treatment of it at Harsha's hands is quite original and that the play on the whole is a very charming one.

It was directed by Isadore 'Friz' Freleng and written by Tedd Pierce. Hawley Pratt and Paul Julian did the layout and backgrounds, while Arthur Davis, Ken Champin, Virgil Ross and Gerry Chiniquy headed the team of animators. Mel Blanc provided voice characterizations, and Carl Stalling created the musical score.  Plot  The story opens with a title card indicating a time setting of 1776, before switching to footages of the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Siege of Yorktown. The scene then transitions to the Battle of Bagle Heights, where Bugs, dressed as an American Minuteman, is defending a wooden fort against the red-coated Sam von Schamm (or Schmamm), the Hessian, attacking from a large stone fortress. Sam's fortress is heavily armored, bristling with artillery; by contrast, Bugs' defenses are rather pathetic, with only one cannon. Even then, Sam is the only one manning his fort, which makes capturing Bugs' difficult, considering the rabbit is able to retaliate by capturing his simultaneously. Sam attempts to continue his bombardment, but Bugs is able to put up a defence by simply catching his enemy's cannonballs with his own cannon and firing them back. When Bugs tires of that contest, he fires a large cork to plug Sam's main mortar. Sam is shot in the face while trying to remove the cork. Frustrated, Sam burrows his way under his base and into Bugs' base using a pickaxe. Upon surfacing, Sam lights a match, only to find himself in a room full of TNT. An explosion occurs in a shack where the room is, with Sam stumbling out, dazed. As the last gambit, Sam uses a keg of gunpowder in an attempt to blow up Bug's base; unbeknownst to Sam, gunpowder falls into Sam's back pocket due to a hole in the keg, creating a trail of gunpowder. After Sam lights the fuse, Bugs, sitting on the powder keg and munching a carrot, calmly extinguishes it and nonchalantly lights the trail of gunpowder left by Sam. Fleeing from the inevitable trail, Sam runs away from the base and up an apple tree, which eventually explodes on him. At this setback, a thoroughly defeated Sam admits that he is a \\"Hessian without no aggression,\\" and decides to defect to the rebels by saying, \\"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\\" To this, Bugs and Sam march side by side in a fife- and-drum march reminiscent of the Archibald Willard painting The Spirit of '76, playing the song The Girl I Left Behind Me.

Retrieved 2010-03-23. The brothers were sons of businessman and politician Hunter Vogel. Shelly Siegel was the label's Vice-president and creative director. Producer Mike Flicker also worked with the company. Mushroom released approximately 15 LP titles and 50 singles between 1974 and 1980. History The Mushroom label initially released recordings in Canada through distribution arrangements with five independent distributors. In 1976 Jay Gold was named General Manager of Mushroom Records in Canada and he negotiated a national distribution agreement with A&M; Records Canada. Ian Warner was Vice- President of International Affairs and Publishing. The company was also incorporated in the United States and maintained a second office on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Mushroom was distributed in the U.S. through a network of independent distributors, which included Fourth Street East in Chatsworth, California. Some Mushroom recordings were also released abroad through Arista Records, EMI Records and Festival Records. Mushroom released several successful albums from artists such as Doucette, Heart, and Chilliwack. Mushroom also had a short lived subsidiary, Chanterelle Records, which released records by Disco musician Jim Grady.https://www.discogs.com/label/25970-Chanterelle Flicker left Mushroom during Heart's dispute with Siegel over Heart's second album. Siegel moved to the L.A. office, but suddenly died due to an aneurysm on 17 January 1979. In late 1980 Mushroom Records went out of business. The same year Gold left Mushroom to co-found Flicker Records with Mike Flicker. Heart's two Mushroom albums were purchased and re-issued by Capitol Records when the band moved to that label in 1985. In late 2013 Linus Entertainment released several Mushroom recordings on CD for the first time including albums by Chilliwack and Doucette. Mushroom Studios In 1946, Aragon Recording Studios was opened in Vancouver. By 1954, Al Reusch had acquired sole ownership. Mushroom Studios was built by Aragon in 1966, and under a sponsorship deal, the new facility was initially named Can-Base Studios. \\"Within five years\\", Reusch sold it to Jack Herschorn, who appointed Mike Flicker as Chief Engineer, Howard Leese as program manager and Charlie Richmond as Head Technical Advisor. During the early 1970s when the Mushroom record label began, and also when Can-Base went bust, the studios and Mushroom Records came to an arrangement, and it was renamed Mushroom Studios. Many of Mushroom Records' albums were recorded there. In the mid 1970s the Mushroom Studios was in the control of producer Mike Flicker and musician Howard Leese, who also became known for their work with Heart. Mushroom Records went bust in 1980, but Mushroom Studios continued on. In January 2006, the studios was purchased by Hipposonic Studios and renamed Hippowest Music Ltd. In 2011, the studio was moved 3,000 miles cross country, and relocated inside the Play-Dead Mansion on Queen Street West in Toronto, where it once again took its current name of Mushroom Studios.

He served as deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 1993 to 1994, under John Hewson. In the Howard Government he held ministerial office as Minister for Health and Family Services (1996‚Äì1998) and Health and Aged Care (1998‚Äì2001). He represented the Liberals in the House of Representatives as the member for Chisholm (1987‚Äì1998) and Casey (1998‚Äì2001). Early years Wooldridge attended Scotch College, Melbourne before attending Monash University's medical school, from where he graduated in 1981. Federal political career During his time in Opposition he was Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and therefore the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from March 1993 to May 1994. In May 1994, Liberal Leader John Hewson called a spill for both the leader's and deputy's positions. Hewson lost to Alexander Downer while Wooldridge withdrew at the last minute as it became clear he did not have the numbers to beat Downer's running mate Peter Costello. Wooldridge's demise as deputy leader came as a result of an opinion poll that showed only 4% of voters preferred him as Liberal leader despite Wooldridge himself stating he had no desire to become leader. In response to this poll, Wooldridge argued on The 7.30 Report that 4% was a good result for a deputy leader as the deputy leader was not meant to be an alternative leader. Ironically, the man who would replace Wooldridge as deputy leader, Peter Costello, not only did not succeed in his ambitions to become leader but also became the party's longest-serving deputy leader. As well as expressing no desire to become leader, Wooldridge as deputy leader did not request to become Shadow Treasurer, making him one of a few and to date, the last deputy Liberal leader who never held the Treasury portfolio either in government or in opposition. Wooldridge's reason for not taking up Treasury was his belief that his strength was in social policy area and that Treasury would take him \\"a year to get up to speed.\\" https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127203961?searchTerm=Michael%20Wooldridge%20Treasury In 1996, the Liberal and National Parties were elected to Government and Wooldridge served as Minister for Health and Family Services from 1996 to 1998 and Minister for Health and Aged Care from 1998 up to his retirement in 2001. During his last term, he transferred from his marginal seat of Chisholm to the somewhat friendlier seat of Casey. During this time he instituted significant and widespread changes to general practice. By setting up and responding to the report: \\"General Practice, Responding to the Future With Partnerships\\",General Practice, Changing the Future Through Partnerships: Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1998 he commenced a reform process that cemented the divisions of general practice as change agents, took responsibility for training GPs away from the RACGP and into the hands of an independent body (General Practice Education and Training), and instituted the Practice Incentives Program. He was forced to make a public apology to the President of the Australian Medical Association at the time, Kerryn Phelps in 2001 for publicly claiming she had no medical qualifications. During Woolridge's term as Health Minister, he was criticised for having close links with multinational drug company, Pfizer that impacted the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). Wooldridge was also criticised for appointing Pat Clear, a former executive of Glaxo-Wellcome Australia who had recently retired as head of Medicines Australia (then known as the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association) to the committee of the PBAC, prompting the immediate resignation of the Chair of the committee, Don Bikkett, and leading to the refusal of five of the other committee members to be reappointed. Career after politics In 2002, Wooldridge's contract with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was terminated due to allegations from the Australian Medical Association and the Federal Opposition that his involvement in the allocation of the $5,000,000 represented a conflict of interest; in 2003 the parties settled and Wooldridge received a $382,500 payout. In 2006, Wooldrige was appointed 'Lead Independent Director' of the ASX listed Australian Pharmaceuticals Industry Limited. In September 2009, Wooldrige was invited to join a panel hosted by CSL Limited \\"a major manufacturer [of flu vaccine] in a US$2 billion influenza industry\\" hosted by the company to dispel myths about swine flu vaccination Wooldridge has served or is currently serving on the Boards of Resonance Health Ltd, Dia-b Tech Limited (resigned in 2009, company since de-listed) and a Director of CogState Ltd. He is currently Chairman of Neurosciences Australia, Healthsource Australia (Ministerial Advisory Committee on AIDS, Sexual Health and Hepatitis), the CRC for Mental Health and the Oral Health Cooperative Research Centre. He is also Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne. In December 2013, Wooldridge and four other directors of Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd (APCHL) were found liable by the Federal Court for breaching their duties as officers of APCHL. APCHL was the responsible entity of the Prime Retirement and Aged Care Property Trust (Prime Trust), a managed investment scheme which owned retirement villages in Queensland, NSW and Victoria.

There are five Internet service providers, who operate through the intermediation of the SOTELMA (soci√©t√© des t√©l√©communications du Mali). The Internet infrastructure remains costly and difficult to maintain. The dominant private telecommunications company is Ikatel (called Orange). Its services include Live Box and 3g plus. Since the beginning of 2011, rival company Malit√©l was launched to be price competitive. Bamako hosted an international conference \\"Bamako 2000 : les passerelles du d√©veloppement\\" on information technology, during which the former president of the republic of Mali, Alpha Oumar Konar√©, promoted Internet access to all communities in Mali. Mali also presided over preparations for the Sommet de la Soci√©t√© de l'Information. A number of cybercaf√©s, and telecommunications centres (public, community or privately owned) have emerged since 1997 in the capitol Bamako. Many have had to close their doors due to difficulties in management and high fixed costs for network connections. Today, those that are surviving are those that support or develop a certain critical mass (access to a large number of computers, a regular customer base) and that offer complementary activities like training or equipment sales. Many students have at least an email address and can benefit from access to relatively accessible prices for Internet research. Many businesses have access to the Internet through telephone. The costs of permanent connections to the radio broadcasting network remain high, but have tended to progressively diminish (100,000 Fcfa per month for an organisation, 30,000 Fcfa per month for an individual). Internet is reaching a progressively larger territory. Regional capitols all have Internet access, as well as a number of mid-sized towns along principal roads.

The LDG is one of the most widely recognized patterns in ecology. The LDG has been observed to varying degrees in Earth's past. A parallel trend has been found with elevation (elevational diversity gradient), though this is less well-studied Explaining the latitudinal diversity gradient has been called one of the great contemporary challenges of biogeography and macroecology (Willig et al. 2003, Pimm and Brown 2004, Cardillo et al. 2005). The question \\"What determines patterns of species diversity?\\" was among the 25 key research themes for the future identified in 125th Anniversary issue of Science (July 2005). There is a lack of consensus among ecologists about the mechanisms underlying the pattern, and many hypotheses have been proposed and debated. A recent review noted that among the many conundrums associated with the LDG (or LBG, Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient) the causal relationship between rates of molecular evolution and speciation has yet to be demonstrated. Understanding the global distribution of biodiversity is one of the most significant objectives for ecologists and biogeographers. Beyond purely scientific goals and satisfying curiosity, this understanding is essential for applied issues of major concern to humankind, such as the spread of invasive species, the control of diseases and their vectors, and the likely effects of global climate change on the maintenance of biodiversity (Gaston 2000). Tropical areas play prominent roles in the understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, as their rates of habitat degradation and biodiversity loss are exceptionally high. Patterns in the past The LDG is a noticeable pattern among modern organisms that has been described qualitatively and quantitatively. It has been studied at various taxonomic levels, through different time periods and across many geographic regions (Crame 2001). The LDG has been observed to varying degrees in Earth's past, possibly due to differences in climate during various phases of Earth's history. Some studies indicate that the LDG was strong, particularly among marine taxa, while other studies of terrestrial taxa indicate the LDG had little effect on the distribution of animals. Hypotheses for pattern Although many of the hypotheses exploring the latitudinal diversity gradient are closely related and interdependent, most of the major hypotheses can be split into three general hypotheses. =Spatial/Area hypotheses= There are five major hypotheses that depend solely on the spatial and areal characteristics of the tropics. Mid-domain effect Using computer simulations, Cowell and Hurt (1994) and Willing and Lyons (1998) first pointed out that if species‚Äô latitudinal ranges were randomly shuffled within the geometric constraints of a bounded biogeographical domain (e.g. the continents of the New World, for terrestrial species), species' ranges would tend to overlap more toward the center of the domain than towards its limits, forcing a mid-domain peak in species richness. Colwell and Lees (2000) called this stochastic phenomenon the mid-domain effect (MDE), presented several alternative analytical formulations for one-dimensional MDE (expanded by Connolly 2005), and suggested the hypothesis that MDE might contribute to the latitudinal gradient in species richness, together with other explanatory factors considered here, including climatic and historical ones. Because \\"pure\\" mid-domain models attempt to exclude any direct environmental or evolutionary influences on species richness, they have been claimed to be null models (Cowell et al. 2004, 2005). On this view, if latitudinal gradients of species richness were determined solely by MDE, observed richness patterns at the biogeographic level would not be distinguishable from patterns produced by random placement of observed ranges called dinosures(Colwell and Lees 2000). Others object that MDE models so far fail to exclude the role of the environment at the population level and in setting domain boundaries, and therefore cannot be considered null models (Hawkins and Diniz-Filho 2002; Hawkins et al. 2005; Zapata et al. 2003, 2005). Mid-domain effects have proven controversial (e.g. Jetz and Rahbek 2001, Koleff and Gaston 2001, Lees and Colwell, 2007, Romdal et al. 2005, Rahbek et al. 2007, Storch et al. 2006; Bokma and Monkkonen 2001, Diniz-Filho et al. 2002, Hawkins and Diniz-Filho 2002, Kerr et al. 2006, Currie and Kerr, 2007). While some studies have found evidence of a potential role for MDE in latitudinal gradients of species richness, particularly for wide-ranging species (e.g. Jetz and Rahbek 2001, Koleff and Gaston 2001, Lees and Colwell, 2007, Romdal et al. 2005, Rahbek et al. 2007, Storch et al. 2006; Dunn et al. 2007) others report little correspondence between predicted and observed latitudinal diversity patterns (Bokma and Monkkonen 2001, Currie and Kerr, 2007, Diniz-Filho et al. 2002, Hawkins and Diniz-Filho 2002, Kerr et al. 2006). Geographical area hypothesis Another spatial hypothesis is the geographical area hypothesis (Terborgh 1973). It asserts that the tropics are the largest biome and that large tropical areas can support more species. More area in the tropics allows species to have larger ranges and consequently larger population sizes. Thus, species with larger ranges are likely to have lower extinction rates (Rosenzweig 2003). Additionally, species with larger ranges may be more likely to undergo allopatric speciation, which would increase rates of speciation (Rosenzweig 2003). The combination of lower extinction rates and high rates of speciation leads to the high levels of species richness in the tropics. A critique of the geographical area hypothesis is that even if the tropics is the most extensive of the biomes, successive biomes north of the tropics all have about the same area. Thus, if the geographical area hypothesis is correct these regions should all have approximately the same species richness, which is not true, as is referenced by the fact that polar regions contain fewer species than temperate regions (Gaston and Blackburn 2000). To explain this, Rosenzweig (1992) suggested that if species with partly tropical distributions were excluded, the richness gradient north of the tropics should disappear. Blackburn and Gaston 1997 tested the effect of removing tropical species on latitudinal patterns in avian species richness in the New World and found there is indeed a relationship between the land area and the species richness of a biome once predominantly tropical species are excluded. Perhaps a more serious flaw in this hypothesis is some biogeographers suggest that the terrestrial tropics are not, in fact, the largest biome, and thus this hypothesis is not a valid explanation for the latitudinal species diversity gradient (Rohde 1997, Hawkins and Porter 2001). In any event, it would be difficult to defend the tropics as a \\"biome\\" rather than the geographically diverse and disjunct regions that they truly include. The effect of area on biodiversity patterns has been shown to be scale-dependent, having the strongest effect among species with small geographical ranges compared to those species with large ranges who are affected more so by other factors such as the mid-domain and/or temperature. Species-energy hypothesis The species energy hypothesis suggests the amount of available energy sets limits to the richness of the system. Thus, increased solar energy (with an abundance of water) at low latitudes causes increased net primary productivity (or photosynthesis). This hypothesis proposes the higher the net primary productivity the more individuals can be supported, and the more species there will be in an area. Put another way, this hypothesis suggests that extinction rates are reduced towards the equator as a result of the higher populations sustainable by the greater amount of available energy in the tropics. Lower extinction rates lead to more species in the tropics. One critique of this hypothesis has been that increased species richness over broad spatial scales is not necessarily linked to an increased number of individuals, which in turn is not necessarily related to increased productivity. Additionally, the observed changes in the number of individuals in an area with latitude or productivity are either too small (or in the wrong direction) to account for the observed changes in species richness. The potential mechanisms underlying the species-energy hypothesis, their unique predictions and empirical support have been assessed in a major review by Currie et al. (2004). The effect of energy has been supported by several studies in terrestrial and marine taxa Climate harshness hypothesis Another climate-related hypothesis is the climate harshness hypothesis, which states the latitudinal diversity gradient may exist simply because fewer species can physiologically tolerate conditions at higher latitudes than at low latitudes because higher latitudes are often colder and drier than tropical latitudes. Currie et al. (2004) found fault with this hypothesis by stating that, although it is clear that climatic tolerance can limit species distributions, it appears that species are often absent from areas whose climate they can tolerate. Climate stability hypothesis Similarly to the climate harshness hypothesis, climate stability is suggested to be the reason for the latitudinal diversity gradient. The mechanism for this hypothesis is that while a fluctuating environment may increase the extinction rate or preclude specialization, a constant environment can allow species to specialize on predictable resources, allowing them to have narrower niches and facilitating speciation. The fact that temperate regions are more variable both seasonally and over geological timescales (discussed in more detail below) suggests that temperate regions are thus expected to have less species diversity than the tropics. Critiques for this hypothesis include the fact that there are many exceptions to the assumption that climate stability means higher species diversity. For example, low species diversity is known to occur often in stable environments such as tropical mountaintops. Additionally, many habitats with high species diversity do experience seasonal climates, including many tropical regions that have highly seasonal rainfall (Brown and Lomolino 1998). =Historical/Evolutionary hypotheses= There are three main hypotheses that are related to historical and evolutionary explanations for the increase of species diversity towards the equator. The historical perturbation hypothesis The historical perturbation hypothesis proposes the low species richness of higher latitudes is a consequence of an insufficient time period available for species to colonize or recolonize areas because of historical perturbations such as glaciation (Brown and Lomolino 1998, Gaston and Blackburn 2000). This hypothesis suggests that diversity in the temperate regions has not yet reached equilibrium and that the number of species in temperate areas will continue to increase until saturated (Clarke and Crame 2003). The evolutionary rate hypothesis The evolutionary rate hypothesis argues higher evolutionary rates in the tropics have caused higher speciation rates and thus increased diversity at low latitudes (Cardillo et al. 2005, Weir & Schluter 2007, Rolland et al. 2014). Higher evolutionary rates in the tropics have been attributed to higher ambient temperatures, higher mutation rates, shorter generation time and/or faster physiological processes (Rohde 1992, Allen et al. 2006), and increased selection pressure from other species that are themselves evolving. Faster rates of microevolution in warm climates (i.e. low latitudes and altitudes) have been shown for plants (Wright et al. 2006), mammals (Gillman et al. 2009) and amphibians (Wright et al. 2010). Based on the expectation that faster rates of microevolution result in faster rates of speciation, these results suggest that faster evolutionary rates in warm climates almost certainly have a strong influence on the latitudinal diversity gradient. More research needs to be done to determine whether or not speciation rates actually are higher in the tropics. Understanding whether extinction rate varies with latitude will also be important to whether or not this hypothesis is supported (Rolland et al. 2014). The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time assumes that diversity is determined by the evolutionary time under which ecosystems have existed under relatively unchanged conditions, and by evolutionary speed directly determined by effects of environmental energy (temperature) on mutation rates, generation times, and speed of selection (Rohde 1992). It differs from most other hypotheses in not postulating an upper limit to species richness set by various abiotic and biotic factors, i.e., it is a nonequilibrium hypothesis assuming a largely non-saturated niche space. It does accept that many other factors may play a role in causing latitudinal gradients in species richness as well. The hypothesis is supported by much recent evidence, in particular, the studies of Allen et al. (2006) and Wright et al. (2006). =Biotic hypotheses= Biotic hypotheses claim ecological species interactions such as competition, predation, mutualism, and parasitism are stronger in the tropics and these interactions promote species coexistence and specialization of species, leading to greater speciation in the tropics. These hypotheses are problematic because they cannot be the ultimate cause of the latitudinal diversity gradient as they fail to explain why species interactions might be stronger in the tropics. An example of one such hypothesis is the greater intensity of predation and more specialized predators in the tropics has contributed to the increase of diversity in the tropics (Pianka 1966). This intense predation could reduce the importance of competition (see competitive exclusion) and permit greater niche overlap and promote higher richness of prey. While recent large-scale experiments suggest predation may be more intense in the tropics, this cannot be the ultimate cause of high tropical diversity because it fails to explain what gives rise to the richness of the predators in the tropics. Several recent studies have failed to observe consistent changes in ecological interactions with latitude (Lambers et al. 2002). These studies suggest the intensity of species interactions is not correlated with the change in species richness with latitude. Synthesis and conclusions There are many other hypotheses related to the latitudinal diversity gradient, but the above hypotheses are a good overview of the major ones still cited today. It is important to note that many of these hypotheses are similar to and dependent on one another. For example, the evolutionary hypotheses are closely dependent on the historical climate characteristics of the tropics. =The generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient= An extensive meta-analysis of nearly 600 latitudinal gradients from published literature tested the generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient across different organismal, habitat and regional characteristics. The results showed that the latitudinal gradient occurs in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems, in both hemispheres. The gradient is steeper and more pronounced in richer taxa (i.e. taxa with more species), larger organisms, in marine and terrestrial versus freshwater ecosystems, and at regional versus local scales. The gradient steepness (the amount of change in species richness with latitude) is not influenced by dispersal, animal physiology (homeothermic or ectothermic) trophic level, hemisphere, or the latitudinal range of study. The study could not directly falsify or support any of the above hypotheses, however, results do suggest a combination of energy/climate and area processes likely contribute to the latitudinal species gradient. Notable exceptions to the trend include the ichneumonidae, shorebirds, penguins, and freshwater zooplankton. =Data robustness= One of the main assumptions about LDGs and patterns in species richness is that the underlying data (i.e. the lists of species at specific locations) are complete. However, this assumption is not met in most cases. For instance, diversity patterns for blood parasites of birds suggest higher diversity in tropical regions, however, the data may be skewed by undersampling in rich faunal areas such as Southeast Asia and South America. For marine fishes, which are among the most studied taxonomic groups, current lists of species are considerably incomplete for most of the world's oceans. At a 3¬∞ (about 350 km2) spatial resolution, less than 1.8% of the world's oceans have above 80% of their fish fauna currently described. =Conclusion= The fundamental macroecological question that the latitudinal diversity gradient depends on is \\"What causes patterns in species richness?\\". Species richness ultimately depends on whatever proximate factors are found to affect processes of speciation, extinction, immigration, and emigration. While some ecologists continue to search for the ultimate primary mechanism that causes the latitudinal richness gradient, many ecologists suggest instead this ecological pattern is likely to be generated by several contributory mechanisms (Gaston and Blackburn 2000, Willig et al. 2003, Rahbek et al. 2007). For now, the debate over the cause of the latitudinal diversity gradient will continue until a groundbreaking study provides conclusive evidence, or there is general consensus that multiple factors contribute to the pattern.

The format followed in the festivals was around 30 one page plays, performed by four actors (two male, two female), with a run time of approximately an hour. Couch Soup 2005 Though the plays are limited to one side of an A4 page, no restrictions are placed on the format used, and plays may vary from under thirty seconds to over two minutes in length, with the average being around a minute per play. The festival is thus characterized by the demands it places on an actor as much as for its accessibility and vigor . Because it is difficult to tackle a serious theme completely in the course of a page the plays are commonly absurd, satirical or (rarely) dramas of the kitchen sink variety.

The station is called \\"KGRG1\\" and has a classic alternative format. KGRG's nighttime signal reception is affected mainly by KKPZ/Portland, as well as CJYM/Rosetown, Saskatchewan in certain areas. This makes KGRG difficult to receive outside of the Enumclaw area; however, KGRG1 has been reported in California and Oregon. Staff members have stated that they've received emails from people claiming to hear the signal in Kansas, and even as far away as Finland and Norway.  History  =KENU - The Sound of The Plateau= Licensed April 28, 1982, KENU was a country music station at 1330 AM run by a series of local owners in Enumclaw, Washington including Robert Reverman. KENU was a community focused radio station that ran local programming hosted by local DJs as well as coverage of Enumclaw High School's football games. In 1988, KENU changed call signs to KQZQ.Call Sign History KQZQ aired a Hard Rock radio format which only lasted for a total of 23 days, when KENU returned by popular demand. =Country Gold Network= In 1992, KENU became a simulcast of KJUN 1450 AM in Puyallup, WA and became a part of the new Country Gold Network along with KBLV 1540 AM in Bellevue, WA, and KTOL 1280 AM in Olympia, WA. In early 1996, the Country Gold Network discontinued operations due to financial distress. KENU went silent and was put up for sale. =Plateau Country= In November 1996, The Green River Foundation purchased the silent radio station, so that Green River Community College students would have internship possibilities at KENU. The studio was moved into the Enumclaw GRCC campus and KENU went back on the air as \\"Plateau Country\\". They tried to operate KENU as a commercial radio station, but relatively few students ever participated in the country station internship. During the summer of 2000, the KENU studios were relocated to Green River's Auburn Campus. In 2001, the general manager of GRCC's radio stations, Tom Evans Krause, allowed a format change.untitled KENU went into stunting, airing the top dance hits of 1997, preparing for a new radio format. =KENU - NU Music, Pure Dance= KENU was moved into the Student Center, next door to KGRG at the Auburn campus with a new digital on air studio. The new moniker as KENU \\"NU Music, Pure Dance\\" was adopted, playing a Dance Hits radio format similar to KNHC. With relatively few complaints from country music fans in the Enumclaw area, the new dance radio format was well received by the public. It was one of the few radio stations in the US to play electronic dance music (EDM), and was the only AM station in the US to do so since Beat Radio. In January 2002, KENU began streaming online.NorthwestTekno - good news in the south end.. nu radio station In May 2004, Karl Koning became the new program director, Matt DeLaney the assistant program director, and Jess Flarity became the new music director. Shortly after, the station began stunting with only a pulsating heart beat, generating the idea that the station was undergoing a radio format change. But in actuality, the station was undergoing preparations for a new image campaign to in an attempt to boost awareness of KENU at the school and in the community as well as slightly refocusing the music format. =Pulse 1330= The new EDM format (unveiled in June 2004) was branded as \\"Pulse 1330\\", which tried to stay away from mainstream Dance music. The new format included a new logo, new IDs, new slogan \\"The Northwest's Underground Music Source\\", and the playlist was completely revamped. Pulse 1330 gained a presence in the Seattle party scene,RadioInsight.com: Dance => Say goodbye to KENU/Enumclaw, Wash despite the fact that their signal was barely audible in the downtown Seattle area. Even though \\"Pulse\\" broadcast over 1330 AM, their main focus was their worldwide online presence as an internet radio station. At first, \\"Pulse\\" focused mainly on Trance, but as time went on, it began including other forms of Electronica, such as Hardcore, House, Drum'n'Bass/Jungle, as well as Rhythmic tracks from local artists (while KGRG played Rock tracks from local artists). \\"Pulse\\" frequently had local DJs spinning on air, many of them well known in the local party scene, and they also hosted several LAN parties, as well as other promotional events that featured Pulse DJs and Pulse music, but they were rarely seen at events on the GRCC campuses. The former show Non-Linear Parfait broke the station's record for the most calls in one show and paved the way for much of the strange programming that was heard on The Pulse.MySpace.com - The Non-Linear Parfiat - 21 - Gar√ßon - KENT, WASHINGTON - www.myspace.com/thenlp1330 Non-Linear Parfait was hosted by Seattle-based DJ/producer Graz. Other notable DJs at the station at that time were Magic Man and DJ Nathan V. In summer 2006, only one student enrolled for the class, which rose to three students in the fall. The station management worked very hard to keep the format afloat, but the lack of student involvement would have resulted in the class being dissolved for the year. This led to the untimely and unfortunate demise of \\"Pulse.\\" The demise was a fate that some believe the Pulse simply didn't deserve. It is speculated that the Capitol Hill Massacre was partially to blame for the drop in student involvement. In September 2006, \\"Pulse\\" signed off and began airing a loop of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit for 3 days. =KGRG1= The Alternative Past \\"KGRG1\\" signed on with The Ramones' Blitzkrieg Bop. The new format plays tracks that were formerly played on sister station KGRG in the 1980s and early 1990s. In February 2007, the long-standing KENU call sign was changed to KGRG to match their sister FM station and the new name. On July 11, 2008 at 5:00 PM (PDT), KGRG1 began airing a \\"Non-Stop Sub Pop Weekend\\" as a tribute to the 20th anniversary of Sub Pop Records. The first song played was \\"Spank Thru\\" by Nirvana off of the Sub Pop 200 compilation followed by tracks from various Sub Pop Records recorded pre-1997.

The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music describes them as \\"One of the first Christian alternative rock bands of the 1990s\\". Their name, when spoken, is audibly similar to saying \\"Dig Jesus\\" in Spanish. History The band signed to Brainstorm Artists International in 1991 and produced their first album, StruggleFish, with Terry Scott Taylor. The album was widely described as essentially a clone of the Red Hot Chili Peppers or Janes Addiction. They subsequently toured nationally with bands such as Scaterd Few and played festivals including the Cornerstone Festival. The band found their own groove by their second album, MagentaMantaLoveTree. Magenta was co- produced with Gene Eugene and is considered more emotional than their first. The bands' sound fuses punk rock and freestyle jazz to create their own brand of neo-psychedelic rock, as in the songs \\"Black-Eyed Pea\\" and \\"Secret.\\" They also covered Steve Taylor's \\"I Want To Be A Clone\\" for the 1994 tribute I Predict A Clone. In later concerts, Taylor's version came to resemble DigHayZoose's more than his own. (1) (2) DigHayZoose was released from their contract in 1994 and announced their breakup at the Cornerstone festival that year. At the same time Ascension 7: Rocketship to Heaven, their final release, was recorded. Ascension 7 includes guests Dan Michaels of The Choir and Allan Aguirre of Scaterd Few. They began to search for a new record label, and in 1995 added David Coonce (known as \\"Zoop\\") as a fifth member. An underproduced demo, which consisted of five songs of modern praise, received what the band later characterized as a \\"lukewarm reception.\\" When David Andersen left the band in 1996 they reformed under the name Infrared and recorded a demo before disbanding in 1997. In 2005 the band reunited to rerecord their Infrared era material. Related projects Cover of Ticklewigglejigglepickle Bil Brown also participated in the initial forming of \\"neopsychedelic\\" Christian Kansas City group Hot Pink Turtle. Hot Pink Turtle released one album, Ticklewigglejigglepickle, in 1993 on R.E.X. Music, and covered Steve Taylor's \\"A Principled Man\\" on the same Steve Taylor tribute album as DigHayZoose. One reviewer concisely described its diversity as \\"a hodgepoge of music and meanings\\". Bil's other efforts include the rockabilly band Silvermen, and most recently, leading worship and creative arts at Desperation Church in Liberty, MO. The Silvermen formed in 1998, signed to Ashland Records, and released one album with Bil on bass, Pioneers of the Intergalactic Frontier, in 2000. Pioneers was a science fiction based album with a variety of sounds, much like DigHayZoose. Hot Pink Turtle also included Dion Tyler on bass, who formed a band called Dev Null with Dave Anderson in 1997. They released one album and disbanded in about 1999. Phil Schlotterer founded a band called The Sky Kings (later changed to The Day Birds) which was reported to have a strong local following in 2000. They released at least one album, turnstyle (1999) and an EP, you rock, in 2002.Daybirds Discography Phil left the band by 2004. Florez, Andersen, Tyler, and Donovan White also formed a band called Sundowner. They had not recorded material as of 2000. Later 2010 White formed a band known as \\"Mavens\\" with Tyler in the band along with a few others they won recording time from a band competition and earned 1st Place.

Finished in 1996, the stadium is home to the Charlotte 49ers soccer and track and field teams. The facility includes the Southeast's first eight-lane continuous radius track with full-depth polyurethane surface; and 10,500 square feet of internal space including coaches' offices, locker rooms and a hospitality suite in the North Pavilion. Public restrooms, concessions and the press box are located in the South Pavilion. The Central Pavilion contains the ticket booths, Wall of Champions and Recognition Center.http://www.rodgersbuilders.com/portfolio/project/80/unc-charlotte/ Track events held in the Center include high jump, pole vault, long jump, and triple jump. The natural grass playing surface is the home field for the 49ers men's and women's soccer teams, and also accommodates shot put, discus, javelin and hammer throw events. The facility has hosted several major meets for both Conference USA and the Atlantic 10 Conference. A pro soccer team, the Charlotte Eagles, have also used Transamerica Field for home games. Originally considered for expansion to host the Charlotte 49ers new football team, estimates of expansion for football usage made by leading sports design firm Populous were prohibitively expensive due to location restrictions and environmental concerns involving the Toby Creek flood plain. Subsequently, the university chose to build a dedicated football stadium west of Hayes Stadium, named Jerry Richardson Stadium. Title IX scholarship requirements related to the addition of the Charlotte 49ers football program will most likely mean that Belk will soon be home to either a potential 49ers future field hockey team or women's lacrosse team. Facilities upgrades, including the possibility of replacing the grass field with artificial turf, might be needed to handle the added usage.

After a trauma factor VII initiates the process of coagulation in conjunction with tissue factor (TF/factor III) in the extrinsic pathway. The condition may be inherited or acquired. It is the most common of the rare congenital coagulation disorders. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may differ greatly, as apparently modifiers control to some degree the amount of FVII that is produced. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms while others may experience life-threatening bleeding. Typically this bleeding disorder manifests itself as a tendency to easy bruising, nose bleeding, heavy and prolonged menstruation, and excessive bleeding after dental or surgical interventions. Newborns may bleed in the head, from the umbilicus, or excessively after circumcision. Other bleeding can be encountered in the gut, in muscles or joints, or the brain. Hematuria may occur. While in congenital disease symptoms may be present at birth or show up later, in patients with acquired FVII deficiency symptoms typically show up in later life. About 3-4% of patients with FVII deficiency may also experience thrombotic episodes. Causes Inherited or congenital FVII deficiency is passed on by autosomal recessive inheritance. A person needs to inherit a defective gene from both parents. People who have only one defective gene do not exhibit the disease, but can pass the gene on to half their offspring. Different genetic mutations have been described. In persons with the congenital FVII deficiency the condition is lifelong. People with this condition should alert other family members may they also have the condition or carry the gene. In the general population the condition affects about 1 in 300,000 to 500,000 people. However, the prevalence may be higher as not all individuals may express the disease and be diagnosed. In the acquired of FVII deficiency an insufficient amount of factor VII is produced by the liver due to liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or certain medications (i.e., Coumadin). Diagnosis Blood tests are needed to differentiate FVII deficiency from other bleeding disorders. Typical is a discordance between the prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and normal levels for the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). FVII levels are <10IU/dl in homozygous individuals, and between 20-60 in heterozygous carriers. The FCVII: C assay supports the diagnosis. The FVII gene (F7) is found on chromosome 13q34. Heterogeneous mutations have been described in FVII deficient patients. Treatment There are several treatments available for factor VII deficiency; they all replace deficient FVII. # Recombinant FVIIa concentrate (rFVIIa) is a recombinant treatment that is highly effective and has no risk of fluid overload or viral disease. It may be the optimal therapy. # Plasma derived Factor VII concentrate (pdFVII) : This treatment is suitable for surgery but can lead to thrombosis. It is virus attenuated. # Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) containing factor VII: this treatment is suitable for surgery, but has a risk of thrombosis. It is virus attenuated. # Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): This is relatively inexpensive and readily available. While effective this treatment carries a risk of blood-borne viruses and fluid overload. History The condition was first described by Dr. B. Alexander, R. Goldstein, G. Landwehr G, and CD. Cook in 1951.

SEAlink was written in 1986 as a part of the SEAdog FidoNet mailer written by System Enhancement Associates, creators of the famous ARC program. It was licensed with a simple \\"give credit\\" requirement, but nevertheless was not very widely used except in FidoNet mailers. SEAlink, and most other XMODEM enhancements, were quickly displaced following the introduction of ZMODEM. Description XMODEM breaks down the file to be sent into a numbered series of packets of 128 bytes each. Packets are sent one at a time to the receiver, who either acknowledges the proper reception by sending a \`ACK\` character or requests it to be resent by sending a \`NAK\` instead. The transfer then continues with another packet. Although the time needed to send the \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` is almost zero, the propagation delay of the phone system itself introduces a latency. A latency of 0.1 seconds is not at all uncommon and can be much longer on overseas links. That means that the maximum transfer rate of XMODEM is a function of the phone system more than the speed of the modems themselves. At 300 bit/s this is not a serious concern, as the packet will take about 3.5 seconds to send, the 0.1 delay being insignificant. However, at 9600 bit/s the packet only takes about 0.1 seconds to send, meaning that at least half of the potential throughput is lost while the sender waits for the \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` to arrive. SEAlink addresses this through the use of a \\"sliding window\\". In this case the sender does not wait for the \`ACK\` or \`NAK\`, and instead simply sends out its packets in a continuous stream. The receiver still has to \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` the packets, but does so by attaching a packet number to each one, allowing the sender to identify which packets worked or failed. The \\"window\\" refers to the number of packets that can be sent before an \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` is required. In the case of SEAlink, the window was six packets, allowing up to 768 bytes of data to be sent at once. SEAlink was designed to be completely backward compatible with existing XMODEM implementations. On the receiver side, all that was required was that the receiver send back the packet number (contained in all XMODEM packets) along with the normal \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` character. On reception of the very first \`ACK\` or \`NAK\`, the SEAlink sender would \\"notice\\" the packet number and continue to use windows. If the packet number was missing, it was assumed it was sending to a non-SEAlink XMODEM, and set the window size to one. Other features SEAlink also included a number of features included in other XMODEM derivatives. Notable was the use of a \\"zero packet\\", which was introduced in the FidoNet-related TeLink protocol in order to send file information and support batch file transfers. SEAlink made one minor modification to this \\"standard\\", adding a byte in position 40 of the packet to indicate whether or not to use \\"overdrive\\". When turned on, by placing any non-zero number in byte 40, the receiver no longer expected \`ACK\` messages, but only \`NAK\`s. This was intended to reduce the bandwidth required from the receiver back to the sender, which was an important consideration on many of the early high-speed modems, which featured a very slow backchannel (75 bit/s in the Telebit modems, for instance). A later addition was \\"RESYNC\\", allowing for file transfers to be restarted from where they left off. RESYNC added another indicator in the zero packet, byte 42, to indicate that the sender supports the feature. In this case, the receiver always checks to see if an identical filename exists locally, and if so, sends a \`SYN\` character instead of the normal \`ACK\` or \`NAK\`. The \`SYN\` is followed by the packet number at which to restart.

The incidence is one in a million to one in five million people, with higher incidence in areas with consanguineous marriage such as Iran that has the highest global incidence of the disorder. Most are due to mutations in the A subunit gene (located on chromosome 6p25-p24). This mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Deficiency of Factor XIII leads to defective cross-linking of fibrin and vulnerability to late re-bleeds when the primary hemostatic plug is overwhelmed. Bleeding tendencies similar to hemophiliacs develop, such as hemarthroses and deep tissue bleeding. As Factor XIII is composed of two subunit protein, A and B, for which the genes are located on different chromosomes, administration of recombinant A subunit improves clot stability and is becoming a therapeutic option for patients with this condition.  Diagnosis:  Bleeding manifestation with normal PT, aPTT, TT, BT, amd CT is suspected as factor XIII Deficiency. Confirmatory test is urea lysis test.

Although it is a recombinant protein, rFXIII subunit A is identical in structure and function to the A subunit of factor XIII naturally produced in the body by healthy individuals. These patients need exogenous subunit A of factor XIII since they have a mutation which prevents production of the A subunit. However, since the B-subunit is located on a separate chromosome, factor XIII deficient patients actually produce the B-subunit normally. When these two subunits interact in the plasma, the enzyme is activated and can act within the clotting cascade. rFXIII acts by inhibiting fibrinolysis factors which enzymatically cleave the fibrin matrix, leading to the ultimate formation of clots. rFXIII is synthetically bio-engineered through a yeast expression system and administered intravenously. In clinical trials, the drug was administered once every four weeks or administered on-demand in order to treat bleeding episodes. The introduction of rFXIII as a treatment for factor XIII deficiency eliminates the risk of pathogenic infection present in plasma-based treatments. rFXIII treatment would also not be dependent on blood donations, consequently increasing availability and product quality. One of the biggest fears in developing rFXIII was that the body would mount an immune-response to the protein; however, several safety and pharmacokinetics studies have reported no immunogenic response to rFXIII or associated yeast products.

The EPQ model was developed by E.W. Taft in 1918. This method is an extension of the economic order quantity model (also known as the EOQ model). The difference between these two methods is that the EPQ model assumes the company will produce its own quantity or the parts are going to be shipped to the company while they are being produced, therefore the orders are available or received in an incremental manner while the products are being produced. While the EOQ model assumes the order quantity arrives complete and immediately after ordering, meaning that the parts are produced by another company and are ready to be shipped when the order is placed. In some literature, \\"economic manufacturing quantity\\" model (EMQ) is used for \\"economic production quantity\\" model (EPQ). Similar to the EOQ model, EPQ is a single product lot scheduling method. A multiproduct extension to these models is called product cycling problem. Overview EPQ only applies where the demand for a product is constant over the year and that each new order is delivered/produced incrementally when the inventory reaches zero. There is a fixed cost charged for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered. There is also a holding or storage cost for each unit held in storage (sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item). We want to determine the optimal number of units of the product to order so that we minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery and storage of the product The required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year, the purchase cost for each item, the fixed cost to place the order and the storage cost for each item per year. Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost, however, this number can be determined from the other parameters = Assumptions = # Demand for items from inventory is continuous and at a constant rate # Production runs to replenish inventory are made at regular intervals # During a production run, the production of items is continuous and at a constant rate # Production set- up/ordering cost is fixed (independent of quantity produced) # The lead time is fixed # The purchase price of the item is constant, i.e. no discount is available # The replenishment is made incrementally = Variables = * K = ordering/setup cost per production run * D = yearly demand rate * h = yearly holding cost per product * T = cycle length * P = yearly production rate * x = frac {D}{P} * Q = order quantity = Total cost function and derivation of EPQ formula = This figure graphs the holding cost and ordering cost per year equations. The third line is the addition of these two equations, which generates the total inventory cost per year. This graph should give a better understanding of the derivation of the optimal ordering quantity equation, i.e., the EPQ equation * Holding Cost per Year = frac{Q} {2} h(1-x) Where frac{Q} {2} is the average inventory level, and h(1-x) is the average holding cost. Therefore, multiplying these two results in the holding cost per year. * Ordering Cost per Year = frac{D} {Q} K Where frac{D} {Q} are the orders placed in a year, multiplied by K results in the ordering cost per year. We can notice from the equations above that the total ordering cost decreases as the production quantity increases. Inversely, the total holding cost increases as the production quantity increases. Therefore, in order to get the optimal production quantity we need to set holding cost per year equal to ordering cost per year and solve for quantity (Q), which is the EPQ formula mentioned below. Ordering this quantity will result in the lowest total inventory cost per year. cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} = Relevant formulas = *Average holding cost per unit time: :frac{1} {2} hD(1-x)t *Average ordering and holding cost as a function of time: :x(t) = frac {1} {2} hD(1-x)t+ frac {K} {t}  See also  * Infinite fill rate for the part being produced: Economic order quantity * Demand is random: classical Newsvendor model * Demand varies over time: Dynamic lot size model * Several products produced on the same machine: Economic lot scheduling problem * Reorder point  References  * Taft, E.

Description Extinct terrestrial vascular plants of the Devonian period. Stem of the order of several mm to several cm in diameter and several cm to a metre long, erect or arched, dichotomizing occasionally, furnished with true roots at the base. Vascular bundle actinostele, tracheids of primitive annular or helical type (so-called G-type). Leaves are unbranched thorn-shaped (i.e. with a wide base, tapering to a blunt point) microphylls several mm long with a single prominent vascular thread, arranged spirally to randomly on the stem. Sporangia borne singly on the upper leaf surface. Drepanophycus has similarities to the genus Halleophyton. It differs from a closely related genus of the same period, Baragwanathia, in the position of the sporangia, and the arrangement and shape of the leaves; see Drepanophycaceae for more details. It is more derived than the coexisting genus Asteroxylon, which has enations lacking vascules, in contrast to the true leaves of Drepanophycus. Drepanophycus spinaeformis was first discovered in Scotland; fossils have since been recovered in Russia (around Lake Shunet in the republic of Khakassia), in the Yunnan province of the People's Republic of China, and in Egypt. They were among the earliest land plants,Palaeos Plants: Chlorobionta growing to approximately 80 cm in height. The species is notably differentiated from other plants in the genus by its thicker stems. Foliage is described as firm and spiny, though recovered fossils rarely retain leaf detail. The stomata of D. spinaeformis look similar to that of Lycopodium japonicum. They both consist of two large guard cells and pore, and are anomocytic. There were two small guard cells surrounded by two large similarly shaped subsidiary cells (paracytic) deriving from a pronounced elliptical cuticular ledge on the surface of the guard cells surrounding a thickened circumporal area.

Her body and belongings have never been found and no one has been charged in connection with her disappearance and presumed murder. Disappearance Blades was hitchhiking from Hamilton to Hastings on Saturday 31 May 1975, the first day of the Queen's Birthday long weekend, and was allegedly last seen on the road between Napier and Taupo in an orange Datsun 120Y station wagon. A truck driver saw Blades getting into the Datsun and witnesses reported seeing a matching vehicle veering off the highway and stopping on rural Matea Road. Investigation There have been about five suspects in the case. Auckland police investigated John Freeman who had rented an orange Datsun the weekend that Blades disappeared. On the day two weeks later that police announced they were searching for an orange Datsun, Freeman shot and wounded a student at St Cuthbert's College in Auckland before killing himself. An elderly New Zealand man and Charlie Hughes, a Hamilton man now living in Australia, have remained \\"persons of interest\\" for police. Hughes has gone public in newspapers and on television about his frustrations at being on the suspects list and has denied he had anything to do with the alleged murder. In 2004, there was a glimmer of hope when police came across a shallow grave bearing Blades' name in a Huntly garage. The name had been inscribed on concrete as a joke six years earlier and the former owner of the property apologised to her family. In 2005, Blades' brother, Tony Blades, told the Daily Post his family had not talked to the media during the previous 30 years about their feelings because it was too hard on them, especially their mother, who was then in her 80s, and her father had died not knowing his daughter's whereabouts. In January 2012 police dug up the concrete laundry floor of a house in Kawerau looking for her body, but found nothing of interest. Aftermath The Mona Blades case featured on TVNZ's Cold Case programme in July 2018. The programme revisited the case with expert detectives and re-examined the original files hoping to find new leads. The experts concluded that the original investigation focused too heavily on the hunt for the orange Datsun and may have misled potential witnesses by using photographs which did not resemble Blades' hairstyle at the time of her disappearance. A detective said that gang members or their associates may have been involved in the disappearance. Blades had gang affiliations, and gang members may have been travelling on the road to a gathering in Wellington that weekend.

In addition, KONE builds and services moving walkways (referred to by the company as autowalks), automatic doors and gates, escalators and elevators. The company provides local service for builders, developers, building owners, designers and architects in 1,000 offices in over 50 countries. Since 1924, KONE has been controlled by one of Finland's wealthiest families, the Herlin family. After Harald Herlin purchased the company in 1924, he served as its Chairman until 1941. Afterwards, his son, Heikki H. Herlin, took over his father's post from 1941-1987. Control of the company was then handed down to his son, Pekka Herlin, which he retained from 1987-2003. The current Chairman of KONE's Board of Directors from 2003 onwards is Antti Herlin, the son of Pekka Herlin. , Antti Herlin controls directly or indirectly 62% of the voting rights and 22% of the shares of the company which is listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In the Finnish language Kone means \\"machine\\" or \\"device\\". History =1910‚Äì1964= KONE (then known as Osakeyhti√∂ Kone Aktiebolag) was founded in 1910 as a subsidiary of Gottfr. Str√∂mberg Oy. Str√∂mberg's licence to import Graham Brothers elevators was transferred to the new company. KONE sold just a few units before terminating the licensing agreement in 1917. KONE, then a company with only 50 employees, started to make and install its own elevators in 1918. Six years later, in 1924, entrepreneur Harald Herlin bought KONE from Str√∂mberg and became the new chairman of the company's Board of Directors. His son, Heikki H. Herlin, joined the company and was appointed technical director in 1928. His office was located in a former margarine factory on Haapaniemi Street in Helsinki that KONE had bought and converted into an elevator production facility the previous year. Heikki H. Herlin took over as KONE's president in 1932. KONE's first foreign subsidiary ‚Äì AB Kone Hissar of Sweden ‚Äì was established in 1957. After World War II, KONE was called upon by the Finnish government to contribute elevators, electric hoists and cranes to the war reparations being paid to the Soviet Union. This program forced KONE to expand its capacity, rationalize production processes and learn to meet demanding manufacturing schedules. In the 1950s KONE introduced its first group controls, automatic doors and hydraulic elevators. Heikki H. Herlin turned over the president's duties in 1964 to his son, Pekka, who had served as administrative director since 1958. =1965‚Äì1998= KONE opened a purpose- built elevator factory in 1966 in Hyvink√§√§, Finland. The following year KONE was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges and started its international expansion through the acquisition of Sweden's Asea-Graham and its Norwegian and Danish affiliates. Numerous acquisitions followed during the 1970s and 1980s with only the most significant being listed here. The acquisitions of companies larger and older than KONE itself has been seen to have brought KONE respectability and lifted the company to a position of market prominence. Eventually KONE further expanded its business scope. The company became one of the world's largest hoist and crane manufacturers as well as a producer of high-tech electronic hospital and laboratory equipment. The former Kone corporate offices in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki In 1981 KONE entered the American elevator market with the acquisition of New York City based Armor Elevator Company, which it continued to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary. The company acquired Navire Cargo Gear in 1982 and International MacGregor, makers of shipboard cargo access equipment. Wood-handling systems and equipment for pulp and paper mills, hydraulic piping systems, mining equipment and conveyors, and specialized steel components were manufactured at KONE's steel foundry. In 1987, after 60 years as a member of KONE's board of directors and 46 as its chairman, Heikki H. Herlin retired. Prevented by Finnish law from serving simultaneously as president and board chairman, Pekka Herlin ceded the presidency to Matti Matinpalo, the first non-Herlin to occupy the position in 55 years, and continued as Chairman of the Board. In 1990, KONE sold its shipboard cargo handling business in 1993, as well as its crane (Konecranes), wood handling and piping systems businesses in 1994, and finally the steel foundry and electronic medical instruments divisions in 1995. Only its elevators, escalators, and automatic door branches remained. KONE acquired the Montgomery Elevator Company of the U.S. in 1994. Soon afterwards, the KONE Corporation purchased a majority of the outstanding shares of O&K; Rolltreppen GmbH of Germany, a supplier of escalators and autowalks. In 1998 the company made a $29 million (US) investment in the construction of an elevator and escalator factory in Kunshan, China. In 1996, Antti Herlin, the great-grandson of the company's founder, was appointed KONE CEO and deputy chairman of the board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc hoisting machine and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using permanent-magnet electric motors (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the hoistway overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own. =1999‚Äì2014= Flags at Kone corporate headquarters, built in 2001 in Keilaniemi, Espoo, Finland (photo 2003). KONEs chairman of the board, Pekka Herlin, died on April 4, 2003 after a long illness. Antti Herlin was subsequently appointed the new chairman of the board in June 2003. Matti Alahuhta, a former Executive Vice President at Nokia Corporation, previously serving as the President of Nokia Mobile Phones, was later chosen to fill Herlin's vacant position as the acting President of the KONE Corporation. He held the position since 2005, and officially became the firm's president and CEO in 2006. In April 2014, Alahuhta stepped down and KONE's CFO at the time, Henrik Ehrnrooth was appointed Alahuhta's successor. In 2000, KONE sold off the American factory in Winfield, KS to Wittur. This was done despite repeated assurances by KONE management to its employees that the factory was not for sale. In 2002, KONE acquired Partek, a Finnish industrial engineering company with net sales equal to KONE's. Partek's business areas specialized in container handling, load handling, forest machinery and tractors. The tractors were manufactured under the Valtra brand. The KONE Materials Handling division thus comprised these Partek business areas. In 2003, KONE decided to concentrate on Container Handling and Load Handling and the tractor and forest machine businesses were sold. The Valtra tractor business was sold to AGCO, a worldwide agricultural manufacturer. As the structure of KONE Materials Handling had changed significantly, the name KONE Cargotec was introduced in January 2004. Its business areas were Kalmar (container handling) and HIAB (load handling). At the end of 2004, KONE Cargotec acquired MacGREGOR, a global marine cargo-flow service provider. In August 2004 the KONE Board of Directors presented a plan to split the company into two separately listed companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchanges in June, 2005. One company would comprise KONE's existing elevator, escalator & building door service business and continue to operate under the name KONE Corporation. The other company would comprise KONE Cargotec's business area and operate under the name Cargotec Corporation. The Extraordinary Shareholders‚Äô Meeting in December 2004 approved the Demerger Plan. The demerger was completed in June 2005. In September 2007 it was announced that KONE is proposing to lease several floors of a new riverfront tower to be built on Bass Street Landing, which is part of the Moline Riverfront.Schorpp, Doug. :Kone to sell its Moline properties to Q-C developer\\", \\"QCTimes.com\\", September 27, 2007. Accessed September 27, 2007. Also in 2007, it was announced KONE had received part of what was then the largest fine ever handed out by the EU Commission for local anti- competitive practices in the elevator and escalator markets in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands relating to time prior to mid-2004 (the commission stated that it could only prove its case back to 1995, though evidence allegedly suggested the abuse had started much earlier). Competitors ThyssenKrupp, Schindler Group, Otis Elevator Co. and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe were also given similar fines. KONE has appealed against the size of the fine, currently 142 million EUR. In total, the industry received 1 billion EUR fine for cartel activity across Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Finally, in 2007, KONE announced that they would stop production of hydraulic elevators, replacing them with the EcoSpace MRL elevators, due to the hydraulic elevators' inefficient energy consumption, contamination concerns regarding the use of hydraulic oil and buried cylinders, and other environmental concerns. Therefore, KONE has become the first major brand elevator company to make only traction elevators. =Alliances and acquisitions= * 1981 ‚Äì KONE enters the United States market by acquiring Armor Elevator Co. * 1985 ‚Äì KONE acquires Canadian division of Montgomery Elevator. * 1994 ‚Äì KONE's ownership of Montgomery in Canada opens an alliance with Montgomery in the U.S. that led to the full aquistition of Montgomery altogether.

KONE UltraRope in elevator shaft Awards and rankings In 2013, KONE has been awarded for several GOOD DESIGN awards for its design offering, functional elevator signalization series and sleek new elevator car design. This is the third time KONE has received this acknowledgement for its design excellence.\\"KONE wins four prestigious GOOD DESIGN awards\\" February 3, 2014. Retrieved on 19 June 2014. =Forbes list of world's most innovative companies= In 2014, KONE was ranked 42nd out of the top in the world by the well-known business magazine Forbes. This was the fourth consecutive year KONE was recognized in this ranking. Out of all European companies listed in 2014, KONE was ranked an impressive sixth and KONE was the only elevator and escalator company featured on Forbes' list. In 2018, KONE remained at 59th on Forbes' list.https://www.forbes.com/innovative- companies/list/ =2014 Newsweek Green Rankings= In 2014, KONE was ranked the world's 12th greenest company by the American magazine Newsweek. Released by Newsweek and its research partner Corporate Knights Capital, the evaluates the world's largest publicly traded companies using eight metrics that collectively provide a transparent measurement of overall corporate environmental performance. In the list, KONE is the only top 50 company representing the elevator and escalator industry. Products and trademarks =KONE UltraRope= In June 2013 the company launched a new high-rise elevator technology, called 'KONE UltraRope', which enables future elevator travel heights of up to one kilometer. The product is light due to its carbon- fiber tape core and a high-friction coating. Because of these qualities, elevator energy consumption in high-rise buildings can be cut significantly.New KONE UltraRope(TM) elevator hoisting technology enables the next big leap in high-rise building design  KONE Press Release June 10, 2013 Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia (with a height of 1,000 meters) which opens in 2020 will feature KONE UltraRope. The elevator in Jeddah Tower will be a height of 660 meters. One additional benefit of UltraRope is that it has a higher resonance frequency than steel cable. This reduces the cable's sway in tall buildings and can minimize damage from the cable to itself and to the elevator shaft. =KONE EcoDisc motor= KONE EcoDisc motor The 'KONE EcoDisc motor', used for hoisting, reduces the amount of energy lost as heat and circulates air through the motor reducing its temperature. The motor control system and brakes make the elevator ride quieter and the design frees up space. It is typically installed as an MRL (Motor-Room-Less) motor that is placed at the top of an elevator shaft. The fastest speed that Kone make the EcoDisc (as an MRL motor) is 3.0 m/s. However, for a faster speed (e.g. 4 m/s) it requires the machine to be installed in a machine room. = KONE Access Turnstiles = The 'KONE Access Turnstiles', used for the fast and efficient movement for the flow of people. These are part of the 'People Flow' technology family by KONE. This system has the option to have the 'KONE Monitoring System' which allows you to watch and track the turnstiles and elevator systems. = KONE Destination = KONE Destination allows for a fast and efficient ride from floor to floor in a building. The system uses a touch screen panel/terminal that shows the floor numbers and when the floor is selected, it calls the nearest elevator to the floor you called and will take you to your floor with minor to no stops on your ride to your floor. The system also allows for the turnstiles to work together with the elevators so when you swipe your access card on the turnstile, it calls the nearest elevator. There is also an app for the elevator system that allows you to call and type in your destination from your mobile device reducing wait time. This system has the option to have the KONE Monitoring System which allows you to watch and track turnstiles and elevator systems. =Elevators= The 'KONE MonoSpace' for low- to mid-rise buildings is the world's first machine-room- less elevator. The 'KONE EcoSpace' elevator is a machine-room-less traction elevator designed for low-rise buildings from 2 to 15 stories as an energy- efficient alternative to hydraulic elevators, and can fit in an existing hydraulic elevator hoistway. It is produced in a speed, and variants. The 'KONE MiniSpace' elevator with a small machine room is often used in high-rise buildings. =Cooperation with IBM= In 2017 Kone announced a new cooperation with IBM allowing them to collect information from lifts. By analysing the information from hundreds of thousands of lifts, the company can identify warning signs of problems that need to be addressed. This means an engineer can be sent out before the problem actually arises, and he or she can also carry the correct spare needed for that exact lift.http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2018/working- environments/article.2018-09-25.8646088789 =Other trademarks= 'People Flow' is a registered trademark of KONE Corporation.  Cartel fine  The European Union (EU) gave a fine of 992m euros ($1.3bn; ¬£666.8m) on four lift and escalator manufacturers for price-fixing between 1995 and 2004. Germany's ThyssenKrupp, US-owned Otis Elevator Company, Kone of Finland and Swiss firm Schindler were fined for taking part in a market-rigging cartel.Record EU fine for lift 'cartel' BBC 21.10.2013  Industrial action  On the 7 April 2015, about 300 KONE UK employees took industrial action.

It is similar to the seminal XMODEM in most ways, but uses a variable-size packet in order to make better use of the available bandwidth on high-speed modems. JMODEM uses variable-length records called blocks. These blocks start with 512 data-bytes and increase in length to a maximum of 8192 bytes per block. There is a 6-byte overhead associated with each block so the percentage of overhead starts at a fairly high 1.1 percent and decreases to a very low 0.07 percent as the transmission progresses. The block length will increase in 512-byte increments as long as there are no errors requiring retransmission. Should an error occur, the block-size is cut in half. This continues until the block- size is as short as 64 bytes. JMODEM also included a basic RLE data compression system, which replaces strings of repeated characters with a counter. If a string of many similar characters are found, JMODEM sends a \\"sentinel byte\\" (hexadecimal 0xBB) followed by a two-byte number, followed by the byte to be repeated. JMODEM applied RLE on a block-by-block basis, as opposed to the file as a whole. Since many files were already compressed with systems like .zip, JMODEM only used RLE on blocks where it actually reduced the size of the block. JMODEM is explained in some detail in the John Dvorak book Dvorak's Guide to PC Telecommunications.

History The foundations of what was to become Symbyosis were laid in 1998 when Franck Kobolt began to compose songs for a personal project called Chrysalid. At first, four songs only were written as they were for his sole benefit, not to be released for a larger audience. Nevertheless, in the following months, Franck Kobolt united with another composer PhilQuist and the singer Corrosive Bob which led to the writing of more music and texts. After a whole year, what had begun as a four-title demo finally turned into a full album. In June 1999, the band began a studio session to record its first true album, Crisis, under the aegis of Hidden Association and finished the recording in January 2000. This album is made of thirteen titles and friends of the group participated like Oslanon Gerom, Cryopsis Entity on additional voices as well as Karl Bourdin on guitar solos. Cryopsis Entity also wrote the lyrics of some songs and PhilQuist co-composed others. One song taken from this album Crisis; the Quest of the Dolphin, was chosen in March 2000 to be released on a compilation for Metallian magazine. Finally, the band signed with Listenable Records in July 2000. In October 2000, Symbyosis released its mini-album The Fluid and revealed its work Crisis in November 2000. Then in 2001, the group went on tour with No Return and Crest of Darkness with Tariq Zulficar playing drums and Antoine Rognon, bass guitar and Nikos Kevorkian as second guitar. That same year, the title ‚ÄúVoyager‚Äù was on free download on the band‚Äôs website as a thank-you present to fans for their support and Symbyosis came 7th best album and 4th best new group in the Hardandheavy (French metal magazine) readers‚Äô referendum. Symbyosis fate changed in September 2001 as Listenable Records did not renew its contract with the group. So in January 2002, Symbyosis launched a new demo still with Tariq, Antoine and Nikos, ‚ÄúLife is a phoenix‚Äù in order to find a new label to sign with. But to no end, so that the band decided to produce and release its next album on its own. As technical and human problems piled up on those linked with the production of the album, the band‚Äôs finances plummeted. Symbyosis was then in a very difficult situation but driven by the support of their families and friends and of some media, the group managed to pull through selling the album on subscription to fans worldwide. This subscription enabled the band to close the necessary budget to the making of the album. About five years after Crisis the new Symbiosis studio album was released, being in the end distributed by Listenable Records / Pias. ‚ÄúOn the wings of Phoenix‚Äù was recorded both in Adima Studio (Paris) and Hidden Association Studios (St Cloud - France) and was out on December 2005. It is a double-album with 24 titles which show the band‚Äôs musical diversity; this was also the opportunity for the band to make references to some of theirs inspirations such as Slayer, Iron Maiden or even pay strong tribute to Napalm Death.

The channel, which is a sister network to Fox Sports Ohio, broadcasts statewide coverage of professional, collegiate and high school sports events throughout northern Ohio, including the Cleveland area. Fox SportsTime Ohio is available from most cable providers in Northeast Ohio and select providers in other portions of Ohio (including Columbus), Northwest Pennsylvania, and extreme Western New York. It is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV, as well as outside Ohio on AT&T; U-verse. History SportsTime Ohio was launched on March 12, 2006; it was founded by the family of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan, becoming the second regional sports network in the Cleveland area, after Fox Sports Ohio (which launched in February 1989 as SportsChannel Ohio). SportsTime Ohio assumed the regional cable television rights to Major League Baseball games involving the Indians from Fox Sports Ohio, which had served as the exclusive local broadcaster of the Indians from 2002 to 2005, when it was majority-owned by Cablevision Systems Corporation (a New York-based company owned by Dolan's brother, Charles) until an asset trade with then-Fox Sports Net parent News Corporation who also owned 20th Century Fox and Fox News. Jim Liberatore, former President of Fox Sports owned Speed Channel helped start the network and served as its first President. His knowledge of the cable industry served a vital role in the success the network enjoyed while so many other team facilitated network launches failed across the country. Starting off as rivals with Gannett-owned WKYC providing studio operations for the cable channel, the two networks would soon become corporate sisters, when on December 3, 2012, the Indians announced that it would sell SportsTime Ohio to Fox Sports Ohio parent Fox Entertainment Group. The deal was finalized four weeks later on December 28. Fox retained SportsTime Ohio's existing staff despite coming under common ownership with Fox Sports Ohio, with Katie Witham becoming a traveling reporter with the team. In April 2013, at the beginning of the 2013 Major League Baseball season, SportsTime Ohio transitioned to the Fox Sports branding and imagery, but maintained the SportsTime Ohio branding (following the model of FSN's similar secondary channels Sun Sports, SportSouth, and Prime Ticket). On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including SportsTime Ohio, sister network Fox Sports Ohio, and Fox's 50% stake in the network's Cincinnati sub-feed. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Holdings) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019, thus putting SportsTime Ohio and Fox Sports Ohio under common ownership with several Sinclair stations in Ohio, which include WSYX/WTTE/WWHO in Columbus, WKRC-TV/WSTR-TV in Cincinnati, WNWO-TV in Toledo, WKEF/WRGT-TV in Dayton, and WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio. The deal will also mark Sinclair's entry into Northeast Ohio, where its nearest existing broadcasting properties are WSYX/WTTE/WWHO, WNWO-TV, WTOV-TV, and WPGH-TV/WPNT in Pittsburgh.

Often referred to as \\"Bƒ´n hu√°\\" among the local Chinese community in Penang. The school provides continuous education, ranging from pre-primary or kindergarten to pre- university studies. History ''' 17 March 1919 Proposal by 4 prominent members of the Hokkien Community‚ÄîMr. Tan Sin Chen, Mr. Lim Lu Tek, Mr. Khor Sen Lee and Mr. Cheah Seng Tin, to establish a school for Chinese girls. This fact still stands as the number of non-Chinese among its enrolment and alumni is next to none. The proposal was [unanimously approved and the Fukien Girls' School was established. Originally, the school was intended to be opened on 15 January 1920, but was delayed due to a number of problems among which were the lack of teachers and pupils. 8 March 1920 Official opening of Fukien Girls' High School at Macalister Road. 11 March 1951 Fukien Girls' School was renamed as the Penang Chinese Girls' High School and the primary school was renamed as the Penang Chinese Girls' Primary School. January 1956 The students attend their classes at the new school building at 2, Gottlieb Road 1962 The school accepted full government aid. As a consequence, the school was divided into 2 sections‚Äîa national-type school and an independent high school (for overaged pupils). 1963 A kindergarten was opened. Thus, the school now provides continuous education from kindergarten to school certificate.

Caseosaurus was a small, lightly-built, bipedal, ground-dwelling carnivore, that could grow up to long. Description The genus Caseosaurus, is known from specimen UMMP 8870, an isolated hip bone that measures nearly 141 mm. A 3D model of this specimen is available on the University of Michigan Online Repository of Fossils. Size estimates suggest that Caseosaurus was at best long and weighed at most. Discovery The genus name Caseosaurus, means \\"Case's lizard\\", and was named in the honor of the scientist who discovered it, Ermine Cowles Case. The Greek suffix \\"-saurus\\" (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ) means \\"lizard\\". The specific name crosbyensis, is a Latinized rendering of Crosby County in Texas, the site of its discovery. Caseosaurus was described and named by A. P. Hunt, Spencer G. Lucas, Andrew B. Heckert, Robert M. Sullivan and Martin Lockley in 1998 and the type species is Caseosaurus crosbyensis.Hunt, A. P., Lucas, S. G., Heckert, A. B., Sullivan, R. M., and Lockley, M. G., 1998, Late Triassic Dinosaurs from the Western United States: Geobios, v. 31, n. 4, p. 511-531. Classification Referred ilium In 1998, Hunt et al., examined UMMP 8870, a partial hip bone (ilium) that was assigned as a paratype of the dinosaur Chindesaurus and made it the holotype of a new dinosaur, Caseosaurus crosbyensis. Irmis et al. concluded that an ilium, NMMNH P-35995 originally assigned by Heckert et al., in 2000 to the dinosaur Eucoelophysis, strongly resembles the Caseosaurus holotype.Irmis, Nesbitt, Padian, Smith, Turner, Woody and Downs, 2007. A Late Triassic dinosauromorph assemblage from New Mexico and the rise of dinosaurs. Science. 317, 358-361. Langer (2004) examined the ilium and reassigned it back to the genus Chindesaurus.Langer, 2004. Basal Saurischia. In Weishampel, Dodson and Osmolska. The Dinosauria Second Edition. University of California Press. 861 pp. Other paleontologists also agree that this may be the same dinosaur as Chindesaurus, which lived during the same period and geological region. However, in 2018 Caseosaurus was considered a valid species, as a relative of Herrerasaurus outside of the Dinosauria. Tawa hallae =Distinguishing anatomical features= According to Hunt et al. (1998), Caseosaurus could be distinguished based on the following features: * a shallow brevis shelf is present on the ilium * a medial longitudinal ridge that is more ventrally placed * a transversely thinner postacetabular blade is present Paleoecology The only specimen of Caseosaurus was discovered in the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, in sediments deposited during the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic period, approximately 235 to 228 million years ago. Caseosaurus's paleoenvironment included the archosaur Tecovasaurus and other early theropod dinosaurs, some of whom left bipedal tracks that were preserved.

It was created by Erik Labs, and was revolutionary for its day. Unlike the predominant protocols of the day (XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM), BiModem allowed BBS users to upload and download files at the same time. This resulted in significant time savings when a 1 megabyte file would take more than an hour to transfer, at 130 to 250 characters per second over a 1200 or 2400 bit/s modem. In addition, it had a chat feature. This would allow the user and the sysop to converse during the upload/download of files. BiModem never received widespread acceptance. It had to be manually patched into both BBS and terminal emulator packages, and it was incompatible with some programs. It was released in the end of 1989, and before it saw widespread use, HS/Link was created which was easily added to BBSes and allowed for file lists and bidirectional transfers. Part of the problem with BiModem is that very few sysops and users wanted to wade through the instructions. To simplify installation, a ZIP file with BiModem and a preconfigured shareware copy of ProComm with a batch file to run BiModem was created. The final version (BiModem 1.25) was released in 1991. In 1995 a program was released in Argentina called BiModem Pro 4.0. This was a user-modified version of BiModem 1.25 with some minor bugfixes.

The Spanish word loma means \\"rise/low hill\\". It was the property of Captain Richard Parks Thomas, a veteran of the Civil WarRichard P. Thomas, 1st Regiment, New York Cavalry and Berkeley businessman. Today, it is entirely a residential area. Although hilly throughout, its average elevation is about 614 feet (187 m). Captain Thomas' home was located on the site of what is today Greenwood Terrace. Some of the large trees here were originally planted by Captain Thomas and managed to survive the devastating fire of 1923 which swept through this part of Berkeley. Thomas enclosed his vast property with a low, whitewashed fence on its north, west and south sides, leaving the east side ‚Äî the upper hillside ‚Äî open. Captain Thomas was the owner of the Standard Soap Company in West Berkeley, president of the California National Bank of San Francisco, and owner of the Berkeley Ferryboat Line. He had a reputation as a friend of the working man and an eccentric character, and was probably the first person who inspired the nickname for the district: \\"Nut Hill\\". An old map includes a notation that he kept an illegal still on his property. He devised a scheme for an aerial tramway running from the Berkeley flatlands to the hills. Every Fourth of July, he fired off an old civil war cannon from \\"Fort La Loma\\", a plaza he constructed up the hill from his home. The site is today occupied by \\"Hume Cloister,\\" also known as \\"Hume Castle\\" on Buena Vista Way, named for Samuel James Hume and his wife, who had architect John Hudson Thomas design a reduced-scale replica of a cloister in Toulouse, France. In the 19th century, a stone quarry was opened at the head of Codornices Creek, abutting the north boundary of the La Loma Park tract. Some of the rock quarried here had a pinkish hue and was used to tint the concrete sidewalks and pathways throughout parts of North Berkeley, a practice that has been maintained by the City to this day, albeit using tint from other sources. The quarry was closed by the 1940s. In the late 1960s the quarry was made into a public park, \\"Glendale-La Loma Park\\". A number of notable people have lived in the La Loma Park/Nut Hill area over the years, including many professors from the University of California, Berkeley, among them, J. Robert Oppenheimer and his nemesis-colleague, Edward Teller. Famed San Francisco Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck made his home here, as well as the homes of several others in the neighborhood, a fact memorialized by Maybeck Twin Drive off of Buena Vista above La Loma. Further up Buena Vista is a structure known as the Temple of the Wings with its Grecian columns, an early 20th-century bohemian hangout. A former public school, Hillside Elementary School is located in the La Loma district on the block bounded by Le Roy Avenue, Buena Vista Way and La Loma Avenue. It is registered as a local historic landmark. The present structure was built after the 1923 fire destroyed its predecessor, located on the southwest corner of Le Roy and Virginia Street. Hillside was closed as a public school both because of a declining school-age population and because it sits immediately adjacent to the Hayward Fault, which runs directly behind it on La Loma Avenue. Upon being subdivided and developed, some residents of the district formed the La Loma Improvement Club. One of their efforts included subsidizing the northward extension of the Euclid Avenue streetcar line from Hilgard to the Berryman Reservoir, which today is adjacent to Codornices Park and the Berkeley Rose Garden.San Francisco Call, 11 February 1910 The Euclid line was first constructed in 1903 as an extension of the Telegraph Avenue streetcar line, and originally terminated at Hilgard and Arch streets.San Francisco Call, 28 December 1902 The extension to the Berryman Reservoir (Rose Street, now Rose Walk) was completed in August 1910.San Francisco Call, 25 August 1910 A subsequent further extension was made in 1912, across Codornices Canyon, by means of a trestle for both streetcar and autos. The line was built to Regal Road and remained active until the end of all streetcar service in 1948.

With the ever-increasing usage of the road due to population increases and the establishment of a country park in Sai Kung, the Hong Kong Government decided to build a new expressway diverging from the junction near Choi Wan Estate, then junctions with Shun Lee Tsuen Road at Shun Lee, then loops back over itself to climb the steep hill and then rejoins the original road at the junction with Anderson Road near Cha Liu Au. The new road was completed in 1980. The loop flyover runs from the hill north of Jordan Valley to Kowloon Peak, and it was the highest bridge in Hong Kong at that time.

Resulting abnormalities include low birth weight, slower growth, mental retardation, deafness, small head size, and malformed bones, cartilage, and joints.Yurdak√∂k, M. 2012, \\"Fetal and neonatal effects of anticoagulants used in pregnancy: a review\\", The Turkish journal of pediatrics, vol. 54, no. 3, pp. 207. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant drug (blood thinner) used to reduce blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, and embolism in people with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, or those who have suffered ischemic stroke.Reid, A., Forrester, C. & Shwe, K. 2009, \\"Warfarin\\", Student BMJ, vol. 17. Warfarin blocks the action of vitamin K, causing an inhibition of blood clotting factors and the pro-bone-building hormone osteocalcin. Warfarin is a teratogen which can cross from the mother to the developing fetus. The inhibition of clotting factors can lead to internal bleeding of the fetus while the inhibition of osteocalcin causes lower bone growth. As well as birth defects, warfarin can induce spontaneous abortion or stillbirth.Hou, J. 2004, \\"Fetal warfarin syndrome\\", Chang Gung medical journal, vol. 27, no. 9, pp. 691. Because of this, warfarin is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Signs and symptoms  The key symptoms, visible at birth, vary between individuals exposed to warfarin in utero. The severity and occurrence of symptoms is dose dependent with higher doses (>5 mg warfarin daily) more likely to cause immediately noticeable defects.Vitale, N., De Feo, M., De Santo, L.S., Pollice, A., Tedesco, N. & Cotrufo, M. 1999, \\"Dose-dependent fetal complications of warfarin in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves\\", Journal of the American College of Cardiology, vol. 33, no. 6, pp. 1637-1641. The period of pregnancy in which warfarin is administered can affect the category of defects which develop. Warfarin taken in the first trimester of pregnancy is more likely to result in physical abnormalities while warfarin taken in the second and third trimester more commonly causes abnormalities of the central nervous system. The more extreme symptoms such as severe mental retardation, blindness and deafness occur more often when warfarin is used throughout all three trimesters. = Growth = Babies born with fetal warfarin syndrome may have a below-average birth weight and do continue to grow at a reduced rate.Starling, L.D., Sinha, A., Boyd, D. & Furck, A. 2012, \\"Fetal warfarin syndrome\\", BMJ case reports, vol. 2012, no. 1, pp. 1-4 = Facial features = Children with fetal warfarin syndrome show many otolaryngological abnormalities consistent with abnormal bone and cartilage growth. Children may present with hypoplasia of the nasal ridge and a deep groove at the midline of the nose, thinned or absent nasal septum,Silveira, D.B., da Rosa, E.B., de Mattos, V.F., Goetze, T.B., Sleifer, P., Santa Maria, F.D., Rosa, R.C.M., Rosa, R.F.M. & Zen, P.R.G. 2015, \\"Importance of a multidisciplinary approach and monitoring in fetal warfarin syndrome\\", American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A, vol. 167, no. 6, pp. 1294-1299. choanal atresia; a narrowing the airway at the posterior nasal cavity, cleft lip and laryngomalacia; large soft protrusions into the larynx. These facial defects and narrowing of the airways often lead to respiratory distress, noisy breathing and later; speech defects. Narrow airways often widen with age and allow for easier breathing. Dental problems are also seen with abnormally large dental buds and late eruption of deciduous teeth. Development of the eyes is also affected by warfarin. Microphthalmia; abnormally small eyes, telecanthus; abnormally far apart eyes and strabismus; misaligned or crossed eyes are common signs of fetal warfarin syndrome. The appearance of an ectopic lacrimal duct, where the tear duct protrudes laterally onto the eye has also been noted. = Bodily features = Whole body skeletal abnormalities are common in fetal warfarin syndrome. A generalized reduction in bone size causes rhizomelia; disproportionally short limbs, brachydactyly; short fingers and toes, a shorter neck, short trunk, scoliosis; abnormal curvature of the spine and stippled epiphyses; malformation of joints. Abnormalities of the chest: either pectus carinatum; a protruding sternum, or pectus excavatum; a sunken sternum form an immediately recognizable sign of fetal warfarin syndrome. Congenital heart defects such as a thinned atrial septum, coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus; a connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta occur in 8% of fetal warfarin syndrome patients. Situs inversus totalis, the complete left-right mirroring of thoracic organs, has also been observed = CNS = Defects of the central nervous system can lead to profound mental challenges. Fetal warfarin syndrome can lead to microcephaly; an abnormally small head, hydrocephaly; increased ventricle size and CSF volume, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. These defects contribute to the appearance of significant mental retardation in 31% of fetal warfarin syndrome cases. Hypotonia, whole body muscle relaxation, can appear in newborns with severe nervous deficits. Atrophy of the optic nerve can also cause blindness in fetal warfarin syndrome.Raghav, S. & Reutens, D. 2006;2007;, \\"Neurological sequelae of intrauterine warfarin exposure\\", Journal of Clinical Neuroscience, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 99-103. = Physiological = Inhibition of coagulation and resultant internal bleeding can cause too few red blood cells to be present in the bloodstream and low blood pressure in newborns with fetal warfarin syndrome. Low hemoglobin levels can lead to partial oxygen starvation, a high level of lactic acid in the bloodstream, and acidosis. Prolonged oozing of fluid from the stump of the cut umbilical cord is common.  Cause  Fetal warfarin syndrome appears in greater than 6% of children whose mothers took warfarin during pregnancy. Warfarin has a low molecular weight so can pass from the maternal to fetal bloodstream through the tight filter-like junctions of the placental barrier. As the teratogenic effects of warfarin are well known, the medication is rarely prescribed to pregnant women. However, for some patients, the risks associated with discontinuing warfarin use may outweigh the risk of embryopathy. Patients with prosthetic heart valves carry a particularly high risk of thrombus formation due to the inorganic surface and turbulent blood flow generated by a mechanical prosthesis. The risk of blood clotting is further increased by generalized hypercoagulability as concentrations of clotting factors rise during pregnancy.Maiello, M., Torella, M., Caserta, L., Caserta, R., Sessa, M., Tagliaferri, A., Bernacchi, M., Napolitano, M., Nappo, C., De Lucia, D. & Panariello, S. 2006, \\"Hypercoagulability during pregnancy: evidences for a thrombophilic state\\", Minerva ginecologica, vol. 58, no. 5, pp. 417. This increased chance of blood clots leads to an increased risk of potentially fatal pulmonary or systemic emboli cutting of blood flow and oxygen to critical organs. Thus, some patients may continue taking warfarin throughout the pregnancy despite the risks to the developing child.  Mechanism  Warfarin‚Äôs ability to cause fetal warfarin syndrome in utero stems from its ability to limit vitamin K activation. Warfarin binds to and blocks the enzyme Vitamin K epoxide reductase which is usually responsible for activating vitamin K during vitamin K recycling. Vitamin K, once activated, is able to add a carboxylic acid group to glutamate residues of certain proteins which assists in correct protein folding.Danziger, J. 2008, \\"Vitamin K-dependent Proteins, Warfarin, and Vascular Calcification\\", Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, vol. 3, no. 5, pp. 1504-1510. Without active vitamin K, a fetus exposed to warfarin is unable to produce large quantities of clotting and bone growth factors. Without vitamin K, clotting factors II, VII, IX and X are unable to be produced. Without these vital parts of the coagulation cascade a durable fibrin plug cannot form to block fluid escaping from damaged or permeable vasculature. Anemia is common in fetuses exposed to warfarin as blood constantly seeps into the interstitial fluid or amniotic cavity. High doses of warfarin and heavy bleeding lead to abortion and stillbirth. Osteocalcin is another protein dependent on vitamin K for correct folding and function. Osteocalcin is normally secreted by osteoblast cells and plays a role in aiding correct bone mineralization and bone maturation.Yamauchi, M., Yamaguchi, T., Nawata, K., Takaoka, S. & Sugimoto, T. 2010, \\"Relationships between undercarboxylated osteocalcin and vitamin K intakes, bone turnover, and bone mineral density in healthy women\\", Clinical Nutrition, vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 761-765. In the presence of warfarin and subsequent absence of vitamin K and active osteocalcin, bone mineralization and growth are stunted.  Prevention  Fetal warfarin syndrome is prevented by withholding prescription to pregnant women or those trying to conceive. As warfarin can remain in the mother‚Äôs body for up to five days,Walfisch, A. & Koren, G. 2010, \\"The \\"Warfarin Window\\" in Pregnancy: The Importance of Half-life\\", Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada, vol. 32, no. 10, pp. 988. warfarin should not be administered in the days leading up to conception. Doctors must take care to ensure women of reproductive age are aware of the risks to the baby should they get pregnant, before prescribing warfarin. For some women, such as those with prosthetic heart valves, anticoagulation medication cannot be suspended during pregnancy as the risk of thrombus and emboli is too high. In such cases an alternate anticoagulant, which cannot pass through the placental barrier to the fetus, is proscribed in place of warfarin. Heparin is one such anticoagulant medication, although its efficacy in patients with prosthetic heart valves is not well established.Loftus, C. (1996). Neurosurgical aspects of pregnancy. Park Ridge, Ill.: American Association of Neurological Surgeons. New anticoagulant medications, which are efficacious and non-teratogenic such as ximelagatran continue to be developed.  Management  = Medication = As well as the routine dose of vitamin K given to newborns after birth, babies born with fetal warfarin syndrome are given additional doses intramuscularly to overcome any remaining warfarin in the circulation and prevent further bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma is also administered to raise concentrations of active blood clotting factors. If the child is anemic from extensive bleeding in-utero, red blood cell concentrate is given to restore oxygen carrying capacity. = Surgical correction = Surgical interventions can be given to improve functionality and correct cosmetic abnormalities. Osteotomy (bone cutting) and zetaplasty surgeries are used to cut away abnormal tissue growths at the piriform aperture around and pharynx to reduce airway obstruction. Rhinoplasty surgery is used to restore normal appearance and function of the nose. Heart surgery may also be required to close a patent ductus arteriosus.

The pertinent fossil remains date back to the early to middle Norian stage, and is widely regarded as the oldest known neotheropod. Description Reconstruction based on Coelophysis Camposaurus is a small, carnivorous, theropod dinosaur. Its approximate length and weight cannot be reliably estimated because of the sparse material that is known from this genus. Camposaurus is known from partial lower leg bones, holotype UCMP 34498 (which includes distal tibiae, distal fibulae, and astragalocalcanea), and other fragmentary material. Like other coelophysids, it has fused tibio-tarsals and fibulo-tarsals. Unlike its relatives, the area of the tibia that fits with the fibula has a distinct ridge at the back. Another unique feature is the lack of a large medial condyle on the astragalus. The type species, C. arizonensis, was formally named and described by Adrian Hunt, Spencer G. Lucas, Andrew B. Heckert, Robert M. Sullivan and Martin Lockley in 1998.A.P. Hunt, S.G. Lucas, A.B. Heckert, R.M. Sullivan and M.G. Lockley, 1998, \\"Late Triassic dinosaurs from the western United States\\", G√©obios 31(4): 511-531 The genus name means \\"Camp's lizard\\", after Charles Lewis Camp. The species name refers to the fact it was found in Arizona, in the United States. Discovery The holotype specimen UCMP 34498 was discovered in the Placerias quarry of the Bluewater Creek Formation of Arizona, from the Norian stage of the Late Triassic period. Classification Camposaurus is considered to be the oldest known neotheropod dinosaur. Camposaurus was originally placed in the clade Ceratosauria based on the analysis of Long and Murray (1995).Long and Murray, 1995. Late Triassic (Carnian and Norian) tetrapods from the Southwestern United States. New Mexico Museum Nat. History Sci. Bull. 4, 1-254. It is morphologically similar to, and was incorrectly considered for some time to be a species of, Coelophysis. In 2000, Downs examined Camposaurus and concluded that it is a junior synonym of Coelophysis, because of its similarity to some of the Coelophysis Ghost Ranch specimens.Downs, 2000. Coelophysis bauri and Syntarsus rhodesiensis compared, with comments on the preparation and preservation of fossils from the Ghost Ranch Coelophysis quarry. in Lucas and Heckert (eds.), 2000. Dinosaurs of New Mexico. NMMNH Bulletin 17. 33-37. The review by Nesbitt et al. in 2007, revealed that a specific feature of the ankle (the ventral astragalar margin) was found to be straight, and is indistinguishable from that of Coelophysis bauri. Based on this Nesbitt et al. (2007) concluded that the two genera were synonymous.Nesbitt, Irmis and Parker, 2007. A critical re-evaluation of the Late Triassic dinosaur taxa of North America. Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 5(2), 209‚Äì243. In 2011, it was entered into a phylogenetic analysis and found to be a close relative of Coelophysis rhodesiensis.

This analysis also demonstrated that Camposaurus is definitely a neotheropod, and based on phylogenetic analysis its closest known relative is Coelophysis rhodesiensis, because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) assigned Camposaurus to the family Coelophysidae.J. A. Spielmann, S. G. Lucas, L. F. Rinehart, A. P. Hunt, A. B. Heckert and R. M. Sullivan. 2007.

Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra and Brusatte (2011), Camposaurus can be distinguished based on the following features: * the caudal ridge of the tibia articular surface on the fibula is prominent, taking the form of a sharp longitudinal ridge, the medial surface having a strongly developed, rostrally bowed, diagonal tuberosity * the astragalus is without a strong cranial projection of the medial condyle of the astragalar body, resulting in a sub- rectangular astragalar body in the distal aspect, and a ventral margin that is incipiently concave in the cranial aspect References Coelophysoids Late Triassic dinosaurs of North America Triassic Arizona Paleontology in Arizona Fossil taxa described in 1998 Taxa named by Spencer G.

Arriving in Japan in the middle of the 16th century, Catholicism was potentially the second contact of Christianity in Japan (with some scholars believing that Nestorian Christianity arrived and retreated centuries earlier), and the only major source of Christianization in Japan until the fall of the shogunate and the Meiji restoration. Christianity was proclaimed initially by the Society of Jesus, joined later on by the less cautious Franciscan order. In 1570 there were 20 Catholic missionaries in Japan. Nagasaki became the center of Japanese Catholicism, and maintained close cultural and religious ties to its Portuguese origins. These ties were severed once Christianity was outlawed; at this point, Catholicism went underground, its rites preserved by the Kakure Kirishitan, or \\"hidden Christians\\", who continued practicing their faith in secret private devotion. A multitude of Japanese Catholics were brutally tortured and killed for their faith, thus becoming martyrs. Many of these martyrs have been canonized, and their liturgical memorial is celebrated each year on February 6 in honor of their fidelity to Christ and his Church unto death. In 1981, Pope John Paul II paid a visit to Japan, during which he met with Japanese people, the clergy, and Catholic lay people, held Holy Mass in the Korakuen Stadium (Tokyo), and visited the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, the Hill of Martyrs in Nagasaki, town of the Immaculate founded by St. Maximilian Kolbe in Nagasaki, and other places.Apostolic Journey to Pakistan, Philippines I, Guam (United States of America II), Japan, Anchorage (United States of America II) (February 16‚Äì27, 1981), Vatican Official Site =Protestantism= James Curtis Hepburn, M.D., LL.D.

History =Missionaries= Although Nestorians possibly arrived in Japan as early as the thirteenth century, the first conclusive appearance of organized Christianity in Japan was the arrival of the Portuguese Catholics in 1549. Spanish missionary Francis Xavier arrived in Japan with three Japanese Catholic converts intending to start a church in Japan. The local Japanese people initially assumed that the foreigners were from India and that Christianity was a new \\"Indian faith\\". These mistaken impressions were due to already existing ties between the Portuguese and India; the Indian city of Goa was a central base for Portuguese India at the time, and a significant portion of the crew on board their ships were Indian Christians. The martyrdom of a Jesuit father in Japan in 1634, engraved by Gerard Bouttats Later on, the Roman Catholic missionary activities were exclusively performed by Jesuits and mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans. Francisco Xavier (a Catholic Saint), Cosme de Torres (a Jesuit priest), and Juan Fern√°ndez were the first who arrived in Kagoshima with hopes to bring Christianity to Japan. Xavier and the Jesuit order was held in good esteem and his efforts seemed to have been rewarded with a thriving community of converts.Gonz√°les, Justo L. (Jan 2004) The Story of Christianity, 3rd edition. Prince Press/Hendrickson Publishers. Volume 1, pages 405‚Äì406 At baptism, these converts were given Portuguese \\"Christian names\\" and encouraged to adopt Western culture. This practice contributed to suspicions that the converts were in reality foreign agents working to subvert social order.In the source, this claim is made of all of Xavier's converts across Asia in general, including but not limited to those in Japan Under Oda Nobunaga, the Jesuits enjoyed the favor of his regency, but the situation began to change once Toyotomi Hideyoshi's suspicions were aroused against Christianity, and later led to the Sakoku Edict of 1635, closing Japan to the outside world for almost 250 years. =Persecution under the Shogunate= Under Hideyoshi and the succeeding Tokugawa shogunate, Catholic Christianity was repressed and adherents were persecuted. During Toyotomi rule especially, foreign missionaries were killed in Japan, some by (Japanese-style) crucifixion; most famously, the twenty-six martyrs of Japan were tortured and crucified on crosses outside Nagasaki to discourage Christianity in 1597. (Hideyoshi nonetheless showed favor to daimy≈ç who had converted, such as Konishi Yukinaga.) Following a brief respite as Tokugawa Ieyasu rose to power and pursued trade with the Portuguese powers, there were further persecutions and martyrdoms in 1613, 1630, 1632 and 1634.June 6th - Servant of God Sebastian Vieira, SJ at Society of Jesus, Singapore By this point, after the Shimabara Rebellion, the remaining Christians had been forced to publicly renounce their faith.

Asteroxylon is considered the most basal member of the Lycopsida.  Description  Asteroxylon is a genus of terrestrial vascular plant which flourished in the Early Devonian period. This plant consisted of aerial, isotomously and anisotomously branching stems that reached 12 mm in diameter and 40 cm in length. The possibly procumbent aerial stems arose from a leaf-less rhizome which bore smaller-diameter, positively geotropic root-like branches. The rhizomes, which represent an independent origin of roots, reached a depth of up to 20 cm below the surface. The xylem or conducting tissue at the center of the aerial stems is distinctly star- shaped in cross-section and has been considered an early actinostele or an \\"Asteroxylon-type\\" protostele. The tracheids are of the primitive annular or helical type (so-called G-type). \\"Leaves\\" ‚Äì not true leaves, but protrusions ‚Äì were of the form of unbranched strap-shaped enations up to 5 mm long; a single vascular trace branched from the main bundle in the centre of the stem to terminate at the base of each enation. Enations and axes bore stomata, indicating that their tissues were capable of photosynthesis. \\"Sporangia, consisting of two kidney-shaped valves, are interspersed among the nonvascularized leaflike appendages and attached to the axis with a short pedicel. The sporangia are curved and lie close to the axis.\\"In their original description, Kidston & Lang thought that some unconnected sporangial branches, similar to those of rhyniophytoids, possibly belonged to Asteroxylon, and in spite of the lack of certainty, many subsequent authors constructed suprageneric taxonomies based on this assumption. The true nature of Asteroxylon sporangia, and of these unconnected sporangia (which were found to belong to Nothia aphylla) were later shown by: . Fertile regions of the axes alternate with sterile regions, suggesting periodic episodes of fertility. Asteroxylon differs from other similar Early Devonian lycopsids such as Drepanophycus and Baragwanathia in that the singular vascular leaf trace in these latter plants extends into the leaf. The leaves of Drepanophycus and Baragwanathia are therefore considered to be true microphylls or, alternatively, small leaves. Species The type species is Asteroxylon mackiei. One other species has been described, Asteroxylon elberfeldense, but this is now considered to be generically distinct and assigned to Thursophyton. A fossil originally named as Asteroxylon setchellii is now considered to be a fern, and is known as Stenokoleos setchellii.

It includes a whole new file transfer protocol, built around the idea of crash recovery, easy of use and great performance. C-Modem provides reliable file transmission even in the worst conditions, as it adapts itself immediately to any errors that may occur (even in the so-called 'error free' modems). Major features of the C-Modem communications protocol include: * Transmission Crash Recovery Being interrupted by any condition, the file transmitted is saved with the extension file .BAD until the last byte is received correctly. In the next connection/transmission, the file will be completed automatically. * Mutable Data : crc blocks on data blocks of variable size Depending on velocity and errors during transmission, as well as line conditions, the size of data- blocks between crc-blocks will freely vary from 32 to 4096 bytes. This reduces the amount of control bytes added to the transmission and minimizes data repetition. The result is an excellent true transfer rate. * Full Duplex The transmitter doesn't stop every block to receive useless answers. The transmitter occurs without pauses between blocks. The receptor only warns when something wrong happens. * Exact Size While not accurate in terms of bits (it rounded up), the file was accurate in terms of bytes, and would have exactly the same size as the original one as it up/downloaded. To its credit, it did not add bytes to complete blocks of fixed size.

It is a supernatural thriller centering on an antique dealer named Hatch Harrison who develops a telepathic connection with a serial killer after a car accident leaves him clinically dead for over eighty minutes. It was made into a film of the same name starring Jeff Goldblum and Alicia Silverstone in 1995. Plot Following a traffic accident that left him clinically dead for more than 80 minutes, a Southern California antique dealer named Hatch Harrison begins experiencing strange dreams and visions that connect him to a psychopathic killer, a young man who calls himself \\"Vassago\\". Vassago believes that he is the human incarnation of one of the demon princes of Hell, and that if he murders enough innocent human beings and offers them up in sacrifice to his Master, he will be allowed to return to the afterlife and rule at Satan's right hand. He also has a strange condition that enables him to see in the dark, but also causes his eyes to be extremely sensitive to light. Meanwhile, the accident gives Hatch and his wife Lindsey, an artist, a new lease on life as they struggle to rebuild their marriage in the wake of their son's death from cancer five years before. As the couple set about trying to adopt a young girl named Regina, Hatch continues to be tormented by visions, in some cases even seeing through the monstrous killer's eyes. Making matters worse, Vassago slowly gains information about Hatch and his family in the same fashion, putting both Lindsay and Regina in danger. It is eventually revealed that Vassago's real name is Jeremy Nyebern; as a teenager, he brutally murdered his mother and sister, then attempted to kill himself. His life was saved by the same doctor who miraculously resuscitated Hatch, Dr. Jonas Nyebern, Jeremy's father (thus facilitating the seemingly supernatural bond between the two characters). Like Hatch, Jeremy was clinically dead for more than 30 minutes, and during that time, believes that he went to hell and was later returned to do Satan's bidding. At the book's climax, Vassago's visions lead him to kidnap Regina and take her to his \\"hideaway\\" (an abandoned amusement park, where, as a boy, Jeremy committed his first murder). There, he is confronted by Hatch, who bludgeons Vassago to death with a crucifix attached to a flashlight, thus saving Regina and Lindsay. During the closing moments of this confrontation, Hatch inexplicably begins speaking in another voice and calls himself \\"Uriel\\" (whom Hatch later learns is an archangel mentioned in the Bible), thus implying that Vassago's beliefs about his demonic heritage and short-lived journey to the afterlife may not have been entirely delusional after all. Uriel/Hatch tells Vassago/Jeremy that instead of returning to hell as a prince, he will be returned as a slave. After Vassago's defeat, the Harrison family strengthen their bond to each other, with Regina insisting on calling her adoptive parents Mom and Dad. Film adaptation The novel was adapted into a feature film by Brett Leonard in 1995. It starred Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone and Jeremy Sisto. Apparently Dean Koontz was so disappointed in the film he fought to have his name removed from the credits.Kempley, Rita. Hideaway, The Washington Post, March 4, 1995, accessed March 21, 2007.

It is loosely based on the comic of the same name by Daniel Clowes. The film is Zwigoff's second collaboration with Clowes, the first being 2001's Ghost World (which was also released by United Artists). The film was partially shot at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles and at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California. Otis Foundation Professor Gary Garaths worked as a consultant on the film. Plot Starting from childhood attempts at illustration, young Jerome pursues his true obsession to art school. Jerome enrolls in Strathmore, an urban college. His roommates are aspiring filmmaker Vince and closeted-gay fashion major Matthew. Jerome looks for love amongst the coeds, but is turned off by them all, before falling in love with the art model, Audrey. In his art classes, he forms a friendship with perennial loser, Bardo, who guides him through the college scene and introduces him to a failed artist, Jimmy, a belligerent drunk. As Jerome learns how the art world really works, he finds that he must adapt his vision to the reality that confronts him. The community has been wracked by a serial killer, the Strathmore Strangler, who has confounded the police. As Jerome slowly loses his idealism at art school, he finds himself in competition with a strange newcomer, Jonah (an undercover detective), both for Audrey's affection and for artistic recognition. In a wild attempt to win a prestigious art competition, Jerome asks for, and gets, Jimmy's paintings, all of which are of the Strangler's victims. Jerome leaves a lit cigarette in Jimmy's apartment by accident, setting a fire and burning up the apartment and Jimmy. The police arrest Jerome as the Strangler (who in fact was Jimmy); Audrey realizes that her true love is Jerome and that she was stupid to be in love with Jonah (who is actually married); and Jerome is sent to prison. Jerome's paintings, especially one of Audrey, become prized by collectors; Vince scores a huge hit with his documentary of the Strangler called My Roommate: The Murderer. In prison, Jerome continues to paint and sells his works at high prices, not caring that people think he is the killer, while all the while Audrey is still in love with him. At the end, Audrey and Jerome share a kiss through the protective glass.

The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Art School [Confidential]s misanthropy is too sour, its targets too flat and clich√©d, and Clowes and Zwigoff stumble when trying to build a story around the premise.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 54 based on 42 reviews.

He demonstrated the first semiconductor laser and invented a type of magnetron commonly used in microwave ovens. He also contributed to the development of rectifiers for power transmission. Biography Robert N. Hall was born on December 25, 1919 in New Haven, Connecticut. He was first inspired by his inventor uncle, who showed him the wonders of small inventions and experimentation. After long studies at his local library, Hall decided to attempt controlled experiments of his own with his mother's approval. He built an 8-inch telescope, which produced a close-up view of Saturn. Later on, an interviewer from California Tech visited him and offered a scholarship to attend the university. Hall studied at California Institute of Technology for three years but had to leave for financial reasons. After working at Lockheed Aircraft as a tester, he returned to Caltech to finish up his studies and obtain his physics degree. Then General Electric hired him as a test engineer at Schenectady, NY. After four years at G.E., under the advice of Harper North, Hall obtained a Research Council Fellowship and returned to Caltech. He graduated in 1948 with his Ph.D. and returned to G.E. Schenectady research labs that summer. While at G.E. during World War II, he developed a magnetron for radar jamming, which led to the development of the microwave oven. While studying the characteristics of p-i-n diodes used as power rectifiers, Hall had a key insight, which resulted in his being co-credited with William Shockley and W. T. Read, Jr., for the analysis of nonradiative carrier recombination in semiconductors. Hall developed the semiconductor laser in 1962, while working at General Electric in Schenectady, New York. In the 1970s, Hall's work focused on photovoltaics and solar cells. He retired in 1987, having been granted 43 U.S. patents during his career. Hall was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1977 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1994.

Scorched follows the story of several disgruntled bank employees who all try to rob the same bank on the same night without knowing that others are doing exactly the same thing. The film had a very poor financial performance at the box office. From the initial budget of US $7 million, Scorched earned back only $8,000 at the end of its theatrical run. It was pulled from its theatrical run after just one weekend in the theaters where it managed to earn a meager $666 per theater. Plot Sheila Rilo (Silverstone) is a bank teller at Desert Savings Bank in a small desert town. Her boyfriend is Rick Becker (Joshua Leonard), the bank manager who was informed by his superiors that he would be fired if the bank's ATMs were to be robbed just one more time. Sheila and Rick have spent several years in an on-again off-again relationship, in which he uses her between other flings. After Sheila pays for most of Rick's education, he leaves her for his tutor. Sheila decides to exact revenge on Rick by robbing the bank and getting him fired. On the same night, Stuart (Paulo Costanzo) and Jason (Woody Harrelson), two other tellers from the same bank, have also decided to rob the bank. Stuart's plan is to steal $250,000 from the bank and bet the entire amount on one game of roulette in Las Vegas. Stuart, who is desperate for excitement in his life, is following the suggestion of his friend Max (David Krumholtz), even though the intelligent Stuart usually talks Max out of his hare-brained get-rich-quick schemes. Jason is a nature lover who lives with an orphaned duck. He was promoted to assistant bank manager, a position with much more responsibility but only a $0.55 per hour raise. He feels the bank owes him for years of loyal and underpaid service and he decides to get even by robbing the safety deposit box of a mean-spirited local millionaire, Charles Merchant (Cleese). Merchant, who got rich from making infomercials and selling videotapes on how to get rich quickly on the real estate market, is the person that shot Jason's duck's mother, therefore making easier Jason's decision to rob Merchant's safety deposit box. Jason is not the only one with a plan for revenge against the local tycoon. A disgruntled clothing store employee, Shmally (Cook), takes her revenge against Merchant the same night by having Carter (Marcus Thomas) help her throw eggs at Merchant's home. Carter Doleman is Shmally's friend and roommate and the bank's newest employee. Due to his inability to dress well and his lack of ability to get a job on his own, Shmally agreed to help him. When Carter was called for an interview at the bank, Shmally gave Carter a make-over, dressed him up properly and coached him on how to pass the interview. Anxious and excited about starting his first day of work, hesitant Carter lets himself be dragged out of bed by Shmally so that he can help her egg Merchant's house.

The mirror handle and the shabti were found in a pyramid at Nuri (Nu. 15), which was obviously his burial place. He was the last Kushite king to be buried in the royal cemetery at Napata. The 1.63 m high granite stela was found at New Dongola and is now in the Berlin Museum Inv. no. 2268. Originally it was most likely placed in the Amun temple of Jebel Barkal. In the upper part appear the pictures and name of his mother, Pelkha and his wife, Sekhmakh, next to the king. The tomb of Nastasen is among several in Nuri that are slated for excavation by archaeologists using underwater archaeological methods. That is necessary because of rising ground waters in what was the Nubian region of Ancient Egypt.Romey, Kristin, Dive beneath the pyramids of Egypt‚Äôs black pharaohs, National Geographic, July 2, 2019 These tombs are under the pyramids and have flooded. Initial excavation reports of his tomb indicate that, essentially, it may be undisturbed by robbers. Expectations exist that artifacts not adversely affected by the water, will be found so more will be known about Nastasen from what is discovered along with tantalizing evidence already found, of artifacts mostly damaged or lost due to the action of the water. During his reign, Nastasen defeated an invasion of Kush from Upper Egypt. Nastasen's monument calls the leader of this invasion Kambasuten, a likely local variation of Khabbash. Khabbash was a local ruler of Upper Egypt who had campaigned against the Persians around 338 BC.

It is linked to ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and with Medieval Western Christendom which emerged from the Middle Ages to experience such transformative episodes as the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, scientific revolution, and the development of liberal democracy. The civilizations of Classical Greece and Ancient Rome are considered seminal periods in Western history; a few cultural contributions also emerged from the pagan peoples of pre-Christian Europe, such as the Celts and Germans, as well as some significant religious contributions derived from Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism stemming back to Second Temple Judea, Galilee, and the early Jewish diaspora; and some other Middle Eastern influences. Western Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization, which throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture. (There were Christians outside of the West, such as China, India, Russia, Byzantium and the Middle East).Roman Catholicism, \\"Roman Catholicism, Christian church that has been the decisive spiritual force in the history of Western civilization\\".

The Church in fact built Western civilization.\\" Western civilization has spread to produce the dominant cultures of modern Americas and Oceania, and has had immense global influence in recent centuries in many ways. Following the 5th century Fall of Rome, Europe entered the Middle Ages, during which period the Catholic Church filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fall of the Western Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine Empire) endured in the East for centuries, becoming a Hellenic Eastern contrast to the Latin West. By the 12th century, Western Europe was experiencing a flowering of art and learning, propelled by the construction of cathedrals, the establishment of medieval universities, and greater contact with the medieval Islamic world via Al- Andalus and Sicily, from where Arabic texts on science and philosophy were translated into Latin. Christian unity was shattered by the Reformation from the 16th century. A merchant class grew out of city states, initially in the Italian peninsula (see Italian city-states), and Europe experienced the Renaissance from the 14th to the 17th century, heralding an age of technological and artistic advance and ushering in the Age of Discovery which saw the rise of such global European Empires as those of Spain and Portugal. The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century. Under the influence of the Enlightenment, the Age of Revolution emerged from the United States and France as part of the transformation of the West into its industrialised, democratised modern form. The lands of North and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand became first part of European Empires and then home to new Western nations, while Africa and Asia were largely carved up between Western powers. Laboratories of Western democracy were founded in Britain's colonies in Australasia from the mid-19th centuries, while South America largely created new autocracies. In the 20th century, absolute monarchy disappeared from Europe, and despite episodes of Fascism and Communism, by the close of the century, virtually all of Europe was electing its leaders democratically. Most Western nations were heavily involved in the First and Second World Wars and protracted Cold War. World War II saw Fascism defeated in Europe, and the emergence of the United States and Soviet Union as rival global powers and a new \\"East-West\\" political contrast. Other than in Russia, the European Empires disintegrated after World War II and civil rights movements and widescale multi-ethnic, multi-faith migrations to Europe, the Americas and Oceania lowered the earlier predominance of ethnic Europeans in Western culture. European nations moved towards greater economic and political co-operation through the European Union. The Cold War ended around 1990 with the collapse of Soviet-imposed Communism in Central and Eastern Europe. In the 21st century, the Western World retains significant global economic power and influence. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of Catholicism, Protestantism, democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to abolish slavery during the 19th century, the first to enfranchise women (beginning in Australasia at the end of the 19th century) and the first to put to use such technologies as steam, electric and nuclear power. The West invented cinema, television, the personal computer and the Internet; produced artists such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Bach, and Mozart; developed sports such as soccer, cricket, golf, tennis, rugby and basketball; and transported humans to an astronomical object for the first time with the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon Landing. Antiquity: before AD 500 The Middle Ages =Early Middle Ages: 500‚Äì1000= While the Roman Empire and Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the Byzantine Empire centered at Constantinople in the East, Western civilization suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476. Gradually however, the Christian religion re-asserted its influence over Western Europe. The Book of Kells. Danish seamen, painted mid-12th century. The Viking Age saw Norseman explore, raid, conquer and trade through wide areas of the West. After the Fall of Rome, the papacy served as a source of authority and continuity. In the absence of a magister militum living in Rome, even the control of military matters fell to the pope. Gregory the Great (c 540‚Äì604) administered the church with strict reform. A trained Roman lawyer and administrator, and a monk, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook and was a father of many of the structures of the later Roman Catholic Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, he looked upon Church and State as co-operating to form a united whole, which acted in two distinct spheres, ecclesiastical and secular, but by the time of his death, the papacy was the great power in Italy: According to tradition, it was a Romanized Briton, Saint Patrick who introduced Christianity to Ireland around the 5th century. Roman legions had never conquered Ireland, and as the Western Roman Empire collapsed, Christianity managed to survive there. Monks sought out refuge at the far fringes of the known world: like Cornwall, Ireland, or the Hebrides. Disciplined scholarship carried on in isolated outposts like Skellig Michael in Ireland, where literate monks became some of the last preservers in Western Europe of the poetic and philosophical works of Western antiquity. By around 800 they were producing illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells. The missions of Gaelic monasteries led by monks like St Columba spread Christianity back into Western Europe during the Middle Ages, establishing monasteries initially in northern Britain, then through Anglo-Saxon England and the Frankish Empire during the Middle Ages. Thomas Cahill, in his 1995 book How the Irish Saved Civilization, credited Irish Monks with having \\"saved\\" Western Civilization during this period.How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe by Thomas Cahill, 1995. According to art historian Kenneth Clark, for some five centuries after the fall of Rome, virtually all men of intellect joined the Church and practically nobody in western Europe outside of monastic settlements had the ability to read or write. Around AD 500, Clovis I, the King of the Franks, became a Christian and united Gaul under his rule. Later in the 6th century, the Byzantine Empire restored its rule in much of Italy and Spain. Missionaries sent from Ireland by the Pope helped to convert England to Christianity in the 6th century as well, restoring that faith as the dominant in Western Europe. Muhammed, the founder and Prophet of Islam was born in Mecca in AD 570. Working as a trader he encountered the ideas of Christianity and Judaism on the fringes of the Byzantine Empire, and around 610 began preaching of a new monotheistic religion, Islam, and in 622 became the civil and spiritual leader of Medina, soon after conquering Mecca in 630. Dying in 632, Muhammed's new creed conquered first the Arabian tribes, then the great Byzantine cities of Damascus in 635 and Jerusalem in 636. A multiethnic Islamic empire was established across the formerly Roman Middle East and North Africa. By the early 8th century, Iberia and Sicily had fallen to the Muslims. By the 9th century, Malta, Cyprus, and Crete had fallen ‚Äì and for a time the region of Septimania.Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004 Only in 732 was the Muslim advance into Europe stopped by the Frankish leader Charles Martel, saving Gaul and the rest of the West from conquest by Islam. From this time, the \\"West\\" became synonymous with Christendom, the territory ruled by Christian powers, as Oriental Christianity fell to dhimmi status under the Muslim Caliphates. The cause to liberate the \\"Holy Land\\" remained a major focus throughout medieval history, fueling many consecutive crusades, only the first of which was successful (although it resulted in many atrocities, in Europe as well as elsewhere). Charlemagne (\\"Charles the Great\\" in English) became king of the Franks. He conquered Gaul (modern day France), northern Spain, Saxony, and northern and central Italy. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Holy Roman Emperor. Under his rule, his subjects in non- Christian lands like Germany converted to Christianity. A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom After his reign, the empire he created broke apart into the kingdom of France (from Francia meaning \\"land of the Franks\\"), Holy Roman Empire and the kingdom in between (containing modern day Switzerland, northern-Italy, Eastern France and the low-countries). Starting in the late 8th century, the Vikings began seaborne attacks on the towns and villages of Europe. Eventually, they turned from raiding to conquest, and conquered Ireland, most of England, and northern France (Normandy). These conquests were not long-lasting, however. In 954 Alfred the Great drove the Vikings out of England, which he united under his rule, and Viking rule in Ireland ended as well. In Normandy the Vikings adopted French culture and language, became Christians and were absorbed into the native population. By the beginning of the 11th century Scandinavia was divided into three kingdoms, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, all of which were Christian and part of Western civilization. Norse explorers reached Iceland, Greenland, and even North America, however only Iceland was permanently settled by the Norse. A period of warm temperatures from around 1000‚Äì1200 enabled the establishment of a Norse outpost in Greenland in 985, which survived for some 400 years as the most westerly outpost of Christendom. From here, Norseman attempted their short-lived European colony in North America, five centuries before Columbus. In the 10th century another marauding group of warriors swept through Europe, the Magyars. They eventually settled in what is today Hungary, converted to Christianity and became the ancestors of the Hungarian people. A West Slavic people, the Poles, formed a unified state by the 10th century and having adopted Christianity also in the 10th centuryDavies, N. God's Playground A History of Poland Volume 1 Clarendon, 1986 Page 4Zamoyski, A. The Polish Way John Murray, 1989 Page 10 but with pagan rising in the 11th century. By the start of the second millennium AD, the West had become divided linguistically into three major groups. The Romance languages, based on Latin, the language of the Romans, the Germanic languages, and the Celtic languages. The most widely spoken Romance languages were French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Four widely spoken Germanic languages were English, German, Dutch, and Danish. Irish and Scots Gaelic were two widely spoken Celtic languages in the British Isles. =High Middle Ages: 1000‚Äì1300= The Mongol invasion of Rus': Sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan (1238). From the medieval Russian annals. Art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Western Europe's first \\"great age of civilisation\\" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote: \\"every branch of life ‚Äî action, philosophy, organisation, technology [experienced an] extraordinary outpouring of energy, an intensification of existence\\". Upon this period rests the foundations of many of Europe's subsequent achievements. By Clark's account, the Catholic Church was very powerful, essentially internationalist and democratic in it structures and run by monastic organisations generally following Benedictine rule. Men of intelligence usually joined religious orders and those of intellectual, administrative or diplomatic skill could advance beyond the usual restraints of society ‚Äì leading churchmen from faraway lands were accepted in local bishoprics, linking European thought across wide distances. Complexes like the Abbey of Cluny became vibrant centres with dependencies spread throughout Europe. Ordinary people also treked vast distances on pilgrimages to express their piety and pray at the site of holy relics. Monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living. Abbot Suger of the Abbey of St. Denis is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: \\"The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material\\". Clark calls this \\"the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today\\". By the year 1000 feudalism had become the dominant social, economic and political system. At the top of society was the monarch, who gave land to nobles in exchange for loyalty. The nobles gave land to vassals, who served as knights to defend their monarch or noble. Under the vassals were the peasants or serfs. The feudal system thrived as long as peasants needed protection by the nobility from invasions originating inside and outside of Europe. So as the 11th century progressed, the feudal system declined along with the threat of invasion. The Abbey of St. Denis, France. Abbot Suger of this Abbey was an early patron of the extraordinary artistic achievements of the epoch. Barons forced King John of England to sign the Magna Carta laying early foundations for the evolution of constitutional monarchy. Saint Thomas Aquinas was one of the most influential scholars of the Medieval period. In 1054, after centuries of strained relations, the Great Schism occurred over differences in doctrine, splitting the Christian world between the Catholic Church, centered in Rome and dominant in the West, and the Orthodox Church, centered in Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. The last pagan land in Europe was converted to Christianity with the conversion of the Baltic peoples in the High Middle Ages, bringing them into Western civilization as well. As the Medieval period progressed, the aristocratic military ideal of Chivalry and institution of knighthood based around courtesy and service to others became culturally important. Large Gothic cathedrals of extraordinary artistic and architectural intricacy were constructed throughout Europe, including Canterbury Cathedral in England, Cologne Cathedral in Germany and Chartres Cathedral in France (called the \\"epitome of the first great awakening in European civilisation\\" by Kenneth ClarkKenneth Clark; Civilisation, BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.). The period produced ever more extravagant art and architecture, but also the virtuous simplicity of such as St Francis of Assisi (expressed in the Prayer of St Francis) and the epic poetry of Dante's Divine Comedy. As the Church grew more powerful and wealthy, many sought reform. The Dominican and Franciscan Orders were founded, which emphasized poverty and spirituality. Women were in many respects excluded from political and mercantile life, however, leading churchwomen were an exception. Medieval abbesses and female superiors of monastic houses were powerful figures whose influence could rival that of male bishops and abbots: \\"They treated with kings, bishops, and the greatest lords on terms of perfect equality;. . . they were present at all great religious and national solemnities, at the dedication of churches, and even, like the queens, took part in the deliberation of the national assemblies...\\". The increasing popularity of devotion to the Virgin Mary (the mother of Jesus) secured maternal virtue as a central cultural theme of Catholic Europe. Kenneth Clark wrote that the 'Cult of the Virgin' in the early 12th century \\"had taught a race of tough and ruthless barbarians the virtues of tenderness and compassion\\". In 1095, Pope Urban II called for a Crusade to re-conquer the Holy Land from Muslim rule, when the Seljuk Turks prevented Christians from visiting the holy sites there. For centuries prior to the emergence of Islam, Asia Minor and much of the Mid East had been a part of the Roman and later Byzantine Empires. The Crusades were originally launched in response to a call from the Byzantine Emperor for help to fight the expansion of the Turks into Anatolia. The First Crusade succeeded in its task, but at a serious cost on the home front, and the crusaders established rule over the Holy Land. However, Muslim forces reconquered the land by the 13th century, and subsequent crusades were not very successful. The specific crusades to restore Christian control of the Holy Land were fought over a period of nearly 200 years, between 1095 and 1291. Other campaigns in Spain and Portugal (the Reconquista), and Northern Crusades continued into the 15th century. The Crusades had major far-reaching political, economic, and social impacts on Europe. They further served to alienate Eastern and Western Christendom from each other and ultimately failed to prevent the march of the Turks into Europe through the Balkans and the Caucasus. After the fall of the Roman Empire, many of the classical Greek texts were translated into Arabic and preserved in the medieval Islamic world, from where the Greek classics along with Arabic science and philosophy were transmitted to Western Europe and translated into Latin during the Renaissance of the 12th century and 13th century.George Sarton: A Guide to the History of Science Waltham Mass. U.S.A. 1952Burnett, Charles. \\"The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century,\\" Science in Context, 14 (2001): 249‚Äì288. Cathedral schools began in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education, some of them ultimately evolving into medieval universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation; and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research The Italian University of Bologna is considered the oldest continually operating university. Philosophy in the High Middle Ages focused on religious topics. Christian Platonism, which modified Plato's idea of the separation between the ideal world of the forms and the imperfect world of their physical manifestations to the Christian division between the imperfect body and the higher soul was at first the dominant school of thought. However, in the 12th century the works of Aristotle were reintroduced to the West, which resulted in a new school of inquiry known as scholasticism, which emphasized scientific observation. Two important philosophers of this period were Saint Anselm and Saint Thomas Aquinas, both of whom were concerned with proving God's existence through philosophical means. The Summa Theologica by Aquinas was one of the most influential documents in medieval philosophy and Thomism continues to be studied today in philosophy classes. Theologian Peter Abelard wrote in 1122 \\"I must understand in order that I may believe... by doubting we come to questioning, and by questioning we perceive the truth\\". In Normandy, the Vikings adopted French culture and language, mixed with the native population of mostly Frankish and Gallo-Roman stock and became known as the Normans. They played a major political, military, and cultural role in medieval Europe and even the Near East. They were famed for their martial spirit and Christian piety. They quickly adopted the Romance language of the land they settled off, their dialect becoming known as Norman, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was one of the great large fiefs of medieval France. The Normans are famed both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture, and their musical traditions, as well as for their military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers established a kingdom in Sicily and southern Italy by conquest, and a Norman expedition on behalf of their duke led to the Norman Conquest of England. Norman influence spread from these new centres to the Crusader States in the Near East, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, and to Ireland. Relations between the major powers in Western society: the nobility, monarchy and clergy, sometimes produced conflict. If a monarch attempted to challenge church power, condemnation from the church could mean a total loss of support among the nobles, peasants, and other monarchs. Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, one of the most powerful men of the 11th century, stood three days bare-headed in the snow at Canossa in 1077, in order to reverse his excommunication by Pope Gregory VII. As monarchies centralized their power as the Middle Ages progressed, nobles tried to maintain their own authority. The sophisticated Court of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II was based in Sicily, where Norman, Byzantine, and Islamic civilization had intermingled. His realm stretched through Southern Italy, through Germany and in 1229, he crowned himself King of Jerusalem. His reign saw tension and rivalry with the Papacy over control of Northern Italy. A patron of education, Frederick founded the University of Naples. Plantagenet kings first ruled the Kingdom of England in the 12th century. Henry V left his mark with a famous victory against larger numbers at the Battle of Agincourt, while Richard the Lionheart, who had earlier distinguished himself in the Third Crusade, was later romanticised as an iconic figure in English folklore. A distinctive English culture emerged under the Plantagenets, encouraged by some of the monarchs who were patrons of the \\"father of English poetry\\", Geoffrey Chaucer. The Gothic architecture style was popular during the time, with buildings such as Westminster Abbey remodelled in that style. King John's sealing of the Magna Carta was influential in the development of common law and constitutional law. The 1215 Charter required the King to proclaim certain liberties, and accept that his will was not arbitrary ‚Äî for example by explicitly accepting that no \\"freeman\\" (non-serf) could be punished except through the law of the land, a right which is still in existence today. Political institutions such as the Parliament of England and the Model Parliament originate from the Plantagenet period, as do educational institutions including the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. From the 12th century onward inventiveness had re-asserted itself outside of the Viking north and the Islamic south of Europe. Universities flourished, mining of coal commenced, and crucial technological advances such as the lock, which enabled sail ships to reach the thriving Belgian city of Bruges via canals, and the deep sea ship guided by magnetic compass and rudder were invented. =Late Middle Ages: 1300‚Äì1500= Christopher Columbus Saint Joan of Arc The siege of Constantinople in 1453 (contemporary miniature) A cooling in temperatures after about 1150 saw leaner harvests across Europe and consequent shortages of food and flax material for clothing. Famines increased and in 1316 serious famine gripped Ypres. In 1410, the last of the Greenland Norseman abandoned their colony to the ice. From Central Asia, Mongol invasions progressed towards Europe throughout the 13th century, resulting in the vast Mongol Empire which became largest empire of history and ruled over almost half of human population and expanded through the world by 1300. The Papacy had its court at Avignon from 1305 to 1378Morris, Colin, The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 , (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271. This arose from the conflict between the Papacy and the French crown. A total of seven popes reigned at Avignon; all were French, and all were increasingly under the influence of the French crown. Finally in 1377 Gregory XI, in part because of the entreaties of the mystic Saint Catherine of Sienna, restored the Holy See to Rome, officially ending the Avignon papacy. However, in 1378 the breakdown in relations between the cardinals and Gregory's successor, Urban VI, gave rise to the Western Schism ‚Äî which saw another line of Avignon Popes set up as rivals to Rome (subsequent Catholic history does not grant them legitimacy). The period helped weaken the prestige of the Papacy in the buildup to the Protestant Reformation. In the Later Middle Ages the Black Plague struck Europe, arriving in 1348. Europe was overwhelmed by the outbreak of bubonic plague, probably brought to Europe by the Mongols. The fleas hosted by rats carried the disease and it devastated Europe. Major cities like Paris, Hamburg, Venice and Florence lost half their population. Around 20 million people ‚Äì up to a third of Europe's population ‚Äì died from the plague before it receded. The plague periodically returned over coming centuries. The last centuries of the Middle Ages saw the waging of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. The war began in 1337 when the king of France laid claim to English-ruled Gascony in southern France, and the king of England claimed to be the rightful king of France. At first, the English conquered half of France and seemed likely to win the war, until the French were rallied by a peasant girl, who would later become a saint, Joan of Arc. Although she was captured and executed by the English, the French fought on and won the war in 1453. After the war, France gained all of Normandy excluding the city of Calais, which it gained in 1558. Following the Mongols from Central Asia came the Ottoman Turks. By 1400 they had captured most of modern-day Turkey and extended their rule into Europe through the Balkans and as far as the Danube, surrounding even the fabled city of Constantinople. Finally, in 1453, one of Europe's greatest cities fell to the Turks. The Ottomans under the command of Sultan Mehmed II, fought a vastly outnumbered defending army commanded by Emperor Constantine XI ‚Äî the last \\"Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire\\" ‚Äî and blasted down the ancient walls with the terrifying new weaponry of the canon. The Ottoman conquests sent refugee Greek scholars westward, contributing to the revival of the West's knowledge of the learning of Classical Antiquity. Probably the first clock in Europe was installed in a Milan church in 1335, hinting at the dawning mechanical age. By the 14th century, the middle class in Europe had grown in influence and number as the feudal system declined. This spurred the growth of towns and cities in the West and improved the economy of Europe. This, in turn helped begin a cultural movement in the West known as the Renaissance, which began in Italy. Italy was dominated by city- states, many of which were nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, and were ruled by wealthy aristocrats like the Medicis, or in some cases, by the pope.

Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, founder of modern political science and ethics William Shakespeare's First Folio The Renaissance, originating from Italy, ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. The merchant cities of Florence, Genoa, Ghent, Nuremberg, Geneva, Z√ºrich, Lisbon and Seville provided patrons of the arts and sciences and unleashed a flurry of activity. The Medici became the leading family of Florence and fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, and the Gonzaga of Mantua. Greatest artists like Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Giotto, Donatello, Titian and Raphael produced inspired works ‚Äì their paintwork was more realistic- looking than had been created by Medieval artists and their marble statues rivalled and sometimes surpassed those of Classical Antiquity. Michelangelo carved his masterpiece David from marble between 1501 and 1504. Humanist historian Leonardo Bruni, split the history in the antiquity, Middle Ages and modern period. Churches began being built in the Romanesque style for the first time in centuries. While art and architecture flourished in Italy and then the Netherlands, religious reformers flowered in Germany and Switzerland; printing was establishing itself in the Rhineland and navigators were embarking on extraordinary voyages of discovery from Portugal and Spain. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. Secular thinkers like Machiavelli re-examined the history of Rome to draw lessons for civic governance. Theologians revisited the works of St Augustine. Important thinkers of the Renaissance in Northern Europe included the Catholic humanists Desiderius Erasmus, a Dutch theologian, and the English statesman and philosopher Thomas More, who wrote the seminal work Utopia in 1516. Humanism was an important development to emerge from the Renaissance. It placed importance on the study of human nature and worldly topics rather than religious ones. Important humanists of the time included the writers Petrarch and Boccaccio, who wrote in both Latin as had been done in the Middle Ages, as well as the vernacular, in their case Tuscan Italian. As the calendar reached the year 1500, Europe was blossoming ‚Äì with Leonardo da Vinci painting his Mona Lisa portrait not long after Christopher Columbus reached the Americas (1492), Amerigo Vespucci proofed that America is not a part of India and hence the new world derived from his name, the Portuguese navigator Vasco Da Gama sailed around Africa into the Indian Ocean and Michelangelo completed his paintings of Old Testament themes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (the expense of such artistic exuberance did much to spur the likes of Martin Luther in Northern Europe in their protests against the Church of Rome). For the first time in European history, events North of the Alps and on the Atlantic Coast were taking centre stage. Important artists of this period included Bosch, D√ºrer, and Breugel. In Spain Miguel de Cervantes wrote the novel Don Quixote, other important works of literature in this period were the Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer and Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory. The most famous playwright of the era was the Englishman William Shakespeare whose sonnets and plays (including Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth) are considered some of the finest works ever written in the English language. Meanwhile, the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia continued their centuries-long fight to reconquer the peninsula from its Muslim rulers. In 1492, the last Islamic stronghold, Granada, fell, and Iberia was divided between the Christian kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Iberia's Jewish and Muslim minorities were forced to convert to Catholicism or be exiled. The Portuguese immediately looked to expand outward sending expeditions to explore the coasts of Africa and engage in trade with the mostly Muslim powers on the Indian Ocean, making Portugal wealthy. In 1492, a Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus found the Americas during an attempt to find a western route to East Asia. From the East, however, the Ottoman Turks under Suleiman the Magnificent continued their advance into the heart of Christian Europe ‚Äî besieging Vienna in 1529. The 16th century saw the flowering of the Renaissance in the rest of the West. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus deduced that the geocentric model of the universe was incorrect, and that in fact the planets revolve around the sun. In the Netherlands, the invention of the telescope and the microscope resulted in the investigation of the universe and the microscopic world. The father of modern science Galileo and Christiaan Huygens developed more advance telescopes and used these in their scientific research. The father of microbiology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek pioneered the use of the microscope in the study of microbes and established microbiology as a scientific discipline. Advances in medicine and understanding of the human anatomy also increased in this time. Gerolamo Cardano partially invented several machines and introduced essential mathematics theories. In England, Sir Isaac Newton pioneered the science of physics. These events led to the so-called scientific revolution, which emphasized experimentation. =The Reformation: 1500‚Äì1650= Martin Luther, Protestant Reformer Saint Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits and a leader of the Counter-Reformation. The other major movement in the West in the 16th century was the Reformation, which would profoundly change the West and end its religious unity. The Reformation began in 1517 when the Catholic monk Martin Luther wrote his 95 Theses, which denounced the wealth and corruption of the church, as well as many Catholic beliefs, including the institution of the papacy and the belief that, in addition to faith in Christ, \\"good works\\" were also necessary for salvation. Luther drew on the beliefs of earlier church critics, like the Bohemian Jan Hus and the Englishman John Wycliffe. Luther's beliefs eventually ended in his excommunication from the Catholic Church and the founding of a church based on his teachings: the Lutheran Church, which became the majority religion in northern Germany. Soon other reformers emerged, and their followers became known as Protestants. In 1525, Ducal Prussia became the first Lutheran state. In the 1540s the Frenchman John Calvin founded a church in Geneva which forbade alcohol and dancing, and which taught God had selected those destined to be saved from the beginning of time. His Calvinist Church gained about half of Switzerland and churches based on his teachings became dominant in the Netherlands (the Dutch Reformed Church) and Scotland (the Presbyterian Church). In England, when the Pope failed to grant King Henry VIII a divorce, he declared himself head of the Church in England (founding what would evolve into today's Church of England and Anglican Communion). Some Englishmen felt the church was still too similar to the Catholic Church and formed the more radical Puritanism. Many other small Protestant sects were formed, including Zwinglianism, Anabaptism and Mennonism. Although they were different in many ways, Protestants generally called their religious leaders ministers instead of priests, and believed only the Bible, and not Tradition offered divine revelation. Britain and the Dutch Republic allowed Protestant dissenters to migrate to their North American colonies ‚Äì thus the future United States found its early Protestant ethos ‚Äì while Protestants were forbidden to migrate to the Spanish colonies (thus South America retained its Catholic hue). A more democratic organisational structure within some of the new Protestant movements ‚Äì as in the Calvinists of New England ‚Äì did much also to foster a democratic spirit in Britain's American colonies. The Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with the Counter Reformation. Some of Luther and Calvin's criticisms were heeded: the selling of indulgences was reined in by the Council of Trent in 1562. But exuberant baroque architecture and art was embraced as an affirmation of the faith and new seminaries and orders were established to lead missions to far off lands. An important leader in this movement was Saint Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit Order) which gained many converts and sent such famous missionaries as Saints Matteo Ricci to China, Francis Xavier to India and Peter Claver to the Americas. Portrait of Elizabeth I of England. As princes, kings and emperors chose sides in religious debates and sought national unity, religious wars erupted throughout Europe, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Charles V was able to arrange the Peace of Augsburg between the warring Catholic and Protestant nobility. However, in 1618, the Thirty Years' War began between Protestants and Catholics in the empire, which eventually involved neighboring countries like France. The devastating war finally ended in 1648. In the Peace of Westphalia ending the war, Lutheranism, Catholicism and Calvinism were all granted toleration in the empire. The two major centers of power in the empire after the war were Protestant Prussia in the north and Catholic Austria in the south. The Dutch, who were ruled by the Spanish at the time, revolted and gained independence, founding a Protestant country. The Elizabethan era is famous above all for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Sir Francis Drake. Her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability and helped forge a sense of national identity. One of her first moves as queen was to support the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor of what was to become the Church of England. By 1650, the religious map of Europe had been redrawn: Scandinavia, Iceland, north Germany, part of Switzerland, Netherlands and Britain were Protestant, while the rest of the West remained Catholic. A byproduct of the Reformation was increasingly literacy as Protestant powers pursued an aim of educating more people to be able to read the Bible. Rise of Western empires: 1500‚Äì1800 Henry the Navigator was a key personality in European exploration in Africa and Asia. discovery of the New World by Italian explorer Christopher Columbus The Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama unlocked the sea route from Europe to India (1497‚Äì1499). The Russian conquest of Siberia began in July 1580 when some 540 Cossacks under Yermak Timofeyevich invaded the territory of the Voguls, subjects to K√º√ß√ºm, the Khan of Siberia. The French navigator Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec City, New France (modern Canada) in 1608. The arrival of Jan van Riebeeck, leading the first European settlement in South Africa. Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, became the first British Governor of Bengal and was a key figure in the establishment of British India. From its dawn until modern times, the West had suffered invasions from Africa, Asia, and non-Western parts of Europe. By 1500 Westerners took advantage of their new technologies, sallied forth into unknown waters, expanded their power and the Age of Discovery began, with Western explorers from seafaring nations like Portugal and Castile (later Spain) and later Holland, France and England setting forth from the \\"Old World\\" to chart faraway shipping routes and discover \\"new worlds\\". In 1492, the Genovese born mariner, Christopher Columbus set out under the auspices of the Crown of Castile (Spain) to seek an oversea route to the East Indies via the Atlantic Ocean. Rather than Asia, Columbus landed in the Bahamas, in the Caribbean. Spanish colonization followed and Europe established Western Civilization in the Americas. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama led the first sailing expedition directly from Europe to India in 1497‚Äì1499, by the Atlantic and Indian oceans, opening up the possibility of trade with the East other than via perilous overland routes like the Silk Road. Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer working for the Spanish Crown (under the Crown of Castile), led an expedition in 1519‚Äì1522 which became the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean into the Pacific Ocean and the first to cross the Pacific. The Spanish explorer Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth (Magellan was killed in the Philippines). The Americas were deeply affected by European expansion, due to conquest, sickness, and introduction of new technologies and ways of life. The Spanish Conquistadors conquered most of the Caribbean islands and overran the two great New World empires: the Aztec Empire of Mexico and the Inca Empire of Peru. From there, Spain conquered about half of South America, the remaining Central America and much of North America. Portugal also expanded in the Americas, attempting to establish some fishing colonies in northern North America first (with a relatively limited duration) and conquering half of South America and calling their colony Brazil. These Western powers were aided not only by superior technology like gunpowder, but also by Old World diseases which they inadvertently brought with them, and which wiped out large segments Amerindian population. The natives populations, called Indians by Columbus, since he originally thought he had landed in Asia (but often called Amerindians by scholars today), were converted to Catholicism and adopted the language of their rulers, either Spanish or Portuguese. They also adopted much of Western culture. Many Iberian settlers arrived, and many of them intermarried with the Amerindians resulting in a so-called Mestizo population, which became the majority of the population of Spain's American empires. Other powers to arrive in the Americas were the Swedes, Dutch, English, and French. The Dutch, English, and French all established colonies in the Caribbean and each established a small South American colony. The French established two large colonies in North America, Louisiana in the center of the continent and New France in the northeast of the continent. The French were not as intrusive as the Iberians were and had relatively good relations with the Amerindians, although there were areas of relatively heavy settlement like New Orleans and Quebec. Many French missionaries were successful in converting Amerindians to Catholicism. On North America's Atlantic coast, the Swedes established New Sweden. This colony was eventually conquered by the nearby Dutch colony of New Netherland (including New Amsterdam). New Netherland itself was eventually conquered by England and renamed New York. Although England's American empire began in what is today Canada, they soon focused their attention to the south, where they established thirteen colonies on North America's Atlantic coast. The English were unique in that rather than attempting to convert the Amerindians, they simply settled their colonies with Englishmen and pushed the Amerindians off their lands. In the Americas, it seems that only the most remote peoples managed to stave off complete assimilation by Western and Western-fashioned governments. These include some of the northern peoples (i.e., Inuit), some peoples in the Yucat√°n, Amazonian forest dwellers, and various Andean groups. Of these, the Quechua people, Aymara people, and Maya people are the most numerous- at around 10‚Äì11 million, 2 million, and 7 million, respectively. Bolivia is the only American country with a majority Amerindian population. Contact between the Old and New Worlds produced the Columbian Exchange, named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Westerners brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes, and bananas. Other items becoming important in global trade were the sugarcane and cotton crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World. Much of the land of the Americas was uncultivated, and Western powers were determined to make use of it. At the same time, tribal West African rulers were eager to trade their prisoners of war, and even members of their own tribes as slaves to the West. The West began purchasing slaves in large numbers and sending them to the Americas. This slavery was unique in world history for several reasons. Firstly, since only black Africans were enslaved, a racial component entered into Western slavery which had not existed in any other society to the extent it did in the West. Another important difference between slavery in the West and slavery elsewhere was the treatment of slaves. Unlike in some other cultures, slaves in the West were used primarily as field workers. Western empires differed in how often manumission was granted to slaves, with it being rather common in Spanish colonies, for example, but rare in English ones. Many Westerners did eventually come to question the morality of slavery. This early anti-slavery movement, mostly among clergy and political thinkers, was countered by pro-slavery forces by the introduction of the idea that blacks were inferior to European whites, mostly because they were non-Christians, and therefore it was acceptable to treat them without dignity. This idea resulted in racism in the West, as people began feeling all blacks were inferior to whites, regardless of their religion. Once in the Americas, blacks adopted much of Western culture and the languages of their masters. They also converted to Christianity. After trading with African rulers for some time, Westerners began establishing colonies in Africa. The Portuguese conquered ports in North, West and East Africa and inland territory in what is today Angola and Mozambique. They also established relations with the Kingdom of Kongo in central Africa before, and eventually the Kongolese converted to Catholicism. The Dutch established colonies in modern-day South Africa, which attracted many Dutch settlers. Western powers also established colonies in West Africa. However, most of the continent remained unknown to Westerners and their colonies were restricted to Africa's coasts. The British navigator Captain James Cook led three great voyages of discovery in the Pacific, mapping the East Coast of Australia, sailing into the Antarctic Circle and becoming the first European to reach Hawaii. Westerners also expanded in Asia. The Portuguese controlled port cities in the East Indies, India, Persian Gulf, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and China. During this time, the Dutch began their colonisation of the Indonesian archipelago, which became the Dutch East Indies in the early 19th century, and gained port cities in Sri Lanka and Malaysia and India. Spain conquered the Philippines and converted the inhabitants to Catholicism. Missionaries from Iberia (including some from Italy and France) gained many converts in Japan until Christianity was outlawed by Japan's emperor. Some Chinese also became Christian, although most did not. Most of India was divided up between England and France. As Western powers expanded they competed for land and resources. In the Caribbean, pirates attacked each other and the navies and colonial cities of countries, in hopes of stealing gold and other valuables from a ship or city. This was sometimes supported by governments. For example, England supported the pirate Sir Francis Drake in raids against the Spanish. Between 1652 and 1678, the three Anglo-Dutch wars were fought, of which the last two were won by the Dutch. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England gained New Netherland (which was traded with Suriname and Dutch South Africa. In 1756, the Seven Years' War, or French and Indian War began. It involved several powers fighting on several continents. In North America, English soldiers and colonial troops defeated the French, and in India the French were also defeated by England. In Europe Prussia defeated Austria. When the war ended in 1763, New France and eastern Louisiana were ceded to England, while western Louisiana was given to Spain. France's lands in India were ceded to England. Prussia was given rule over more territory in what is today Germany.

The Part Borne by the Dutch in the Discovery of Australia 1606-1765, London: Royal Dutch Geographical Society, section III.B Another Dutchman, Abel Tasman later touched mainland Australia, and mapped Tasmania and New Zealand for the first time, in the 1640s. The English navigator James Cook became first to map the east coast of Australia in 1770. Cook's extraordinary seamanship greatly expanded European awareness of far shores and oceans: his first voyage reported favourably on the prospects of colonisation of Australia; his second voyage ventured almost to Antarctica (disproving long held European hopes of an undiscovered Great Southern Continent); and his third voyage explored the Pacific coasts of North America and Siberia and brought him to Hawaii, where an ill-advised return after a lengthy stay saw him clubbed to death by natives. Europe's period of expansion in early modern times greatly changed the world. New crops from the Americas improved European diets. This, combined with an improved economy thanks to Europe's new network of colonies, led to a demographic revolution in the West, with infant mortality dropping, and Europeans getting married younger and having more children. The West became more sophisticated economically, adopting Mercantilism, in which companies were state-owned and colonies existed for the good of the mother country. Enlightenment =Absolutism and the Enlightenment: 1500‚Äì1800= Charles V was ruler of the Holy Roman Empire from 1519 and, as Charles I, of the Spanish Empire from 1516 until his voluntary abdication in 1556. Cesare Beccaria was the most talented jurist of the Enlightenment and a father of classical criminal theory John V of Portugal's reign saw an exuberant period for Portugal, with colonial success and domestic production. Portrait of Peter I of Russia (1672-1725). Under his reign, Russia looked westward. Heavily influenced by advisors from Western Europe, he implemented sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing Russia. The West in the early modern era went through great changes as the traditional balance between monarchy, nobility and clergy shifted. With the feudal system all but gone, nobles lost their traditional source of power. Meanwhile, in Protestant countries, the church was now often headed by a monarch, while in Catholic countries, conflicts between monarchs and the Church rarely occurred and monarchs were able to wield greater power than they ever had in Western history. Under the doctrine of the Divine right of kings, monarchs believed they were only answerable to God: thus giving rise to absolutism. At the opening of the 15th century, tensions were still going on between Islam and Christianity. Europe, dominated by Christians, remained under threat from the Muslim Ottoman Turks. The Turks had migrated from central to western Asia and converted to Islam years earlier. Their capture of Constantinople in 1453, thus extinguishing the Eastern Roman Empire, was a crowning achievement for the new Ottoman Empire. They continued to expand across the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans. Under the leadership of the Spanish, a Christian coalition destroyed the Ottoman navy at the battle of Lepanto in 1571 ending their naval control of the Mediterranean. However, the Ottoman threat to Europe was not ended until a Polish led coalition defeated the Ottoman at the Battle of Vienna in 1683.Davies, N. God's Playground A History of Poland Volume 1 Clarendon, 1986 Page 481-483Zamoyski, A. The Polish Way John Murray, 1989 Page 171 The Turks were driven out of Buda (the eastern part of Budapest they had occupied for a century), Belgrade, and Athens ‚Äì though Athens was to be recaptured and held until 1829. The 16th century is often called Spain's Siglo de Oro (golden century). From its colonies in the Americas it gained large quantities of gold and silver, which helped make Spain the richest and most powerful country in the world. One of the greatest Spanish monarchs of the era was Charles I (1516‚Äì1556, who also held the title of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). His attempt to unite these lands was thwarted by the divisions caused by the Reformation and ambitions of local rulers and rival rulers from other countries. Another great monarch was Philip II (1556‚Äì1598), whose reign was marked by several Reformation conflicts, like the loss of the Netherlands and the Spanish Armada. These events and an excess of spending would lead to a great decline in Spanish power and influence by the 17th century. After Spain began to decline in the 17th century, the Dutch, by virtue of its sailing ships, became the greatest world power, leading the 17th century to be called the Dutch Golden Age. The Dutch followed Portugal and Spain in establishing an overseas colonial empire ‚Äî often under the corporate colonialism model of the East India and West India Companies. After the Anglo- Dutch Wars, France and England emerged as the two greatest powers in the 18th century. Voltaire, French Enlightenment writer, philosopher and wit. Isaac Newton discovered universal gravitation and the laws of motion. Louis XIV became king of France in 1643. His reign was one of the most opulent in European history. He built a large palace in the town of Versailles. The Holy Roman Emperor exerted no great influence on the lands of the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the Thirty Years' War. In the north of the empire, Prussia emerged as a powerful Protestant nation. Under many gifted rulers, like King Frederick the Great, Prussia expanded its power and defeated its rival Austria many times in war. Ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, Austria became a great empire, expanding at the expense of the Ottoman Empire and Hungary. One land where absolutism did not take hold was England, which had trouble with revolutionaries. Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry VIII, had left no direct heir to the throne. The rightful heir was actually James VI of Scotland, who was crowned James I of England. James's son, Charles I resisted the power of Parliament. When Charles attempted to shut down Parliament, the Parliamentarians rose up and soon the all of England was involved in a civil war. The English Civil War ended in 1649 with the defeat and execution of Charles I. Parliament declared a kingless commonwealth but soon appointed the anti-absolutist leader and staunch Puritan Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. Cromwell enacted many unpopular Puritan religious laws in England, like outlawing alcohol and theaters, although religious diversity may have grown. (It was Cromwell, after all, that invited the Jews back into England after the Edict of Expulsion.) After his death, the monarchy was restored under Charles's son, who was crowned Charles II. His son, James II succeeded him. James and his infant son were Catholics. Not wanting to be ruled by a Catholic dynasty, Parliament invited James's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, to rule as co-monarchs. They agreed on the condition James would not be harmed. Realizing he could not count on the Protestant English army to defend him, he abdicated following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Before William III and Mary II were crowned however, Parliament forced them to sign the English Bill of Rights, which guaranteed some basic rights to all Englishmen, granted religious freedom to non-Anglican Protestants, and firmly established the rights of Parliament. In 1707, the Act of Union of 1707 were passed by the parliaments of Scotland and England, merging Scotland and England into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with a single parliament. This new kingdom also controlled Ireland which had previously been conquered by England. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, in 1801 Ireland was formally merged with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Ruled by the Protestant Ascendancy, Ireland eventually became an English-speaking land, though the majority population preserved distinct cultural and religious outlooks, remaining predomininantly Catholic except in parts of Ulster and Dublin. By then, the British experience had already contributed to the American Revolution. Louis XVI of France by Antoine- Fran√ßois Callet. 3 May Constitution, by Matejko (1891). King Stanis≈Çaw August (left) enters St. John's Cathedral, where deputies will swear to uphold the Constitution. Background: Warsaw's Royal Castle, where it has just been adopted. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was an important European center for the development of modern social and political ideas. It was famous for its rare quasi-democratic political system, praised by philosophers such as Erasmus; and, during the Counter-Reformation, was known for near-unparalleled religious tolerance, with peacefully coexisting Catholic, Jewish, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant and Muslim communities. With its political system the Commonwealth gave birth to political philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503‚Äì1572), Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça Go≈õlicki (1530‚Äì1607) and Piotr Skarga (1536‚Äì1612). Later, works by Stanis≈Çaw Staszic (1755‚Äì1826) and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (1750‚Äì1812) helped pave the way for the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls \\"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\\". Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's constitution enacted revolutionary political principles for the first time on the European continent. The Komisja Edukacji Narodowej, Polish for Commission of National Education, formed in 1773, was the world's first national Ministry of Education and an important achievement of the Polish Enlightenment. The intellectual movement called the Age of Enlightenment began in this period as well. Its proponents opposed the absolute rule of the monarchs, and instead emphasized the equality of all individuals and the idea that governments should derive their existence from the consent of the governed. Enlightenment thinkers called philosophes (French for philosophers) idealized Europe's classical heritage. They looked at Athenian democracy and the Roman republic as ideal governments. They believed reason held the key to creating an ideal society. David Hume, an important figure in the Scottish Enlightenment. The Englishman Francis Bacon espoused the idea that senses should be the primary means of knowing, while the Frenchman Ren√© Descartes advocated using reason over the senses. In his works, Descartes was concerned with using reason to prove his own existence and the existence of the external world, including God. Another belief system became popular among philosophes, Deism, which taught that a single god had created but did not interfere with the world. This belief system never gained popular support and largely died out by the early 19th century. Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher, best known today for his work on political philosophy. His 1651 book Leviathan established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of social contract theory. The theory was examined also by John Locke (Second Treatise of Government (1689)) and Rousseau (Du contrat social (1762)). Social contract arguments examine the appropriate relationship between government and the governed and posit that individuals unite into political societies by a process of mutual consent, agreeing to abide by common rules and accept corresponding duties to protect themselves and one another from violence and other kinds of harm. In 1690 John Locke wrote that people have certain natural rights like life, liberty and property and that governments were created in order to protect these rights. If they did not, according to Locke, the people had a right to overthrow their government. The French philosopher Voltaire criticized the monarchy and the Church for what he saw as hypocrisy and for their persecution of people of other faiths. Another Frenchman, Montesquieu, advocated division of government into executive, legislative and judicial branches. The French author Rousseau stated in his works that society corrupted individuals. Many monarchs were affected by these ideas, and they became known to history as the enlightened despots. However, most only supported Enlightenment ideas that strengthened their own power. The Scottish Enlightenment was a period in 18th century Scotland characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. Scotland reaped the benefits of establishing Europe's first public education system and a growth in trade which followed the Act of Union with England of 1707 and expansion of the British Empire. Important modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by the philosopher/historian David Hume. Adam Smith developed and published The Wealth of Nations, the first work in modern economics. He believed competition and private enterprise could increase the common good. The celebrated bard Robert Burns is still widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland. European cities like Paris, London, and Vienna grew into large metropolises in early modern times. France became the cultural center of the West. The middle class grew even more influential and wealthy. Great artists of this period included El Greco, Rembrandt, and Caravaggio. By this time, many around the world wondered how the West had become so advanced, for example, the Orthodox Christian Russians, who came to power after conquering the Mongols that had conquered Kiev in the Middle Ages. They began westernizing under Czar Peter the Great, although Russia remained uniquely part of its own civilization. The Russians became involved in European politics, dividing up the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with Prussia and Austria. =Revolution: 1770‚Äì1815= The U.S. Constitution Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. The late 18th century and early 19th century, much of the West experienced a series of revolutions that would change the course of history, resulting in new ideologies and changes in society. The first of these revolutions began in North America. Britain's 13 American colonies had by this time developed their own sophisticated economy and culture, largely based on Britain's. The majority of the population was of British descent, while significant minorities included people of Irish, Dutch and German descent, as well as some Amerindians and many black slaves. Most of the population was Anglican, others were Congregationalist or Puritan, while minorities included other Protestant churches like the Society of Friends and the Lutherans, as well as some Roman Catholics and Jews. The colonies had their own great cities and universities and continually welcomed new immigrants, mostly from Britain. After the expensive Seven Years' War, Britain needed to raise revenue, and felt the colonists should bare the brunt of the new taxation it felt was necessary. The colonists greatly resented these taxes and protested the fact they could be taxed by Britain but had no representation in the government. After Britain's King George III refused to seriously consider colonial grievances raised at the first Continental Congress, some colonists took up arms. Leaders of a new pro-independence movement were influenced by Enlightenment ideals and hoped to bring an ideal nation into existence. On 4 July 1776, the colonies declared independence with the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. Drafted primarily by Thomas Jefferson, the document's preamble eloquently outlines the principles of governance that would come to increasingly dominate Western thinking over the ensuing century and a half: > George Washington led the new Continental Army against the British forces, > who had many successes early in this American Revolution. After years of > fighting, the colonists formed an alliance with France and defeated the > British at Yorktown, Virginia in 1781. The treaty ending the war granted > independence to the colonies, which became The United States of America. The > other major Western revolution at the turn of the 19th century was the > French Revolution. In 1789 France faced an economical crisis. The King > called, for the first time in more than two centuries, the Estates General, > an assembly of representatives of each estate of the kingdom: the First > Estate (the clergy), the Second Estate (the nobility), and the Third Estate > (middle class and peasants); in order to deal with the crisis. As the French > society was gained by the same Enlightenment ideals that led to the American > revolution, in which many Frenchmen, such as Lafayette, took part; > representatives of the Third Estate, joined by some representatives of the > lower clergy, created the National Assembly, which, unlike the Estates > General, provided the common people of France with a voice proportionate to > their numbers. The people of Paris feared the King would try to stop the > work of the National Assembly and Paris was soon consumed with riots, > anarchy, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of the French > Guard, including arms and trained soldiers, because the royal leadership > essentially abandoned the city. On the fourteenth of July 1789 a mob stormed > the Bastille, a prison fortress, which led the King to accept the changes. > On 4 August 1789 the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism > sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the > tithes gathered by the First Estate. It was the first time in Europe, where > feudalism was the norm for centuries, that such a thing happened. In the > course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies, and > cities lost their special privileges. At first, the revolution seemed to be > turning France into a constitutional monarchy, but the other continental > Europe powers feared a spread of the revolutionary ideals and eventually > went to war with France. In 1792 King Louis XVI was imprisoned after he had > been captured fleeing Paris and the Republic was declared. The Imperial and > Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population should it > resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy. As a consequence, > King Louis was seen as conspiring with the enemies of France. His execution > on 21 January 1793 led to more wars with other European countries. During > this period France effectively became a dictatorship after the parliamentary > coup of the radical leaders, the Jacobin.

Finally, in 1794, Robespierre himself was arrested > and executed, and more moderate deputies took power. This led to a new > government, the French Directory. In 1799, a coup overthrew the Directory > and General Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as dictator and even an emperor > in 1804. Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© (French for \\"Liberty, equality, > fraternity\\"), now the national motto of France, had its origins during the > French Revolution, though it was only later institutionalised. It remains > another iconic motto of the aspirations of Western governance in the modern > world. Some influential intellectuals came to reject the excesses of the > revolutionary movement.

He is remembered as a father of modern Anglo- > conservatism. In response to such critiques, the American revolutionary > Thomas Paine published his book The Rights of Man in 1791 as a defence of > the ideals of the French Revolution. The spirit of the age also produced > early works of feminist philosophy ‚Äì notably Mary Wollstonecraft's 1792 > book: A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. =Napoleonic Wars= Napoleon > Crossing the Alps (David).

As a direct result of the > Napoleonic wars, the British Empire became the foremost world power for the > next century, thus beginning Pax Britannica.

Since workers relied only on their small wages for > sustenance, entire families were forced to work, including children. These > and other problems caused by industrialism resulted in some reforms by the > mid-19th century. The economic model of the West also began to change, with > mercantilism being replaced by capitalism, in which companies, and later, > large corporations, were run by individual investor(s).

Capitalists emerged as a new powerful group, with educated > professionals like doctors and lawyers under them, and the various > industrial workers at the bottom. These changes were often slow however, > with Western society as a whole remaining primarily agricultural for > decades. =United Kingdom: 1815‚Äì1870= The British Empire in 1897 From > 1837 until 1901, Queen Victoria reigned over the United Kingdom and the > ever-expanding British Empire.

Tim Blanning and Hagen Schulze (New York: Oxford > University Press, 2006), 5‚Äì18. Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, so did > Romanticism reject the ideas of the Enlightenment and the aesthetic of the > Neoclassicists. Romanticism emphasized emotion and nature, and idealized the > Middle Ages. Important musicians were Franz Schubert, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, > Richard Wagner, Fryderyk Chopin, and John Constable. Romantic art focused on > the use of color and motion in order to portray emotion, but like classicism > used Greek and Roman mythology and tradition as an important source of > symbolism. Another important aspect of Romanticism was its emphasis on > nature and portraying the power and beauty of the natural world. Romanticism > was also a large literary movement, especially in poetry. Among the greatest > Romantic artists were Eug√®ne Delacroix, Francisco Goya, Karl Bryullov, > J.M.W. Turner, John Constable, Caspar David Friedrich, Ivan Aivazovsky, > Thomas Cole, and William Blake. Romantic poetry emerged as a significant > genre, particularly during the Victorian Era with leading exponents > including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Burns, Edgar > Allan Poe and John Keats. Other Romantic writers included Sir Walter Scott, > Lord Byron, Alexander Pushkin, Victor Hugo, and Goethe. Some of the best > regarded poets of the era were women. Mary Wollstonecraft had written one of > the first works of feminist philosophy, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman > which called for equal education for women in 1792 and her daughter, Mary > Shelley became an accomplished author best known for her 1818 novel > Frankenstein, which examined some of the frightening potential of the rapid > advances of science. In early 19th-century Europe, in response to > industrialization, the movement of Realism emerged. Realism sought to > accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of > changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially > optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and > despair. Similarly, while Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed > life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, Realism was a > literary as well as an artistic movement. The great Realist painters include > Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, Gustave Courbet, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Camille > Corot, Honor√© Daumier, √âdouard Manet, Edgar Degas (both considered as > Impressionists), Ilya Repin, and Thomas Eakins, among others. Writers also > sought to come to terms with the new industrial age. The works of the > Englishman Charles Dickens (including his novels Oliver Twist and A > Christmas Carol) and the Frenchman Victor Hugo (including Les Miserables) > remain among the best known and widely influential. The first great Russian > novelist was Nikolai Gogol (Dead Souls). Then came Ivan Goncharov, Nikolai > Leskov and Ivan Turgenev. Leo Tolstoy (War and Peace, Anna Karenina) and > Fyodor Dostoevsky (Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov) > soon became internationally renowned to the point that many scholars such as > F. R. Leavis have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever. > In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in writing short > stories and became perhaps the leading dramatist internationally of his > period. American literature also progressed with the development of a > distinct voice: Mark Twain produced his masterpieces Tom Sawyer and > Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. In Irish Literature, the Anglo-Irish > tradition produced Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde writing in English and a > Gaelic Revival had emerged by the end of the 19th century. The poetry of > William Butler Yeats prefigured the emergence of the 20th-century Irish > literary giants James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Patrick Kavanagh. In > Britain's Australian colonies, bush balladeers such as Henry Lawson and > Banjo Paterson brought the character of a new continent to the pages of > world literature. The response of architecture to industrialisation, in > stark contrast to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. The > railway stations built during this period are often called \\"the cathedrals > of the age\\". Architecture during the Industrial Age witnessed revivals of > styles from the distant past, such as the Gothic Revival‚Äîin which style the > iconic Palace of Westminster in London was re-built to house the mother > parliament of the British Empire. Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral in Paris was > also restored in the Gothic style, following its desecration during the > French Revolution. Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major > artistic movement, Impressionism. The Impressionists pioneered the use of > light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human > eye. Edgar Degas, √âdouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre- > Auguste Renoir, were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct > outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of Post-Impressionism. Paul > C√©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat are the best known > Post-Impressionists. In Australia the Heidelberg School was expressing the > light and colour of Australian landscape with a new insight and vigour. The > Industrial Revolution which began in Britain in the 18th century brought > increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and > follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and > increased accessibility. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played > in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the > British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified > in Britain during the 19th century and obtained global prominence ‚Äì these > include Ping Pong, modern tennis, Association Football, Netball and Rugby. > The United States also developed popular international sports during this > period.

New imperialism: 1870‚Äì1914 The years between 1870 and > 1914 saw the expansion of Western power. By 1914, the Western and some Asian > and Eurasian empires like the Empire of Japan, Russian Empire, Ottoman > Empire, and Qing China dominated the entire planet. The major Western > players in this New Imperialism were Britain, Russia, France, Germany, > Italy, and the United States. The Empire of Japan is the only one non- > Western power involved in this new era of imperialism. Western empires as > they were in 1910 Although the West had had a presence in Africa for > centuries, its colonies were limited mostly to Africa's coast. Europeans, > including the Britons Mungo Park and David Livingstone, the German Johannes > Rebmann, and the Frenchman Ren√© Cailli√©, explored the interior of the > continent, allowing greater European expansion in the later 19th century. > The period between 1870 and 1914 is often called the Scramble for Africa, > due to the competition between European nations for control of Africa. In > 1830, France occupied Algeria in North Africa. Many Frenchman settled on > Algeria's Mediterranean coast. In 1882 Britain annexed Egypt. France > eventually conquered most of Morocco and Tunisia as well. Libya was > conquered by the Italians. Spain gained a small part of Morocco and modern- > day Western Sahara. West Africa was dominated by France, although Britain > ruled several smaller West African colonies. Germany also established two > colonies in West Africa, and Portugal had one as well. Central Africa was > dominated by the Belgian Congo. At first the colony was ruled by Belgium's > king, Leopold II, however his regime was so brutal the Belgian government > took over the colony. The Germans and French also established colonies in > Central Africa. The British and Italians were the two dominant powers in > East Africa, although France also had a colony there. Southern Africa was > dominated by Britain. Tensions between the British Empire and the Boer > republics led to the Boer Wars, fought on and off between the 1880s and > 1902, ending in a British victory. In 1910 Britain united its South African > colonies with the former Boer republics and established the Union of South > Africa, a dominion of the British Empire. The British established several > other colonies in Southern Africa. The Portuguese and Germans also > established a presence in Southern Africa. The French conquered the island > of Madagascar. By 1914, Africa had only two independent nations, Liberia, a > nation founded in West Africa by free black Americans earlier in the 19th > century, and the ancient kingdom of Ethiopia in East Africa. Many Africans, > like the Zulus, resisted European rule, but in the end Europe succeeded in > conquering and transforming the continent. Missionaries arrived and > established schools, while industrialists helped establish rubber, diamond > and gold industries on the continent. Perhaps the most ambitious change by > Europeans was the construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt, allowing ships to > travel from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean without having to go all the > way around Africa. In Asia, China was defeated by Britain in the Opium War > and later Britain and France in the Arrow War, forcing it to open up to > trade with the West. Soon every major Western power as well as Russia and > Japan had spheres of influence in China, although the country remained > independent. Southeast Asia was divided between French Indochina and British > Burma. One of the few independent nations in this region at the time was > Siam. The Dutch continued to rule their colony of the Dutch East Indies, > while Britain and Germany also established colonies in Oceania. India > remained an integral part of the British Empire, with Queen Victoria being > crowned Empress of India. The British even built a new capital in India, New > Delhi. The Middle East remained largely under the rule of the Ottoman Empire > and Persia. Britain, however, established a sphere of influence in Persia > and a few small colonies in Arabia and coastal Mesopotamia.

In the first year, Eastern was upset by lightly regarded Metcalfe County in the first round, 60-58. A year later as a senior, Eastern was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Hazard High School. Spencer attended the University of Louisville, where he became the all-time field goal percentage leader at 62.8%. He took over the center position as a senior in 1989‚Äì90 after Pervis Ellison left to join the NBA. That season Spencer paced the Cardinals in scoring (14.9 ppg), rebounding (8.5 rpg), blocked shots (69), and field goal percentage (68.1%). NBA career Spencer was selected with the 6th pick in the 1990 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves. As a rookie, Spencer split time at center with 7'3\\" veteran Randy Breuer, but still managed respectable numbers, averaging 7.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game, and shooting 51.2% from the floor. He finished the season with 272 offensive rebounds, good for seventh in the NBA that year. Additionally, he blocked 121 shots, establishing a single-season record for the young franchise that would stand until Kevin Garnett's rookie season in 1995-96. For his efforts, Spencer was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team that year. However, with the arrival of Luc Longley the following season, Spencer's playing time declined over the following two years. After the 1992‚Äì93 season, Minnesota traded Spencer to the Utah Jazz for power forward/center Mike Brown. In Utah, Spencer became the successor to Mark Eaton, and he provided the Jazz with solid scoring, rebounding and defense at the pivot position. In 1993‚Äì94, as a complement to John Stockton and Karl Malone, he averaged 8.6 points and 8.3 rebounds while shooting 50.5% from the floor. Spencer and the Jazz seemed to be on their way to greatness in 1994‚Äì95, but 34 games into the season he ruptured his left Achilles tendon and was lost for the year. Utah went on to win 60 regular-season games but failed to reach the NBA Finals by losing in the first round. He missed the first 11 games of the 1995‚Äì96 season while recovering from his Achilles injury, but went on to play in the remaining 71, starting 70 and averaging 5.6 points and 4.3 rebounds in 17.8 minutes per game. He shot a career-high 52.0% from the field, tying Adam Keefe for the second-best mark on the team. On August 10, 1996, Spencer was obtained by the Orlando Magic for guard Brooks Thompson, forward Kenny Gattison and a first-round draft pick, after the Magic had lost Shaquille O'Neal to the Lakers as a free agent. But he played just one game for Orlando before he was traded to Golden State in the deal that brought Rony Seikaly to the Magic. He went on to play 71 games for the Warriors and do a solid job in the middle, ranking second on the team in rebounding and third in blocked shots. His role was diminished in 1997‚Äì98 by the arrival of second- year man Erick Dampier as the starter, as well as the drafting of rookie Adonal Foyle, and he saw relatively limited action as a reserve in 68 games. He played even less in 1998‚Äì99, averaging just 6.1 minutes in his 26 appearances off the bench. Spencer retired after the 2001‚Äì02 season.

Oberholtzer (10 January 1809 ‚Äì 15 February 1895) was a North American Mennonite leader who advocated for Mennonite cooperation for the purpose of higher education and mission work. He provided key leadership during the formation of the General Conference Mennonite Church. Oberholtzer was born on a farm in Berks County, Pennsylvania, the second child of Abraham and Susanna Oberholtzer. Starting at age sixteen he was employed as a schoolteacher and learned locksmithing to supplement his income. Between school teaching and his locksmith shop in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Oberholtzer was in daily contact with a wider variety of people and ideas than other Mennonites in the area, who tended to be more withdrawn. At the age of 33, Oberholtzer became the pastor of his congregation, Swamp Mennonite Church. Mennonite pastors were untrained, unpaid and selected by lot. The selection process began with nominations from the congregation. A set of Bibles, one for each nominee, was presented to the candidates. The one selecting the Bible containing a hidden slip of paper was ordained as the new pastor. Oberholtzer was expected to remain a minister in the Swamp congregation for the remainder of his life. Franconia Conference Oberholtzer's congregation was part of Franconia Conference, a group of 22 Mennonite congregations located in eastern Pennsylvania. Conference leadership was composed of five bishops plus ministers and deacons from the congregations. Not long after he became a pastor, Oberholtzer was also selected to be bishop for the congregations of the Swamp area. Because of Oberholtzer's interest and contact with the wider world, his ideas clashed with the more conservative members at Franconia conference sessions. Areas of disagreement arose around the need for ministers to wear a particular style of colonial coat, whether more formal meeting procedures should be adopted and how open the church should be to Christians from other denominations. Oberholtzer suggested that the Franconia Conference adopt a formal constitution, document procedures and keep minutes of their meetings. These practices had never been done in the past and the majority thought that they were not necessary. When Oberholtzer and his supporters were not allowed to bring these items up for discussion, a rift developed between the two groups. East Pennsylvania Conference Attempts to reconcile the division failed and in 1847 a new group, East Pennsylvania Conference, was formed from about a quarter of the original Franconia members. Oberholtzer provided leadership for the new conference, creating a set of guidelines to act as a constitution. He initiated contact with Canadian and European Mennonites in order to incorporate ideas from the broader Mennonite world into the new conference. Oberholtzer stressed training for young people wanting to become church members. He distributed a catechism booklet among the churches as a guide for religious education. The class he formed for his own congregation in 1857 was one of the first Mennonite Sunday schools in North America. Oberholtzer purchased a hand printing press in 1851 and set it up in his locksmith shop. He published Der Religi√∂se Botschafter (the Religious Messenger) with a circulation of 400, the first successful Mennonite periodical in North America. The financial burden and the demands on his time ended the operation after three years. In 1856, with funding from 92 shareholders, the Mennonite Printing Union was organized and printing resumed with a periodical named Das Christliche Volksblatt. Besides the periodical, books and other material were printed at this new facility. Oberholtzer's contribution as publisher and editor was to have significant influence on Mennonites in North America. Oberholtzer writing reflected his response to issues of his time. He advocated open communion, allowing Christians of other denomination participate. With respect to the emotional prayer meeting movement, he believed one should pray continuously and need not participate in specially arranged prayer meetings. He was opposed to church members participating in secret societies and believed foot washing should be taken symbolically, not literally. Oberholtzer believed participation in war is always wrong. General Conference In an effort to communicate with like- minded Mennonites, Oberholtzer's publications were circulated beyond the borders of the East Pennsylvania Conference. Oberholtzer pursued contacts with Mennonites in Ontaria, Ohio and Iowa, promoting his ideas about inter- Mennonite cooperation. In 1859, a newly organized group of Mennonites in Iowa invited any interest Mennonites to join them in forming a union to work together to promote missions. The invitation was published in Das Christliche Volksblatt with Oberholtzer endorsing the idea. A formal meeting took place on 29 May 1860, resulting in the creation of the General Conference Mennonite Church. Oberholtzer was a key committee member in drawing up the organization's constitution and presided over four of the initial sessions. When Daniel Hege visited Pennsylvania the following year to explain the purpose of the new conference, Oberholtzer's own East Pennsylvania Conference joined and would become the Eastern District Conference within this new structure. One of the new conference's initial goals was to provide higher education in order to train missionaries. This goal was realized with the creation of Wadsworth Institute. Oberholtzer was a key supporter of this project, helping to write its constitution. Oberholtzer continued to be an active leader in the General Conference Mennonite Church throughout his life. Family and last years Oberholtzer married Mary Reihn. They had one son and one daughter. Mary Reihn died in 1871 and both children preceded Oberholtzer in death. Oberholtzer married Susanna Moyer in 1872. He died at the age of 86 and was buried at Swamp Mennonite Church where he had served as a pastor. References *Kaufman, Edmund G.

Early life and career Charles Stirling was born in London on 28 April 1760 and baptised at St. Albans on 15 May. The son of Admiral Sir Walter Stirling, he was born into a family with a long and proud naval tradition. Stirling joined the Royal Navy and was promoted to captain in 1783. On 11 August 1789 he married Charlotte Grote at Greenwich, London. He was involved in the famous battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, the capture of Seine at the Action of 30 June 1798 during which he was wounded, and took part in the July 1801 Battle of Algeciras as captain of the 74-gun HMS Pomp√©e. Later that year he was appointed Commissioner at Jamaica Yard. Admiral Stirling was recalled to England in late 1804, and on arrival was promoted to rear admiral and hoisted his flag in the 98-gun , which had been one of the famous ships involved in the Glorious First of June battle, and was now the flagship of the Rochefort squadron. Stirling immediately arranged for his nephew James to transfer to his ship as a midshipman. James Stirling would remain under his uncle's command until 1808, and would be enormously influenced by his uncle, both professionally and personally. On 22 July 1805, Stirling took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre under Sir Robert Calder, during which his squadron attacked the combined French and Spanish fleets off Cape Finisterre. In July 1806 he was given command of the ship and order to convoy General Samuel Auchmuty's troops to Buenos Aires, where he would relieve Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham, who, with troops under William Carr Beresford, had captured Buenos Aires in the first of a series of British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. By the time he arrived, Buenos Aires had been retaken by the Spanish, so after relieving Popham and transferring to Popham's ship, , Stirling aided Auchmuty in a successful attack on Montevideo. He was later praised in both Houses of Parliament and in the British press for his good judgement. Shortly after the capture of Montevideo, Stirling was relieved and ordered to take up the office of naval Commander-in-Chief at the Cape of Good Hope Station. He was recalled to London after about five months. On 31 July 1810, he was promoted to vice admiral, and given the Freedom of the City of London. He also received a sword with \\"gallant and meritorious conduct at the capture of the Fortress of Monte Video\\" inscribed on the hilt. Stirling took an extended period of leave, but in October 1811 returned to active service to take up an appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica Station.Cundall, p. xx When war broke out with America, he was placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in September 1812, and led his squadron in harassing American shipping and conducting coastal raids in the Bermuda area. Court martial In June 1813 Stirling was relieved and ordered to return to London. On arriving in London late in 1813, he learned that he had been recalled to face charges of accepting payment for protecting foreign seamen. The specific charges were contained in a letter written by Commissioner Wolley at Jamaica, who claimed \\"that His Majesty's Naval Service had been brought into disrepute in consequence of it being spoken of publicly that ships of war were hired out to convoy vessels going to the Spanish Main.\\" Wolley cited a specific incident, when Stirling was said to have received $2000 for the hire of His Majesty's sloop . Aspects of the charge were dismissed, but the verdict that was handed down in May 1814 was \\"that the charge had been in part proved.\\" Although it was agreed that Stirling's actions were excusable on humanitarian grounds, he had acted against regulations. He was retired on half pay, and barred from further promotion. Stirling appealed in July and won a number of concessions: a restoration to flag officer status and the right to continue to be addressed as \\"senior vice admiral of the white\\". The admiralty, however, refused to return him to active service. Later life Stirling's wife died on 25 March 1825 at Woburn Farm, Chertsey, Surrey. Stirling was reported as seriously ill in September 1833, and he died at Woburn Farm on 7 November 1833. His only daughter Charlotte Dorothea Stirling married her cousin Charles Stirling of Muiravonside House on 1 May 1827.

Britain eventually gained control of Nigerian administration. After independence, the Nigerian economy seemed very promising. Many saw Nigeria, with 15% of Africa's population, as an emerging economy. However, this potential never materialized. A series of unfortunate political and economic events have stalled Nigerian growth. The country still plays an important economic role in the world, especially as a producer of fossil fuels.  Nigeria during the Atlantic slave trade  Direct trade with Europe started from the fifteenth century. Portuguese had explored the coasts to avoid Saharan intermediaries in the trade of West African gold to Europe and that was a way to India. They built coastal bases and introduced the Atlantic slave trade when they bought captives from the kingdom of Benin (nowadays Nigeria) and sold them to African tradesmen on the coast (nowadays Ghana). The period from 1680-1800 was dominated by a boom of the Atlantic slave trade because of the growth of the Atlantic plantation system. The effects on peaceful production and trade were terrible since slave trade was a cause of conflicts. However, the Atlantic trade still brought advantages. Especially, the currencies that West African tradesmen adopted were more efficient than earlier commodity currencies. This helped to reduce the cost of doing business.  History of tax in Nigeria  The European struggle to establish communities and trading posts on the West African coast from about the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century was part of the wider competition for trade and empire in the Atlantic. The British, like other newcomers to the slave trade, found they could compete with the Dutch in West Africa only by forming national trading companies. The first such effective English enterprise was the Company of the Royal Adventurers, chartered in 1660 and succeeded in 1672 by the Royal African Company. Only a monopoly company could afford to build and maintain the forts considered essential to hold stocks of slaves and trade goods. In the early 18th century, Britain and France made inroads on the Dutch hold on West African trade; and by the end of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars (1799‚Äì1815), Britain had become the dominant commercial power in West Africa. The slave trade was one of the major causes of the devastating internecine strife in southern Nigeria during the three centuries to the mid-19th century, when abolition occurred. In the 19th century, Britain was interested primarily in opening markets for its manufactured goods in West Africa and expanding commerce in palm oil. Securing the oil and ivory trade required that Britain usurp the power of coastal chiefs in what became Nigeria. That was an unplanned consequence of the creation of the Sokoto Caliphate in 1804. At its peak, the Sokoto Caliphate was the most populous state in Africa. The Caliphate occupied most of north-central and north-west Nigeria, as well as parts of neighboring countries of nowadays Nigeria. Internal peace and market integration was a basis of the commercial prosperity of the Caliphate. Hausa merchant diasporas ran an extensive export-trade network and the state had regular increase of the labour supply through the importation of ‚Äúpagan‚Äù captives as slaves. Many cities became bigger, especially, its commercial capital Kano, which was the biggest manufacturing center in the region. The clothing was exported from Kano to all over West Africa. The formation of the Sokoto Caliphate made Islam a mass rural religion for the first time in the region. The Caliphate introduced Islamic taxes that facilitated economic expansion. Formal \\"protection\\" and‚Äîeventually‚Äîcolonization of Nigeria resulted not only from the desire to safeguard Britain's expanding trade interests in the Nigerian hinterland, but also from an interest in forestalling formal claims by other colonial powers, such as France and Germany. By 1850 British trading interests were concentrating in Lagos and the Niger River delta. British administration in Nigeria formally began in 1861, when Lagos became a crown colony, a step taken in response to factors such as the now-illegal activities of slave traders, the disruption of trade by the Yoruba civil wars, and fears that the French would take over Lagos. Through a series of steps designed to facilitate trade, by 1906 present-day Niger was under British control.  Northern Nigeria, 1900-1945  The regional British government in Northern Nigeria made exports a high priority and set up a system of regulation to control disease and maintain quality.Ayodeji Olukoju, \\"Government, the Business Community, and Quality Control Schemes in the Agricultural Export Trade of Nigeria, 1889-1929.\\" African Economic History 26 (1998): 99-118. In terms of exports, one of the main agricultural industries involved the production and export of hides and skins. It had been developed long before the British arrived for the precolonial caravan trade and now reached an international market. World demand soared during the two world wars. The regional government imposed new, more efficient procedures in flaying, trimming, and drying hides and skins. It imposed new rules regarding minimum standards, and compulsory inspection, which had the effect of raising quality and obtaining higher prices. European merchants and industrialists had unlimited access to, and sometimes prevailed on, the colonial state, but the latter exercised autonomous decision-making power on matters affecting the economy and commerce of the colony.Akanmu G. Adebayo, \\"The Production and Export of Hides and Skins in Colonial Northern Nigeria, 1900‚Äì1945.\\" Journal of African history 33.2 (1992): 273-300.  National Economic Interests in the Postwar Period  Starting in 1949, when Nigerian's recently emergent labor, commercial, and professional elites were first consulted by the British as part of a constitutional review, the peoples of Nigeria engaged in ongoing debate over the pressure of decolonization, independence, and modernization. The two coup d'√©tats of 1966 and the civil war of 1967-70 reflected economic as well as political elements.Helen Chapin Metz, Nigeria: A Country Study (1992) p. 160. Between 1951 and 1960, the major political parties played leading roles in unifying and locally mobilizing the economic elite. Elites from majority parties in the regional assemblies who cooperated with the ruling federal coalition dispensed a wide range of rewards and sanctions, thus retaining their own positions and power and keeping the masses subordinated. Positions in government services and public corporations, licenses for market stalls, permits for agricultural export production, rights to establish enterprises, roads, electrical service, running water, and the governing group allocated scholarships to its supporters. Each major party was backed by a bank, which assisted in the transfer of substantial public funds to the party.Metz, p. 160 At all levels‚Äîlocal and regional after 1951 and federal after 1954‚Äîpolitical leaders could use a range of controls, extending over local councils, district administration, police, and courts, to subdue any dissident minority, especially in the far north, where clientage was the social adhesive of the emirate system. Political superiors offered protection, patronage, and economic security in exchange for loyalty and the obedience of inferiors.Metz, p. 160/ The elites attracted clients and socially inferior groups not only in the far north, where Islam legitimized the traditional hierarchy, but even in Igboland, an area of southeastern Nigeria where power had been widely dispersed before the 20th century. The elites of the three regions preferred to close ranks to share the fruits of office and to prevent challenges to their positions, but by the time independence was achieved in 1960, policies designed to enhance the security of one regional elite threatened the security of others.Metz, p 160. 1970s-1980s A major feature of Nigeria's economy in the 1980s, as in the 1970s, was its dependence on petroleum, which accounted for 87 percent of export receipts and 77 percent of the federal government's current revenue in 1988. Falling oil output and prices contributed to another noteworthy aspect of the economy in the 1980s‚Äîthe decline in per capita real gross national product, which persisted until oil prices began to rise in 1990. Indeed, GNP per capita per year decreased 4.8 percent from 1980 to 1987, which led in 1989 to Nigeria's classification by the World Bank as a low-income country (based on 1987 data) for the first time since the annual World Development Report was instituted in 1978. In 1989 the World Bank also declared Nigeria poor enough to be eligible (along with countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Chad, and Mali) for concessional aid from an affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA).Metz, p 157. Another relevant feature of the Nigerian economy was a series of abrupt changes in the government's share of expenditures. As a percentage of gross domestic product, national government expenditures rose from 9 percent in 1962 to 44 percent in 1979 but fell to 17 percent in 1988. In the aftermath of the 1967-70 civil war, Nigeria's government became more centralized. The oil boom of the 1970s provided the tax revenue to strengthen the central government further. Expansion of the government's share of the economy did little to enhance its political and administrative capacity but did increase incomes and the number of jobs that the governing elites could distribute to their clients. The economic collapse in the late 1970s and early 1980s contributed to substantial discontent and conflict between ethnic communities and nationalities, adding to the political pressure to expel more than 2 million illegal workers (mostly from Ghana, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad) in early 1983 and May 1985.  Boko Haram's effect on Nigeria's economy  Nigeria has one of the largest populations in Africa with over 200 million citizens. Its economy was booming from the oil industry in the Niger Delta, and was said to become the leading economy in Africa by 2020. Although their economy was doing well, 35 percent live in absolute poverty. Approximately 90 million Nigerians are believed to live on less than one US dollar a day. With economic insecurity, high unemployment rates, and poverty the Boko Haram was able to emerge within Nigeria as political protests. Boko Haram is a violent social group that arose, partly in response to the social and economic deprivation of Nigeria's northeastern population. Starting out around 2008, Boko Haram has carried out attacks in order to spread their Islamic influence and defeat the westernization that began during colonialism. They were able to recruit among the youth population of Nigeria because of youth unemployment; approximately 64 million youths are unemployed with 1.6 million being underemployed. Boko Haram targets individuals or organizations who encourage lifestyles believed to follow western culture, like the US or Europe. One targeted attack was on women who were attacked while attending school, leading to roughly 250 girls being kidnapped. The Boko Haram are responsible for roughly 10,000 deaths since 2011 and roughly 2.6 million displaced Nigerians. Nigeria's economy suffered when attacks held by the Boko Haram began on local businesses, government buildings, and local facilities such as schools and churches. Local businesses began to migrate south as a result of being attacked or due to fear of the Boko Haram. Roughly 80 percent of the businesses in Kano had to close down due to power failure and security challenges caused by attacks. In the capital city of Borno, Maiduguri, a major market known as Market Monday was drastically hit by the Boko Haram causing over 10,000 shops to have to close. Banks were said to be affected by the Boko Haram's violent attacks, and caused them to shorten their hours from eight to three hours to minimize the risk of getting hit by the Boko Haram; limiting citizens to their finances. Citizens and the government had to pay for the retribution of damages caused by the Boko Haram. This stalled the economy in the northeast region because businesses were leaving, people began to lose jobs, and there was less money going into the local economy. Foreign investors began to withdraw their money from Nigeria because of the state of conflict Nigeria is in and the degrading economy as a result of the Boko Haram; causing Nigeria to lose 1.33 trillion dollars in foreign investments. Nigerian refugees who were displaced or just seeking refuge from the Boko Haram migrated to neighboring countries such as Cameroon, Ghana, Niger, and Chad. Majority citizens migrated to the southern half of Nigeria where there are more opportunities for work, better economy, and more security. This further plays into the socioeconomic divide between the north and the south of Nigeria where the south is more financially stable from lack of conflict, government funding, and the oil industry in the Niger Delta.

Lynx is based on a sliding window protocol with two to sixteen packets per window (or \\"block\\"), and 64 bytes of data per packet. It also applies run length encoding (RLE) to the data on a per-block basis to compress suitable data. Lynx was developed by Matthew Thomas, who released it as shareware in 1989. The protocol was supported primarily by the Lynx program, and appears to have seen little or no support in bulletin board systems (BBSs) or online services. Techniques The Lynx program was run from the command line to start transfers, there is no documented example of a 3rd party terminal emulator supporting the system. The protocol was relatively simple, largely identical to WXMODEM with the exception that it used fixed-size 64-byte packets in windows of two to sixteen packets, rather than one to four 128-byte packets in WXMODEM. Error recovery was handled by reducing the window size rather than the packet size. CRC-32 was used to detect errors. Like TeLink, Lynx also included a separate header packet that contained file information: * File name (8 character body, 3 character extension) * Original time/date stamp (optional) * File length (exact length of files is preserved by Lynx) * Lynx version number (practically useless) This allowed file transfers to be automated, sending multiple files in a single session by having the receiver extract the names of the files as they were received. The Lynx program allowed up to 99 files to be sent in a batch, although there is no limit in the protocol itself. Lynx tests each block for compressibility before transmitting it. RLE compression is used for this operation. Generally, a block containing text information will be compressed. Archived, ZIPped, or other compressed files will likely not be further condensed by this technique. Note that Lynx will always optimize the transmission of each block, if RLE decreases the block length, it will be used; otherwise, the uncompressed packet will be sent. Lynx required 8-bit clean links and did not include any sort of escaping. It only supports CTS/RTS hardware handshaking, is considered valid data.

Reid. It is the second book of the War of the Spider Queen series, set in the Forgotten Realms fictional universe of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Plot summary The party led by Quenthel Baenre journeys to the drow city of Ched Nasad in hopes of learning more about Lloth's silence. The beginning of the book is mostly a running battle as Quenthel Baenre foolishly commands the party to travel through the domain of Kaanyr Vhok who immediately dispatches his Tanarukk soldiers (led by an Alu-fiend) to destroy the party. The Alu-fiend takes an interest in Pharaun Mizzrym early but continues to harry them. The party eventually makes it to Ched Nasad. Once there, they realize Ched Nasad is in real danger. The city is very much in conflict as the lesser races have taken to the streets and violence is around every corner. One of Ched Nasad's noble houses has contracted with a Duergar mercenary band to attack the city (A plot which they believe will ultimately make their house rise to power). Unfortunately for the drow, the duergar do too good of a job with their stonefire bombs and in the ensuing battle Ched Nasad is destroyed. Quenthel's party fights at every turn to try and escape the doomed city and eventually they reach a portal (with the help of two new female additions to the party named Halisstra Melarn and Danifae). The book ends just as the drow party escape through the portal and the City's Calcified web strands give out causing Ched Nasad to fall to its doom. This book introduces the characters Halisstra and Danifae to the drow party, both of whom go on to become prominent in the rest of the series.

It is the third book of the War of the Spider Queen series, set in the Forgotten Realms setting of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Plot summary This is the third book in the War of the Spider Queen series. After emerging from the portal that they used to escape the city of Ched Nasad, the drow party plans its next phase of the mission. They decide to consult a priest of Vhaerun to see if any of the other deities know what has become of the drow goddess Lloth. Valas Hune knows where such a priest can be found and believes that this priest may help them in their quest. Valas' friend is far away, however, and the last thing that the party wants is to travel a huge distance to get to them, so on Pharaun Mizzrym's advice they decide to shadow walk to get there. The journey has some minor battles but nothing this group can't handle. They end up back in the Underdark after their journey and in the Domain of the duergar. It becomes evident that to get where they are going, they must travel through the home city of the duergar and will need passports to get through unharmed. The group rests for days in the city while they search for means to obtain these documents. Meanwhile, in Menzoberranzan, Gromph Baenre learns of an impending duergar invasion, and rushes to alert the ruling council until the lichdrow Lord Dyrr stops him. A duel is fought in Gromph's own sanctuary, but the lich prevails and imprisons Gromph in a glass sphere. Eventually, Matron Triel Baenre does learn of the impending duergar attack (Nimor Imphraezl posing as a drow commander from House Agrach Dyrr informs them), and the decision is made to send Menzoberranzan's army to the Pillars of Woe to destroy the duergar. Nimor's trap is thus set. The Army of the Black Spider is almost utterly destroyed in the ensuing encounter (and would have been if it were not for the ferocity of House Baenre troops). The army limps back to Menzoberranzan, leaving a token force behind to slow the duergar. Quenthel Baenre's drow party eventually escapes the duergar city and makes it to Valas' contact (Halisstra Melarn is captured by surface elves during this journey). They are told by Valas' priest friend to journey to Myth Drannor and acquire a magical item. After an intense battle with devils and a beholder, the group finally returns. The last part of the book entails the party's journey to the Abyss (in astral form, not physical) to inspect for themselves what has happened to Lloth. They come to a great barrier to Lloth's domain in the shape of a huge visage of a female face. They are powerless to get through the barrier and are about to give up when the god Vhaerun materializes and strikes the visage with his godly power. He is about to break through when the god Selvetarm (Lloth's guardian) materializes and fights him. The drow party realizes that the power of the gods is too much for them and must kill the priest of Vhaeraun to escape the Abyss. They flee the stronghold of the priest stunned and shaken.

It is the fourth book of the War of the Spider Queen series, set in the Forgotten Realms setting of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Plot summary Pharaun summons Jeggred's father, the demon Belshazu, and interrogates him to find a portal to the Abyss. Belshazu tries to escape, and during the commotion, Ryld Argith and Halisstra Melarn leave the party to pursue their own ends among the surface. Pharaun successfully binds the demon, and learns there is a demon ship that sails on the plane of shadow, and can take them to the Abyss. The party then journeys to an aboleth-filled lake to find this ship, and Quenthel Baenre and Pharaun both devise schemes to get rid of the other.

Gromph Baenre awakens in a cave nearby, trapped in a small sphere, but with the help of his familiar escapes. He is captured by an Illithid, but by using his cunning drow intellect he is able to defeat the foe. He finds an amulet of light and binds it to Nimor, trapping him in the Shadow Plane. Ryld and Halisstra are happy together, and she eventually converts to the followers of Eilistraee.

Gromph Baenre, after being transported by Dyrr to \\"Halfling Heaven\\" returns and is near victory over the lichdrow when Nimor Imphraezl interferes. The spell duel continues until Dyrr polymorphs himself into a Gigant and petrifies Gromph. Only with Triel's help does Gromph continue the fight and finally destroy the Lichdrow's physical body by breaking his staff, releasing a devastating magical discharge. Nimor flees from the battle after he is warned that Lloth is awakening. The second major event in the book is the duel between Jeggred Baenre and Ryld Argith. Danifae sends Jeggred to kill Ryld using a portal. The battle takes place in a large swamp where Jeggred doggedly pursues Ryld even after being interrupted by many local beasts. The duo finally crash into a human logging camp where events become rather chaotic. Jeggred slaughters most of the loggers and uses their leader's enchanted axe to break Splitter.

Plot summary Quenthel Baenre, Pharaun Mizzrym, Jeggred Baenre, and Danifae continue their journey in the Demonweb Pits without Valas Hune, who disappears shortly before the story begins. Halisstra Melarn, with her new faith in Eilistraee, the Dancing Goddess, journeys with Uluyara and Feliane to fulfill her destiny as the slayer of Lolth, the Spider Queen, Goddess of Chaos. As the journey continues, Both Quenthel's and Hallistra's groups are attacked by numerous beings along the way, soon coming into combat with each other. Quenthel's companions easily defeat Hallistra's, sacrificing the drow Uluyara to Lolth in the process. Danifae strikes Halisstra down in the battle and leaves, believing her former mistress to be dead. Hallistra awakens later, however, bitter and angry. In her rage over losing, and her rage at Eilistraee for allowing it to happen, she throttles Feliane's weak body and soon destroys the Crescent Blade. This turns her from Eilistraee's faith back to her faith in Lolth. Quenthel's group later runs into a mercenary demon army, hired by Vhaeraun, the Masked Lord, in order to thwart his mother's plans and cause Lolth to die. Quenthel summons an extremely powerful demon, and Danifae summons a monstrous horde of spiders, which attack the assembled demonic forces. Halisstra, who followed Danifae, now attacks her in revenge for their earlier battle. Before either priestess becomes victorious, Lolth's tabernacle, the Spider Queen's inner chamber, opens, beckoning all three of her priestesses forth. Pharaun, magically paralyzed from a fight with a demon mage, is left on the ground to die at the hands of a host of spiders. Danifae, Halisstra, and Quenthel enter Lolth's tabernacle and are confronted by Lolth, in the form of 8 giant black widow spiders. The eighth and largest spider grabs Danifae, sucks her empty, and is then slaughtered by the other seven spiders. Danifae is in fact the Yor'thae, or Chosen of Lolth. From the gore rises a new form, essentially a giant black widow body with Danifae's torso. The Spider Queen instructs Quenthel to return to her position as Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, and punishes Halisstra for her heresy. Halisstra, now the 'battle-captive', is transformed into the Lady Penitent, reborn to eternally hunt and kill worshipers of Lolth's daughter, son, and former consort. Before returning to Menzoberranzan, Quenthel sacrifices Jeggred to the resurrected Lolth as a gift, and as punishment for opposing Quenthel earlier.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 15, 2011 is one of the principal creeks which runs out of the Berkeley Hills in the East Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. In its upper stretch, it passes entirely within the city limits of Berkeley, and marks the city limit with the adjacent city of Albany in its lower section. Before European settlement, Codornices probably had no direct, permanent connection to San Francisco Bay. Like many other small creeks, it filtered through what early maps show as grassland to a large, northward-running salt marsh and slough that also carried waters from Marin Creek and Schoolhouse Creek.http://www.fivecreeks.org/maps/#coastal_survey (1856 map), http://www.fivecreeks.org/maps/#land_case_map (1861 map) A channel was cut through in the 19th Century, and Codornices flows directly to San Francisco Bay by way of a narrow remnant slough adjacent to Golden Gate Fields racetrack.Friends of Five Creeks Colonial period to 1900 The name derives from the Spanish word \\"codornices\\", meaning \\"quails\\". California valley quail were once common in the area. The name was given by one of the Peraltas, owners of the vast Rancho San Antonio. Luis Maria Peralta, military governor at San Jose, divided the land grant among his sons, giving the area that now is Berkeley and Albany to Domingo, who built his home on the banks of Codornices Creek. The first of his dwellings was an adobe which was destroyed in the 1868 Hayward earthquake on October 21, 1868. He replaced it with a wooden structure which was razed in the 1930s for an apartment building. Both were located on the high banks of Codornices Creek across from the site of what today is St. Mary's College High School (Roman Catholic) near the Westbrae district of Berkeley. In the 19th century, a quarry was opened at one of the heads of Codornices Creek in the La Loma district. It was replaced by a city park in the late 1960s. Another feeder comes down from Remillard Park. Others, on private land, have lovely small waterfalls. Napoleon Bonaparte Byrne, a wealthy Missourian who crossed the plains before the Civil War, attempted to farm along the creek and built his large home (burned in the 1980s) on the south bank of the creek above today's Oxford Street. The Byrne family was accompanied by two freed slaves, believed to have been Berkeley's earliest African American residents. Byrne's property was later acquired by Henry Berryman, a developer who in 1877 built Berryman Reservoir south of today's Codornices Park, above Euclid. The reservoir became part of the East Bay Municipal Utility District system and was enlarged and covered, but has been drained because of fears it might rupture in an earthquake. In 2010 construction was begun on a replacement, a large tank on the site which was put into service in 2013. Early 20th century From 1912 to 1928, a 275-foot-long wooden streetcar and road trestle spanned Codornices Creek along Euclid Avenue. In 1928, the trestle was filled in and a culvert laid through it for the creek.Key System Streetcars, Vernon Sappers, Signature Press, 2007, pp. 175, 208 Codornices Creek was recognized early for its beauty. In 1914, the Berkeley City Council voted to acquire Live Oak Park (north of Rose Street between Shattuck and Oxford) as Berkeley's first \\"nature park.\\" In 1915, Codornices Park was opened along the east side of Euclid Avenue. In that streetcar era, both parks had busy club houses (now gone; Live Oak's was replaced by the current community center) and large picnic areas with stone fireplaces (still existing). Across Euclid from this park, the WPA constructed the Berkeley Rose Garden during the 1930s. The creek once flowed into a swimming hole below today's Henry Street, but today enters a culvert above Henry. This culvert was installed to carry the creek under the extensive fill emplaced along Henry Street by the Southern Pacific when it extended the Berkeley Branch steam line for its new East Bay Electric Lines. Much of the material used for the fill came from the excavation of the nearby Northbrae Tunnel (constructed 1910 by the Southern Pacific). For a time before the fill was emplaced, a wooden trestle also spanned the creek in this locale.Berkeley Gazette, special Progress Edition, October 27, 1966, p.31 (includes photo) Later, a steel bridge spanned a gap left in the fill over Eunice Street. The overcrossing was removed when the Key System ceased running its F-train here in 1958, and more fill was added to bring the uphill portion of Eunice up to the level of Henry Street. The lower portion of Eunice now deadends at a retaining wall below Henry. Downstream, Berkeley's first zoning designated the marshy area near the creek and railroad tracks for \\"noxious industries.\\" In the 1920s, the city built a garbage incinerator just south of the creek channel at Second Street, across from today's city Transfer Station. The incinerator failed, and the building became a slaughterhouse. (Today it is an official historic landmark, part of a storage company.) Other industries edging the creek included a gas plant and scrap-metal yard. Late 20th to early 21st centuries Codornices Creek may have escaped burial in pipes because much of it formed the Berkeley‚ÄìAlbany border, making projects complicated. It is Berkeley's most intact creek, in and out of culverts, mostly at streets. Some of the longer covered portions are below Neilson Street, San Pablo Avenue, Eastshore Highway, and Interstate 80. The creek exits this last culvert into a narrow tidal slough‚Äîthe remnant of the former salt marsh - that makes a right turn to follow between Golden Gate Fields Racetrack and the I-80/I-580 freeway, following the creek's original northward course to San Francisco Bay. Just south of Buchanan Street in Albany, this channel widens into a small salt marsh. This marsh in turn empties into the Albany tide flats and San Francisco Bay via four pipes under Buchanan Street. After a brief post-World War II boom, the industries that had polluted the lower creek began to wither. The University of California bought the housing that had been used for shipyard workers and then returning G.I.s, and used it for student families. Contemplating expansion, the University had creek meanders straightened in the 1960s. But it was then largely left alone, its increasingly cleaner water shaded by volunteer bushes and trees. Upstream, water quality also improved by better sewer systems and, as the environmental movement got started, public education about keeping pollutants out of storm drains. Most of the channel was deeply incised and overgrown, making for cool water and undisturbed habitat. At some unknown time, perhaps in the 1980s, steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)) found their way to the creek and began to reproduce. Citizen work to restore the creek began in the 1970s with planting of natives at Codornices Park by Los Amigos de Codornices. In 1995, efforts of the nonprofit Urban Creeks Council and Richard Register's Ecocity Builders led to a block of the creek between Eighth and Ninth Streets being \\"daylighted\\"‚Äîthat is, removed from a culvert. In the late 1990s, the volunteer group Friends of Five Creeks, planting natives at the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) crossing, discovered the return of the steelhead/rainbow trout. This encouraged further restoration, notably below Albina Street adjacent to St. Mary's College High School, carried out by the Urban Creeks Council in 2007. In the late 1990s, the University of California Berkeley needed to replace the World War II-era student-family housing. Stricter regulations and the need for flood control led to a collaboration with the City of Albany and, to a lesser extent, Berkeley, aimed at giving the creek a more meandering channel, with native plantings, along the south edge of University Village. By 2010, restoration extended from the Union Pacific tracks upstream to the earlier restoration at Eighth Street. There are hopes to extend it to San Pablo Avenue, and to restore a shorter portion just upstream at Kains Street, creating a mini-park next to subsidized housing. If Golden Gate Fields racetrack were to move, some of the large salt marsh could be restored in its place. In April 2019, many fish in the creek were killed by retardant foam used by Berkeley firefighters to prevent a gas-tank explosion. Ecology The creek's steelhead trout population climbed to some 500 individuals by 2006 according to surveys. On December 3, 2012 a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was videotaped in the creek, the first sighting in recent history.

The Berengarian sect, considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church, is said to have numbered 800,000 according to the historian Belamine.Alien Baptism and The Baptist Classification as heresy The Roman Catholic Church held considerable power in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. Those clergy and theologians whom it judged guilty of heresy could be excommunicated and exiled or sentenced to death unless they formally recanted their errors. John Scotus Eriugena, a philosopher-theologian and intellectual heir of Maximus the Confessor, had maintained in the ninth century that there was no physical transformation of the Eucharist. Later in 1047, Berengar of Tours reignited the debate in the name of Erigena. During the next 30 years, Berengar was asked to recant his heresy concerning what would be declared the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation no less than five times including a short spell in prison. He later retired into solitude and made no further pronouncements on the matter. Followers of the heresy It is known that an early supporter of Berengar was Bishop Eusebius of Angers, although he later renounced the heresy. Although it is known that Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou secured Berengar's release from prison, it is unlikely that it was more than political point scoring. The historian Belamine said that the supporters numbered 800,000 by 1160. His followers were divided on the head of the Eucharist; though they all agreed that the bread and wine were not essentially changed, some allowed it to be changed in effect, though under an impanation, which was the opinion of Berenger himself. Others denied any change at all, and resolved all into figure. Yet others allowed a change in part, and others an entire change, with the restriction that to those who presented themselves unworthily, it was changed back again. Influence on the reformers As Berengar left no written tracts it is moot what influence the Berengarians had on the Protestant Reformation. While John Calvin rejected the theory of transubstantiation in favor of \\"pneumatic presence,\\" earlier Martin Luther criticized the making of this teaching into a dogma as well as some of its metaphysical underpinnings and implications.

A. Salvatore, the first book in The Dark Elf Trilogy, a prequel to The Icewind Dale Trilogy. It follows the story of Drizzt Do'Urden from the time and circumstances of his birth and his upbringing amongst the drow (dark elves). Plot introduction The book takes the reader into Menzoberranzan, the city of drow that is Drizzt's homeland. From here, the reader follows Drizzt on his quest to follow his principles in the cruel and competitive society of his underground homeland where such feelings are threatened. Plot summary Drizzt was born to the tenth noble House of Menzoberranzan, Daermon Na'shezbaernon (more commonly known as House Do'Urden). He was the son of Malice, the Do'Urden Matron Mother and her consort, Do'Urden weaponmaster (and sometime Patron) Zaknafein. As the third son, drow culture demanded that Drizzt be sacrificed to their goddess Lolth. However, the death of his older brother, and the first son, Nalfein, (incidentally, at the treacherous hand of the second son, Dinin) in the battle against House DeVir which raised Daermon Na'shezbaernon to the 9th ranked in the city during his birth, made him the second son and spared him. Being a male in the matriarchal drow society, Drizzt Do'Urden suffered considerable abuse at the hands of his family, particularly his eldest sister Briza, in the first sixteen years of his life. His first ten years were spent as a page prince in the care of his sister Vierna; though she was far from kind, in his later years Drizzt would recall some affection for her, stemming from the fact they shared paternity through Zaknafein. As a child, Drizzt displayed amazing reflexes and coordination. Consequently, Zaknafein was able to persuade Malice that Drizzt should become a warrior, instead of replacing Nalfein as the house wizard. Thus, at the age of sixteen, Drizzt began his weapons training. He began learning the skills that would lead him to become one of the most formidable swordsmen in both the Underdark, and Faer√ªn. At twenty years of age, he went to the Academy, specifically Melee-Magthere, Menzoberranzan's warrior academy, where he excelled in his studies despite his resistance to the attempted brainwashing by the masters of the academy. When it was clear that there were none in Drizzt's class who could beat him, the masters of the academy matched him against students three years above him. Drizzt defeated that class easily. His time at the academy would have been perfect (by Drow standards) except for the graduation ceremony, where he disgraced himself by not taking part in a ritual, refusing the advances of two high priestesses, one of them his sister, Vierna, and damning Lolth. Vierna, angered by Drizzt's defiance, showed him what happened to those who defied the Spider Queen: she took him to a drider's lair. She started to leave him there, but Drizzt's mother interfered and saved Drizzt from certain death by the driders. She threatened to turn Drizzt into one of the hideous creatures if she heard of any more defiance from him. He graduated with honors, even though he did not participate in the ceremony. He believed that no one really noticed his absence from the ceremony because the others were wrapped up in the moment. He began patrolling the Underdark with his assigned patrol group. He witnessed first hand the cruelty his race showed the other races of the Underdark. Not long after graduation, he took part in a surface raid in which he saved the life of a child of the most bitter enemy of the drow, the surface elves, by hiding her body underneath the corpse of her murdered mother. Zaknafein, having similar morals to Drizzt, believed he had killed the child, but Lolth knew he allowed the child to survive and House Do'Urden fell out of the Spider Queen's tenuous favor. Zaknafein, fearing that Drizzt had succumbed to the evil ways of the drow, fought with Drizzt, and was told the truth of the matter by his son. Upon hearing Drizzt say that he had no part in the murder of the surface elves, Zaknafein became ecstatic, and revealed that Drizzt was indeed his child. They planned to escape House Do'Urden and live in the caverns of the Underdark. Unfortunately, Matron Malice and her daughters, in a bid to find out why Do'Urden was no longer in Lolth's favor, were watching. They knew that the only way to rectify the situation was to offer Drizzt up as a sacrifice to Lolth. Malice informed Zaknafein of the plan to sacrifice their son, and to stop it from happening, Zaknafein offered himself to replace Drizzt. This was Malice's intention all along. She believed that once Zaknafein was dead that Drizzt would begin behaving like a proper drow noble, and would take the position of weapon master with pride. When Drizzt learned of his father's demise, he confronted Matron Malice. She told him, cruelly and with much delight, that Zaknafein had been sacrificed to Lolth in order to regain the Spider Queen's favor. She told Drizzt that he was to serve as the house's new weapon master. Drizzt refused outright and, using one of Zaknafein's weapons - an exploding ball of light - escaped into the Underdark.

She stated the novel was an impressive start to the characterization of Drizzt. Pornokitsch, in their review of Homeland, wrote that \\"Mr. Salvatore displays tiny fragments of being able to write the drow as a compelling race, but abandons these efforts and indulges himself in making them as evil as possible instead. The result does no favors to either Drizzt's character or the book as a whole.\\" The comics adaption of Homeland, volume 1, received a positive review from George Galuschak of Kliatt magazine, who said, \\"I am not a big sword & sorcery buff, but I enjoyed this graphic novel.

There he met with much adversity because of his race, but also found his true calling in life as a ranger, during his time with a blind ranger named Montolio.

He stated he found the book short and although not incredible, it was an important component of the Drizzt mythos. According to PopMatters' Andrew Welsh, Drizzt is Salvatore's attempt to create a multifaceted character who faces internal struggles, in hopes of standing out from the drow, and fantasy fiction in general.

While people from St. Joseph's parish are often buried at Mount Olivet, the cemetery is not part of the parish. History The parish was originally established in 1872 by Father Thomas J. O'Reilly for the Catholics living just south of Dubuque in Mosalem and Table Mound townships. Father James Ward was the first resident pastor. In the late 1940s another Saint Joseph's Church was established about three miles away in Dubuque. This led to confusion on the part of people between the two parishes, at times one parish would receive mail meant for the other. As a result, St. Joseph's in Dubuque eventually changed its name to Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in the 1990s.

He was one of a few composers from the Low Countries who remained in his native land throughout the turbulent period of religious conflict in the late 16th century. He was a skilled composer of chansons, motets and madrigals.Kristin Forney. \\"Andreas Pevernage\\". In: Deane L. Root (ed.). Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Retrieved 29 October 2010 Life Pevernage was born in Harelbeke, a small town near to Kortrijk, and probably spent his boyhood years as a singer in the church in Kortrijk. He became the choirmaster at the church of St Salvator in Brugge (Bruges in French) on 21 January 1563, and later that same year became choirmaster at the Onze Lieve Vrouwkerk (Notre Dame) in Kortrijk. In 1564 he became chaplain there, and rose to the position of permanent vicar in 1569. Also in Kortrijk, he joined the guild of St. Cecilia, for which he wrote some of his music. Title page of Encomium Musices, showing Pevernage's six-part motet 'Nata et grata polo', engraved and published by Philip Galle, c. 1590 Encomium Musices at Wurlitzer-Bruck The religious wars of the 16th century ravaged the Netherlands as they had adjacent regions, and war came to Kortrijk. He fled the city in 1577 or 1578 with his family when the Calvinists took over; they had little use for music, and as a Roman Catholic he was unsafe during this period of persecution; his family went to Antwerp, where they stayed until the next year, during which Pevernage was appointed to the post of choirmaster in Bruges. However, Calvinists captured this town as well, and Pevernage was out of a job until 1584, at which time he regained his former employment in Kortrijk. On 29 October 1585 he was appointed choirmaster at the cathedral in Antwerp; this was shortly after the Spanish capture of the town (see Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585); the Protestant rebels had been forcibly ejected from the city in August). One of Pevernage's activities there was to rebuild the extensive music library, which had been ransacked and burned by Calvinists. He remained at this post until his death in 1591, and was buried in the cathedral. Music Pevernage was a fairly prolific composer of both sacred and secular vocal music; of his output, about 235 pieces (115 sacred, 120 secular) remain. No specifically instrumental music has survived. His output of sacred includes six masses, published in Antwerp after his death (1602), for from five to seven voices; a collection of motets entitled Cantiones sacrae (1578), which also includes some secular works, many of which are occasional pieces written in honor of local nobility, including Margaret of Parma; and a group of 14 Marian antiphons, like the masses published posthumously. Stylistically they are typical of late-16th-century practice, alternating homophonic and polyphonic textures, and using groups of voices in alternation in a cori spezzati style; the influence of the Venetian school was felt even as far away as the Netherlands. Pevernage also wrote Italian madrigals, in Italian; it was a wildly popular form even in northern Europe (the vogue in England was just beginning in the late 1580s), and also wrote many French chansons, published in four separate books. They make use of syncopation, melismas, and complex rhythms. Notes References and further reading Kamiel Cooremans, \\"Andreas Pevernage\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

History Electric Road remained unnamed when the Hong Kong Tramway was completed in 1904. In 1913, Hongkong Electric built a new power station on the new reclamation of North Point to replace the one in Wan Chai. Its operation was delayed until summer 1919 because of World War I. The operation of the power station spurred the development of North Point. In 1929 after the improvement of the road, it was named 'Electric Road' after the power station.

It founded in 2002 by a group of local residents, including Tova Hartman. Shira Hadasha's prayer service format has been adopted by a number of congregations in Israel, the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Practices Shira Hadasha was the first Jewish congregation to implement the Halakhic opinions of Rabbis Mendel Shapiro and Daniel Sperber on the role of women in the synagogue. The congregation combines a traditional liturgy with certain prayer leadership opportunities for women, including leading Kabbalat Shabbat, reciting Pesukei DeZimra, removing and replacing the Torah in the Ark, and reading the Torah on Saturday mornings. A mechitza separating men and women runs down the middle of the room. Parts of the service requiring a minyan do not begin until both 10 men and 10 women are present. Criticism A number of Orthodox rabbis have publicly disagreed with Shira Hadasha's mode of worship. Rabbi Yaakov Ariel, chief rabbi of Ramat Gan and a prominent religious Zionist rabbi, has ruled that \\"people should not pray in this synagogue\\". Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba has stated that \\"anyone who is truly God-fearing will not join in such a minyan since this is how the breaking of Jewish tradition begins. Today they do this, and in the future the result will be women and men praying completely together.\\" Rabbi Gil Student has also weighed in against the practice, as have Rabbis Aryeh Frimer and Dov Frimer, who wrote that \\"these practices are a radical break from the ritual of millennia and have not received the approval of any major posek\\".

V1BR acts as a receptor for vasopressin. AVPR1B belongs to the subfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. Its activity is mediated by G proteins which stimulate a phosphatidylinositol- calcium second messenger system. It is a major contributor to homeostasis and the control of water, glucose, and salts in the blood. Arginine vasopressin has four receptors, each of which are located in different tissues and have specific functions. AVPR1b is a g-protein coupled pituitary receptor that has only recently been characterized because of its rarity. It has been found that the 420-amino-acid sequence of the AVPR1B receptor shared the most overall similarities with the AVP1A, AVP2 and oxytocin receptors. AVPR1B maps to chromosome region 1q32 and is a member of the vasopressin/oxytocin family subfamily.  Tissue distribution  AVPR1B was initially described as a novel vasopressin receptor located in the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates ACTH release. Subsequent studies have shown that it is also present in the brain and some peripheral tissues.  Clinical significance  = Behavioral = Inactivation of the Avpr1b gene in mice (knockout) produces mice with greatly reduced aggression and a reduced ability to recognize recently investigated mice. Defensive behaviour and predatory behaviours appear normal in these knockout mice, but there is evidence that social motivation or awareness is reduced. The AVPR1B antagonist, SSR149415, has been shown to have anti-aggressive actions in hamsters and anti-depressant- and anxiety (anxiolytic)-like behaviors in rats. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with susceptibility to depression in humans. = Metabolic = Various stress-induced elevations of ACTH are blunted in the Avpr1b knockout mouse. = Oncology = AVPR1B is expressed at high levels in ACTH- secreting pituitary adenomas as well as in bronchial carcinoids responsible for the ectopic ACTH syndrome.  Ligands  Nelivaptan (SSR149415) and D-[Leu4-Lys8]-vasopressin are a specific antagonist and agonist for the vasopressin 1b receptor, respectively. Function AVPR1B is found in different parts of the body and thus has several influences and regulatory actions. Arginine vasopressin influences several symptoms related to affective disorders including significant memory processes, pain sensitivity, synchronization of biological rhythms and the timing and quality of REM sleep. Studies have shown that AVPR1B deficiencies produce behavioral changes that can be reversed when the peptide is replaced. These effects are expressed through contact with specific plasma membrane receptors. AVPR1B is responsible for fueling the effects of vasopressin on ACTH release. This interaction takes place as Arginine Vasopressin works with corticotropin releasing hormone to stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH. AVPR1b is then responsible for mediating the stimulatory effect of vasopressin on ACTH release. Several G proteins are also involved in the signal transduction pathways linked with AVPR1B. These relationships depend on the level of receptor expression and concentration of vasopressin. For example, AVPR1B causes secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary cells in a dose-dependent relationship by activating protein kinase C via the Gq/11 protein. Application There have been several experiments which have studied these interactions further and revealed AVPR1B‚Äôs role in psychological disorders and regulatory functions. Haplotypes of AVPR1B are associated with increased protective effects to recurrent major depression. AVPR1B has also been associated with higher cortisol responses to psychosocial stress in children with psychiatric disorders compared with carriers of glucocorticoid receptor gene. AVPR1b has also shown involvement in regulation of brain water content and cerebral edema. This was revealed as increased levels of AVPR1B mRNA on the choroid plexus were discovered as a result of increased plasma osmolality. The increase after a reduction of brain water content from salt water loading indicated AVPR1B‚Äôs role in the neuroendocrine feedback loop in maintaining normal central nervous system fluid balance.

The quenching results in the formation of metastable martensite, the fraction of which is reduced to the desired amount during tempering. This is the most common state for finished articles such as tools and machine parts. In contrast, the same steel composition in annealed state is softer, as required for forming and machining. Depending on the temperature and composition of the steel, it can be hardened or softened. To make steel harder, it must be heated to very high temperatures. The final result of exactly how hard the steel becomes depends on the amount of carbon present in the metal. Only steel that is high in carbon can be hardened and tempered. If a metal does not contain the necessary quantity of carbon, then its crystalline structure cannot be broken, and therefore the physical makeup of the steel cannot be altered. Frequently, the term \\"hardening\\" is associated with tempered steel. Both processes are used hand in hand when hardening steel. The two part process begins with hardening the steel so that it becomes hard and does not wear over time. However, very often, this process leaves the steel very brittle and susceptible to breaking during use. Tempering reduces the hardness of the forged steel very slightly but improves the overall product as it results in steel that is much less brittle. An electric arc furnace being tapped. Hardening and tempering The two major processes of hardening and tempering can be broken down into four major steps. First, a piece of carbon steel is heated gradually until it reaches a temperature above the alloy's critical temperature. The steel is then quenched, usually in water or oil (though other quenches, such as brine or sodium hydroxide solutions, are sometimes used to achieve a particular result). The steel is now at that given alloy's maximum hardness, but as stated above, also brittle. At this point, tempering is usually performed to achieve a more useful balance of hardness and toughness. The steel is gradually heated until the desired temper colours are drawn, generally at a temperature significantly lower than the alloy's critical temperature. Different colours in the temper spectrum reflect different balances of hardness to toughness, so different temper levels are appropriate for different applications. The steel is then re-quenched to 'fix' the temper at the desired level. A talented smith or metalworker can fine-tune the performance of a steel tool or item to precisely what is required based solely on careful observation of temper colours. A visual representation of this process may make the concept easier to understand. thumbnail Hardened Steel 3D Printing Nozzle Testing for hardened steel It is not easy to determine if steel has undergone the hardening and tempering process by simply looking at it, but there is a reliable and simple test.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGcRFYV018 To examine a piece of steel, obtain a hand file and file an edge of the selected metal. If the piece of steel has not undergone the hardening process, the metal file should easily 'bite' into the sample. If the metal has been hardened, the file fails to cut into the sample and glances off with little visible effect. Case hardened steel-vickers hardness test Case hardened articles starting as low carbon steel (0.5 - 1.5% carbon content) can also be labeled hardened steel.

AVPR2 belongs to the subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Its activity is mediated by the Gs type of G proteins, which stimulate adenylate cyclase. AVPR2 is expressed in the kidney tubule, predominantly in the membrane of cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, in fetal lung tissue and lung cancer, the last two being associated with alternative splicing. AVPR2 is also expressed outside the kidney in vascular endothelium.Jackson EK (2018). \\"Drugs Affecting Renal Excretory Function\\". In: Brunton LL, Hilal-Dandan R, Knollmann BC. eds. Goodman & Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 13e New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Stimulation causes the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from the endothelial cells. Because von Willebrand factor helps stabilize circulating levels of factor VIII, the vasopressin analog desmopressin can be used to stimulate the AVPR2 receptor and increase levels of circulating factor VIII. This is useful in the treatment of hemophilia A as well as Von Willebrand disease. In the kidney, AVPR2's primary property is to respond to arginine vasopressin by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate the urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism. When the function of AVPR2 is lost, the disease nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) results. Antagonists Vasopressin receptor antagonists that are selective for the V2 receptor include: * Tolvaptan (FDA-approved) * Lixivaptan * Mozavaptan * Satavaptan Their main uses are in hyponatremia, such as that caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, however these agents should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Demeclocycline and lithium carbonate act as indirect antagonists of renal vasopressin V2 receptors by inhibiting activation of the second messenger cascade of the receptors. Pharmacoperones Vasopressin receptor 2 function has been shown to be deleteriously effected by point mutations in its gene. Some of these mutations, when expressed, cause the receptor to remain in the cytosol. An approach to rescue receptor function utilizes pharmacoperones or molecular chaperones, which are typically small molecules that rescue misfolded proteins to the cell surface. These interact with the receptor to restore cognate receptor function devoid of antagonist or agonist activity. This approach, when effective, should increase therapeutic reach. Pharmacoperones have been identified that restore function of V2R.  Interactions  Arginine vasopressin receptor 2 has been shown to interact with C1QTNF1.

Note that in the Netherlands, the radio academy awards are also called Marconi Awards. The Marconi Radio Awards are presented annually by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) to the top radio stations and on-air personalities in the United States. The awards are named in honor of Guglielmo Marconi, the man generally credited as the \\"father of wireless telegraphy\\". NAB member stations submit nominations. A task force determines the finalists and the Marconi Radio Award Selection Academy votes on the winners, who receive their awards in the fall.

As a Naib Subedar, he led the team which conquered the highest peak in the Siachen area as part of Operation Rajiv. The peak was named as \\"Bana Post\\" in his honour.  Early life  Bana Singh was born into a Sikh family in Kadyal in Jammu and Kashmir on 6 January 1949. His father was a farmer and his uncles were soldiers in the Indian Army. He enrolled in the Indian Army on 6 January 1969 into the 8th Battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI). He was trained at the High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg and also at another school at Sonamarg. He was promoted to Naib Subedar from Havildar on 16 October 1985.  Operation Rajiv  In 1987, the strategically important Siachen area had been infiltrated by the Pakistani forces. The Pakistanis had captured an important position, which they called \\"Quaid post\\" (from Quaid-e-Azam, the title of Muhammad Ali Jinnah). The post was located at a height of 6500 metres on the highest peak in the Siachen Glacier area (the peak was later renamed to \\"Bana Top\\" by the Indians, in honour of Bana Singh). From this feature the Pakistanis could snipe at Indian army positions since the height gave a clear view of the entire Saltoro range and Siachen glacier. The enemy post was virtually an impregnable glacier fortress with ice walls, 457 metres high, on either side. On 18 April 1987, the Pakistanis from Quaid Post fired on the Indian troops at Point Sonam (6,400 m), killing two soldiers. The Indian Army then decided to evict the Pakistanis from the Post. Naib Subedar Bana Singh was posted in Siachen on 20 April 1987, as part of the 8th JAK LI regiment, which was given the task of capturing the Quaid Post. On 29 May, a JAK LI patrol led by Second lieutenant Rajiv Pande made at an unsuccessful attempt of capturing the post, resulting in deaths of 10 Indian soldiers. After a month of preparation, the Indian Army launched a fresh operation to capture the post. This operation, called \\"Operation Rajiv\\" in honour of 2/Lt Rajiv Pande, was headed by Major Varinder Singh. Starting on 23 June 1987, Major Varinder Singh's task force launched multiple attacks to capture the post. After initial failures, the 5-member team led by Nb Sub Bana Singh successfully captured the Quaid post on 26 June 1987. Nb Sub Bana Singh and his fellow soldiers, including Chuni Lal, climbed the steep 457 m high wall of ice. The team approached the Quaid Post from an unexpected direction, using a longer and more difficult approach than the other teams. There was a blizzard, resulting in poor visibility, which gave cover to the Indian soldiers. After reaching the top, Nb Sub Bana Singh found that there was a single Pakistani bunker. He lobbed a grenade into the bunker and closed the door, killing those inside. The two sides also got involved in a hand-to-hand combat, in which the Indian soldiers bayoneted some of the Pakistani soldiers outside the bunker. A few Pakistani soldiers jumped off the peak. Later, the Indians found six dead bodies of Pakistani soldiers. On 26 January 1988, Nb Sub Bana Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the highest wartime gallantry medal in India for his bravery during Operation Rajiv. The peak which he captured was renamed Bana Top in his honour. At the time of the Kargil War, he was the only PVC awardee who was still serving in the Army. Param Vir Chakra Citation  The Param Vir Chakra citation on the Official Indian Army Website reads as follows:  After retirement  National War Memorial, New Delhi Nb Sub Bana Singh was promoted Subedar on 1 December 1992, with promotion to Subedar Major on 20 October 1996. He was given the honorary rank of Captain at his retirement. Hony Capt Bana Singh retired from service on 31 October 2000. The Jammu & Kashmir Government gave him a pension of 166 per month. Bana Singh protested against the low amount, pointing out that the neighbouring states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh provided a monthly pension above 10,000 to the Param Vir Chakra awardees. In October 2006, the Punjab Government led by Captain Amarinder Singh announced a cash award of 1,000,000 for him. The cheque was presented to Bana Singh by Amarinder's successor Parkash Singh Badal in March 2007. The Punjab Government also offered him 2,500,000, a monthly allowance of 15,000 and a 25-acre plot (Worth Crores), if he moved to Punjab. However, he refused the offer, saying that he is a resident of J&K.; The J&K; Government named a stadium in the Ranbir Singh Pora area of Jammu after him, and sanctioned an amount of Rs 5,000,000 for its development in 2010. However, in 2013, The Tribune reported that the funds had not been released, and the Bana Singh Memorial Stadium was in a poor shape. Bana Singh's son Rajinder Singh joined the Indian Army in 2008, at the age of 18.

It is generally a wooden handle to which a small ball is attached by a string and that has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including boliche in Spain and balero in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the bilboquet. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called kendama is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity. History The game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then. =Americas= Baleros at a tianguis in Uruapan, Michoacan, Mexico Balero demonstration in Mexico showing a common technique of landing the cup on the stick. In North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin. The Mohave variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings. Other variants include those played by the Inuit of what is now Labrador, with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair. Ring and pin games in general were known as ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk in Inuit dialects. =France= Jeanne B√¥le's L'Enfant au Bilboquet (around 1880) The cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century. The game was played by King Henry III of France as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability. - \\"it is lamentable to read of the pitiful imbecility which could induce the king, the day following his indignant protest, to sally forth from the Louvre at the head of a disorderly troop, and to parade the streets of the capital playing with a cup-and-ball. After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts such as the Marquis de Bi√©vre. The game had its golden age during the reign of Louis XV ‚Äî among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jean-Jacques Rousseau mentions the game early in his Confessions when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying \\"If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say.\\" =Iberian world= The game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora. The name varies across many countries ‚Äî in El Salvador and Guatemala it is called capirucho; in Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico it is called balero; in Spain it is boliche; in Portugal and Brazil it is called bilboqu√™; in Chile it is emboque; in Colombia it is called coca; and in Venezuela the game is called perinola. In 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term zingo paya for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection. =England= This game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as Jane Austen is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called Bilbo Catcher. There is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found. Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other. =Japan= The game of kendama is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century, and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century. =Germany= In 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their yo-yos and kendamas, began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy. Gameplay The main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging. There are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as la simple, la doble, la vertical, la mariquita.

Life In 1943, Filliou became a member of the French Communist Party. After the war in 1947, he travelled to the United States where he worked as a laborer for Coca-Cola in Los Angeles while gaining a master's degree in economics. In 1951, he took dual French-American nationality and worked as a United Nations adviser and was sent to Korea for three years. He lived in Egypt, Spain, Denmark, Canada, and France. Filliou met his wife, Marianne Staffels, in Denmark. Filliou died on 2 December 1987 in a monastery in Les Eyzies, France. Career In 1960, Filliou designed his first visual work, Le Collage de l'immortelle mort du monde (Collage of the Immortal Death of the World), a transcription of a random theater play comparable to a chessboard where individual experiences are expressed. Filliou first proposed \\"Art's Birthday\\" in 1963. He suggested that 1,000,000 years ago, there was no art. But one day, on January 17 to be precise, Art was born. Filliou says it happened when someone dropped a dry sponge into a bucket of water. He also proposed a public holiday to celebrate the presence of art in our lives. Art's Birthday was first publicly celebrated in 1973 in Aachen (i.e., Aix-la-Chapelle), Germany and at the same time in Paris, France. In 1971, Filliou created la R√©publique g√©niale (the Republic of Genius) where people enter its territory to develop their genius rather than their talent and research is no longer the privileged domain of the person who knows, but of the person who does not know. In his work Le Petit Robert Filliou, Filliou defined the principles of Poetic Economics and its scale of values. This work served as the script for a Super 8 film that he made in 1972 with Bob Guiny. In 1974, Filliou produced Recherche sur l'origine, a work made of cloth 90 meters long and 3 meters high where spectators could walk around inside. Video works by Filliou include: 14 Songs and 1 Riddle (1977, document of a performance), And So on, End So Soon: Done 3 times (1977), Porta Filliou (1977), Telepathic Music N√∏7 - The Principle of Equivalence Carried to a Series of 5 (1977), Teaching and Learning as Performings Arts, Part 2, Video (1979). Filliou also produced video works at Vehicule in Montr√©al, and an obscure work done in the basement of the Pompidou. Filliou worked together with artists such as Emmett Williams and George Brecht. In 1982, Filliou received the first Schwitters prize of the city of Hanover. Among the many artists who cherished Robert Filliou's work was Maurizio Nannucci, who actually published him as editor and owner of an avant-garde publishing house.http://www.guggenheim- venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/biografia.php?id_art=178 In 1977, Filliou moved to Canada and continued to work with video. Later, with his wife Marianne Staffels, Filliou withdrew for 3 years 3 months and 3 days to a Buddhist center in Les Eyzies, France. Underscoring Filliou's work is an interest in what defines and constitutes an artwork. A trained political scientist, Filliou was greatly inspired by the work of the feminist and utopian communist philosopher Charles Fourier, especially his concept of 'attractive passions' that championed the concept of work as pleasure. Play and joy occupy crucial roles for Filliou, who believed art making was part of a permanent, universal and endless process deeply embedded everyday life.

Biography  Caffery was born in Franklin, Louisiana, the seat of St. Mary Parish. His great- grandfather, Colonel John Donelson, co-founder of the city of Nashville, was the father-in-law of President of the United States Andrew Jackson. During the American Civil War, Caffery served in the Confederate army as a lieutenant in the 13th Louisiana Infantry Regiment. After the war, he became a lawyer and owned a sugar plantation. He was elected to the Louisiana State Senate, he was a Democrat, and in 1892, he was appointed to the United States Senate from Louisiana to fill the unexpired term of Randall L. Gibson who died in office. Caffery began a full six-year term in 1894, on election by the Louisiana State Legislature, and he served in the Senate until 1901. He was an anti- expansionist. He was the first nominee for President of the United States of the \\"Democratic National Party\\" at its Indianapolis Convention in 1900 but declined the nomination of this group. He declined to seek a second full term in 1900. Strangely, a group of anti-imperialists, meeting in New York on 5 September 1900, also nominated Caffery for President and Boston attorney and historian Archibald M. Howe for Vice President. Caffery, a staunch Democrat, likewise refused this nomination, and Howe quickly withdrew as well. Caffery served as chairman of the Senate Committee on enrolled bills from 1893 to 1894 and as chairman of the Senate Committee on corporations organized in the District of Columbia from 1899 to 1901. After he left the Senate, Caffery resumed practicing law. He died in 1907 on December 30th in New Orleans Louisiana, and is interred at Franklin Cemetery in his native Franklin. Caffery's grandson, Patrick T. Caffery, served one term in the Louisiana House of Representatives and two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1969-73.See also Jefferson Caffery.

As the atoms of interacting molecules (or of different parts of the same molecule - intramolecular BSSE) approach one another, their basis functions overlap. Each monomer \\"borrows\\" functions from other nearby components, effectively increasing its basis set and improving the calculation of derived properties such as energy. If the total energy is minimised as a function of the system geometry, the short-range energies from the mixed basis sets must be compared with the long-range energies from the unmixed sets, and this mismatch introduces an error. Other than using infinite basis sets, two methods exist to eliminate the BSSE. In the chemical Hamiltonian approach (CHA), basis set mixing is prevented a priori, by replacing the conventional Hamiltonian with one in which all the projector-containing terms that would allow mixing have been removed. In the counterpoise method (CP), the BSSE is calculated by re-performing all the calculations using the mixed basis sets, and the error is then subtracted a posteriori from the uncorrected energy. (The mixed basis sets are realised by introducing \\"ghost orbitals\\", basis set functions which have no electrons or protons. It however has been shown that there is an inherent danger in using counterpoise corrected energy surfaces, due to the inconsistent effect of the correction in different areas of the energy surface.) Though conceptually very different, the two methods tend to give similar results. It also has been shown that the error is often larger when using the CP method since the central atoms in the system have much greater freedom to mix with all of the available functions compared to the outer atoms. Whereas in the CHA model, those orbitals have no greater intrinsic freedom and therefore the correction treats all fragments equally. The errors inherent in either BSSE correction disappear more rapidly than the total value of BSSE in larger basis sets.

Her work is often described as surreal, intimate, abstract art, having a preoccupation with the female body. Her artwork is often categorized as feminist art. In a 2011 Guardian exhibition review article, Rist describes her feminism: \\"Politically,\\" she says, \\"I am a feminist, but personally, I am not. For me, the image of a woman in my art does not stand just for women: she stands for all humans. I hope a young guy can take just as much from my art as any woman.\\" Life and career Pipilotti Rist was born Elisabeth Rist in Grabs in the Rhine Valley. Her father is a doctor and her mother is a teacher. She started going by \\"Pipilotti\\", a combination her childhood nickname \\"Lotti\\" with her childhood hero, Astrid Lindgren‚Äôs character Pippi Longstocking, in 1982. Prior to studying art and film, Rist studied theoretical physics in Vienna for one semester. From 1982 to 1986 Rist studied commercial art, illustration, and photography at the University of Applied Arts Vienna in Vienna. She later studied video at the Basel School of Design, Switzerland. From 1988 through 1994, she was member of the music band and performance group Les Reines prochaines. In 1997, her work was first featured in the Venice Biennial, where she was awarded the Premio 2000 Prize. From 2002 to 2003, she was invited by Professor Paul McCarthy to teach at UCLA as a visiting faculty member.

She summarized the plot as \\"a young woman and her friends on a quest to find the right color combinations and with these colors they can free other people from fear and make life better.‚Äù Works During her studies, Pipilotti Rist began making super 8 films. Her works generally last only a few minutes, borrowing from mass-media formats such as MTV and advertising,Catherine M.

Her works generally treat issues related to gender, sexuality, and the human body. Her colorful and musical works transmit a sense of happiness and simplicity. Rist's work is regarded as feminist by some art critics. Her works are held by many important art collections worldwide. In I'm Not The Girl Who Misses Much (1986) Rist dances before a camera in a black dress with uncovered breasts. The images are often monochromatic and fuzzy. Rists repeatedly sings \\"I'm not the girl who misses much,\\" a reference to the first line of the song \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" by the Beatles. As the video approaches its end, the image becomes increasingly blue and fuzzy and the sound stops.Holly, Rogers, Sounding the Gallery: Video and the Rise of Art-Music [Oxford University Press, 2013] Rist achieved notoriety with Pickelporno (Pimple porno) (1992), a work about the female body and sexual excitation. The fisheye camera moves over the bodies of a couple. The images are charged by intense colors, and are simultaneously strange, sensual, and ambiguous. Sip My Ocean (1996), a video projected as a mirrored reflection on two adjoining walls, shows a dreamlike series of images of a bikini-clad woman swimming underwater among sinking tea cups, televisions, and other domestic objects.

Pour Your Body Out was a commissioned multimedia installation organized by Klaus Biesenbach and installed in the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art in early 2009. In an interview with Phong Bui published in The Brooklyn Rail, Rist said she chose the atrium for the installation \\"because it reminds me of a church's interior where you‚Äôre constantly reminded that the spirit is good and the body is bad.

G. Wells. Plot summary The protagonist of The History of Mr. Polly is an antihero inspired by H. G. Wells's early experiences in the drapery trade: Alfred Polly, born circa 1870, a timid and directionless young man living in Edwardian England, who despite his own bumbling achieves contented serenity with little help from those around him. Mr. Polly's most striking characteristic is his \\"innate sense of epithet\\", which leads him to coin hilarious expressions like \\"the Shoveacious Cult\\" for \\"sunny young men of an abounding and elbowing energy\\" and \\"dejected angelosity\\" for the ornaments of Canterbury Cathedral. Alfred Polly lives in the imaginary town of Fishbourne in Kent (not to be confused with Fishbourne, West Sussex or Fishbourne, Isle of Wight ‚Äì the town in the story is thought to be based on Sandgate, Kent where Wells lived for several years).Chapter notes from The History of Mr Polly, Penguin Classics (2005). The novel begins in medias res by presenting a miserable Mr. Polly: \\"He hated Foxbourne, he hated Foxbourne High Street, he hated his shop and his wife and his neighbours ‚Äì every blessed neighbour ‚Äì and with indescribable bitterness he hated himself\\". Thereafter, The History of Mr. Polly is divided in three parts. Chapters 1‚Äì6 depict his life up to age 20, when he marries his cousin Miriam Larkins and sets up an outfitter's shop in Fishbourne. Second Chapters 7‚Äì8 show Mr. Polly's spectacular suicide attempt, which ironically makes him a local hero, wins him insurance money that saves him from bankruptcy, and yields the insight that \\"Fishbourne wasn't the world\\", which leads him to abandon his shop and his wife.; emphasis in original. Chapters 9‚Äì10, at the Potwell Inn (apparently located in West Sussex), culminates in Mr. Polly's courageous victory over \\"Uncle Jim\\", a malicious relative of the innkeeper's granddaughter. An epilogue then depicts Mr. Polly at ease as assistant- innkeeper, after a brief visit to ascertain Miriam's prosperity. Themes The novel's principal conflict is Mr. Polly's struggle with life, told \\"in the full-blooded Dickens tradition\\".. This moral struggle is slow to develop, for Mr. Polly is a stunted, rather than a gifted or self-confident character. He is not without imagination and a flair for language, but his mind is \\"at once too vivid in its impressions and too easily fatigued\\". His mother dies when he was seven, and his formal education ends at the age of fourteen, by which \\"Mr. Polly had lost much of his natural confidence, so far as figures and sciences and languages and the possibilities of learning things were concerned\\". His unsympathetic father apprentices him to The Port Burdock Drapery Bazaar. Unsatisfied there, he leaves to look for work in London, and is employed for a time in Canterbury, whose cathedral pleases him greatly: \\"There was a blood affinity between Mr. Polly and the Gothic\\". Mr. Polly's struggles are chiefly moral: he has no confidence in his intellectual powers (though he is an avid reader), and his emotions are confused and timid. The reader is invited to see things from Mr. Polly's point of view, even when this leads him to commit arson and, perhaps, manslaughter. \\"This is a history and not a glorification of Mr. Polly, and I tell of things as they were with him.\\" H. G. Wells's moral point of view in the novel is complex and often ironic, as Mr. Polly's musings at the end of the novel suggest: \\"One seems to start in life expecting something. And it doesn't happen. And it doesn't matter. One starts with ideas that things are good and things are bad ‚Äì and it hasn't much relation to what is good and what is bad. . . . There's something that doesn't mind us. It isn't what we try to get that we get, it isn't the good we think we do is good. What makes us happy isn't our trying, what makes others happy isn't our trying. There's a sort of character people like and stand up for and a sort they won't. You got to work at it and take the consequences\\". For the most part in The History of Mr. Polly the author's penchant for social reform is in abeyance; but Wells does cite twice the diagnosis of \\"a certain high-browed, spectacled gentleman living at Highbury, wearing a gold pince-nez, and writing for the most part in the beautiful library of the Reform Club,\\" who without knowing Mr. Polly diagnoses the situation of \\"those ill-adjusted units that abound in a society that has failed to develop a collective intelligence and a collective will for order, commensurate with its complexities.\\" A later passage of several hundred words from the same unidentified author critiques \\"that vast mass of useless, uncomfortable, under-educated, under-trained and altogether pitiable people that we contemplate when we use that inaccurate and misleading term, the lower middle class.\\"  Criticism  The History of Mr. Polly received mostly enthusiastic reviews. H. L. Mencken published a glowing review in the July 1910 number of The Smart Set. The novel has been called \\"a complete comic miracle.\\" Mr. Polly' has been called a \\"wonderful incarnation of what might have happened to Wells without education, a Wells driven to use the words bubbling in him and getting them all so delightfully muddled.\\" But Wells said his protagonist was based not on himself, but on his elder brother Frank. The History of Mr. Polly was included by Robert McCrum in his list of the 100 best novels in English in The Guardian. Screen adaptations A film version of the same name was made in 1949 by Anthony Pellisier, with John Mills as Polly. It was adapted by the BBC as a six-part television serial shown between 28 August ‚Äì 10 October 1959, with Emrys Jones as Polly, and again as a five-part adaptation starring Andrew Sachs, shown between 2 and 30 March 1980. The 1959 version no longer exists. A feature-length version, starring Lee Evans was shown on ITV in May 2007.

Seba was the founder of the independent label Hydeout Productions and released two collection compilations: Hydeout Productions 1st Collection (2003) and 2nd Collection (2007). Additionally, Seba collaborated on the soundtrack for Shinichir≈ç Watanabe's anime series Samurai Champloo (Music Record: Departure and Impression) in 2004. Nujabes has been referred to as one of the \\"godfathers\\" of the microgenre of lo-fi hip hop. In particular, his collaborations with Shing02 have been credited as having \\"pioneered a sound that inspired the viral 'chillhop' phenomenon, and popular YouTube programs like 'lofi hip hop radio ‚Äì beats to relax/study to.'\\" On February 26, 2010, Jun Seba was killed in a traffic collision. Biography Seba was born on February 7, 1974, in the Nishi-Azabu district of Minato in central Tokyo, Japan. Seba was the owner of two Shibuya record stores, T Records and Guinness Records, and in 1998 founded the independent record label Hydeout Productions. Career Seba adopted the stage name Nujabes (his name spelled backwards) and became notable for his approach to producing hip hop beats, often blending jazz influences into his songs creating a mellow, nostalgic and atmospheric sound. He is considered a pioneer of chillhop and lo-fi music. Seba collaborated with Japanese artists like Uyama Hiroto, Shing02, L-Universe, and Minmi, and with various underground American hip hop acts such as CYNE, Cise Starr (as a solo apart from the hip-hop collective CYNE), Apani B, Five Deez, Substantial, CL Smooth, Fat Jon, Terry Callier as well as British rapper Funky DL. Seba was also a member of the production duo Urbanforest, an experimental collaboration with Nao T. Seba collaborated with Shing02 on the critically acclaimed Luv(sic) hexalogy, making the parts 1-3 together, but after Seba died unexpectedly many doubted that the series could ever be completed. However, parts 4 and 5 had already been completed, which were released shortly after Seba's death. Part 6 was not among the previously completed tracks, but it was released on February 26, 2013, on the third anniversary of Seba's death. According to Shing02's official Facebook page, the instrumental to what would eventually be part 6 was discovered on Seba's cell phone a few weeks after his death. Seba was one of the most prolific contributors to the soundtrack of the critically acclaimed anime series Samurai Champloo, which blends a feudal Japanese setting with modern anachronisms, especially in regard to hip hop culture such as graffiti and rapping. Death On February 26, 2010, Seba was involved in a traffic collision upon exiting the Shuto Expressway at 22:14. He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Shibuya Ward after efforts to revive him failed. His grave is located within the Japanese section of Tama Cemetery. Legacy Seba's death elicited many tributes from other artists around the world. On Bandcamp, the New York-based Digi Crates records released a series of tribute albums performed by various artists in a style reminiscent of Seba's. Seba's label Hydeout Productions released a tribute album titled Modal Soul Classics II featuring a number of former collaborators and with lyrics and song titles that reference Seba's work. Frequent collaborator Shing02 remarked, \\"Through his soulful music, Nujabes has touched so many people around the world, even beyond his dreams\\", and \\"[I] deeply regret the loss of a unique talent and a close friend.\\" Shing02 has performed at tribute concerts for Seba. Daniel Hodgman, founder of hip hop culture website BonusCut, in a 2014 highlight of Modal Soul said that, \\"Nujabes may not be physically with us anymore, but through his music, his legacy and lust for life lives on.\\" Co-founder Gus Navarro remarked that, \\"The music of the late producer Nujabes is something to hold onto and never let go.\\" In 2013, Australian producer Ta-ku released the tribute album 25 Nights for Nujabes. In 2018, Polish rapper Zeus released the tribute song \\"Kwiaty dla J.\\" In 2018, American rapper SahBabii mentioned Nujabes in his song ‚ÄúAnime World‚Äù. He said ‚ÄúRIP Nujabes, nine tails a Jinchuriki‚Äù. In an interview with XXL, SahBabii said Nujabes was an influence for him to make music. In 2018, American rapper Logic mentioned Nujabes in the track \\"Thank You\\" off of his album YSIV, saying \\"I had to write this over a Nujabes vibe\\", referencing the production style of the track, which is reminiscent of Nujabes' music. In 2020, Logic cited Nujabes as a key inspiration behind his production style alongside MF Doom, RZA and Kanye West in the track \\"Perfect\\" off of his album No Pressure.\\"Perfect by Logic\\". SoundCloud. July 24, 2020. On 26 July 2019, Otakon held a tribute concert in Washington, D.C., featuring Shing02, MINMI, Substantial, Marcus D and EyeQ.

It was created in September 2003. It is owned and operated by John Tayman who is a lifelong fan of the NFL and follows the Washington Redskins. In September 2005, a podcast series was introduced hosted by Tayman and the site's producer Tom Lacks. Like the cartoons it is satirical and based mostly on the NFL. Lacks is an avid Buckeye and Cowboy fan and this is often a source humor on the show. The cartoons grew out of Tayman's love for the NFL and his belief that many NFL fans take the sport too seriously. It has attracted both praise and criticism and has also become popular among a number of the players that they generally parody. The site hosts an active message board community which hosts discussion about the cartoon and podcasts. Links can be found on many player websites, most notably Clinton Portis and Santana Moss. History It began in early 2003 when Tayman produced two cartoons, about the Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder stealing players from the New York Jets and broadcaster John Madden getting his head stuck in a bucket. From there each cartoon gained an increasing audience. The release of \\"Booyah!\\", a cartoon parodying ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith and Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis saw the numbers of visitors increase significantly. The site's popularity increased significantly in December 2003 with the release of \\"Michael Vick Takes A Crap\\" (viewable at ), parodying the seemingly endless praising of Vick by Mike Patrick, Paul Maguire, and Joe Theismann during a Sunday night game on ESPN against the Carolina Panthers. Traffic to the site overwhelmed its servers and Tayman was forced to search for a new server. Tayman was contacted by Eric Leichter, an owner and administrator of Extremeskins, a Washington Redskins fan site. Leichter offered to host the cartoons on Extremeskins. Tayman agreed and it became Bang Cartoon's new host. It remained there until the summer of 2005 when it was removed from Extremeskins after the Washington Redskins purchased the site and determined that, due to the scornful nature of some of the cartoons, it not be officially connected with Bang Cartoon. Bang Cartoon then became exclusively featured on its own domain where it remains to date. A new website and forum were introduced in early 2006 and the website's content was expanded in August 2006. The site now also covers music, movies and politics through columns e-mailed to the site. =Development= In April 2004 Bang Cartoon released \\"Going Poston\\", a cartoon about sports agents Carl and Kevin Poston and their client, then NFL rookie Kellen Winslow II. The cartoon was a satirical look at the upcoming contract negotiations between the Postons and the Cleveland Browns. The following Sunday, ESPN used the cartoon on their program Outside the Lines in a segment about the Postons.\\"Outside the Lines\\" ESPN television program May, 2004 In the segment they showed the cartoon to one of the Postons, who laughed at it, and called it \\"unfortunate\\". Later in the program, sports agent and former NBA star Len Elmore said the cartoon was \\"disgusting\\" and carried \\"racial overtones\\", due to the accents and attitudes of the characters. From there a small storm began in which the accusations of racism surfaced. It culminated when Tayman appeared on sports radio in Cleveland to answer growing questions as to the motives behind the characterization.The Greg-O Show on WBZX, Columbus Ohio, Jan. 15, 2006. =Favorite of the NFL= Bang Cartoon has been featured on national television and given Tayman a fair measure of notoriety in the NFL. When Detroit Lions Coach Jim Schwartz was the Tennessee Titans' defensive coordinator, he sent Tayman a letter detailing how the locker room \\"stopped and watched when new cartoons came out.\\" Despite the steady flow of criticism directed towards Washington Redskins owner, Daniel Snyder, it is rumored that the reclusive owner is a fan of the site Characters Most characters are satirical portrayals of actual NFL players, coaches and journalists. However ‚ÄúThe Justice Guys‚Äù feature NFL players and coaches as superheroes. Non-NFL personalities such as George W Bush have also appeared. There are also a number of characters that have been created by Bang Cartoons, with news reporters Harry Sphincter and Bill Spleen and newsreader Lance Pants the most frequent of these. Other frequent characters include: *Tiki Barber *Bronco Billy *Tom Brady *Colonel Kofflin *Vinny Cerrato *Bill Cowher *Brett Favre *Jeff Garcia *Roger Goodell *Jerry Jones *Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones *John Madden *Matt Millen *Terrell Owens *Carl Poston and Kevin Poston *Drew Rosenhaus *Frebby Smoop *The Generalissimo *Paul Tagliabue *Mike Tomlin *Michael Vick *Ricky Williams *Kellen Winslow II *Robert Kraft *Bill Belichick Bang Cartoon Radio Hour In September 2005 a podcast series called \\"The Bang Cartoon Radio Hour\\" was introduced to the site. It features Tayman and fellow site developer Tom Lacks talking for about an hour discussing issues in the NFL. The two met six years ago in an NFL chat room, and Lacks, who works in radio, expressed interest in helping with Bang Cartoon. Tayman saw it as a great chance to work on a new project. Like the cartoons they take a satirical approach to most issues. They will try to avoid analysis of games or players, believing that to be something everyone does. Lacks often provides audio of notable or amusing quotes from players, coaches and announcers. \\"The cartoon is fun, but it's only one idea,\\" he said. \\"By the time I put the cartoon out there for you to laugh at it, I've seen in 10,000 times. I'm tired of it. I'm done with it.\\" Tayman estimates that he and Lacks have shaken hands just two or three times in six years, that hasn't detracted from their podcast. In May 2006, the Radio Hour was named the winner of the Podcast-O-Rama, a contest which pitted podcasts against one another in a bracket style tournament. The contest was hosted and sponsored by vitalpodcasts.com and TPSRadio.net. In November 2006 a MySpace page was set up for it. The podcast is available for free on itunes or the Bang Cartoon Radio Hour website =Other features= With the introduction of a new website a number of other features were added. *Meet the Mullettes a sitcom about rednecks Skeeter Mullette, his wife Raylene, his brother Duane and his best friend Jim-Bob Stuckey. Tayman portrays all characters. This has now expanded into a weekly cartoon feature called \\"The Super Awesome Football Show\\". *The Bang Music hour which showcases unsigned artists and bands which have been e-mailed to Tayman by visitors to the site.

It is conventionalEntry on Bestiarii at Chambers, Ephraim, Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, c. 1680-1740 to distinguish two categories of bestiarii: the first were those condemned to death via the beasts (see damnatio ad bestias) and the second were those who faced them voluntarily, for pay or glory (see venatio).William Smith, \\"Bestiarii\\" from A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray: London, 1875. Public domain. The latter are sometimes erroneously called gladiators; to their contemporaries, however, the term gladiator referred specifically to one who fought other men. The contemporary term for those who made a career out of participating in arena \\"hunts\\" was venatores.  As a form of execution  As a means of torturous capital punishment, death by wild beasts was a punishment for enemies of the state,The Bestiarius and the Ludus Matutinus a category which included those taken prisoner and slaves found guilty of a serious crime. These were sent to their deaths naked and unable to defend themselves against the beasts. Even if they succeeded in killing one, fresh animals were continually let loose on them, until the bestiarii were all dead. It is reported that it was seldom necessary for two beasts to be required to take down one man. On the contrary, one beast frequently dispatched several men. Cicero mentions a single lion which alone dispatched 200 bestiarii. Seneca relates that a German prisoner, rather than participate, killed himself by forcing a sponge used in the lavatory down his throat. \\"What a brave fellow!\\", said Seneca, \\"He surely deserved to be allowed to choose his fate! How bravely he would have wielded a sword!\\". Another nodded as if asleep and, lowering his head, thrust it between the spokes of the cart wheel, breaking his neck. Symmachus writes of twenty- nine Saxon prisoners strangling one another in their cells the night before they were to appear in the arena.  Voluntary combat  Bestiarii, as reported by Seneca, consisted of young men who, to become expert in managing their arms, fought sometimes against beasts, and sometimes against one another; and of bravos who, to show their courage and dexterity, exposed themselves to this dangerous combat. Augustus encouraged this practice in young men of the first rank; Nero exposed himself to it; and it was for killing beasts in the amphitheatre that Commodus acquired the title of the Roman Hercules. Vigen√®re adds two more types of bestiarii:Cyclopaedia, apparently referring to some one of Vigen√®re's French translations of Latin works, such as his translation of Caesar's Commentaries. the first were those who made a trade of it, and fought for money. It appears that there were schools in Rome, in which people were trained to fight wild beasts (scholae bestiarum, or bestiariorum).Tertullian's Apologeticus, chapter 35; cited in Smith 1875. The second type was where several armed bestiarii were let loose at once against a number of beasts.

While primarily known as a power amplifier company it also produced several innovative preamplifiers, tuners and the Andromeda loudspeaker. History Its first location was 19555 23rd Ave. N.W. Seattle, Washington. Its second location was a small building at 405 Howell Way in Edmonds, Washington. The first amplifier produced was the Phase Linear 700. With 350 watts per channel it soon became the standard amplifier used in recording studios, sound reinforcement companies, professional musicians and audiophiles. It had a retail price of $749.00, or a little more than a dollar a watt. The design was notable for its brushed aluminum front panel and large dual VU meters, and was made possible by the new high-power transistors designed for the high voltages of auto electronic ignitions. That original amp was replaced by the 700B and the 700 II. All of those designs were made to have extra power to run loudly the relatively inefficient sealed-box speakers like the Acoustic Research AR3/AR3a. The second amplifier released was the Phase Linear 400 with 200 watts per channel. It shared the same distinctive brushed aluminum, dual VU meters front panel style as the 700. It retailed for just under $500.Anthony Young's Phase Linear history reference site The next product was the Phase Linear 4000 Series Auto-correlation Pre-Amplifier introduced in 1973 and manufactured through 1978. It retailed for $700.00 at the end of its life. It was a design collaboration by Bob Carver and Bill Skinner. The company was known for the most powerful audio amplifiers of the era led by the Phase Linear D-500 introduced in 1978. It was a stereo power amplifier delivering 505 watts of clean (typically < 0.1% total harmonic distortion over 20 Hz‚Äì20 kHz) RMS power per channel. It had a retail price of $1395. ;Buyout The company was bought by Pioneer Electronics, and Bob Carver founded Carver Corporation in 1979. Pioneer added a high end cassette-tape deck designed in house and CD players designed by Kyocera to the Phase Linear line. By that time the company was in decline due to the increasing cost of research and development, and the departure of Carver. In 1982 Phase Linear was sold to Jensen Inc. which also owned the AR and Advent brands. Recoton later acquired the Jensen brands. Bob Carver went on to form Carver Corporation. He later had a falling out with Carver Corporation management and left to start Sunfire.Bob Carver history reference site There continues to be a loyal following of some of the older products. Many electronic parts are still available for repairs. Mechanical parts such as switches, meters and hardware are scarce.

He holds a BS in Mathematics from University of Dayton, a PhD in Mathematics from University of Virginia, and a PhD in Philosophy from Ohio State University. He currently is Professor of Philosophy at Loyola University Chicago. He has taught at Loyola since 1975. He was a visiting professor of mathematics at the University of Kentucky from 1969 to 1970, and a visiting professor of philosophy at the University of New Hampshire from 1986 to 1987.

In 1999, Schweickart was named Faculty Member of the Year at Loyola University Chicago. He is an editor and contributing writer to SolidarityEconomy.net, an online journal dedicated to economic democracy.  Economic democracy  In After Capitalism and other works, Schweickart has developed the model of market socialism he refers to as \\"economic democracy\\". In his own words, \\"Economic Democracy is a market economy.\\" It embodies several key ideas: * Workplace self-management, including election of supervisors * Management of capital investment by a form of public banking * A market for goods, raw materials, instruments of production, etc. * Protectionism to enforce trade equality between nations The firms and factories are owned by society and managed by the workers. These enterprises, so managed, compete in markets to sell their goods. Profit is shared by the workers. Each enterprise is taxed for the capital they employ, and that tax is distributed to public banks, who fund expansion of existing and new industry.  Critiques  In 2006, Schweickart wrote a detailed critique of participatory economics, called Nonsense on Stilts: Michael Albert's Parecon. He claimed three fundamental features of the economic system are flawed.http://dschwei.sites.luc.edu/parecon.pdf  Published works  * After Capitalism (Rowman and Littlefield, 2002) - * Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists, with Bertell Ollman, Hillel Ticktin and James Lawler (Routledge, 1998) * Against Capitalism (Cambridge University Press, 1993; Spanish translation, 1997; Chinese translation, 2003) * Capitalism or Worker Control?

It occupies part of Brodmann's area 6. It has been studied mainly in primates, including monkeys and humans. The functions of the premotor cortex are diverse and not fully understood. It projects directly to the spinal cord and therefore may play a role in the direct control of behavior, with a relative emphasis on the trunk muscles of the body. It may also play a role in planning movement, in the spatial guidance of movement, in the sensory guidance of movement, in understanding the actions of others, and in using abstract rules to perform specific tasks. Different subregions of the premotor cortex have different properties and presumably emphasize different functions. Nerve signals generated in the premotor cortex cause much more complex patterns of movement than the discrete patterns generated in the primary motor cortex. Structure The premotor cortex occupies the part of Brodmann area 6 that lies on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The medial extension of area 6, onto the midline surface of the hemisphere, is the site of the supplementary motor area, or SMA. The premotor cortex can be distinguished from the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4, just posterior to it, based on two main anatomical markers. First, the primary motor cortex contains giant pyramidal cells called Betz cells in layer V, whereas giant pyramidal cells are less common and smaller in the premotor cortex. Second, the primary motor cortex is agranular: it lacks a layer IV marked by the presence of granule cells. The premotor cortex is dysgranular: it contains a faint layer IV. The premotor cortex can be distinguished from Brodmann area 46 of the prefrontal cortex, just anterior to it, by the presence of a fully formed granular layer IV in area 46. The premotor cortex is therefore anatomically a transition between the agranular motor cortex and the granular, six-layered prefrontal cortex. The premotor cortex has been divided into finer subregions on the basis of cytoarchitecture (the appearance of the cortex under a microscope), cytohistochemistry (the manner in which the cortex appears when stained by various chemical substances), anatomical connectivity to other brain areas, and physiological properties. These divisions are summarized below in Divisions of the premotor cortex. The connectivity of the premotor cortex is diverse, partly because the premotor cortex itself is heterogenous and different subregions have different connectivity. Generally the premotor cortex has strong afferent (input) and efferent (output) connectivity to the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the superior and inferior parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Subcortically it projects to the spinal cord, the striatum, and the motor thalamus among other structures. In the study of neurolinguistics, the ventral premotor cortex has been implicated in motor vocabularies in both speech and manual gestures. A mental syllabary ‚Äî a repository of gestural scores for the most highly used syllables in a language ‚Äî has been linked to the ventral premotor cortex in a large-scale meta-analysis of functional imaging studies. A recent prospective fMRI study that was designed to distinguish phonemic and syllable representations in motor codes provided further evidence for this view by demonstrating adaptation effects in the ventral premotor cortex to repeating syllables. The premotor cortex is now generally divided into four sections. First it is divided into an upper (or dorsal) premotor cortex and a lower (or ventral) premotor cortex. Each of these is further divided into a region more toward the front of the brain (rostral premotor cortex) and a region more toward the back (caudal premotor cortex). A set of acronyms are commonly used: PMDr (premotor dorsal, rostral), PMDc (premotor dorsal, caudal), PMVr (premotor ventral, rostral), PMVc (premotor ventral, caudal). Some researchers, especially those who study the ventral premotor areas, use a different terminology. Field 7 or F7 denotes PMDr; F2 = PMDc; F5=PMVr; F4=PMVc. These subdivisions of premotor cortex were originally described and remain primarily studied in the monkey brain. Exactly how they may correspond to areas of the human brain, or whether the organization in the human brain is somewhat different, is not yet clear. =PMDc (F2)= PMDc is often studied with respect to its role in guiding reaching. Neurons in PMDc are active during reaching. When monkeys are trained to reach from a central location to a set of target locations, neurons in PMDc are active during the preparation for the reach and also during the reach itself. They are broadly tuned, responding best to one direction of reach and less well to different directions. Electrical stimulation of the PMDc on a behavioral time scale was reported to evoke a complex movement of the shoulder, arm, and hand that resembles reaching with the hand opened in preparation to grasp. =PMDr(F7)= PMDr may participate in learning to associate arbitrary sensory stimuli with specific movements or learning arbitrary response rules. In this sense it may resemble the prefrontal cortex more than other motor cortex fields. It may also have some relation to eye movement. Electrical stimulation in the PMDr can evoke eye movements and neuronal activity in the PMDr can be modulated by eye movement. =PMVc(F4)= PMVc or F4 is often studied with respect to its role in the sensory guidance of movement. Neurons here are responsive to tactile stimuli, visual stimuli, and auditory stimuli. These neurons are especially sensitive to objects in the space immediately surrounding the body, in so- called peripersonal space. Electrical stimulation of these neurons causes an apparent defensive movement as if protecting the body surface. This premotor region may be part of a larger circuit for maintaining a margin of safety around the body and guiding movement with respect to nearby objects. =PMVr(F5)= PMVr or F5 is often studied with respect to its role in shaping the hand during grasping and in interactions between the hand and the mouth. Electrical stimulation of at least some parts of F5, when the stimulation is applied on a behavioral time scale, evokes a complex movement in which the hand moves to the mouth, closes in a grip, orients such that the grip faces the mouth, the neck turns to align the mouth to the hand, and the mouth opens. Mirror neurons were first discovered in area F5 in the monkey brain by Rizzolatti and colleagues. These neurons are active when the monkey grasps an object. Yet the same neurons become active when the monkey watches an experimenter grasp an object in the same way. The neurons are therefore both sensory and motor. Mirror neurons are proposed to be a basis for understanding the actions of others by internally imitating the actions using one's own motor control circuits. History In the earliest work on the motor cortex, researchers recognized only one cortical field involved in motor control. Campbell in 1905 was the first to suggest that there might be two fields, a \\"primary\\" motor cortex and an \\"intermediate precentral\\" motor cortex. His reasons were largely based on cytoarchitectonics. The primary motor cortex contains cells with giant cell bodies known as \\"Betz cells\\". The Betz cells are rare or absent in the adjacent cortex. On similar criteria Brodmann in 1909 also distinguished between his area 4 (coextensive with the primary motor cortex) and his area 6 (coextensive with the premotor cortex). Vogt and Vogt in 1919 also suggested that motor cortex was divided into a primary motor cortex (area 4) and a higher-order motor cortex (area 6) adjacent to it. Furthermore, in their account, area 6 could be divided into 6a (the dorsal part) and 6b (the ventral part). The dorsal part could be further divided into 6a-alpha (a posterior part adjacent to the primary motor cortex) and 6a-beta (an anterior part adjacent to the prefrontal cortex). These cortical fields formed a hierarchy in which 6a-beta controlled movement at the most complex level, 6a-alpha had intermediate properties, and the primary motor cortex controlled movement at the simplest level. Vogt and Vogt are therefore the original source of the idea of a caudal (6a-alpha) and a rostral (6a-beta) premotor cortex. Fulton in 1935 helped to solidify the distinction between a primary motor map of the body in area 4 and a higher-order premotor cortex in area 6. His main evidence came from lesion studies in monkeys. It is not clear where the term \\"premotor\\" came from or who used it first, but Fulton popularized the term. A caveat about the premotor cortex, noted early in its study, is that the hierarchy between the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex is not absolute. Instead both the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex project directly to the spinal cord, and each has some capability to control movement even in the absence of the other. Therefore, the two cortical fields operate at least partly in parallel rather than in a strict hierarchy. This parallel relationship was noted as early as 1919 by Vogt and Vogt and also emphasized by Fulton. Penfield in 1937 notably disagreed with the idea of a premotor cortex. He suggested that there was no functional distinction between a primary motor and a premotor area. In his view both were part of the same map. The most posterior part of the map, in area 4, emphasized the hand and fingers and the most anterior part, in area 6, emphasized the muscles of the back and neck. Woolsey who studied the motor map in monkeys in 1956 also believed there was no distinction between primary motor and premotor cortex. He used the term M1 for the proposed single map that encompassed both the primary motor cortex and the premotor cortex. He used the term M2 for the medial motor cortex now commonly known as the supplementary motor area. (Sometimes in modern reviews M1 is incorrectly equated with the primary motor cortex.) Given this work by Penfield on the human brain and by Woolsey on the monkey brain, by the 1960s the idea of a lateral premotor cortex as separate from the primary motor cortex had mainly disappeared from the literature. Instead M1 was considered to be a single map of the body, perhaps with complex properties, arranged along the central sulcus. =Re-emergence= The hypothesis of a separate premotor cortex re-emerged and gained ground in the 1980s. Several key lines of research helped to establish the premotor cortex by showing that it had properties distinct from those of the adjacent primary motor cortex. Roland and colleagues studied the dorsal premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in humans while blood flow in the brain was monitored in a positron emission scanner. When people made complex sensory-guided movements such as following verbal instructions, more blood flow was measured in the dorsal premotor cortex. When people made internally paced sequences of movements, more blood flow was measured in the supplementary motor area. When people made simple movements that required little planning, such as palpating an object with the hand, the blood flow was more limited to the primary motor cortex. By implication, the primary motor cortex was more involved in execution of simple movement, the premotor cortex was more involved in sensory guided movement, and the supplementary motor area was more involved in internally generated movements. Wise and his colleagues studied the dorsal premotor cortex of monkeys. The monkeys were trained to perform a delayed response task, making a movement in response to a sensory instruction cue. During the task, neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex became active in response to the sensory cue and often remained active during the few seconds of delay or preparation time before the monkey performed the instructed movement. Neurons in the primary motor cortex showed much less activity during the preparation period and were more likely to be active only during the movement itself. By implication, the dorsal premotor cortex was more involved in planning or preparing for movement and the primary motor cortex more involved in executing movement. Rizzolatti and colleagues divided the premotor cortex into four parts or fields based on cytoarchitectonics, two dorsal fields and two ventral fields. They then studied the properties of the ventral premotor fields, establishing tactile, visual, and motor properties of a complex nature (summarized in greater detail above in Divisions of the premotor cortex). At least three representations of the hand were reported in the motor cortex, one in the primary motor cortex, one in the ventral premotor cortex, and one in the dorsal premotor cortex. By implication, at least three different cortical fields may exist, each one performing its own special function in relation to the fingers and wrist. For these and other reasons, a consensus has now emerged that the lateral motor cortex does not consist of a single, simple map of the body, but instead contains multiple subregions including the primary motor cortex and several premotor fields. These premotor fields have diverse properties. Some project to the spinal cord and may play a direct role in movement control, whereas others do not. Whether these cortical areas are arranged in a hierarchy or share some other more complex relationship is still debated. Graziano and colleagues suggested an alternative principle of organization for the primary motor cortex and the caudal part of the premotor cortex, all regions that project directly to the spinal cord and that were included in the Penfield and Woolsey definition of M1. In this alternative proposal, the motor cortex is organized as a map of the natural behavioral repertoire. The complicated, multifaceted nature of the behavioral repertoire results in a complicated, heterogeneous map in cortex, in which different parts of the movement repertoire are emphasized in different cortical subregions. More complex movements such as reaching or climbing require more coordination among body parts, the processing of more complex control variables, the monitoring of objects in the space near the body, and planning several seconds into the future. Other parts of the movement repertoire, such as manipulating an object with the fingers once the object has been acquired, or manipulating an object in the mouth, involve less planning, less computation of spatial trajectory, and more control of individual joint rotations and muscle forces. In this view the more complex movements, especially multi-segmental movements, come to be emphasized in the more anterior part of the motor map because that cortex emphasizes the musculature of the back and neck which serves as the coordinating link between body parts. In contrast the simpler parts of the movement repertoire that tend to focus more on the distal musculature are emphasized in the more posterior cortex. In this alternative view, though movements of lesser complexity are emphasized in the primary motor cortex and movements of greater complexity are emphasized in the caudal premotor cortex, this difference does not necessarily imply a control hierarchy. Instead the regions differ from each other, and contain subregions with differing properties, because the natural movement repertoire itself is heterogeneous.

It is perhaps \\"the oldest extant manuscript in Indian mathematics.\\" For some portions a carbon-date was proposed of AD 224‚Äì383 while for other portions a carbon-date as late as AD 885‚Äì993 in a recent study, but the dating has been criticised by specialists on methodological grounds (Plofker et al. 2017 and Houben 2018 ¬ß3Jan E.M. Houben ‚ÄúLinguistic Paradox and Diglossia: on the emergence of Sanskrit and Sanskritic language in Ancient India.‚Äù De Gruyter Open Linguistics (Topical Issue on Historical Sociolinguistic Philology, ed. by Chiara Barbati and Christian Gastgeber.) OPLI ‚Äì Vol. 4, issue 1: 1-18. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/opli-2018-0001). The manuscript contains the earliest known Indian use of a zero symbol. It is written in Sanskrit with significant influence of local dialects. Discovery The manuscript was unearthed from a field in 1881, by a peasant in the village of Bakhshali, which is near Mardan, now in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The first research on the manuscript was done by A. F. R. Hoernl√©. After his death, it was examined by G. R. Kaye, who edited the work and published it as a book in 1927. The extant manuscript is incomplete, consisting of seventy leaves of birch bark, whose intended order is not known. It is in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford (MS. Sansk. d. 14), and is said to be too fragile to be examined by scholars. Contents The numerals used in the Bakhshali manuscript, dated to sometime between the 3rd and 7th century AD. The manuscript is a compendium of rules and illustrative examples. Each example is stated as a problem, the solution is described, and it is verified that the problem has been solved. The sample problems are in verse and the commentary is in prose associated with calculations. The problems involve arithmetic, algebra and geometry, including mensuration. The topics covered include fractions, square roots, arithmetic and geometric progressions, solutions of simple equations, simultaneous linear equations, quadratic equations and indeterminate equations of the second degree. =Composition= The manuscript is written in an earlier form of ≈öƒÅradƒÅ script, a script which is known for having been in use mainly from the 8th to the 12th century in the northwestern part of India, such as Kashmir and neighbouring regions. The language of the manuscript, though intended to be Sanskrit, was significantly influenced in its phonetics and morphology by a local dialect or dialects, and some of the resultant linguistic peculiarities of the text are shared with Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. The overlying dialects, though sharing affinities with Apabhra·πÉ≈õa and with Old Kashmiri, have not been identified precisely. It is probable that most of the rules and examples had been originally composed in Sanskrit, while one of the sections was written entirely in a dialect.Section VII 11, corresponding to folio 46. It is possible that the manuscript might be a compilation of fragments from different works composed in a number of language varieties. Hayashi admits that some of the irregularities are due to errors by scribes or may be orthographical. A colophon to one of the sections states that it was written by a brahmin identified as \\"the son of Chajaka\\", a \\"king of calculators,\\" for the use of Vasi·π£·π≠ha's son Hasika. The brahmin might have been the author of the commentary as well as the scribe of the manuscript. Near the colophon appears a broken word rtikƒÅvati, which has been interpreted as the place MƒÅrtikƒÅvata mentioned by VarƒÅhamihira as being in northwestern India (along with Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ, GandhƒÅra etc.), the supposed place where the manuscript might have been written. =Mathematics= The manuscript is a compilation of mathematical rules and examples (in verse), and prose commentaries on these verses. Typically, a rule is given, with one or more examples, where each example is followed by a \\"statement\\" (nyƒÅsa / sthƒÅpanƒÅ) of the example's numerical information in tabular form, then a computation that works out the example by following the rule step-by-step while quoting it, and finally a verification to confirm that the solution satisfies the problem. This is a style similar to that of BhƒÅskara I's commentary on the ga·πáita (mathematics) chapter of the ƒÄryabha·π≠ƒ´ya, including the emphasis on verification that became obsolete in later works. The rules are algorithms and techniques for a variety of problems, such as systems of linear equations, quadratic equations, arithmetic progressions and arithmetico-geometric series, computing square roots approximately, dealing with negative numbers (profit and loss), measurement such as of the fineness of gold, etc.  Mathematical context  Scholar Takao Hayashi has compared the text of the manuscript with several Sanskrit texts. He mentions that a passage is a verbatim quote from Mahabharata. He discusses similar passages in Ramayana, Vayupurana, Lokaprakasha of Kshemendra etc. Some of the mathematical rules also appear in Aryabhatiya of Aryabhatta, Aryabhatiyabhashya of Bhaskara I, Patiganita and Trairashika of Sridhara, Ganitasarasamgraha of Mahavira, and Lilavati and Bijaganita of Bhaskara II. An unnamed manuscript, later than Thakkar Pheru, in the Patan Jain library, a compilation of mathematical rules from various sources resembles the Bakhshali manuscript, contains data in an example which are strikingly similar. =Numerals and zero= Bakhshali manuscript, detail of the numeral \\"zero\\". The Bakhshali manuscript uses numerals with a place- value system, using a dot as a place holder for zero. The dot symbol came to be called the shunya-bindu (literally, the dot of the empty place). References to the concept are found in Subandhu's Vasavadatta, which has been dated between 385 and 465 by the scholar Maan Singh.Singh, Maan (1993). Subandhu, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, , pp. 9‚Äì11. Prior to the 2017 carbon dating ‚Äì which, however, has in the meantime been discounted, see below under Date ‚Äì a 9th-century inscription of zero on the wall of a temple in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, was thought to be the oldest Indian use of a zero symbol. Date In 2017, three samples from the manuscript were thought to come from three different centuries, from AD 224‚Äì383, 680‚Äì779, and 885‚Äì993, on the basis of a study involving radiocarbon dating. If the dates were accepted, it is not known how fragments from different centuries came to be packaged together. A detailed reconsideration of all relevant evidence regarding the date of the Bakhshali manuscript, led Kim Plofker, Agathe Keller, Takao Hayashi, Clemency Montelle and Dominik Wujastyk to conclude the following: \\"We express regret that the Bodleian Library kept their carbon-dating findings embargoed for many months, and then chose a newspaper press-release and YouTube as media for a first communication of these technical and historical matters. The Library thus bypassed standard academic channels that would have permitted serious collegial discussion and peer review prior to public announcements. ... we urge the investigators to consider the importance of reconciling their findings with historical knowledge and inferences obtained by other means. It should not be hastily assumed that the apparent implications of results from physical tests must be valid even if the conclusions they suggest appear historically absurd.\\" Referring to the detailed reconsideration of the evidence by Kim Plofker et al., Jan Houben remarked: \\"If the finding that samples of the same manuscript would be centuries apart is not based on mistakes in the procedure of sampling etc., or if the manuscript was at the moment it was written upon not partly consisting of older, recycled pages, there are still some factors that have evidently been overlooked by the Bodleian research team: the well-known divergence in exposure to cosmic radiation at different altitudes and the possible variation in background radiation due to the presence of certain minerals in exposed, mountainous rock have nowhere been taken into account. Among the variables of carbon dates, variation in script and linguistic variation, the first is the most objective but still much in need of calibration for relatively recent, historical dates.\\"Jan E.M. Houben ‚ÄúLinguistic Paradox and Diglossia: on the emergence of Sanskrit and Sanskritic language in Ancient India.‚Äù De Gruyter Open Linguistics (Topical Issue on Historical Sociolinguistic Philology, ed. by Chiara Barbati and Christian Gastgeber.) OPLI ‚Äì Vol. 4, issue 1: 1-18. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/opli-2018-0001 Prior to the proposed radiocarbon dates of the 2017 study, most scholars agreed that the physical manuscript was a copy of a more ancient text, whose date had to be estimated partly on the basis of its content. Hoernl√© thought that the manuscript was from the 9th century, but the original was from the 3rd or 4th century. Indian scholars assigned it an earlier date. Datta assigned it to the \\"early centuries of the Christian era\\". Channabasappa dated it to AD 200‚Äì400, on the grounds that it uses mathematical terminology different from that of Aryabhata. Hayashi noted some similarities between the manuscript and Bhaskara I's work (AD 629), and said that it was \\"not much later than Bhaskara I\\". To settle the date of the Bakhshali manuscript, language use and especially palaeography are other major parameters to be taken into account. In this context Jan Houben observed: \\"In view of the strong normativity of linguistic usage within the dimension ‚Äúsanskrit - approximative sanskrit‚Äù it is difficult to derive a linear chronological difference from the observed linguistic variation. Also writing is a normative activity and moreover dependent on some amount of individual variation from scribe to scribe. However, writing has been much less subject either to the intensive study of early scripts by later generation scribes or to the conscious reintroduction of archaisms in later forms of writing (something we see in language, most famously the studied archaizing ‚ÄúVedic‚Äù language use in parts of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and in the BhƒÅgavatapurƒÅ·πáa). We therefore have to take quite seriously the judgement of palaeographists such as Richard Salomon who observed that, what he teleologically called ‚ÄúProto- ≈öƒÅradƒÅ,‚Äù ‚Äúfirst emerged around the middle of the seventh century‚Äù (Salomon 1998: 40). This excludes the earlier dates attributed to manuscript folios on which a fully developed form of ≈öƒÅradƒÅ appears. The ‚Äúhardest‚Äù evidence to judge the date of a manuscript such as the Bakhshali and its sections would therefore be the palaeographic evidence. Other evidence, including the laboratory results of radiocarbon dating, is to be interpreted in the light of the results reached by careful palaeographic study.\\"Jan E.M.

Turkey hosts more than three thousand endemic plant species, has high diversity of other taxa, and is almost entirely covered by three of the world's thirty-five biodiversity hotspots. Although some environmental pressures have been decoupled from economic growth the environment still faces many threats, such as coal and diesel fuel emitting greenhouse gases and deadly fine particulate air pollution.OECD (2019), page 3 there is no fine particulate limit and coal in Turkey is subsidized. Issues =Conservation of biodiversity= The wildlife of Turkey is diverse, due to its wide variety of habitats and unique position between three continents and three seas. \\"Ill-considered development projects are threatening biodiversity, but a new wildlife corridor offers hope for further conservation progress.\\" Turkish montane forests face major threats to their genetic diversity associated with over-exploitation, forest fragmentation, air pollution, and global climatic change. The European Environment Agency has identified three biogeographic regions in Turkey, the Black Sea, Mediterranean and Anatolian regions, which should be protected under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, to which Turkey is signatory. =Air pollution= Air pollution is particularly significant in urban areas; the problem is especially acute in Istanbul, Ankara, Erzurum, and Bursa, where the combustion of heating fuels increases particulate density in winter. Almost all the urban population is exposed to particulate matter emissions higher than the EU and World Health Organization limits. Especially in Istanbul, increased car ownership causes frequent urban smog conditions. \\"Air pollution in urban centers, often caused by transport, and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems.\\" \\"PM10 levels are 36.7 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the OECD average of 20.9 micrograms per cubic meter, and the annual guideline limit of 20 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.\\" Although there is some monitoring of air pollution compared with other European countries, many air pollution indicators are not available. Regulations in Turkey do not contain any restrictions on the pollutant PM 2.5, which causes lung diseases. Greenpeace Mediterranean claim that the Af≈üin-Elbistan coal-fired plant is the power plant with the highest health risk in Europe, followed by the Soma coal- fired power plant, also from Turkey. =Waste disposal= many municipalities use substandard dumps to dispose of waste.EEA (2019), p. 227 =Noise= Environmental noise data is not reported.EEA (2019), p. 255 =Climate change= Summer temperatures have increased and are expected to continue to increase due to climate change. Coal in Turkey emits a third of the country's greenhouse gas. =Water= Pollution Organic pollution of streams is a problem. There is a potential for spills from the 5,000 oil- and gas- carrying ships that pass through the Bosporus annually. Drought Turkey is at risk of water shortages. Almost three quarters of water that is consumed is used for irrigation in agriculture. =Land degradation= Land degradation is a critical agricultural problem, caused by inappropriate use of agricultural land, overgrazing, or over-fertilization,. Serious soil erosion has occurred in 69% of Turkey's land surface. A national soil information system is being developed as presently 'it is difficult to assess the levels of land degradation, desertification or soil contamination'. =Green space in cities= Former military land in cities may be rezoned for housing. Laws and regulations The first Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control permits are expected to be issued in 2024, to use best available techniques but to use the least stringent emission levels (of those specified in EU 2017-1442).OECD (2019), page 94 Politics Environmental issues are becoming more politically sensitive. Changes in the law on environmental impact assessments are being considered which will permit mining investments without waiting for environmental impact assessments. The EU has asked for \\"a stronger political commitment\\". In 2019 Turkey was one of five countries which voted against the proposed UN Global Pact for the Environment. Economics Ecotaxes on gasoline, diesel fuel and vehicles cover the social cost of carbon from the road transport sector, however being nationwide they are not designed to cover the negative externality of health costs due to local air pollution in cities. =Subsidies= Turkey continues to provide substantial environmentally harmful subsidies, such as subsidies for poor families to use coal for heating.OECD (2019), executive summary Restrictions on public access to information Turkey is not a party to the Aarhus Convention, and the EUEuropean Commission (2019), page 93 and OECD say the government should remove restrictions on access to environmental information:OECD (2019), executive summary researchers say the government is punishing them for publishing information about pollution.

Dead Meat was the first microbudget film to receive a release. To cut costs, the crew used many donated sets, filmmakers' personal vehicles and recruited volunteer extras at the local pub. Dead Meat received video distribution by Revolver Entertainment in the UK and Fangoria Entertainment in the US. Soundtrack David Muyllaert, who played heroic gravedigger Desmond in Dead Meat, also sang lead on the film's title song, the punk-metal-ish \\"Dead Meat\\". Reception Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \\"A rural Irish setting and mad cow disease plot hook do surprisingly little to distinguish fast-moving but routine zombie flick\\". Beyond Hollywood called it \\"one of the best zombie movies, regardless of budget, to come out in recent years\\". Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia: Volume 2, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"A few unexpected twists and a lot gorgeous scenery distinguish this otherwise straightforward B-zed flick from Ireland.\\" References External links 2004 films 2004 horror films Irish films Irish horror films English-language films Splatter films Films about zombies ","title":"Dead Meat (film)"},{"id":"4305844","text":"Elisabeth of Hesse may refer to: * Elisabeth of Hesse-Marburg (1466-1523), daughter of Henry III, Landgrave of Upper Hesse and wife of John V of Nassau- Dillenburg * Elisabeth of Hesse (1502‚Äì1557), daughter of William II, Landgrave of Hesse * Elisabeth of Hesse (1503‚Äì1563), daughter of William I, Landgrave of Lower Hesse and wife of Louis II, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken * Elisabeth of Hesse (1539‚Äì1582), daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse and married George, Duke of Saxony * Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt (1635‚Äì1709), daughter of George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and wife of Philip William, Elector Palantine * Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel (1661-1683), daughter of William VI, wife of Frederick I of Prussia See also * Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (disambiguation) ","title":"Elisabeth of Hesse (disambiguation)"},{"id":"4305845","text":"Greg Champion is an Australian songwriter, guitarist, radio personality and athlete. Born in Benalla, Victoria, Champion is most recognised for his work as part of the Coodabeen Champions as a songwriter and guitarist. Greg often appears on the program writing songs about both Aussies rules football and cricket. He is an avid Australian rules football fan, supporting the Adelaide Crows and since the 1980s has penned many tunes on the Australian game. Of these, the most famous is \\"That's the Thing About Football\\", which has gone down as a classic Australian rules song, and has been used on Seven Network's Australian Football League coverage. Greg Champion grew up in Hectorville, a suburb of the South Australian capital, Adelaide. Beginning in 1983, Champion has appeared on ABC Local Radio as part of the Coodabeens team, singing parodies of popular songs and relating them to Australian rules footballers. Champs (Greg Champion) has written hundreds of songs (many serious, many humorous) and is a multi-awarded country/folk singer, who after being discovered in the Catacombs (an Adelaide folk club of the 1970s), went on to form the band Tidewater before launching a successful solo career. Champion's highest selling album is the 1996 released Aussie Christmas with Bucko & Champs with Australian country music star Colin Buchanan. Their duet \\"Aussie Jingle Bells\\" is a favourite at Christmas time. In 1998, a sequel to \\"Aussie Christmas with Bucko & Champs\\" was released featuring 25 Christmas-themed songs. In 2006, his song \\"Been there, done that\\" rocketed to No. 4 on the Country Music Chart having been released that year as part of The Shack Tapes. In 2009, Greg released his Strayana CD which is proving popular as it epitomises his \\"half country, half folk, half comedy\\" approach to music. In 2010, Champs was awarded Victorian Male Vocalist in the Victorian Country Music Awards for his meaningful song ‚Äúthis was my town (Marysville)‚Äù. In 2011, Champs released a well regarded CD At This Stage, a collection of fan favourite songs 2002‚Äì2010, which included the first release (on a CD) of the absolute classic \\"(Listening to the) Earthbeat\\" written and first performed in 1995. The release included his \\"best of\\" CD 1990‚Äì2001. In 2012, just prior to heading off to his 22nd Tamworth Country Music Festival, he surprised many with his Emergence CD which had a wide range of musical styles of 11 original songs. In 2017 Champs headlined the show All Star Musical Comedy Showcase with Greg Champion & Friends at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

Biography  Traube was born at Ratibor (Racib√≥rz) in Prussian Silesia, a son of the famous private scholar Moritz Traube. After studying law for a short time, he studied chemistry in Heidelberg, Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw), Munich and Berlin. Among his tutors were August Wilhelm von Hofmann, Adolf von Baeyer and Karl Friedrich Rammelsberg. In 1888 he received his doctorate \\"√úber die Additionsprodukte der Cyans√§ure\\". Since 1897 Traube was assistant at the Pharmakological Institute in Berlin, since 1902 assistant at the Pharmaceutical Institute and \\"Titularprofessor\\". In 1911 he became an associate professor and 1929 a full professor. Hermann Emil Fischer nominated Traube to be department head at the Chemical Institute (Analytical Department) of the University in Berlin. Traube was inventive and held many patents in cellulose chemistry and salts of metal complexes. Traube is well known for a procedure of synthesis of caffeine. The TRAUBEsche Synthese (Traube purine synthesis) was important for the pharmacological industry. The University of Kiel appointed him full professor, but he refused. Traube was a board member of the German Chemical Society and became in 1926 a member of the Leopoldina in Halle. In December 1938, Otto Hahn used an organic salt that Traube had constructed in order to detect barium in the products of nuclear fission. Traube liked to play the piano. He was of Jewish origin but belonged to the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. In 1935 the Nazis deprived Traube of the right to teach. His property was expropriated, and he was arrested on 11 September 1942. Traube had planned to commit suicide with cyanide before deportation, but Hahn had asked him not to do so. Hahn and Walter Schoeller had knowledge of the forthcoming deportation and tried to rescue him on the same day, but arrived a mere few hours too late. Traube died in prison in Berlin as a result of maltreatment. Traube is buried in Berlin's Wei√üensee Cemetery; there is no memorial stone.

He was the Prime Minister of Somali Republic from 14 June 1964 to 15 July 1967.Somalia - Worldstatesmen.com From 1975 to early 1980, he also served as the country's ambassador to the United Nations. A former Secretary General of the Somali Youth League, Hussein played a leading role in the nation's early civilian administration. Early life Hussein was born in 1924 in Galkayo, the capital of the north-central Mudug region of Somalia. His family hailed from the Majeerteen Harti Darod clan. He studied the Qur'an under his father, Hajji Hussein Atosh, who was an authority on Islam. Hussein was largely self-educated, and was fluent in both Italian and English. He was married, and had two daughters and a son. Career =Early career= From 1942 to 1949, Hussein served as an officer in the British Military Administration, including as an interpreter. He was also a clerk during the early periods of the Trust Territory of Somalia. In 1950, he was imprisoned for six months for protesting for Somali independence. In 1944, Hussein joined the Somali Youth League. He subsequently became a Galkayo Councillor in 1954, during the nation's first municipal elections. In June 1955, Hussein was sent to the United Nations, where he presented a petition on the SYL's behalf. He was elected the party's Secretary General a few months later, and became a Member of Parliament for the Nugal District of the Mudug region in 1959. That same year, Hussein elected to the National Assembly in 1959. During this period, he was also the president of the Higher Institute of Law and Economics and would later go on to become the president of the University Institute. In the first post-independence government of Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, Hussein served as Minister of Interior from 1960 to 1962, and Minister of Public Works and Communications from 1962 to 1964. Prime Minister of Somalia =Civilian administration= Countrywide municipal elections, in which the Somali Youth League won 74 percent of the seats, occurred in November 1963. These were followed in March 1964 by the country's first post-independence national elections. Again the SYL triumphed, winning 69 out of 123 parliamentary seats. The party's true margin of victory was even greater, as the fifty-four seats won by the opposition were divided among a number of small parties. After the 1964 National Assembly election in March, a crisis occurred that left Somalia without a government until the beginning of September. President Osman, who was empowered to propose the candidate for prime minister after an election or the fall of a government, chose Abdirizak Haji Hussein as his nominee instead of the incumbent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who had the endorsement of the SYL party leadership. Shermarke had been prime minister for the four previous years, and Osman decided that new leadership might be able to introduce fresh ideas for solving national problems. In drawing up a Council of Ministers for presentation to the National Assembly, the nominee for prime minister chose candidates on the basis of ability and without regard to place of origin. But Hussein's choices strained intraparty relations and broke the unwritten rules that there be clan and regional balance. For instance, only two members of Shermarke's cabinet were to be retained, and the number of posts in northern hands was to be increased from two to five. The SYL's governing Central Committee and its parliamentary groups became split. Hussein had been a party member since 1944 and had participated in the two previous Shermarke cabinets. His primary appeal was to younger and more educated party members. Several political leaders who had been left out of the cabinet joined the supporters of Shermarke to form an opposition group within the party. As a result, the Hussein faction sought support among non-SYL members of the National Assembly. Although the disagreements primarily involved personal or group political ambitions, the debate leading to the initial vote of confidence centered on the issue of Greater Somalia. Both Osman and prime minister-designate Hussein wanted to give priority to the country's internal economic and social problems. The proposed cabinet failed to be affirmed by a margin of two votes. Seven National Assembly members, including Shermarke, abstained, while forty- eight members of the SYL voted for Hussein and thirty-three opposed him. Despite the apparent split in the SYL, it continued to attract recruits from other parties. In the first three months after the election, seventeen members of the parliamentary opposition resigned from their parties to join the SYL. Osman ignored the results of the vote and again nominated Hussein as prime minister. After intraparty negotiation, which included the reinstatement of four party officials expelled for voting against him, Hussein presented a second cabinet list to the National Assembly that included all but one of his earlier nominees. However, the proposed new cabinet contained three additional ministerial positions filled by men chosen to mollify opposition factions. The new cabinet was approved with the support of all but a handful of SYL National Assembly members. Hussein remained in office until the presidential elections of June 1967. The 1967 presidential elections, conducted by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again the central issue was moderation versus militancy on the pan- Somali question. Osman, through Hussein, had stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, was elected president of the republic. =Greater Somalia= Due to the Somali government's vision of uniting Somali-inhabited territories, the administration was suspected of giving aid and support to the irredentist movements in the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the Northern Frontier District of northeastern Kenya, and French Somaliland. Even though Hussein favoured the idea of Greater Somalia, he persistently denied reports that his government was involved in support. He stated his policy was to pursue the issue constitutional and peaceful means. He called for United Nations plebiscites in the Somali-inhabited areas outside the republic and asked for the Organization of African Unity to send fact-finding commissions to the areas to determine what the Somali inhabitants of these disputed areas desired. Neither organization responded to his calls but the Organization of African Unity passed a resolution favouring the retention of existing boundaries inherited from the European colonial powers throughout Africa. Later years Immediately after the 1969 Somali coup d'√©tat that overthrew the civilian government, Hussein became a political prisoner and remained in detention from 1969 to April 1973. In 1974, he was appointed as Somalia's representative to the United Nations in 1974, and he held that position until 1979. During the Somali civil war, Hussein was called on several times to help reconcile the warring parties. On May 6, 2001, an effort by the Transitional National Government (TNG) to create the National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement (NCRPS), a 25-member working body, was stalled when Abdirizak Haji Hussein was named as its chief. The Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC) and Puntland's then leadership opposed the bid. On July 25, 2001, Hussein resigned from the post. Death and legacy Hussein died of pneumonia on 31 January 2014 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, after being hospitalized for a week. Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed issued a statement a few hours later sending his condolences to Hussein's family and friends. Ahmed described Hussein as \\"one of the leading Somali nationalists of [the] 20th century,\\" noting that the late statesman was \\"a leading member of the freedom fighters of [the] Somali Youth League and following independence became a committed public servant and politician who dedicated his life to the people and the Republic of Somalia[...] we must now take forward his legacy.\\" Ahmed concurrently appointed a governmental committee to start preparations for a national funeral for Hussein, which would be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ridwan Hirsi Mohamed. Additionally, the Federal Government of Somalia announced that national memorial days would be held in Mogadishu in Hussein's honour, with the late leader's body slated to be transported to the city for burial. Puntland President and former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali was among the dignitaries scheduled to attend Hussein's funeral service in the capital. After originally departing from Minneapolis, Hussein's body arrived in Istanbul, Turkey, where governmental officials awaited on 5 February 2014. The Somali National Funeral Committee announced that Hussein would be buried in Mogadishu's National Cemetery, with the official farewell event slated to start on Friday after the burial service. Three days of national mourning and the lowering of the flag would begin the same day. On 7 February 2014, Hussein was laid to rest at a memorial service in Mogadishu Cemetery. The ceremony was attended by a number of dignitaries, including President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari, and Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, with security in the city concurrently bolstered. Janaza prayers were read at the capital's largest mosque, after which a burial service was held at the Al-Irfid cemetery on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Hussein was buried beside his former colleague, Aden Abdulle Osman Daar, the Somali Republic's first President. Incumbent President Mohamud sent his condolences to Hussein's family and the people of Somalia, and urged the gathered attendees to \\"pray for one of Somalia's greatest heroes[...] Abdirizak Haji Hussein was a great man and a towering Somali patriot[...] His life should be an example to all Somalis.\\" As a career politician, Hussein is remembered for his emphasis on responsible leadership. Most of his Cabinet members and director generals were educated, young and energetic professionals who had been selected on the basis of merit. During his tenure as Somalia's ambassador to the United Nations, Hussein also signed a number of international agreements on the country's behalf, including the International Convention on Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. Openness, stability, fairness, anti-corruption and anti-nepotism, and good governance characterized his political career, particularly his tenure as Prime Minister.

The genus is monotypic, including only the type species, T. longicranialis. The specimen consists of a very partial individual, compromising the skull and lacking postcranial remains. Since it only preserves the skull, Tsagantegia is mainly characterized by its elongated snout and the flattened facial osteoderms, greatly differing from other ankylosaurs. Discovery and naming The holotype specimen, MPC 700/17, is a virtually complete skull that was recovered from the locality Tsagan-Teg (or \\"White Mountain\\") of the Bayan Shireh Formation in the southeastern Gobi Desert, Mongolia. It was formally described in 1993 by the Russian paleontologist Tatyana Alekseyevna Tumanova. The generic name, Tsagantegia, is in reference to Tsagan Teg, the locality of its discovery, and the specific name, longicranialis, is derived from the Latin words longus and crƒÅnium, in reference to its elongated skull. Description Skeletal diagram of MPC 700/17 Tsagantegia was a medium to large-sized ankyosaur, with an estimated length of Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information and weighing about . The skull measures about in length, with a near width of , missing the lower jaws. Unlike other Asian ankylosaurs, in Tsagantegia the caputegulae (cranial ornamentation) are not subdivided into a mosaic of polygons but are amorphous and flattened; they show some degree of symmetry. The quadratojugal, squamosal and orbital horns are poorly preserved, in contrast with other ankylosaurs. The snout was long and flat with a pointed rostrum (beak); each maxilla preserves approximately 18 alveoli, no teeth were preserved. According to Arbour, Tsagantegia differs from Gobisaurus and Shamosaurus based on the more rounded, U-shaped premaxillary beak and the flat ornamentation. Classification Although fragmentary, its position can be established. In 2012, Thompson et al. conducted an analysis of almost all known valid ankylosaurs and outgroup taxa at the time. They based their resulting phylogeny on characters representing cranial, post-cranial, and osteodermal anatomy, and details of synapomorphies for each recovered clade. Tsagategia was found to be closely related to Pinacosaurus and Shamosaurus. In the performed phylogenetic analysis by Arbour and Currie in 2015, Tsagantegia seems to be more related to Pinacosaurus and Zhejiangosaurus; below are the results for the analysis: Paleoecology Tsagantegia compared to the Dinosauria of the Bayan Shireh Formation (Tsagantegia in lime, fourth from left) Tsagantegia was unearthed from the Tsagan Teg locality, which represents part of the Upper Bayan Shireh. Calcite U‚ÄìPb analyses seem to confirm the age of the Bayan Shireh Formation from 102 million to 86 million years ago, Cenomanian-Santonian ages. Based on comparisons between the snouts of Tsagantegia and the contemporary Talarurus, these taxa were divided by niche partitioning. In a palatal view, the rostra Talarurus have a broad-like, rectangular shape, while Tsagantegia have a more shovel-like shaped rostra. These morphological differences indicate that Tsagantegia filled the niche of a browser herbivore, while Talarurus was a grazer. The Bayan Shireh Formation could have looked like the Finke River Fossil localities in Mongolia. Locality of Tsagantegia in Tsagan Teg, at Area D Caliche-based boundary indicates a semi-arid environment and climate, but also, the presence of fluvial and lacustrine sediments are indicators of large rivers and lakes. As interpreded by Hicks et al. 1999, during the times of the Bayan Shireh Formation, large rivers drained the estern part of the Gobi Desert. Additional to this, fossil fruits remains have been recovered from the Bor Guv√© and Khara Khutul localities (Upper and Lower Bayan Shireh, respectively), suggesting the presence of Angiosperm plants. Tsagantegia shared its habitat with numerous animals from other localities of the formation, compromising dinosaur and non- dinosaur genera; such as the theropods Achillobator, Alectrosaurus, Erlikosaurus, Garudimimus and Segnosaurus; the fellow ankylosaur Talarurus; Marginocephalians: Amtocephale and Graciliceratops; the hadrosauroid Gobihadros, and the large sauropod Erketu. The turtle Lindholmemys, the crocodylomorph Paralligator, unnamed azhdarchids and the shark Hybodus.

The Empire State Express was one of the named passenger trains and onetime flagship of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (a predecessor of the later New York Central Railroad). On September 14, 1891 it covered the 436 miles (702 kilometers) between New York City and Buffalo in 7 hours and 6 minutes (including stops), averaging 61.4 miles-per- hour (98.8 km/h), with a top speed of 82 mph (132 km/h).  History  The train soon gained worldwide acclaim, and its route would later stretch to 620 miles (998 kilometers), to Cleveland, Ohio. The Empire State was the first passenger train with a schedule speed of over 52 mph and the first to make runs of 142.88 miles (230 km) between stops (between New York City and Albany: the longest scheduled nonstop run until then). The 1893 Guide shows an 8 hr 40 min schedule for 440 miles New York to Buffalo. As early as the 1930s the train served as a connector train for people making a transfer in Utica, New York for day trains through the Adirondacks and on to Malone, New York and Montreal, Quebec.July 1936 New York Central timetable, Table 58 http://www.canadasouthern.com/caso/ptt/images/tt-0736.pdf On December 7, 1941, the New York Central inaugurated a new stainless-steel streamlined (Budd) train, powered by a streamlined J-3a Hudson (4-6-4) steam locomotive. The streamlined shrouding of the J-3a Hudson was designed by Mr. Chase H. Knowlton and Mr. George M. Davies. Henry Dreyfuss wasn't involved with the project. Later that day Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese. Like many long haul passenger trains through the mid-1960s, the \\"Empire State Express\\" carried a 60-foot stainless steel East Division (E.D.) Railway Post Office (R.P.O.) car operated by the Railway Mail Service (RMS) of the United States Post Office Department which was staffed by USPOD clerks as a \\"fast mail\\" on each of its daily runs.Riding the Fast Mail. Popular Mechanics, February, 1943 p. 56 et seq. Mail handled by the \\"Empire State's\\" RPOs was canceled or backstamped by hand applied circular date stamps (CDS) reading \\"N.Y. & CHICAGO R.P.O.\\" and the train's number: \\"TR 50\\" (eastbound) or \\"TR 51\\" (westbound). The train was distinctively the most limited in stops (aside from the elite 20th Century Limited) in the New York City to Albany section. Beyond 125th Street, it only made a stop at Croton-Harmon, the location for switching from electric to diesel power, and made no other stops until Albany. From the post-war 1940s to the 1960s the train split at Buffalo. One section went along the south shore of Lake Erie to Cleveland. Another section went through Southwestern Ontario, Canada to Detroit, Michigan.June 1951 New York Central timetable http://streamlinermemories.info/NYC/NYC51-6TT.pdfFrom the early 1960s the Buffalo to Detroit section was a separate connecting train.April 1964 New York Central timetable http://streamlinermemories.info/NYC/NYC64TT.pdf Also at this time, coaches on the train from New York broke off at Buffalo and joined with the Buffalo-Toronto Express in partnership with the Canadian Pacific Railway bound for Toronto.Official Guide of the Railways, June 1961, New York Central section, 'Sleeping Car, Coach and Dining Service,' and Tables 11, 13, 37 This Toronto segment ended by April 1964.New York Central timetable, April 1964, Buffalo-Toronto Express and Toronto-Buffalo Express eliminated from timetable In 1967 the train was extended from being a day train to continuing to Chicago, Illinois as an overnight train.November 1967 New York Central timetable http://www.canadasouthern.com/caso/ptt/images/tt-1167.pdf With the December 1967 schedule the Empire State Express name was gone, and #51 was shortened to Buffalo to Chicago, via Cleveland. The eastbound #50 was from Detroit to Buffalo.December 1967 New York Central timetable http://www.canadasouthern.com/caso/ptt/images/tt-1267.pdf = Amtrak = When Amtrak took over the nation's passenger service on May 1, 1971 it consolidated trains on the New York--Albany--Buffalo corridor into the \\"Empire Service\\". Amtrak revived the name, although not the route to match, on January 6, 1974 when it gave names to Empire Service trains. The Empire State Express returned as a New York--Buffalo train, numbers 71 and 78. On October 31 that year Amtrak extended the train to Detroit via Southwestern Ontario with dining car and baggage service.Amtrak May 1975 timetable, p. 34 This was the first instance of restored New York City to Detroit through Ontario service since the Penn Central's successor to the New York Central's Wolverine. On April 25, 1976 Amtrak renamed this train the Niagara Rainbow. Amtrak brought the name back in 1978 as a New York--Buffalo service, which in 1979 was extended to Niagara Falls. A few years later Amtrak dropped train names on the Empire Corridor. Empire State Express locomotive No. 999 New York Central and Hudson River Railroad No. 999, the \\"Queen of Speed,\\" slows to as it leads the Empire State Express through Palatine, New York in 1905. The key to the Empire State's initial fame was a -long American-type 4-4-0 steam locomotive built in West Albany, New York especially to haul the train. The handmade unit had 86\\" diameter driving wheels and was the first of its kind to have brakes on the front truck. The bands, pipes, and trim were polished; the boiler, smokestack, domes, cab, and tender were given a black satin finish, and \\"Empire State Express\\" was applied to the sides of the tender in high gold leaf lettering. After touring the nation and making appearances at numerous expositions including the Chicago Railroad Fair, the unit was retired from service in May, 1952, at which time it was relegated switching service in western New York shuttling express service milk cars.

This poorly known genus has been recovered from the Paw Paw Formation (late Albian) near Haslet, Tarrant County, Texas, which has also produced the nodosaurid ankylosaur Pawpawsaurus. Texasetes is estimated to have been 2.5‚Äì3 m (8‚Äì10 ft) in length. It was named by Coombs in 1995. Discovery and species The holotype and only known specimen (USNM 337987) consists of portions of the scapulocoracoid and pelvis, elements from the fore and hind limbs, vertebrae, osteoderms, a skull fragment, and one tooth. These remains had been labelled as those of a sauropod in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, but were many years later recognized as ankylosaurian by M.K. Brett-Surman. They were subsequently studied by ankylosaur expert Walter Preston Coombs, Jr, who named them in 1995 as the type species Texasetes pleurohalio. Vickaryous et al. (2004) and Coombs (1995) describe Texasetes as having a horizontally oriented ilium, an imperforate acetabulum, and \\"characteristically ankylosaur scapula morphology, including a prominent acromion and prespinous fossa.\\" Classification However, Lee (1996) has questioned whether this material is diagnostic and suggests Texasetes is likely a synonym of Pawpawsaurus. Coombs assigned the specimen to the family Nodosauridae, but Vickaryous et al. consider it Ankylosauria incertae sedis. See also * Timeline of ankylosaur research References *Coombs, W. P. 1995.

The hill was to be Spirit rover's next target. She was expected to reach significant north-facing slopes on the hill in mid-April 2006, and spend her second winter on Mars there. However, on the way to the slopes on \\"McCool Hill\\" between outcrops nicknamed \\"Oberth\\" and \\"Korolev,\\" Spirit ran into an impassable sandy area. To increase solar power output, Spirits handlers redirected the rover to a closer north- facing slope in an area known as \\"Low Ridge\\" or \\"Low Ridge Haven,\\" about 20 meters away from the rover's position on sol 802 (April 5, 2006). Spirit spent the rest of the Martian winter here, operating from a fixed position for long periods of time, attempting to observe very small changes that would not be noticeable otherwise because the rover was moving much more often. Mission directors were undecided on where to go in the spring, either to re-attempt the climb of McCool Hill, go back to Home Plate, or elsewhere. In the end they decided to go to Low Ridge Haven. Husband Hill was originally thought to be the highest of the Columbia Hills as seen from Columbia Memorial Station until surveying by Spirit updated elevation levels, placing McCool as the highest.

It is found mainly on the edge of forests where it is seen or heard at dusk. The taxonomy of this and related nightjars is complex and a range of treatments have been followed that cover this and several other nightjars in the Asian region. It was formerly called the grey nightjar or Indian jungle nightjar and sometimes included the East Asian grey nightjar (C. jotaka) as a subspecies. Description In flight (Western Ghats) With chick, in Bandipur National Park The jungle nightjar is about 21‚Äì24 cm long with the Sri Lankan population (ssp. kelaarti) being smaller. Mostly grey with black streaks on the crown, it lacks a conspicuous wing patch which is rufous. The tail is greyish with well separated narrow black bars. The male has a white throat patch that is broken at the middle. The female has a rufous throat patch and submoustachial streaks. The usual call is a series of thacoo or chuck notes (at the rate of 5 every 2 seconds) like a distant engine. The song is a slow and regular, series of FWik-m notes, repeated for as long as 10 seconds. This sometimes ends in quick whistling foo-foo with the quality of sounds obtained when air is blown over an open bottle. A call described as uk-krukroo attributed to this species by Ali and Ripley in their Handbook is in error and is the call of the Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia). Taxonomy Jungle nightjar in Karnataka The Indian (nominate) and the Sri Lankan populations (ssp. kelaarti) are included in this species while jotaka (whose egg coloration and calls differs) has been separated and elevated to a full species, Grey nightjar, by Rasmussen and Anderton (2005). The populations found along the Himalayas, west from Hazara to Bhutan and south to Bangladesh, hazarae, are then treated as a subspecies of Caprimulgus jotaka in this work. Records of jotaka have come from the Andamans and Phuentsholing. Older treatments include the widely distributed (China, Japan) migratory subspecies jotaka and phalaena (Palau Island) in this species. Its scientific name means \\"nightjar from India\\", and it is thus sometimes confused with C. asiaticus which is commonly known as the Indian nightjar. To distinguish them, in former times C. indicus was known as the large Indian nightjar. Behaviour  The jungle nightjar becomes active at dusk, often over hilly grassland or scrub, perching regularly at favourite prominent bare posts or rocks. It roosts in trees, perching lengthwise along a branch. The breeding season in India is January to June and March to July in Sri Lanka. The nest is a bare patch on the ground in which two eggs are laid. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 16 to 17 days.
