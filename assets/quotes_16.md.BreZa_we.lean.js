He was the eldest son of Thomas Anstey, an early settler in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). George migrated to Tasmania at the age of thirteen and arrived in Hobart in February 1827 with Thomas 'Chiz' Chisholm Anstey, one of his younger brothers, in the ship Admiral Cockburn. At the age of sixteen, he led one of his father's roving parties in the Black War and captured a small tribe of Aboriginals, winning a 500-acre (2 km²) land grant and official praise for his 'humanity and kindness'. In 1834, Anstey went back to England with one of his sisters; on his return to Tasmania, he was shipwrecked in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. In 1837 he took sheep to Port Phillip, sold them to John and Somerville Learmonth, and returned to Oatlands, his father's estate. He then took sheep to South Australia, but could not sell them straight away and had to remain in the new colony. By 1840 he had at his newly acquired estate of Highercombe in the Adelaide Hills. Highercombe was named after a village near Dulverton, Somerset, England - his father's birthplace. With 9000 sheep at the time, he was one of the South Australia's biggest stock-holders. His flocks grew and by 1851 he had extensive pastoral leases on the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas. The produce of his orchard and vineyard at Highercombe was also winning a wide reputation. Although a 'true liberal' he was defeated by William Giles in two successive polls at Yatala in the first elections for the Legislative Council. Nominated to the first vacancy on 17 December 1851, he resigned on 25 August 1852, despairing of 'a reasonable constitution for the people'. On 12 September 1837 he married Harriet Kingham, daughter of W. J. Ruffy, sometime editor of the Farmers' Journal, in London; they had nine children. After his father's death he returned to Van Diemen's Land with his wife and two sons, but soon went to England where, after years of constant travel, he died in 1895. He is remembered by the name Anstey Hill, a geographical feature, and the Anstey Hill Recreation Park in the north eastern suburbs of Adelaide.

It is located in the northeastern part of Salamis Island (Cape Arapis), Greece and in Amphiali and Skaramangas. It is close to the major population centre of Athens. Most Hellenic Navy ships are based at Salamis, as well as many of its administrative, training and support services. The base employs approximately 10,000 naval and civilian personnel. History The first organized Greek Naval Base during the Greek War of Independence (1821 Revolution) was founded on Poros. The facility remained in use as the main naval base of the Royal Hellenic Navy until 1881 and is still used today for naval personnel training. Between January 1878 and April 1881, certain activities were transferred from Poros to the Faneromeni Monastery () and its surrounding area, on Salamis Island. On April 16, 1881, a Royal Decree directed that a new naval base would be built in Salamis, at a location then called Arapi, near Akra (Cape) Arapis. The Navy acquired an area of approximately 300 hectares.In the Greek texts the area is stated as 3000 Greek stremmata Most of the land was donated by the Municipality of Salamis, which saw the construction of the naval base as an opportunity for employment, real estate development and business profit. Construction of the new base began in 1881 and gradually naval activities were transferred to the new buildings from Poros and Faneromeni Monastery. One of the first buildings was the church of Saint Nikolaos (1882). The new naval base was used intensively during the Balkan Wars, the First World War and the Second World War. A suburban standard gauge light railway line (Piraeus-Perama light railway) opened in 1936, connecting Piraeus with Perama and terminating inside the naval base at Amphiali. The line remained in use until 1977. During the Second World War the naval base was occupied by the Germans and used for naval activities, including submarine operations. The Germans retreated in 1944, after causing extensive damage to the installations. In addition the sea channel was blocked by a number of naval ships sunk by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the decommissioned battleships Lemnos and Kilkis. Cleanup, salvage and reconstruction work began in November 1944 and the facilities were gradually restored to operational condition. Salamis Naval Base has been in continuous use by the Hellenic Navy ever since, while a second major base was constructed at Souda Bay. Structure and activities Aerial bombing of Nazi occupied Salamis Naval Dock, September 1944 Salamis Naval Base dry dock facilities (1979) Salamis Naval Base administrative area (1979) Salamis Naval Base belongs to the Hellenic Navy Logistics Command. It consists of the Headquarters and the following services: * Ship movements, docks, jetties and base security * Salamis Naval Hospital (ΝΝΣ) * General procurement and supplies service (ΝΣ/ΔΕ) * Fuel supply service (ΝΣ/ΔΚ) * Naval infrastructure section (ΝΣ/ΔΝΕΡ) * Naval weapons service (ΝΣ/ΔΝΟ) * Chemical Laboratory (ΝΣ/ΔΝΧ) * Financial section (ΝΣ/ΔΟΥ) * Technical section (ΝΣ/ΔΤ) The following commands of the Fleet Headquarters are also based within Salamis Naval Base: * Hellenic Command Frigates * Hellenic Command Fast Boats * Hellenic Command Gun Boats * Hellenic Command Mine Sweepers * Hellenic Command Amphibious Forces * Hellenic Command Submarines * Underwater Demolition Command Other naval units in the base area include: * Palaskas Training Camp * Amphiali Heliport, LGAM In addition, the Forward Operating Naval Base of Syros is controlled by Salamis Naval Base. Relations with local communities Salamis Naval Base has established close ties with the local community. The base is a major employer for the islanders and regularly subcontracts ship maintenance to local business establishments in Salamis, Perama, Keratsini and Drapetsona. In addition it provides the local community with health services (the islanders were served by the naval hospital), vocational training for the young, and reinforcement to the national and municipal emergency services (fire and ambulance).

Rudolf William Nilsen (28 February 1901 – 23 March 1929) was a Norwegian poet and journalist. Early life He was born in the district of Vålerenga in Kristiania (present-day Oslo), on 28 February 1901,Tilbake på stengrunn and was raised at the nearby neighborhood of Tøyen/Grønland in the same city. Writing and political life Rudolf Nilsen's first published work was the collection of poetry På stengrunn (1925), which was followed by På gjensyn (1926). Many of his poems were of political nature, while others were romantic or about the contemporary life in Oslo. His poem collection, Hverdagen was published posthumously the same year. His collected poems were published in 1935. New collections of his works were published in the 1970s. An album bearing the same title as his first collection of poetry, På Stengrunn, was popular in the 1970s and still in 2019 there are yearly concerts where the songs are performed. Other artists, both Norwegian and other Nordic artists have composed songs to the poems of Rudolf Nilsen, even as recently as 2019. A child of the working class, Nilsen became part of the left-wing revolutionary movement and joined the organisation Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund (Social Democratic Youth League of Norway), the youth league of the Norwegian Labour Party. When the Norwegian Labour Party split up in 1923, due to an ideological schism, Nilsen decided to join the Communist Party of Norway, and their youth league Young Communist League of Norway. In 1921, he was arrested and stood trial for smuggling illegal revolutionary literature into Norway. With the help of defence lawyer (and later Secretary-General of the United Nations) Trygve Lie, he avoided sentencing, and was eventually found not guilty and released. Personal life and death In 1924, he married Ella Quist Kristoffersen, later Ella Hval. Nilsen died shortly after contracting tuberculosis in Paris on 23 March 1929. Outside his childhood address of Heimdalsgata nr 26, a public square was named after him in 1952, and a bronze statue of a worker, based on the theme of one of the poems, was erected on that site in 1954.

Glasgow, 18 March 1941 The Clydebank Blitz, comprised two devastating Luftwaffe air raids on the shipbuilding and munition-making town of Clydebank in Scotland which took place in March 1941. The air raids As a result of the raids on the nights of 13 and 14 March 1941, the town was largely destroyed and it suffered the worst destruction and civilian loss of life in all of Scotland. 1,200 people died, 1,000 people were seriously injured, and hundreds more were injured by blast debris. Over the course of the two nights, a total of 439 Luftwaffe bombers dropped in excess of 1,650 incendiary containers and 272 tonnes of bombs. Out of approximately 12,000 houses, only eight remained undamaged — with 4,000 completely destroyed and 4,500 severely damaged. Over 35,000 people were made homeless. Clydebank's production of ships and munitions for the Allies made it a target (similar to the Barrow Blitz). Major targets included the John Brown & Company shipyard, ROF Dalmuir and the Singer Corporation factory. A total of 439 bombers dropped over 1,000 bombs. RAF fighters managed to shoot down two aircraft during the raid, but none were brought down by anti-aircraft fire. The building on the right was one of the few which survived the Blitz. In his book Luftwaffe over Scotland: a history of German air attacks on Scotland, 1939-45, amateur historian Les Taylor characterised the Clydebank Blitz as \\"the most cataclysmic event\\" in wartime Scotland. He claims that while the raid on 13 March was not intended as a terror attack, it caused extensive damage because there was a lot of housing near the specific targets. But the bombings the following night were indeed a terror attack as it \\"was intended to crack morale and force the people to call for an end to the war. However, it had quite the opposite effect, strengthening resolve for the war in Scotland.\\"\\"The cold hard facts of the Blitz\\" , Clydebank Post, 21 April 2010. Retrieved 12 June 2011. Effectiveness of the raids To the immediate west of the town was situated Clydeside's main Admiralty Oil Storage facility, covering . Luftwaffe target maps categorised this area as the primary target. Post raid surveys counted 96 bomb craters. 11 tanks were destroyed and 7 were severely damaged. The resulting inferno blazed for over four weeks. Clydebank, to the immediate East, suffered badly as a result of being in close proximity. Clydebank in 1941 was a small industrial town, approximately long with an occupied townscape space of just over . Target discrimination was made difficult by the close mix of industry and housing resulting in a catastrophic housing loss. Many industrial targets were severely damaged. Singer's wood yard was destroyed and Singer's main building was badly damaged. Rothesay Dock and John Browns Shipyards suffered severe incendiary damage. William Beardmore & Co lost furnaces and related industrial infrastructure. Schools, churches and built-up town areas became victims of incendiaries. War memorials The main Blitz memorial is located in Dalnottar Cemetery above Clydebank. It is composed of a substantial granite memorial with bronze cast plates at its base designed by artist Tom McKendrick. The castings name the 528 casualties. The memorial sits over the remains of Clydebank's unclaimed dead. An additional memorial is dedicated to the crew of a Polish destroyer, , which helped defend the town from the docks of the John Brown & Company shipyard. It is located directly opposite from the Town Hall, which has itself a shrine dedicated to those in Clydebank who died during World War I and World War II. There is another war memorial on Graham Avenue. A recording made in May 1941 by bombed-out civilian Tom Wright features on The Blitz, an archive audiobook CD issued in 2007.

Before that, Palacio had tried unsuccessfully to win a world title on 3 occasions and never gave up on his dream, even when he had very low points in his career (between 1984 and 1986, for example, he lost 4 out of 5 fights).

He graduated from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut in 1863. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1864. He enlisted in the Union Army as a private in 1865 in the third West Virginia Cavalry. He had risen to the rank of first lieutenant when honorably discharged. After earning a Masters of Arts degree in 1866, again at Wesleyen, he returned to Wheeling and commenced the practice of law in 1866. He married Ann E. Chamberlin of Louisiana in 1868. He was a clerk of the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1866 to 1870, then served as a member of the House of Delegates in 1881 and 1882. He was chosen as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888 and 1912. At the 1912 Republican convention, Hubbard was a leading supporter of Theodore Roosevelt in his unsuccessful attempt to retake the White House. He was also an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia in 1888. Hubbard's candidacy for election in 1890 to the Fifty-second Congress was also unsuccessful. From 1901 to 1903 he served as chairman of the commission to revise the tax laws of West Virginia. He was elected in 1906 from West Virginia's 1st District as a Republican to the Sixtieth and Sixty- first Congresses (March 4, 1907 – March 3, 1911). He declined renomination in 1910 and returned to his law practice in Wheeling. There he died at the age of 77, and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Wheeling.

Collectively, the fires killed a total of 16 people. This disaster is an important part of the local history of the York County and Mount Desert Island areas. The fires After a wet spring, in which the months of April, May and June were inundated with rainy weather, the climate turned to drought conditions in mid-July, 1947. By the end of September, the ground was extremely dry. State and local officials, recognizing the dangers of the dry conditions, began implementing preventative measures such as informing the public to have their chimneys cleaned. By the second week of October, the state was in a Class 4 state of danger, meaning: \\"high state of inflammability.\\" Fire watch towers, normally closed at the end of September, were reopened by the State Forest Service. Reports of small fires in woods began coming into the Forest Service on October 7. These early fires burned in Portland, Bowdoin and Wells. Being apart from each other, these three fires illustrated the danger. After this, reports of fires poured in, and by October 16, 20 separate fires were burning in the state. By October 19, many communities in Maine breathed air filled with a smoky haze and the smell of burning wood. York County Hardest hit was northern York County, the southernmost county in the state. Fires began in the towns of Shapleigh and Waterboro, destroying both communities, including, with only a few exceptions, most homes. The fires swept through the forests, and moved with the wind toward the ocean. In addition to Waterboro and Shapleigh, the towns of Alfred, Lyman, Newfield, Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, North Kennebunkport (now Arundel), Dayton, Wells, and the cities of Biddeford and Saco were devastated by fire. With the exception of Shapleigh and Waterboro, most town centers were saved through the tireless work of firefighters, most notably Goodwins Mills in the eastern corner of Lyman, where due in part to a change in wind direction, only the center was saved, and all of the acreage around it burned to the ground. Restoration After the fire, bulldozers were brought in to clear the debris and standing chimneys where homes once stood. It took a decade for many to fully recover their losses. Modern evidence of the Great Fires Even today evidence exists of the Great Fires that swept through York County. In Waterboro, Shapleigh and Lyman, where the devastation was great, forests of small, undesirable pine trees grow en masse where great forests stood before the fires. One would notice on visits to these communities that homes within them lack historical significance; the oldest were built in the late 1940s. Most historic farms and homes built before 1947 in these communities were destroyed. In the late 1980s, to commemorate the Great Fires of 1947, the State of Maine developed signs for each community where the fires burned, detailing the effect the fires had on those communities. Signs still stand today in many communities, including Alfred at the Alfred Fire Department on Kennebunk road, Shapleigh at the Ross Corner Fire Department on Ross Corner Road, and North Kennebunkport (Arundel) at the Central Fire Station and Town Hall on Limerick Road. Many people fought to save their homes. In a book published in 1979, Joyce Butler wrote about the Great Fires of 1947 in Wildfire Loose: The Week Maine Burned: > Juanita and Franklin Spofford lived on the Granite Point Road across > Horseshoe Cove from Fortunes Rocks. The Spoffords wet down their house with > a garden hose until the pressure failed. Then they filled buckets and tubs > and set them around the house. As burning debris carried by the wind fell in > the grass, setting it afire, they wet brooms in the buckets and beat the > flames out. Bushes beside the garage caught fire. The house across the > street and others on Granite Point Road burned, but the Spoffords' did as > well.

The serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of α11 subset of HLA-A α-chains. For A11, the alpha \\"A\\" chain are encoded by the HLA-A allele group and the β-chain are encoded by B2M locus. This group currently is dominated by A*1101. A11 and A are almost synonymous in meaning. A11 is more common in East Asia than elsewhere, it is part of several long haplotypes that appear to have been frequent in the ancient peoples of Asia. Serotype Serotyping of A11 demonstrates better recognition of the *1101 gene products and poorer recognition of other A*11 gene products. There are ~40 recognized alleles of A*11. There is only one null classified as A11. =In infectious disease= Associations have been observed between A11 and familial otosclerosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, leprosy, and cytomegalovirus infection with epilepsy. These and other studies suggest an involvement between A11 and secondary effects of certain herpes virus infections. A11 was also found increase in supraglottic cancer with poor 3 year survival. In osteosarcoma A11 was found elevated. There is a strong association between anti-depressant induced hepatitis and HLA-A11. In autoimmune hepatitis, A11 has a synergistic effect, acting together with DR4 and DR3 to increase the odds of disease to over 300. A11 is also part of a haplotype A11-Cw4-B35-DR1-DQ1 that is a second factor in the rapid progression of HIV. The involvement of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma primarily as a result of Epstein-Barr virus reinfection does not appear to be a cause in this acceleration. Epstein-Barr Virus anomaly There are at least a couple of forms of lymphoproliferative diseases that appear to arise from unresolved Epstein-Barr virus infection. Examination of the virus itself has led to the discovery of strains that can all but turn off the A11-mediated class I response to the virus in A11 enriched peoples (see tables below). This ability to turn off the immune system and for the virus to remain active is a factor in carcinogenesis. Early studies of A serotypes revealed and association of A11 with Hodgkin's lymphoma and recent studies have shown a complex involvement of Epstein-Barr virus infection as a consequence of low A11 control over infection. Burkitt's lymphoma eventually lead to the discovery of the virus, however this disease is more evident in Africa. An involvement in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes down-regulation in Burkitt's lymphoma was subsequently discovered, More recent studies show A11 is down- regulated, and that other genetic defects are a likely cause. The ability to present EB virus antigens revealed a defect in the process after antigen process but before TAP1 involvement. Other studies indicated that peptides bind A11 in delivery to the cell surface for CTL screening, but fall off, and are destroyed intracellularly. However, A3 and A11 can process and load antigens even when proteosome activity is diminished suggesting an alternative mechanism for loading which may benefit in recovery from some disease but impair recovery of others. It appears that these and other viruses have learned to exploit some defect in the region surrounding A11 that allows the near complete shut-down of gene expression. Oddly, in Africa A11 is at very low frequencies, and homozygotes are rare, suggesting that other genetic susceptibilities may exist that steer the virus toward Burkitt's lymphoma.

He was the fifth son of George Nayler, surgeon, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, and his wife Sarah, daughter of John Fark of Clitheroe, Lancashire. Heraldic career Nayler was originally a miniature painter. In 1792, he married Charlotte Williams, the illegitimate daughter of Sir John Guise, 1st Baronet. That year, he acquired a loan of £1300 to purchase the resignation of John Suffield Brown as Genealogist of the Order of the Bath and Blanc Coursier Herald and Nayler was appointed on 15 June 1792. The following year, Nayler acquired a post in the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant for £60 and on the accidental deaths of Somerset and York Heralds at Haymarket in 1794, he was promoted to York Herald that year. In 1813, Nayler was knighted by The Prince Regent at Carlton House. In 1816 and 1818 respectively, Nayler was appointed King of Arms of the newly created orders of the Royal Guelphic Order and the Order of St Michael and St George.

He was known as \\"Daredevil Danny\\" and the original \\"Skywalker\\" in Philippine basketball. Collegiate/Amateur Career Florencio played for the UST Glowing Goldies from 1965–1967. After he left UST, joined the national team soon after, and became a member of the RP Team that finished second in the 1971 ABC Championships in Tokyo, which earned them a berth in the 1972 Munich Olympics. This was the last time the Philippine national basketball team qualified for the Olympics. He was also part of the national team that won gold in 1967 ABC Championship and earned the berth for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. While donning the national team colors, he also played in the MICAA via the YCO Painters in the late 1960s, which was coached by no less than the great Caloy Loyzaga. In the early 1970s, he, along with Jun Papa, became the cornerstones of the powerhouse Crispa squad. However, in 1973, he, along with four others, were meted a lifetime ban by the MICAA due to game-fixing allegations, which was later lifted. He was the hero of the Philippine team that beat South Korea in the 1967 FIBA Asia Championship, scoring the Philippines' last four points, including two clinching free throws for an 83-80 win. Professional career Florencio played in the PBA from 1975 to 1983 with the U/Tex Wranglers, the Toyota Super Corollas, 7-Up, and the Galerie Dominique Artistas.Sports-Reference.com - Danny Florencio Though generously listed as 5'10\\", he stood 5'9\\" at the most, but he distinguished himself with daring drives to the hoop capped by never-before-seen hangtime moves and twisting undergoal stabs. He also had an accurate jumpshot from up to 18 feet. His aerial feats earned him the nicknames \\"Daredevil Danny\\" and, decades after hanging up his sneakers, the \\"Original Skywalker\\", in reference to the more popular Samboy Lim, who admitted idolizing Florencio. Florencio's eight seasons in the league were highlighted by numerous all-time records. In 1977, he averaged a 32.3 points per game in 39 games played, the highest tallied by any local player in a season. He was also the ninth player to achieve the 5,000 point-plateau, reaching the milestone on his birthday in 1981. He scored at least 50 points four times, at least 40 points six times, and at least 30 points eight times in his eight-year stint as a pro. On November 5, 1977, he became the first local player in the PBA to score more than 60 points in a game. He tallied 64 points in an import-laden conference and led all locals in scoring that year. This was later broken by Allan Caidic. At the end of his career, he ranked 11th in the all-time scoring plateau with 5,791 points, eighth in scoring average, and 13th all time in steals. Retirement and later life Florencio would later be recognized as one of the PBA's Greatest Players in 2000 and was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He moved to California after his retirement from basketball and permanently settled there. He occasionally returned to the Philippines after retiring from working several years in a hospital in San Francisco.

These eras represent the major evolutions of army division structure (there have been several minor changes during these times). The 1911–1917 era lists divisions raised during the Army's first attempts at modernizing the division, prior to the authorization of permanent divisions, and the 1917–1941 era lists the first permanent divisions, prior to advent of specialized (armored, airborne, etc.) divisions. The 1941–present era lists all of the divisions organized, raised, or authorized since then. As much as possible, divisions are only listed in the eras in which they were first created. Some divisions, such as the 1st Cavalry Division, are listed in multiple eras, as their organizations were drastically changed from one era to the next. Many divisions overlap the years listed in the era categories, mainly due to the slow pace in which they were deactivated, inactivated, or otherwise disbanded. Several divisions have existed under multiple designations, such as the 10th Mountain Division (10th Light Division (Alpine), 10th Infantry Division). Additionally, several divisions with the same numerical designations were completely separate and unrelated divisions (there have been two 5th Divisions, for instance).  History  Divisions in the United States Army have existed since the American Revolution when, on 22 July 1775, George Washington organized three divisions in Boston, Massachusetts. Early American divisions, up until the American Civil War, were primarily temporary organizations, with the basis of the United States Army being brigades and regiments. During the Civil War, the war in which formed the first large true armies in United States history, divisions were formed primarily to support Army corps, and were usually numbered as 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Division of the pertaining corps. The concept of the permanent United States Army division was formulated and put to the test following the turn of the 20th century. In 1916, the permanent division would finally be authorized by Congress, resulting in a dramatic change in the Army's force structure. For the first time, the division was the base element of the United States Army and remained as such until the Global War on Terrorism, when the Army switched its emphasis to brigade and regimental combat teams. Since the authorizations of permanent divisions, the United States Army has raised 128 separate divisions with unique lineages.  Designations  Prior to 1941, only cavalry divisions were specifically designated; infantry divisions were simply designated by \\"Division\\". Following the advent of the armored division, infantry divisions became officially designated by \\"Infantry Division\\" (with the 25th Infantry Division being the first constituted by the adjutant general as such). All of the 1917–1941 (non- cavalry) divisions, with the exceptions of the 10th through 20th and 101st Divisions, would be redesignated as Infantry Divisions at some point in the 1941–present era. Other than the aforementioned Armored, Cavalry, and Infantry, the only official Army division designations are Air Assault (one test division), Airborne, Light (three test divisions in World War II), Motorized (briefly authorized from 1942 to 1943), and Mountain. For lineage purposes, the 101st Airborne Division maintains its designation as an airborne division, though it is currently organized as an air assault division. Divisions listed with an additional identifier in parentheses (\\"alpine\\" or \\"test\\", for example) existed only with that identifier. Divisions that have held multiple additional identifiers, such as the 1st Cavalry (\\"airmobile\\", \\"heavy\\") and the 9th Infantry (\\"light\\", \\"motorized\\"), are left unidentified, regardless of their current additional identifier. An unspecified division today refers to a United States Army Reserve training division. * (*) denotes divisions that reorganized under a different division designation while still active * Bold denotes current United States Army divisions  Divisions of the United States Army (1911–17)  * Maneuver Division (1911) – see History of the United States Army ;Regular Army 1913–16 * 1st Division (Eastern Department) * 2nd Division (Central Department) * 3rd Division (Western Department) * Cavalry Division: authorized as the Regular Army division for the Southern Department in 1913; never officially numerically designated. * Punitive Expedition: (provisional division): 1916–17 ;National Guard 1914–17 * 5th Division * 6th Division * 7th Division * 8th Division * 9th Division * 10th Division * 11th Division * 12th Division * 13th Division * 14th Division * 15th Division * 16th Division =National Defense Act of 1916= The National Defense Act of 1916 provided that the \\"Army of the United States\\" would consist of the Regular Army, the Volunteer Army, the Officers' Reserve Corps, the Enlisted Reserve Corps, the National Guard in the service of the United States, and such other land forces as were or might be authorized by Congress. The president was to determine both the number and type of National Guard units that each state would maintain. Both the Regular Army and the National Guard were to be organized, insofar as practicable, into permanent brigades and divisions. * 5th Division: 1917* (26th Division) * 6th Division: 1917* (27th Division) * 7th Division: 1917* (28th Division) * 8th Division: 1917* (29th Division) * 9th Division: 1917* (30th Division) * 10th Division: 1917* (31st Division) * 11th Division: 1917* (32nd Division) * 12th Division: 1917* (33rd Division) * 13th Division: 1917* (34th Division) * 14th Division: 1917* (35th Division) * 15th Division: 1917* (36th Division) * 16th Division: 1917* (37th Division) * 17th Division: 1917* (38th Division) * 18th Division: 1917* (39th Division) * 19th Division: 1917* (40th Division) * 20th Division: 1917* (41st Division)  Divisions of the United States Army (1917 to 1941)  = Cavalry divisions = In 1940, the National Guard voluntarily withdrew their allotment of the 21st through 24th Cavalry Divisions, partially in response to the Army's decision that the National Guard did not need four Cavalry Divisions and the Army's unwillingness to allot the National Guard armored divisions. The 61st through 66th Cavalry Divisions were inactivated in 1942. * 30x30px1st Cavalry Division: 1921–present * 30x30px 2nd Cavalry Division: Unorganized.

The 76th through 91st and 94th through 104th Divisions existed primarily as officer billets with enlisted cadre; they were not completely reactivated until America's entry into World War II. The infantry brigades, field artillery brigades, and several other of the subordinate units of the Panama Canal, Hawaiian, and Philippine Divisions were numbered accordingly with what should have been the 10th, 11th, and 12th Divisions. * 1st Division (later 1st Infantry Division): 1917–present * 2nd Division (later 2nd Infantry Division): 1917–present * 3rd Division (later 3rd Infantry Division): 1917–present * 4th Division: 1917–1921;

Initially, necessary mobilization was estimated to be as high as 350 divisions, but the Army ultimately settled on a 100-division plan. This relatively low number (compared to the high estimates) was partially due to the army's policy of assigning many combat units, particularly artillery and tank destroyer units, directly to corps and higher- level commands. These non-divisional units numbered approximately 1.5 million soldiers, enough personnel to man roughly 100 more divisions. The strategic philosophy was that such units could be assigned to divisions on an as-needed basis, and would allow divisions to remain as mobile and flexible as possible. By the end of 1943, U.S. Army strength stood at more than 70 divisions. Allied gains in 1942 and 1943 resulted in a further contraction of U.S. mobilization, and the last wartime division, the 65th Infantry Division, was activated on 16 August 1943. In all, 91 divisions served in the U.S. Army in World War II. When the decision was made to halt the increase in divisions, 12 more divisions were still on the rolls, but would not be organized, though several of these would be organized following the war. They were the 15th Airborne Division, the 18th, 21st and 22nd Armored Divisions, the 19th Armored Division, which was in fact activated following the war, the 61st, 62nd, 67th, 68th, 72nd, 73rd, and 74th Infantry Divisions, and the 105th and 107th Infantry Divisions, which were intended to be Negro formations. Unique among the 14 unorganized divisions, the 15th Airborne Division was not only a victim of the decision to set the size of the Army at 89 divisions (the 2nd Cavalry Division had been deactivated during the war and the Philippine Division was destroyed as a result of the Japanese victory in the Philippines), but also because it had become evident that the Army Air Forces lacked enough transport aircraft to support a sixth airborne division. The 13th Airborne Division never saw combat for this very reason. The 105th and 107th Infantry Divisions were to join the 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions as Negro divisions. A shortage of manpower resulted in the activation of the 105th and 107th being canceled in 1942.

If it were to be developed successfully, racetrack would offer storage density higher than comparable solid-state memory devices like flash memory and similar to conventional disk drives, with higher read/write performance. Description Racetrack memory uses a spin-coherent electric current to move magnetic domains along a nanoscopic permalloy wire about 200 nm across and 100 nm thick. As current is passed through the wire, the domains pass by magnetic read/write heads positioned near the wire, which alter the domains to record patterns of bits. A racetrack memory device is made up of many such wires and read/write elements. In general operational concept, racetrack memory is similar to the earlier bubble memory of the 1960s and 1970s. Delay line memory, such as mercury delay lines of the 1940s and 1950s, are a still- earlier form of similar technology, as used in the UNIVAC and EDSAC computers. Like bubble memory, racetrack memory uses electrical currents to \\"push\\" a sequence of magnetic domains through a substrate and past read/write elements. Improvements in magnetic detection capabilities, based on the development of spintronic magnetoresistive sensors, allow the use of much smaller magnetic domains to provide far higher bit densities. In production, it was expected that the wires could be scaled down to around 50 nm. There were two arrangements considered for racetrack memory. The simplest was a series of flat wires arranged in a grid with read and write heads arranged nearby. A more widely studied arrangement used U-shaped wires arranged vertically over a grid of read/write heads on an underlying substrate. This would allow the wires to be much longer without increasing its 2D area, although the need to move individual domains further along the wires before they reach the read/write heads results in slower random access times. Both arrangements offered about the same throughput performance. The primary concern in terms of construction was practical; whether or not the three dimensional vertical arrangement would be feasible to mass-produce. Comparison to other memory devices Projections in 2008 suggested that racetrack memory would offer performance on the order of 20-32 ns to read or write a random bit. This compared to about 10,000,000 ns for a hard drive, or 20-30 ns for conventional DRAM. The primary authors discussed ways to improve the access times with the use of a \\"reservoir\\" to about 9.5 ns. Aggregate throughput, with or without the reservoir, would be on the order of 250-670 Mbit/s for racetrack memory, compared to 12800 Mbit/s for a single DDR3 DRAM, 1000 Mbit/s for high- performance hard drives, and 1000 to 4000 Mbit/s for flash memory devices. The only current technology that offered a clear latency benefit over racetrack memory was SRAM, on the order of 0.2 ns, but at a higher cost. larger feature size \\"F\\" of about 45 nm (as of 2011) with a cell area of about 140 F2. Racetrack memory is one among several emerging technologies that aim to replace conventional memories such as DRAM and Flash, and potentially offer a universal memory device applicable to a wide variety of roles. Other contenders included magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), phase-change memory (PCRAM) and ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM). Most of these technologies offer densities similar to flash memory, in most cases worse, and their primary advantage is the lack of write-endurance limits like those in flash memory. Field-MRAM offers excellent performance as high as 3 ns access time, but requires a large 25-40 F² cell size. It might see use as an SRAM replacement, but not as a mass storage device. The highest densities from any of these devices is offered by PCRAM, with a cell size of about 5.8 F², similar to flash memory, as well as fairly good performance around 50 ns. Nevertheless, none of these can come close to competing with racetrack memory in overall terms, especially density. For example, 50 ns allows about five bits to be operated in a racetrack memory device, resulting in an effective cell size of 20/5=4 F², easily exceeding the performance-density product of PCM. On the other hand, without sacrificing bit density, the same 20 F² area could fit 2.5 2-bit 8 F² alternative memory cells (such as resistive RAM (RRAM) or spin- torque transfer MRAM), each of which individually operating much faster (~10 ns). In most cases, memory devices store one bit in any given location, so they are typically compared in terms of \\"cell size\\", a cell storing one bit. Cell size itself is given in units of F², where \\"F\\" is the feature size design rule, representing usually the metal line width. Flash and racetrack both store multiple bits per cell, but the comparison can still be made. For instance, hard drives appeared to be reaching theoretical limits around 650 nm²/bit,1 Tbit/in² is approx. 650nm²/bit. defined primarily by the capability to read and write to specific areas of the magnetic surface. DRAM has a cell size of about 6 F², SRAM is much less dense at 120 F². NAND flash memory is currently the densest form of non-volatile memory in widespread use, with a cell size of about 4.5 F², but storing three bits per cell for an effective size of 1.5 F². NOR flash memory is slightly less dense, at an effective 4.75 F², accounting for 2-bit operation on a 9.5 F² cell size. In the vertical orientation (U-shaped) racetrack, nearly 10-20 bits are stored per cell, which itself would have a physical size of at least about 20 F². In addition, bits at different positions on the \\"track\\" would take different times (from ~10 to ~1000 ns, or 10 ns/bit) to be accessed by the read/write sensor, because the \\"track\\" would move the domains at a fixed rate of ~100 m/s past the read/write sensor. Development challenges One limitation of the early experimental devices was that the magnetic domains could be pushed only slowly through the wires, requiring current pulses on the orders of microseconds to move them successfully. This was unexpected, and led to performance equal roughly to that of hard drives, as much as 1000 times slower than predicted. Recent research has traced this problem to microscopic imperfections in the crystal structure of the wires which led to the domains becoming \\"stuck\\" at these imperfections. Using an X-ray microscope to directly image the boundaries between the domains, their research found that domain walls would be moved by pulses as short as a few nanoseconds when these imperfections were absent. This corresponds to a macroscopic performance of about 110 m/s. The voltage required to drive the domains along the racetrack would be proportional to the length of the wire. The current density must be sufficiently high to push the domain walls (as in electromigration). A difficulty for racetrack technology arises from the need for high current density (>108 A/cm²); a 30 nm x 100 nm cross-section would require >3 mA. The resulting power draw becomes higher than that required for other memories, e.g., spin-transfer torque memory (STT- RAM) or flash memory. Another challenge associated with Racetrack memory is the stochastic nature in which the domain walls move, i.e., they move and stop at random positions. There have been attempts to overcome this challenge by producing notches at the edges of the nanowire. Researchers have also proposed staggered nanowires to pin the domain walls precisely. Experimental investigations have shown the effectiveness of staggered domain wall memory. Recently researchers have proposed non-geometrical approaches such as local modulation of magnetic properties through composition modification. Techniques such as annealing induced diffusion and ion-implantation are used.

Each solution of the Einstein field equations encompasses the whole history of a universe – it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole spacetime: a statement encompassing the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. By this token, Einstein's theory appears to be different from most other physical theories, which specify evolution equations for physical systems; if the system is in a given state at some given moment, the laws of physics allow you to extrapolate its past or future. For Einstein's equations, there appear to be subtle differences compared with other fields: they are self-interacting (that is, non-linear even in the absence of other fields); they are diffeomorphism invariant, so to obtain a unique solution, a fixed background metric and gauge conditions need to be introduced; finally, the metric determines the spacetime structure, and thus the domain of dependence for any set of initial data, so the region on which a specific solution will be defined is not, a priori, defined.Cf. . There is, however, a way to re- formulate Einstein's equations that overcomes these problems. First of all, there are ways of rewriting spacetime as the evolution of \\"space\\" in time; an earlier version of this is due to Paul Dirac, while a simpler way is known after its inventors Richard Arnowitt, Stanley Deser and Charles Misner as ADM formalism. In these formulations, also known as \\"3+1\\" approaches, spacetime is split into a three-dimensional hypersurface with interior metric and an embedding into spacetime with exterior curvature; these two quantities are the dynamical variables in a Hamiltonian formulation tracing the hypersurface's evolution over time.; for a pedagogical introduction, see . With such a split, it is possible to state the initial value formulation of general relativity. It involves initial data which cannot be specified arbitrarily but needs to satisfy specific constraint equations, and which is defined on some suitably smooth three-manifold \\\\Sigma; just as for other differential equations, it is then possible to prove existence and uniqueness theorems, namely that there exists a unique spacetime which is a solution of Einstein equations, which is globally hyperbolic, for which \\\\Sigma is a Cauchy surface (i.e. all past events influence what happens on \\\\Sigma, and all future events are influenced by what happens on it), and has the specified internal metric and extrinsic curvature; all spacetimes that satisfy these conditions are related by isometries. and ; for a pedagogical introduction, see ; an online review can be found in . The initial value formulation with its 3+1 split is the basis of numerical relativity; attempts to simulate the evolution of relativistic spacetimes (notably merging black holes or gravitational collapse) using computers.See . However, there are significant differences to the simulation of other physical evolution equations which make numerical relativity especially challenging, notably the fact that the dynamical objects that are evolving include space and time itself (so there is no fixed background against which to evaluate, for instance, perturbations representing gravitational waves) and the occurrence of singularities (which, when they are allowed to occur within the simulated portion of spacetime, lead to arbitrarily large numbers that would have to be represented in the computer model).For a review of the basics of numerical relativity, including the problems alluded to here and further difficulties, see .

History In 1990, a group from Houston, Texas traveled to Kenya and saw the need for clean drinking water. They returned to Houston and founded a 501(c)3 non-profit. The organization equipped and trained a team of Kenyan drillers, and Living Water Kenya began operations the next year under the direction of a national board. One of the organization's co-founders, Harry Westmoreland Jr., worked in the seismic drilling industry. He first saw how important clean water was in 1989 when he visited a missionary who was having difficulty drilling a water well in Peru. In 1989 he invented a portable rig called the LS 100 that could be transported in the back of a pickup truck or in a small boat. The LS 100 can drill 100 feet through soft formations. Operations Westmoreland increased the LS 100 rig's drilling capacity in order to sink holes 200 and 300 feet through soft formations. Living Water uses larger traditional rigs to drill through rock formations. The countries Living Water operates in include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, Haiti, Mexico, Ghana, Angola, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Central African Republic.LWI provides clean cups of water, National Driller, 2002-02-01. Living Water's operations in Kenya have drilled boreholes and rehabilitated water systems.

Priming (foaming in North America) is a condition in the boiler of a steam locomotive in which water is carried over into the steam delivery. It may be caused by impurities in the water, which foams up as it boils, or simply too high a water level. It is harmful to the valves and pistons, as lubrication is washed away, and can be dangerous as any water collecting in the cylinders is not compressible and if trapped may fracture the cylinder head or piston. Causes The most frequent cause is running the locomotive with too high a level of water in the boiler and is most apparent when the regulator is opened sharply or steam demand is high. Thus, sensible locomotive management by the operators will help to prevent the occurrence. The phenomenon is particularly evident in areas of impure water, where boiled water creates a foam, or a mist of droplets, filling the space that collects steam at the top of the boiler, to be drawn down the steam collector pipe in the form of slugs of water. If boiler water is condensed and re-used, any oil or grease must be extracted as this form of contamination is particularly likely to give trouble. Remedy Early designers fitted curved sheets below the steam collector pipe, but these were not successful as the whole of the steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, blowdown valves (\\"scum valves\\"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water.

Henry came from a knightly family from Lüneburg. He took his name from Bode near Ebstorf. He married a relative of King Valdemar I of Denmark and had two brothers, Helmold and Volrad; the latter was not, as often supposed, the first Count of Dannenberg. After replacing Henry the Proud as Duke of Saxony in 1138, Albert the Bear made Henry a Graf (count) of Holstein, but Henry was soon replaced by Adolf II. Gertrude of Süpplingenburg granted Henry a claim to Wagria to the east of Holstein. In response to a raid by the Obotrite prince Pribislav, Henry led a campaign into Wagria against the Polabian Slavs. The lands around Plön, Lütjenburg, and Oldenburg were laid waste, as was the region between the Schwale, the Baltic Sea, and the Trave. The campaign failed to capture any of the strong castles, however. A campaign in 1139 killed much of the population and captured Plön. Henry feuded with Count Adolf II of Schauenburg over Holstein and Wagria. In 1143 Duke Henry the Lion mediated between the two counts, granting Wagria and Segeberg to Adolf. Henry was granted Polabia and Ratzeburg. The newly created County of Ratzenburg included Ratzeburg, Boitin, Gadebusch, Wittenburg, and Boizenburg. The count pursued a policy of expelling the native Slavs and inviting Westphalians to settle in the conquered territory. Henry received the titles Comes Polaborum (1154), Graf von Ratzeburg (1156), and Vogt von Ratzeburg (1162). He was succeeded by his son, Bernard I, Count of Ratzeburg.

Their descendants also live in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Because of the scarcity of people on the island, many of the mutineers' children and grandchildren intermarried, with some marrying first and second cousins. Occasionally a new person would arrive on the island bringing with them a new surname (like Samuel Russell Warren from the United States, whose descendants still live on the island today). The nine remaining mutineers arrived on the island on 15 January 1790 with eleven Tahitian women and six men. Each of the mutineers took one woman as a wife, with the three remaining women to be shared by the six Tahitian men, which they resented. According to author Caroline Alexander, the women were \\"passed around from one 'husband' to the other\\". Fletcher Christian, Ned Young, John Adams, John Mills, William McCoy, and Matthew Quintal had relationships with six Tahitian women. Mauatua, Toofaiti, Vahineatua, and Teio had children from two of the mutineers and one of their sons. Tevarua and Teraura had only one partner. Together they had 24 children, who in turn had 77 children. When John Williams and John Adams' wives died, they commandeered two of the Polynesian men's wives, who plotted to kill the men in retribution. Two of the plotters were killed instead. On 20 September 1793, the four remaining Polynesian men stole muskets and killed Christian, Mills, Brown, Martin, and Williams. The remaining seamen—Adams, McCoy, Quintal, and Young, with the assistance of Teraura, the wife of Ned Young—who beheaded the Polynesian Tetahiti while he slept—soon killed the Polynesian men. In 1798, McCoy built a still. He, Quintal, and some of the women were continually drunk. On 20 April 1798, McCoy attached a rock to his neck with a rope and leaped over a cliff to his death. Quintal became increasingly erratic and threatened to kill the other seamen and their wives. In 1799, Adams and Young killed him. Young died of an asthma attack in 1800. Adams lived until 1829. * Fletcher Christian (25 September 1764 – 20 September 1793) * m. Mauatua a.k.a.

He was a great- great-great-grandson of Fletcher Christian. In 1957, while working on a National Geographic-sponsored dive off Pitcairn, Christian helped salvage some of the sunken remains of the Bounty, including its old hull fittings. Tom was the son of Frederick Christian, grandson of Daniel Christian, great-grandson of Thursday Christian, and great-great-grandson of Friday Christian, who himself, was the son of Fletcher Christian. The cause of Tom's death was complications of a recent stroke, said his daughter Jacqueline Christian. * Rosalind Amelia Young (13 August 1853 – 1 February 1924), historian and greatgrandaughter of John Adams The majority of the many rulers of the Pitcairn Islands have been descendants of the Bounty mutineers, till this day. In 1935 – in the wake of their successful American blockbuster movie Mutiny on the Bounty, which premiered that year – the MGM Studios also shot a short documentary with the title \\"Pitcairn Island Today\\" (a Eugene H. Roth production, narrated by Carey Wilson).Island Today (1935), accessed on 14 December 2014Island Today (1935) – Full Cast & Crew, accessed on 14 December 2014. NB! the film poster on this page erroneously depicts that of the blockbuster movie! It tells the story of some of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers, who were natives of Pitcairn and inhabitants of the only village of the island, Adamstown. The list of descendants mentioned and presented in this MGM documentary includes: * William Christian, 60–70 years old (judging by appearance), farmer, presented as \\"Fletcher Christians great grandson\\". * Benjamin Young, 84 years old (i.e. born around 1851), blacksmith, presented as the \\"great grandson of a happy young Midshipman of the Bounty\\" (that would be Edward \\"Ned\\" Young). * Edward Christian, 55–60 years old (judging by appearance), stonecutter, presumably another descendant of Fletcher Christian. * \\"Pastor Christian\\", pastor and mayor of the island. Most likely he is to be identified as Edgar Allen Christian (at that time 52 years old, an age corresponding to his appearance in the video). Furthermore, this assumption is based on the fact that he (as seen later in the footage) appears to have signed a marriage announcement in his function of being the \\"Magistrate\\" of the island (see below). In earlier and later years, however, Edgar A. Christian's cousin Charles Richard Parkin Christian too held this double office of being both the religious leader as well as the Chief Magistrate of Pitcairn (cf. List of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands).Pitcairners – Part I: Parkin Christian, accessed on 14 December 2014 * (Aunt) Annie McCoy, 70–80 years old (judging by appearance), descendant of Able Seaman William McCoy. * Rebecca Young, 12–20 years old (judging by appearance), presumably another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young. * Allan Christian and Eva Christian, a couple (of likely young age?) whose intention of marriage is officially signed and publicly announced by \\"Edgar Christian – Magistrate\\" (during the time of shooting the documentary). * David Young, a newborn baby (who nearly died because the doctor came by ship from abroad and almost arrived too late), yet another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young. On top of those, three more people are mentioned in the MGM documentary: Andrew Warren (grandson of a whaler who came to Pitcairn around 1875, thus being no descendant of the mutineers), as well as Dora Warren and Roy Clark, whose exact direct descent from the mutineers (or lack of such) remains unclear, when judging only from the information that the documentary reveals. A 1962 documentary, Pitcairn People (directed by Peter Newington, narrated by Patrick Wymark), was produced by the British Petroleum Company. It featured many of the island residents of that time. Another documentary, Miracle on Pitcairn Island, was produced in the 1960s by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (filmed and written by Eric Were, narrated by Neal C. Wilson). It featured many of the same residents.

On 26 January 2016, the assets were acquired from administration by Russian businessmen Alexander Volov and Igor Glyanenko into a new company, Fairline Yachts Ltd. History =Newington family= The company started when Newington bought a series of gravel pits on the River Nene and built the Oundle Marina. In 1967 he launched the first Fairline boat, a handcrafted glass-reinforced plastic river cruiser. When Newington's son Sam, a former Royal Air Force pilot and Columbia University MBA graduate, took over in 1971, the company employed fourteen people. Sam expanded the company's sales network overseas to take advantage of the expanding Mediterranean market place – by 1979 the company employed 140 people and turned over £5 million, with production expanded by the success of 1977's Fairline 40 model. The company expanded in the 1980s developing lines of high speed cruising yachts. In 1986, Fairline was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise: International Trade. When Sam retired in 1996, the company expanded further by establishing Fairline Boats of North America Inc., creating a network of 35 dealers.

She was the wife of Chinese-born American cinematographer James Wong Howe. Life Babb with her husband James Wong Howe Sanora Babb was born in Otoe territory in what is now Oklahoma, though neither her mother nor father were of the Otoe group of native Americans. Her father, Walter,Biography at the Harry Ransom Center a professional gambler, moved Sanora and her sister Dorothy to a one-room dugout on a broomcorn farm settled by her grandfather near Lamar, Colorado. Her experiences were fictionalized in her novels An Owl on Every Post and The Lost Traveler. She did not start attending school until she was 11, and she graduated from high school as valedictorian. She began studying at the University of Kansas but she could not afford to continue there and after one year transferred to junior College in Garden City, Kansas. Her first work in journalism was with the Garden City Herald, and several of her articles were reprinted by the Associated Press. She moved to Los Angeles in 1929 to work for the Los Angeles Times, but due to the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 the newspaper retracted its offer. She occasionally was homeless through the Depression, sleeping in Lafayette Park. She eventually found secretarial work with Warner Brothers and wrote scripts for radio station KFWB. She joined the John Reed Club and was a member of the U.S. Communist Party for 11 years, visiting the Soviet Union in 1936, but she dropped out of the party due to the authoritarian structure and in-fighting. In 1938, she returned to California to work for the Farm Security Administration.Elaine Woo, Sanora Babb, 98; novelist's masterpiece rivaled Steinbeck's, Los Angeles Times, 21 January 2006 While with FSA, she kept detailed notes on the tent camps of the Dust Bowl migrants to California. Without her knowledge, the notes were given to John Steinbeck by her supervisor Tom Collins. She turned the stories she collected into her novel, Whose Names Are Unknown. Bennett Cerf planned to publish the novel with Random House, but the appearance of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath caused publication to be shelved in 1939.Novelist and Poet Sanora Babb, The Washington Post, 9 January 2006 Her novel was not published until 2004. Babb had a long friendship with writer William Saroyan starting in 1932 that grew into an unrequited love affair on Saroyan's part. She also had an affair with Ralph Ellison. She met her future husband, the Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong Howe before World War II. They traveled to Paris in 1937 to marry, but their marriage was not recognized in California, due to the state's anti-miscegenation law (which prohibited marriage between people of different races). Howe would not cohabit with Babb while they were legally unwed, due to his traditional Chinese views, so they maintained separate apartments in the same building. Howe's studio contract \\"morals clause\\" also prohibited him from publicly acknowledging their marriage. In 1948, plaintiffs Andrea Perez (white) and Sylvester Davis (black) brought a lawsuit (Perez v. Sharp) in state supreme court, which overturned the prohibition.32 Cal. 2d 711, 198 P. 2d 17 (Cal. 1948). It took Howe and Babb another three days to find a judge who agreed to marry them. Even then, the judge reportedly remarked \\"She looks old enough. If she wants to marry a chink, that's her business.\\" Coincidentally, in 1939 Babb had used the pseudonym Sylvester Davis, the same name as that of the husband in Perez v. Sharp. In the early 1940s Babb was West Coast secretary of the League of American Writers. She edited the literary magazine The Clipper and its successor The California Quarterly, helping to introduce the work of Ray Bradbury and B. Traven, as well as running a Chinese restaurant owned by Howe. During the early years of the HUAC hearings, Babb was blacklisted, and moved to Mexico City to protect the \\"graylisted\\" Howe from further harassment. Babb resumed publishing books in 1958 with the novel The Lost Traveler, followed in 1970 with her memoir An Owl on Every Post.

History It was established in 1903 by Hendrik Wicher Flentrop (1866 -1950) from Koog aan de Zaan. Hendrik, originally a house painter by trade, was an organist at the Westzijderkerk in Zaandam, and started a piano- and organ trade. He believed that old organs could not be adapted to contemporary tastes, but had valid sound nonetheless. In 1915, after experience had been gained with restoration and extension of organs, the first new organ was built. Beginning in 1922 he corresponded with Albert Schweitzer, which resulted in pronounced opinions concerning the demands which had to be made on the organ. Dirk Andries Flentrop (1910-2003), son of Hendrik Wicher Flentrop and Christina Anna Dekker, took control of the company in 1940. Important organs, such as that of Hans van Covelen in the large church at Alkmaar, and the Schnitger organs in the large church at Zwolle and the Laurenskerk in Alkmaar, were restored. In addition he built numerous instruments in the United States (most notably those in Adolphus Busch Hall at Harvard University, and in St. Mark's Cathedral, in Seattle, Washington), and restored two in Mexico City. J. A. Steketee (b. 1936) led the company from 1976 to 1998. Under his direction, the organ of Johannes Duyschot in the Westzijderkerk at Zaandam was restored. Tasks were also carried out in foreign countries: Taipei, Riga, Tokyo, Dunblane, Kazan, and Yerevan. Additionally, the organ of the Holy Name Cathedral was built in Chicago, and in the Netherlands the organs of the Westerkerk and the Concertgebouw, and the St. John's Cathedral, were restored. Cees van Oostenbrugge was managing director from 1998 until his death in 2008. During his tenure, a new restoration was carried out of the Hans van Covelen organ, which is the oldest playable organ of the Netherlands, originally built in 1511. Frits Elshout was managing director from 2008 through 2016, followed by Erik Winkel. All directors have also been church organists.

In June 2007, Mid Europa Partners (holding 65%) and France Telecom (35%) acquired the Austrian mobile phone network One for value of about €1.4 billion. The network was thereafter re-branded as Orange Austria. In February 2012, Orange Austria was then sold to Hutchison 3G, which merged the networks and ended use of the Orange brand. In October 2008, Mid Europa Partners increased their shareholding in T-Mobile Czech Republic and Ceske Radiokommunikace. Other major investments by Mid Europa Partners include the acquisition of UPC Slovenia, LUX Med, comprehensive outpatient medical care and diagnostic services to corporate and individual subscribers; Centrum medyczne LIM, the third largest private healthcare provider in Poland; and DISA, provider of moulding and metal surface preparation equipment. In October 2009, Mid Europa Partners bought Invitel, the Hungarian unit of TDC, Denmark's leading provider of land-line phone access. The controlling share was purchases for EUR€ 7.4 million. In addition to the 64.6% stake in Invitel Holdings AS, Mid Europa has also agreed to take on all rights and obligations of an existing € 34.1 million subordinated PIK loan, and submit a tender offer for a € 125 million loan due in 2013. In July 2018, Mid Europa Partner bought 55% shares of MediGroup, the leading private healthcare provider in Serbia with 13 facilities across key cities. The seller, Blue Sea Capital, retained a 45% stake in the company. The private healthcare system MediGroup emerged in 2013 by acquisition of the most prominent and the oldest private healthcare institutions in the country, and now it is the biggest and the only private comprehensive healthcare system regarding the number of patients, procedures and locations in the region.

He was known as Rainbow Fisher for his frequent changes of political allegiance. He was also an internationally successful tennis player.  Early life and family  Fisher was the son of George Fisher, a member of parliament and Mayor of Wellington. David Fisher was his uncle. Francis Fisher was a Captain in the 10th New Zealand Contingent to the South African Second Boer War in 1902. His eldest daughter Esther Fisher (1900–1999) became an international pianist.  Member of Parliament  Massey Government, with Fisher playing the trombone Fisher represented two Wellington electorates in the New Zealand House of Representatives for nine years from a 1905 by-election to the 1914 general election. Initially from 6 April 1905 he represented the multi-member City of Wellington electorate, but from the 1905 general election, he represented . His initial intention in early 1905 was to stand in a Christchurch electorate at the 1905 general election. In mid February 1905, he held his first meeting with electors in Christchurch. This changed, however, when his father died in mid March, and a request was put to him to stand in the City of Wellington electorate to fill the vacancy. In his speeches to Wellington electors, he stressed the need for the Liberal Party, of which he was a member, to reform itself from within. The by-election was contested by Fisher, Charles Hayward Izard and John Hutcheson, with Fisher being successful. After his election, he helped form the New Liberal Party. The party was formed at a meeting in the Christchurch suburb of Papanui in June 1905. The New Liberals suffered considerable damage from the so-called \\"voucher incident\\", in which Fisher alleged that Richard Seddon's son had been received payment from a government department for work he had not done. The allegations were disproven, and the New Liberals suffered considerable public backlash. Fisher had not consulted his colleagues before making the accusation, and it also strained relations between party members. Fisher was the only New Liberal MP (out of three) re- elected in 1905. The New Liberal Party was defunct by 1908. In the 1908 general election he stood as an Independent. By 1910, he had joined the Reform Party. The 1911 general election required a second ballot if no candidate could achieve an absolute majority in the first round. The election was contested by Fisher, Robert Fletcher (Liberal Party), W. S. Young (Labour Party) and F. Freeman (Socialist Party), with Fisher having a majority of one vote over Fletcher. In the second ballot a week later, Fisher beat Fletcher with a majority of 150 votes. By the next general election in 1914, the incumbent Fisher as a government minister contested Wellington Central against Fletcher again, and he was decisively beaten by 2677 votes to 4910. This spelled an end to Fisher's political career in New Zealand. After the war, in 1919, he stood as the Conservative candidate in the Widnes by-election in Cheshire, England, where he was defeated by Labour's Arthur Henderson. He was known as Rainbow Fisher because of his frequent changes of political colour.Bollinger, Conrad Grog's Own Country: The Story of Liquor Licensing in New Zealand (2nd revised edition Minerva Auckland, 1967, page 77; 1st edition Price Milburn Wellington, 1959) Fisher was Minister of Customs and Minister of Marine from 10 July 1912 to 7 January 1915 in the Reform Government.  Tennis  A top New Zealand tennis player, both at home and abroad, Fisher reached the final of the Australasian Open in 1906 but was defeated by Tony Wilding – Fisher was one of only four New Zealanders to play in the final of a 'Grand Slam' event. He won the New Zealand Men's Championship Doubles in 1901–02, 1902–03, 1909–10 and 1910–11, and the Mixed Doubles Championships in 1899–1900, 1900–01, 1901–02 and 1911–12.

He made 354 appearances in the Football League for Rochdale, Crewe Alexandra, Plymouth Argyle, Stockport County, Blackburn Rovers and Chesterfield, and scored 172 goals. Life and career Lord was born in Chadderton, near Oldham, Lancashire. He began his career with Rochdale, where he scored 54 goals in 122 league games during eight seasons with the club. His goal-ratio improved with Crewe Alexandra, who he joined in 1961. Lord spent a little over two seasons with Crewe and scored 68 league goals in 108 appearances. He scored four hat-tricks in 1961–62 and eight in total to set a new club record. He signed with Plymouth Argyle in November 1963 and was the club's leading goalscorer in his first season. Lord was also joint-leading scorer in 1964–65 with Mike Trebilcock. In February 1966, he moved to Stockport County after scoring 23 times in 69 league games for Argyle and six more in seven cup ties. His form at Stockport, 18 goals in 27 league appearances, prompted a move to Blackburn Rovers later that year. He scored once in 10 league games for Blackburn before joining Chesterfield in 1967. He returned to Plymouth Argyle in October 1967 to work as a player-coach under the management of Billy Bingham, having scored six times in 12 league games for Chesterfield. While his main role was coaching, Lord did play occasionally when others were injured. He scored two more goals in nine league and cup games in 1968–69 before retiring from playing. Lord went on to coach at Crystal Palace and Preston North End, where he also served as caretaker manager in 1973. He managed Cape Town City in South Africa for several years, where he won the Manager of the Year award in 1977, before becoming Hereford United manager in December 1979; a position he held until September 1982. Lord was the head coach of the Malaysia national team from 1983 to 1985, and applied unsuccessfully for the vacant manager's position at Plymouth Argyle. In 1994, he became assistant manager at Lincoln City and then joined Wigan Athletic as a football co-ordinator. Lord was briefly caretaker manager at Wigan in 1995. He returned to South Africa and settled in Cape Town, where he later worked as a scout for Manchester United. Lord died of a heart attack at his home in June 2005.

Ed.; \\"Modern Practice of Gas Chromatography\\", John Wiley & Sons, C1977, pg. 228, This detector senses changes in the thermal conductivity of the column effluent and compares it to a reference flow of carrier gas. Since most compounds have a thermal conductivity much less than that of the common carrier gases of helium or hydrogen, when an analyte elutes from the column the effluent thermal conductivity is reduced, and a detectable signal is produced. Operation The TCD consists of an electrically heated filament in a temperature-controlled cell. Under normal conditions there is a stable heat flow from the filament to the detector body. When an analyte elutes and the thermal conductivity of the column effluent is reduced, the filament heats up and changes resistance. This resistance change is often sensed by a Wheatstone bridge circuit which produces a measurable voltage change. The column effluent flows over one of the resistors while the reference flow is over a second resistor in the four-resistor circuit. TCD schematic A schematic of a classic thermal conductivity detector design utilizing a Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown. The reference flow across resistor 4 of the circuit compensates for drift due to flow or temperature fluctuations. Changes in the thermal conductivity of the column effluent flow across resistor 3 will result in a temperature change of the resistor and therefore a resistance change which can be measured as a signal. Since all compounds, organic and inorganic, have a thermal conductivity different from helium or hydrogen, virtually all compounds can be detected. That's why the TCD is often called a universal detector. Used after a separation column (in a chromatograph), a TCD measures the concentrations of each compound contained in the sample. Indeed, the TCD signal changes when a compound passes through it, shaping a peak on a baseline. The peak position on the baseline reflects the compound type. The peak area (computed by integrating the TCD signal over time) is representative of the coumpound concentration. A sample whose compounds concentrations are known is used to calibrate the TCD: concentrations are affected to peak areas through a calibration curve. The TCD is a good general purpose detector for initial investigations with an unknown sample compared to the FID that will react only to combustible compounds (Ex: hydrocarbons). Moreover, the TCD is a non-specific and non-destructive technique. The TCD is also used in the analysis of permanent gases (argon, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide) because it responds to all these substances unlike the FID which cannot detect compounds which do not contain carbon- hydrogen bonds. Considering detection limit, both TCD and FID reach low concentration levels (inferior to ppm or ppb). Both of them require pressurized carrier gas (Typically: H2 for FID, He for TCD) but due to the risk associated with storing H2 (high flammability, see Hydrogen safety), TCD with He should be considered in locations where safety is crucial. =Considerations= One thing to be aware of when operating a TCD is that gas flow must never be interrupted when the filament is hot, as doing so may cause the filament to burn out. While the filament of a TCD is generally chemically passivated to prevent it from reacting with oxygen, the passivation layer can be attacked by halogenated compounds, so these should be avoided wherever possible. http://ipes.us/used/58904.pdf If analyzing for hydrogen, the peak will appear as negative when helium is used as the reference gas. This problem can be avoided if another reference gas is used, for example argon or nitrogen, although this will significantly reduce the detector's sensitivity towards any compounds other than hydrogen. Process description It functions by having two parallel tubes both containing gas and heating coils. The gases are examined by comparing the rate of loss of heat from the heating coils into the gas. The coils are arranged in a bridge circuit so that resistance changes due to unequal cooling can be measured. One channel normally holds a reference gas and the mixture to be tested is passed through the other channel. Applications Katharometers are used medically in lung function testing equipment and in gas chromatography. The results are slower to obtain compared to a mass spectrometer, but the device is inexpensive, and has good accuracy when the gases in question are known, and it is only the proportion that must be determined.

The Hummelstown Brownstone Company quarried high quality brownstone near Hummelstown from 1863 to 1929 and sold it across the U.S. as a preferred masonry material of builders. Because of its durability, it was used for a wide range of building projects, especially as trim and ornamentation on large buildings, but also as bridge piers and in the foundations and walls of buildings or the sculptures that decorated them. Frequently, entire buildings were dressed in Hummelstown brownstone. An outstanding example of this is the Barbour County Courthouse (1903–05) in Philippi, West Virginia. Hummelstown brownstone and similar sandstones were known as “freestone” because of properties allowing them to be worked freely in every direction, rather than in one direction along a “grain”.

It is located at the head of Reykjarfjörður on the Strandir coast in the Westfjords region (Vestfirðir), in the municipality of Árneshreppur.\\"ÁRNESHREPPUR\\", Iceland Review. Accessed June 14, 2016. It is approximately 70 km away from Hólmavík (the nearest settlement of any account), 280 km from Ísafjörður and 340 km from the country's capital Reykjavík. At present it only consists of seven houses, a hotel and the ruins of a herring factory. It can be reached by car via road 643 or by plane via the nearby Gjögur Airport. History of settlement =Before 1917= Prior to 1917, the area around Djúpavík hosted farmsteads for hundreds of years. Around 1916 only one family lived there.Granholm, p. 59 =1917-1934= The village of Djúpavík was first settled in 1917 when Elías Stefánsson built a herring salting factory there. Guðjón Jónsson moved to Djúpavík in 1917 with his wife Krístín Guðmundsdóttir and three children to serve as the factory's supervisor. They were the village's first residents.Matthíasson, p. 25-27 That year brought many challenges to the herring industry in Iceland. There were shortages of fuel oil and salt, and the import price of coal and other supplies rose sharply. Both cod and herring catches were small. In the following year, the Armistice of 11 November 1918 led to reduced demand for exports from Iceland.Chamberlin p. 65-66 The enterprise went bankrupt in 1919.Matthíasson, p. 31 Although the business was briefly taken over by others, the site was abandoned during the 1920s. Guðjón stayed on at the factory until 1921.Matthíasson, p. 27 =1934-1983= In 1934, a decline in demand for salted fish led to new investments in factories that could produce valuable herring oil.Chamberlin p. 75 This year saw the resettlement of Djúpavík. The decision to establish Djúpavík Ltd. was made at Hótel Borg in Reykjavík on September 22, 1934. Because financing was difficult to obtain in Iceland, Djúpavík Ltd. sent representatives to Sweden to negotiate a loan to build a new herring factory. Solberg Bank in Stockholm loaned the company 400,000 Swedish krona.Matthíasson, p. 37-38 Guðmundur Guðjónsson, an engineer, designed the factory and oversaw its construction.Matthíasson, p. 70 The new factory was built, and at 90 meters (300 ft) in length it was the largest concrete building in Iceland and one of the largest in Europe. There were no roads to Djúpavík so all supplies arrived by ship. Despite the harsh conditions, the construction was completed within the span of just one year and the factory was operational by July 1935.Jónsson & Holloway, p. 4 It was one of 12 new herring oil and meal factories in Iceland.Chamberlin p. 28 However, the Djúpavík factory was unique. It was the first fully automated fish factory in Europe, with conveyor belts running from dock to basement storage rooms, then to coal-fired steam cookers, oil-extraction presses, coal-fired dryers, and meal grinders. Powerful electric fans then blew the hot fish meal through ducts that passed outside the factory for cooling and finally to chutes in the upper level where 100 kg (220 lb) meal bags were filled for transport. Electricity was generated by four German-built diesel engines salvaged from submarines and an Icelandic guard ship. The 60-tonne boiler used to generate steam for cooking was also salvaged from a ship.Pétursson 2017 Initial worries that the catches would not meet requirements proved unfounded and during its early years the enterprise boomed, bringing improved financial status and living standards to the whole region.Jónsson & Holloway, p. 17 Guðmundur Guðjónsson was the factory director from 1936 and until the factory ceased operations in 1954. His wife was Ragnheiður Jörensdóttir Hansen. Their adopted daughter María Guðmundsdóttir (filmmaker) became Miss Iceland.Matthíasson, p. 28 Herring catches started to decline after 1944, with a sharp drop in 1948 (when there were almost no catches for two years) and, despite attempts to keep the enterprise running by processing other fish besides herring, the factory closed in 1954 while Djúpavík Ltd. was officially dissolved in 1968. Jónsson & Holloway, p. 17 Some residents remained until about 1980.Granholm, p. 100-101 =1984-present= Djúpavík village sign, wreck of the Suðurland freight ship In 1984 Ásbjörn Þorgilsson, the grandson of a former Djúpavík resident, and his wife Eva Sigurbjörnsdóttir bought the herring factory, intending to repair it and start a fish breeding program. They chose instead to renovate the women's dormitory for use as a hotel to support increasing tourism in the area. Over the years, business increased, with significant growth after 2010. Ásbjörn and Eva have taken care to preserve the cultural heritage of the site and the environment. As of 2016, Hotel Djúpavík was \\"the only eco-friendly tourism service in Strandir....\\"Guðmundsdóttir 2016 During this time, they also made repairs to prevent further deterioration of the factory and other buildings.Jónsson & Holloway, p. 18 Hotel business is confined mostly to the Summer months. The nearest major route (road 61) is located 60 km (37 mi) to the south, and the nearest airport is at Gjögur, 14 km (9 mi) to the north. Road 643 is the only connection between Djúpavík and these locations. This road is classified as a secondary road and is in snow clearance group G. Snow on group G roads is not cleared during the Winter months causing Djúpavík to be cut off from road transportation.Granholm, p. 59-60 However, in recent years the hotel has hosted snowmobile adventurers who follow snowmobile guides from Hólmavík to Djúpavík.Pétursson 2017 Life in Djúpavík =1935-1954= Djúpavík was unlike other villages in the region. The streets were not named. There were no police, churches, liquor stores or bars. There were, however, a shop and bakery owned by Djúpavík Ltd.Jónsson & Holloway p. 14 The population of Djúpavík was approximately 260 during much of this period.Granholm, p. 59 While most of the population was seasonal, the manager and his family lived there year-round.Pétursson 2017 Men and women sought work at the factory during the Summer fishing season. Men worked inside the factory loading coal into ovens, operating machinery, and loading meal bags onto transport vehiclesPétursson 2017. Women worked long hours outdoors near the dock, often in adverse weather conditions. They removed the heads and bones, packed the herring in salt, and placed them in large wooden barrels.Jónsson & Holloway p. 10 While men were paid for the time they worked, women were paid for each barrel they filled. Although they earned significantly less than the men in the factory, many women sought this work because they earned more than they could doing clerical and domestic work in Reykjavik.Jóhannesson, p. 92 One of Elías Stefánsson's timber houses was refurbished and served as a women's dormitory.Jónsson & Holloway p. 14 Men slept in the former freight and passenger ship Suðurland (ship) - known as M. Davidsen (ship) prior to 1919 - which was purchased by Djúpavík Ltd. in 1935 and docked next to the factory for that purpose.Ragnarsson 2017 The upper cabins were comfortable. However, the lower cabins had no portholes and poor ventilation.Jónsson & Holloway p. 7 Other men slept in the upper floor of the canteen.Jónsson & Holloway p. 14 Married couples who wanted to be together were required to sleep in tents away from the other living quarters. Men were served meals in a cafeteria located behind the factory. Women prepared their own meals in the dormitory kitchen. For entertainment, dances were held on the first floor of the women's dormitory. There was no access from the dance hall to the dormitory kitchen or the stairs leading to the second floor. To avoid unwanted pregnancies, much care was taken to keep men away from the women's quarters.Pétursson 2017 =1985 to present= When Ásbjörn, Eva and their three children moved to Djúpavík in 1985, they were its only residents. Finances were difficult while renovating the hotel and during the early years of operation. To repair the factory, they bought supplies as they could afford them and did much of the work themselves.Pétursson 2017 The two younger children attended school in Trékyllisvík, about 20 km (12 mi) by road to the north. When snow made the road impassible, Ásbjörn transported his children to and from Gjögur in a small boat. Windy conditions sometimes made docking impossible, causing the children to either stay home from school or remain at school for weeks.Granholm, p. 83 After a particularly harrowing incident when his daughter nearly fell from the jetty at Gjögur, Ásbjörn bought a snowmobile for Winter transportation to and from school.Pétursson 2017 From 10th grade until graduation the children attended school in Hólmavík and stayed there during the winter.Granholm, p. 83 As of 2010 Djúpavík had two year-round residents and three Summer residentsGranholm, p. 59 Restoration of buildings In 1984, there was significant damage and decay in the factory due to decades of neglect and vandalism. The original intent was to repair the factory and establish a fish farm. After considering the economics of fish farming and the increase in tourism, Ásbjörn and Eva decided to preserve the factory as a museum. One of the first tasks was to replace the windows. Over many years masonry has been patched and roofs repaired.Árnadóttir, p. 10 As of November 2017 roof repairs continue. The work is done primarily by family members and a few hired workers.Pétursson 2017 The core of the factory contains the original machinery as it was found in 1984 and educational displays which preserve the history of Djúpavík. The large storage areas of the factory are used for art exhibitions, concerts, and special events such as weddings.

It functions as an accounting information system. It may be developed in-house by the organization using it, may be purchased from a third party, or may be a combination of a third-party application software package with local modifications. Accounting software may be on-line based, accessed anywhere at any time with any device which is Internet enabled, or may be desktop based. It varies greatly in its complexity and cost. The market has been undergoing considerable consolidation since the mid-1990s, with many suppliers ceasing to trade or being bought by larger groups.  Modules  Accounting software is typically composed of various modules, different sections dealing with particular areas of accounting. Among the most common are: ;Core modules *Accounts receivable--where the company enters money received *Accounts payable--where the company enters its bills and pays money it owes *General ledger--the company's \\"books\\" *Billing--where the company produces invoices to clients/customers *Stock/inventory--where the company keeps control of its inventory *Purchase order--where the company orders inventory *Sales order-- where the company records customer orders for the supply of inventory *Bookkeeping--where the company records collection and payment *Financial close management — where accounting teams verify and adjust account balances at the end of a designated time period ;Non-core modules *Debt collection-- where the company tracks attempts to collect overdue bills (sometimes part of accounts receivable) *Electronic payment processing *Expense--where employee business-related expenses are entered *Inquiries--where the company looks up information on screen without any edits or additions *Payroll--where the company tracks salary, wages, and related taxes *Reports--where the company prints out data *Timesheet--where professionals (such as attorneys and consultants) record time worked so that it can be billed to clients * Purchase requisition--where requests for purchase orders are made, approved and tracked *Reconciliation--compares records from parties at both sides of transactions for consistency *Drill down *Journals *Departmental accounting *Support for value added taxation *Calculation of statutory holdback *Late payment reminders *Bank feed integration *Document attachment system *Document/Journal approval system Note that vendors may use differing names for these modules.  Implementation  In many cases, implementation (i.e. the installation and configuration of the system at the client) can be a bigger consideration than the actual software chosen when it comes down to the total cost of ownership for the business. Most midmarket and larger applications are sold exclusively through resellers, developers and consultants. Those organizations generally pass on a license fee to the software vendor and then charge the client for installation, customization and support services. Clients can normally count on paying roughly 50-200% of the price of the software in implementation and consulting fees. Other organizations sell to, consult with and support clients directly, eliminating the reseller. Accounting software provides many benefits such as speed up the information retrieval process, bring efficiency in Bank reconciliation process, automatically prepare Value Added TAX (VAT) / Goods and Services TAX (GST), and, perhaps most importantly, provide the opportunity to see the real-time state of the company’s financial position.  Types  = Personal accounting = Personal accounting software is mainly targeted towards home users, supporting accounts payable-type accounting transactions, managing budgets, and simple account reconciliation, at the inexpensive end of the market. = Low-end market = At the low-end of the business markets, inexpensive applications software allows most general business accounting functions to be performed. Suppliers frequently serve a single national market, while larger suppliers offer separate solutions in each national market. Many of the low end products are characterized by being \\"single-entry\\" products, as opposed to double-entry systems seen in many businesses. Some products have considerable functionality but are not considered GAAP or IFRS/FASB compliant. Some low-end systems do not have adequate security nor audit trails. = Mid-market = The mid-market covers a wide range of business software that may be capable of serving the needs of multiple national accountancy standards and allow accounting in multiple currencies. In addition to general accounting functions, the software may include integrated or add-on management information systems, and may be oriented towards one or more markets, for example with integrated or add-on project accounting modules. Software applications in this market typically include the following features: * Industry-standard robust databases * Industry-standard reporting tools * Tools for configuring or extending the application (e.g. an SDK), access to program code. = High-end market = The most complex and expensive business accounting software is frequently part of an extensive suite of software often known as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. These applications typically have a very long implementation period, often greater than six months. In many cases, these applications are simply a set of functions which require significant integration, configuration and customization to even begin to resemble an accounting system. Many freeware high-end open-source accounting software are available online these days which aim to change the market dynamics. Most of these software solutions are web- based. The advantage of a high-end solution is that these systems are designed to support individual company specific processes, as they are highly customizable and can be tailored to exact business requirements. This usually comes at a significant cost in terms of money and implementation time. = Hybrid solutions = As technology improves, software vendors have been able to offer increasingly advanced software at lower prices. This software is suitable for companies at multiple stages of growth. Many of the features of mid-market and high-end software (including advanced customization and extremely scalable databases) are required even by small businesses as they open multiple locations or grow in size. Additionally, with more and more companies expanding overseas or allowing workers to home office, many smaller clients have a need to connect multiple locations. Their options are to employ software-as-a-service or another application that offers them similar accessibility from multiple locations over the internet. = SaaS accounting software = With the advent of faster computers and internet connections, accounting software companies have been able to create accounting software paid for on a monthly recurring charge instead of a larger upfront license fee (software as a service - SaaS). The rate of adoption of this new business model has increased steadily to the point where legacy players have been forced to come out with their own online versions.

Massello, USNR, Officer in Charge.  World War II service  Following a training period at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, Trident reported to Section Base Boston, for duty with the 1st Naval District. During the first week in March 1942, the wooden-hulled coastal minesweeper plied the waters of Boston harbor and its approaches, performing tasks which would soon become familiar. At night, she functioned as a guard and escort vessel; then, as sunrise came, she began daily exploratory sweeps, searching for moored, magnetic, and sonic mines in the harbor and its approaches. At times, severe weather or low visibility forced Trident to secure from sweep operations; and, in foggy weather, she helped to regulate harbor traffic. Continuing instruction, drills, and periods of repair broke the minesweeper's routine. After Trident was assigned to the harbor entrance control post, she had occasion to locate and investigate suspicious small craft—a welcome diversion from the usual inner harbor activities. In June 1942, the 1st Naval District command was incorporated into the Northern Group of the Eastern Sea Frontier, and Trident continued her duties in coastal waters for over three years until 8 August 1945, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, and reported to the Commandant, 6th Naval District, for disposition. She was placed out of service on 16 November 1945 and her name was struck from the Navy list on the 28th. On 22 October 1946, Trident was transferred to the Maritime Commission; and she was subsequently sold to Benjamin Feldman of New York City.

It is a dead mall with a 74% and rising vacancy rate with only one anchor store, Burlington. It has three vacant anchors left by Belk, J.C. Penney and Macy's. Sears once occupied the space currently taken by Burlington. The lower level is still empty. History =1975 - mid-1990s= The mall opened in 1975 as a 1.08 million square foot shopping mall anchored by Davison's, Belk, JCPenney, and Sears. A Woolworth was added later which went bankrupt. The opening of Macon Mall led to the demise of Georgia's first enclosed mall, Westgate Mall down the street. At opening date the mall was filled with hundreds of light bulbs in a disco-style theme. This appearance quickly became dated and expensive to maintain, leading to the mall's first renovation in 1983. The food court was added in 1986 and Davison's changed over to Macy's, when Macy's decided to rename all of their stores at the time under the same name. =1997 renovation and expansion= For 14 years Macon Mall was one of the largest malls in the state of Georgia encompassing . The mall underwent a huge renovation and expansion in 1997 that nearly doubled the size of the mall and added Dillard's and Parisian as anchors. This made the mall more upscale and added 40+ new stores. This expansion made Macon mall the largest mall in the state of Georgia for two years until Mall of Georgia opened in 1999 in Gwinnett County. Two parking garages were constructed on the new wing to handle the increase in business and decrease in parking. An extra level was also added to the food court that brought in Atlanta Bread Company, Sbarro, and Time Out Arcade. Macy's changed over to Rich's in 1998. In the years following the expansion, Macon Mall ran a monopoly on regional retail. A new power center named Eisenhower Crossing opened down the street in 2001 and took Old Navy from the mall. Federated integrated Macy's into Rich's as Rich's-Macy's in 2003, and in 2005 announced they were eliminating all of their regional names in favor of Macy's in 2005. This resulted in Rich's at Macon Mall changing back to Macy's. Belk also dropped the \\"Matthews\\" name from their store and Steve & Barry's opened a large store on the upper level of the Sears wing in 2005. =Late 2000s decline= Parisian was bought by Belk in 2006 and was closed in 2007. The mall entered foreclosure in 2008, and put under the operation of Jones Lang LaSalle. In 2008, The Shoppes at River Crossing, a new lifestyle center, opened in North Bibb County and took Dillard's from Macon Mall. Dillard's stated they could better serve the market with one store, but their departure was speculated to be because of the mall's debt issues. With Dillard's gone, this leaves the two anchor stores added to the mall in 1997 vacant, and the mall performance began to deteriorate rapidly. This in turn created a ripple effect and many tenants began leave the mall in 2009, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Ann Taylor Loft, Eddie Bauer, Hollister Co., The Gap, Charlotte Russe, GameStop, New York & Company, f.y.e., The Limited, Lane Bryant, Wolf Camera, Wet Seal, LensCrafters, Starbucks, and Ruby Tuesday. Some of these stores moved to The Shoppes at River Crossing, many left the Macon area entirely, and some closed due to corporate bankruptcies: Steve & Barry's, B. Dalton, Linens N Things, and KB Toys. The Movie Tavern that was supposed to open in 2009, in the former Parisian building, never did due to the mall's financial issues. The upper level of the food court has been abandoned. This exodus of retailers is a direct result of Dillard's vacancy, new competition, poor location, and the weakened economy. In 2009, Macon Mall introduced Art Space. This is the second art space concept in a mall in the U.S. The first is Crestwood Court outside of St. Louis. =2011 renovation and demolition= The mall continued to leak in-line tenants in 2010 including Express, Yankee Candle, Hot Topic, Chick-Fil-A, and Subway. In September 2010, the mall was acquired by Hull Storey Gibson of Augusta, Georgia. They planned to demolish the east wing of the mall beginning with the vacant Parisian building. The original and remaining portion of the mall, was renovated. The art space tenants in the 1997 addition were asked to vacate, while the remaining tenants were asked to move to the west wing. While many did (Rue 21, Finish Line, Spencer's) just to name a few, there were some who left the mall including American Eagle Outfitters, Victoria's Secret, and Sunglass Hut. Demolition began on August 15, 2011. Once demolition was complete, North Point Mall in Alpharetta outside Atlanta reliquinshed Macon Mall as 4th largest mall in Georgia. Macon Mall also signed off with a new restaurant called Smok’n Pig which is the largest tenant to sign with the mall. This restaurant is and takes up at least 7 stores including the former Baskin-Robbins which is located on the Sears wing of the mall which has the most vacancies. The Renovation was revealed on November 18 and 19 in a two-day celebration. Notable changes included the whole mall being carpeted, new skylights and ceilings, new restrooms, removal of the carousel, and the moving of staircases. They did not demolish the former Dillard's building. Demolition was completed by the end of 2011.New Macon Mall owner plans remodel, demolition On December 29, 2011, Sears announced that they would close the store at the Macon Mall due to a decline in sales at both Kmart and Sears stores nationwide. Sears' last day was Sunday, April 29, 2012. Belk closed its doors on Saturday, September 15, 2012. For the next two years, vacancies steadily increased with stores like The Children's Place, RadioShack, Kirkland's, Ashley Stewart, Aéropostale, and Justice (formerly Limited Too) leaving the mall. Despite these closures, two stores opened in 2012: B. Turner's and Dry Falls Outfitters. Macy's interior entrance of the Macon Mall in Macon GA =Continued decline= Burlington Coat Factory confirmed that it would move into the upper level of the former Sears in 2015. In October 2015, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the top level of the former Sears as Burlington. On Friday, March 17, 2017, JCPenney announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 138 stores nationwide. The store closed on Monday, July 31, 2017. Meanwhile, as of 2018 vacancies continue to increase with stores like Marks & Morgan Jewelers and Men's Wearhouse & Tux, closing as well as the food court steadily emptying out. On January 6, 2020, it was announced that Macy's would be closing in March 2020 as part of a plan to close 125 stores nationwide which would leave Burlington as the only anchor store left.

The sophisticated Buchanan had no problem portraying Bramleigh but was unable to capture the essence of Schmidt. The show opened in Philadelphia to critical pans. Rather than proceed to Broadway, the creative team added characters and expanded the role of police commissioner Bauer, played by radio's \\"Baron Munchausen\\", Jack Pearl.

The Obotrites were attacked by Saxons and Danes in 1160, resulting in the death of the Obotrite prince, Niklot, and the partition of the Obotrite lands. Niklot's son Pribislav rose in revolt in 1163, capturing the castles of Malchow and Quetzin. The army of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony was concentrated at Verchen near Demmin and consisted of troops from Saxony, Holstein, Dithmarschen, and Frisia. The Christian army was also assisted by a fleet from King Valdemar the Great of Denmark. They were opposed by a force of Slavs led by Pribislav and the Pomeranian dukes Bogislaw I and Casimir I. The outcome of the resulting bloody battle with the Slavs was in doubt, although the Christian lords were eventually victorious. Slavic casualties amounted to 2,500, while the Saxon Count of Holstein, Adolf II, fell in battle. The land of the Obotrites was ravaged by the campaign and many inhabitants, including Pribislav, fled to Pomerania.

Life Pribislav was the son of Budivoj, and nephew of Henry. After the murder of Canute Lavard in 1131, the Obotrite lands were partitioned between Pribislav and Niklot, with the former receiving Wagria and Polabia and the latter Mecklenburg until the Peene River; Pribislav received the title regulus, or lesser king and resided in Liubice. A follower of Slavic paganism, Pribislav was described by Emperor Lothair III, whom he was dependent upon, as an enemy of Christianity and an idolater. After the death of Lothair in 1137, Lothair's son-in-law Henry the Proud and Margrave Albert the Bear fought over the Duchy of Saxony. Pribislav took advantage of the struggle to rebel against the authority of the Holy Roman Empire by destroying the new castle of Segeberg and invading Holstein in Summer 1138. Saxons from Holstein and Stormarn under the command of Henry of Badewide led a massive counterattack the following winter. Another Holsatian campaign in Summer 1139 devastated the Slavic inhabitants of Wagria and placed the territory under German control. The Slavs under Pribislav's rule were reduced to living in the northeastern corner of Wagria. The prince complained to the Bishop of Oldenburg that the taxation and oppression of the Saxon lords were essentially driving the Wagrians to the Baltic Sea. The Slavs retained their old religious practices, such as worship of the god Porewit, near Oldenburg. On Tuesdays Pribislav held court with pagan priests and representatives of the Slavic population.

The territory of the Obotrites was largely partitioned between Saxon lords, but Pribislav continued to fight against Henry from the fortification at Werle on the River Warnow near Rostock,Tschan, (HCS LXXXVIII), p. 232 the only territory remaining to Pribislav and his brother Wertislav.

Wertislav was publicly hanged at Malchow. Supported by a Danish fleet, the Saxon army defeated the Slavs in the bloody Battle of Verchen in 1164. Pribislav fled to Pomerania afterward, but later led raids into the counties of Schwerin and Ratzeburg. The Cistercian missionary Berno of Amelungsborn convinced Pribislav to side with the Christians against the pagan Slavs. In conflict with the Saxon nobility and seeking an ally, Henry restored Pribislav to power in 1167 as the Prince of Mecklenburg, Kessin, and Rostock; the County of Schwerin remained in Frankish Saxon control. Pribislav's restoration to power established an originally Slavic dynasty in Mecklenburg that lasted until 1918. In comparison, the lands of the Polabians and Wagrians to the west had been taken over by Saxon lords.

The trumpeter whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the eastern seaboard from southern New South Wales to northern Queensland. The species is found in bays, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks on silty and muddy substrates in waters ranging from 0 to 30 m deep, occasionally inhabiting sandy and seagrass beds. The trumpeter whiting is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs, with a dietary shift occurring as they mature and move into deeper waters. The species spawns during summer, with young fish often penetrating into estuaries and seagrass beds. The species is highly sought after by both recreational and commercial fishermen, with the fish highly regarded as a table food. The trumpeter whiting has two close relatives, the oriental trumpeter whiting and the western trumpeter whiting, which can be easily confused with S. maculata. Taxonomy and naming The trumpeter whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three genera in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was first described by Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824 from specimens collected from the waters of Sydney Harbour in New South Wales, Australia. A specimen from this location was also designated to be the holotype. The species was subsequently redescribed under the name of Sillago gracilis by Alleyne and Macleay in 1877, which is a junior synonym and has been discarded under the ICZN rules. Roland McKay, whilst working on a revision of the sillaginids, found there to be three closely related species of 'trumpeter whiting'; the western trumpeter whiting, the oriental trumpeter whiting and the trumpeter whiting which he interpreted to be subspecies. He therefore assigned the trumpeter whiting the name Sillago maculata maculata to clarify its subspecies status, doing similar for the other two species. However, soon after publishing, more specimens came to light which validated giving the three subspecies full species status, and the trumpeter whiting once again returned to the binomial Sillago maculata. The common name of the species, trumpeter whiting, refers to the grunting sound the fish makes when first taken from the water, with a number of other species of unrelated fish also known to do this. The names 'winter' and 'diver' whiting are in reference to the high catches made in winter by amateur fishermen and the depth at which larger individuals of the species inhabit respectively. Description 240 pxAs with most of the genus Sillago, the trumpeter whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales, including the two rows of cheek scales. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 19 to 20 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 19 to 21 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 71 to 75 lateral line scales and a total of 34 to 36 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of 30 cm and a maximum recorded weight of 216 grams. The swimbladder has a short anterior median extension and two anterolateral extensions present, with a complex network of tubular canals that rejoin the swimbladder at four locations anteriorally. Lateral extensions reach to the duct like process present on the ventral surface of the swimbladder. The body is a sandy brown to olive green colour above, while the sides and lower body are a silvery brown to cream-white hue. The head is dark olive brown to greenish above, while the cheeks and opercles are golden-green, with a dark blotch on the opercle of some individuals. The trumpeter whiting is usually easy to distinguish by its characteristic dark brown irregular blotches present on the side of the fish, as well as a golden silver longitudinal band. The spinous dorsal fin is whitish, with a mottled olive green and brown texture. The soft dorsal fin has about five rows of brownish green spots. The anal and ventral fins are golden to yellow with cream margins, while the pectoral fins are yellow to pale yellow-green, with a distinct black-blue spot at the base. The caudal fin is olive brown to a darkish green-brown with darker margins. Distribution and habitat The trumpeter whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the eastern seaboard from Narooma in New South Wales up to Lizard Island in Queensland. Fossil otoliths found in New Zealand indicate the trumpeter whiting or one of its closely related species was present in New Zealand until sometime in the late Pleistocene. The species prefers silty and muddy substrates in the deeper water of bays, but also inhabits deep sandy areas, with a study by Burchmore et al. suggesting a seasonal move between these two substrates in Botany Bay, New South Wales. They are frequently found in the mouths of rivers, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks. It is known from a depth range of 0 to 50 m. The juveniles are most abundant in estuaries and shallow water during the summer months, where they occupy sand and seagrass beds before moving into deeper water as they mature. Biology =Diet= Trumpeter whiting are benthic carnivores during their adult life, and like other sillaginids undergo a change in diet as they grow older. Juveniles are often considered to not be benthic, as they feed on a variety of planktonic prey, with mysids, amphipods and rarely polychaetes the main prey. They also prey on a variety of meiobenthos, with copepods the predominant form taken. Once they reach over 10 cm in size, they move into deeper water where they prey predominantly on polychaetes, bivalves, ophiuroidea and brachyura. Studies have also shown there is variation in the diet depending on geographical location and to a lesser extent, season. =Life cycle= Trumpeter whiting reach sexual maturity at a length of 19 cm in both sexes, having an extended period of reproductive development from October to April. Reproductive development of males and females was synchronized, with a peak in February and high levels of maturation in December. Running-ripe fish are present every month except June, but are most abundant in December and February. The species spawns on sandy beaches in sheltered bays, lakes and estuaries in relatively shallow water. Juveniles remain in these shallow water environments from 1–3 m depth, often penetrating into the upper reaches of estuaries. The juveniles have been observed to occupy small burrows on shallow sand flats, sitting at the entrance and retreating into the burrow as danger approaches. Whether they excavate these burrows themselves or hijack them from other organisms is unknown. Relationship to humans Trumpeter whiting are considered to be good quality fish for consumption, having softer flesh than most other Australian species of sillaginid. The species is commonly targeted by both commercial and recreational fishermen. Large amounts of the species are taken by prawn trawlers and seine netters in bays, with catches in Moreton Bay alone exceeding 200 tonnes per year, and the catch much higher for the entire fishery. The fish are marketed fresh, with trawled fish being bruised and don't fetch as high a price as netted fish. Recreational fishermen take large quantities of the species during winter predominantly, although they are present year round in most areas. Large catches are possible, with rigs kept as light as possible to avoid spooking the fish. Simple running sinker rigs using a size 6 - 2 hook, on 2 – 3 kg lines are commonly used, occasionally with red tubing employed as an attractant. Bait consists of the species natural prey such as prawns or bass yabbies, bivalves, a variety of marine worms, as well as bait such as squid.

On 20 May 1944, she was detached from the 5th Naval District and reassigned to the 1st Naval District where she operated into May 1945. With the end of the war in Europe however, she was designated for inactivation; and, on 25 July, she was ordered south to the 6th Naval District to await disposal. She arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 8 August and was placed out of service on 16 November. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 November, and she was sold, via the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration, on 13 August 1946 to Mr. Philip Filetto, Gloucester, Massachusetts.

The anti-RhE antibody can be naturally occurring, or arise following immune sensitization after a blood transfusion or pregnancy. The anti-RhE antibody is quite common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; it usually only causes a mild hemolytic disease, but can cause a severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also cause a severe hemolytic disease. One study done by Moran et al., found that titers are not reliable for anti-E. Their most severe case of hemolytic disease of the newborn occurred with titers 1:2. Moran states that it would be unwise routinely to dismiss anti-E as being of little clinical consequence. Presentation =Complications= *High at birth or rapidly rising bilirubin *Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia *Bilirubin-induced neuorlogical dysfunction *Cerebral palsy *Kernicterus *Thrombocytopenia *Hemolytic anemia – must not be treated with iron *Late onset anemia – must not be treated with iron. Can persist up to 12 weeks after birth. Mechanism Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDN) is a condition where the passage of maternal antibodies results in the hemolysis of fetal/neonatal red cells. The antibodies can be naturally occurring such as anti-A, and anti-B, or immune antibodies developed following a sensitizing event. Isoimmunization occurs when the maternal immune system is sensitized to red blood cell surface antigens. The most common causes of isoimmunization are blood transfusion, and fetal-maternal hemorrhage. The hemolytic process can result in anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal thrombocytopenia, and neonatal neutropenia. With the use of RhD Immunoprophylaxis, (commonly called Rhogam), the incidence of anti-D has decreased dramatically and other alloantibodies are now a major cause of HDN. =Antibody specific = One study done by Moran et al., found that titers are not reliable for anti-E. Their most severe case of hemolytic disease of the newborn occurred with titers 1:2. Moran states that it would be unwise routinely to dismiss anti-E as being of little clinical consequence. In the case of anti-E, the woman should be checked around 28 weeks to see if she has developed anti-c as well. Testing Testing for HDN involves blood work from both mother and father, and may also include assessment with amniocentesis and Middle Cerebral Artery scans. =Mother= Blood testing for the mother is called an indirect Coombs test (ICT) or an indirect agglutination test (IAT). This test tells whether there are antibodies in the maternal plasma. If positive, the antibody is identified and given a titer. Critical titers are associated with significant risk of fetal anemia and hydrops. Titers of 1:8 or higher is considered critical for Kell. Titers of 1:16 or higher are considered critical for all other antibodies. After critical titer is reached, care is based on MCA scans. If antibodies are low and have a sudden jump later in pregnancy, an MCA scan is warranted. If the titer undergoes a 4 fold increase, it should be considered significant regardless of if the critical value has been reached. Maternal titers are not useful in predicting fetal anemia after the first affected gestation and should not be used for the basis of care. Titers are tested monthly until 24 weeks, after which they are done every 2 weeks. \\"In only 2 situations are patients not monitored identically to patients who are Rh sensitized. The first is that of alloimmunization to the c, E, or, C antigens. Some concern exists that hemolysis may occur in these patients with a lower than 1:16 titer. Thus, if the initial titer is 1:4 and stable but increases at 26 weeks' gestation to 1:8, assessment with MCA Doppler velocity at that point is reasonable. However, if the patient presents in the first trimester with a 1:8 titer that remains stable at 1:8 throughout the second trimester, continued serial antibody titers are appropriate. The second situation in which patients should not be treated identically to patients who are Rh D sensitized is that of Kell isoimmunization because several cases of severe fetal hemolysis with anti-Kell antibodies have occurred in the setting of low titers.\\" In the case of a positive ICT, the woman must carry a medical alert card or bracelet for life because of the risk of a transfusion reaction. =Father= Blood is generally drawn from the father to help determine fetal antigen status. If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen.Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis: Clinical and Laboratory Aspects This test can help with knowledge for the current baby, as well as aid in the decision about future pregnancies. With RhD, the test is called the RhD genotype. With RhCE, and Kell antigen it is called an antigen phenotype.https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/march/molecular- typing-for-red-blood-cell-antigens =Fetus= There are three possible ways to test the fetal antigen status. Free cell DNA, amniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Of the three, CVS is no longer used due to risk of worsening the maternal antibody response. Once antigen status has been determined, assessment may be done with MCA scans. *Cell-free DNA can be run on certain antigens. Blood is taken from the mother, and using PCR, can detect the K, C, c, D, and E alleles of fetal DNA. This blood test is non-invasive to the fetus and is an easy way of checking antigen status and risk of HDN. Testing has proven very accurate and is routinely done in the UK at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol. Sanequin laboratory in Amsterdam, Netherlands also performs this test. For US patients, blood may be sent to either of the labs. In the US, Sensigene is done by Sequenome to determine fetal D status. Sequenome does not accept insurance in the US, but US and Canadian patients have had insurance cover the testing done overseas. *Amniocentesis is another recommended method for testing antigen status and risk for HDN. Fetal antigen status can be tested as early as 15 weeks by PCR of fetal cells. *CVS is possible as well to test fetal antigen status but is not recommended. CVS carries a higher risk of fetal maternal hemorrhage and can raise antibody titers, potentially worsening the antibody effect. =MCA scans= Middle cerebral artery – peak systolic velocity is changing the way sensitized pregnancies are managed. This test is done noninvasively with ultrasound. By measuring the peak velocity of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery, a MoM (multiple of the median) score can be calculated. MoM of 1.5 or greater indicates severe anemia and should be treated with IUT. Intervention There are several intervention options available in early, mid and late pregnancies. =Early pregnancy= *IVIG – IVIG stands for intravenous immunoglobulin. It is used in cases of previous loss, high maternal titers, known aggressive antibodies, and in cases where religion prevents blood transfusion. Ivig can be more effective than IUT alone. Fetal mortality was reduced by 36% in the IVIG and IUT group than in the IUT alone group. IVIG and plasmapheresis together can reduce or eliminate the need for an IUT. *Plasmapheresis – Plasmapheresis aims to decrease the maternal titer by direct plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis and IVIG together can even be used on women with previously hydropic fetuses and losses. =Mid to late pregnancy= *IUT – intrauterine transfusion (IUT) is done either by intraperitoneal transfusion (IPT) or intravenous transfusion (IVT). IVT is preferred over IPT. IUTs are only done until 35 weeks. After that, the risk of an IUT is greater than the risk from post birth transfusion.http://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion- of-red-cells *Steroids – steroids are sometimes given to the mother before IUTs and early delivery to mature the fetal lungs. *Phenobarbital – Phenobarbital is sometimes given to the mother to help mature the fetal liver and reduce hyperbilirubinemia.https://www.mombaby.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/03/UNC-Isoimmunization-Detection-Prevention.pdf *Early delivery – delivery can occur anytime after the age of viability. Emergency delivery due to failed IUT is possible, along with induction of labor at 35–38 weeks. After birth =Testing= *Coombs – after birth the baby will have a direct Coombs test run to confirm antibodies attached to the infant's red blood cells. This test is run from cord blood. In some cases, the direct Coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur. An indirect Coombs needs to be run in cases of anti-C, anti-c, and anti-M. Anti-M also recommends antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN. *Hgb – the infant's hemoglobin should be tested from cord blood. *Reticulocyte count – Reticulocytes are elevated when the infant is producing more blood to combat anemia. A rise in the retic count can mean that an infant may not need additional transfusions.https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/pdf/manuals/42_Hemol.pdf Low retic is observed in infants treated with IUT and in those with HDN from anti- Kell *Neutrophils – as neutropenia is one of the complications of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked. *Thrombocytes – as thrombocytopenia is one of the complications of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked. *Bilirubin should be tested from cord blood. *Ferritin – because most infants affected by HDN have iron overload, a ferritin must be run before giving the infant any additional iron. *Newborn screening tests – transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the newborn screening tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions. Treatment *Phototherapy – Phototherapy is used for cord bilirubin of 3 or higher. Some doctors use it at lower levels while awaiting lab results. *IVIG – IVIG has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well. IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy. The AAP recommends \\"In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ-globulin (0.5–1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34–51 μmol/L) of the exchange level. If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease.\\" *Exchange transfusion – exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the nonogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4). Cord bilirubin >4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion. Transfusion reactions Once a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a transfusion reaction. For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors of her antibody status. \\"Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune- mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures.\\" Summary of transfusion reactions in the US:https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/TransfusionDonationFatalities/ucm302847.htm See also *Coombs test *Hematology *Hemolytic anemia *Hemolytic disease of the newborn References Further reading *Antenatal & neonatal screening (second edition).

The Jim Henson Company sold the rights to the Muppets (including Kermit) to The Walt Disney Company in 2004 (namely their branch in The Muppets Studio), and Kermit's scenes and narrations were thus omitted from the special's 2005 DVD. The 2018 releases of the special on Blu-ray and DVD reinstate Kermit's scenes, but not his narrations. Plot Following an introduction by Kermit the Frog, the story tells of Emmet Otter and his Ma, a widow who scrapes by on the small amount of money she gets from doing laundry and that Emmet gets from doing odd jobs around their home in the town of Frogtown Hollow despite both of them often being cheated. Some of the people who cheated them are Old Lady Possum and Gretchen Fox (the wife of Mayor Harrison Fox) of Waterville. As Christmas approaches, they hear of a talent contest in the nearby town of Waterville with a grand prize of $50, and separately decide to enter to buy store-bought presents for each other: an elaborate guitar for Emmet or a piano for Ma. However, in a twist on The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry, they must sacrifice each other's livelihood for the talent contest. Ma hocks Emmet's tools for dress fabric while Emmet turns Ma's washtub into a washtub bass for a jug band. Emmet assembles Wendell Porcupine, Harvey Beaver, and Charlie Muskrat as the Frogtown Hollow Jubilee Jug Band. Emmet and Ma each do an excellent job (despite Emmet's jug band having to frantically change songs after another contestant performs their song, Bar-b-que), only to be defeated at the last minute by a rock and roll band called The Riverbottom Nightmare Band, which comprises a hoodlum gang from the fairly distant town of River Bottom made up of Chuck Stoat, Fred Lizard, Howard Snake, \\"Pop-Eyed\\" Catfish, and Stanley Weasel. However, as the Frogtown Hollow Jubilee Jug Band sing a song together on the way home (more accurately, both of their talent show songs together after Ma realized they fit together), they are overheard by Doc Bullfrog (owner of a local restaurant called the Riverside Rest) who hires them to sing for his customers. This grants them the bigger prize. Kermit concludes the special with Emmet, Ma, and the gang playing in front of Doc Bullfrog and the customers.

Preparation  The dough for hotteok is made from wheat flour, water, milk, sugar, and yeast. The dough is allowed to rise for several hours. Handful-sized balls of this stiff dough are filled with a sweet mixture, which may contain brown sugar, honey, chopped peanuts, and cinnamon. The filled dough is then placed on a greased griddle, and pressed flat into a large circle with a special tool with a stainless steel circle and wooden handle as it cooks.

The mix also comes with a filling consisting of brown sugar and ground peanuts or sesame seeds. Snack mix popularity on the rise, Yonhap News, 2010-01-07. Retrieved 2010-06-27.  Origin  Hotteok, showing filling It is generally believed that hotteok originated from Chinese merchants who immigrated to Korea after the late 19th century. 호떡, 가난한 쿨리의 가장 먹기 편한 음식, The Hankyoreh, 2012-04-27. Retrieved 2017-07-11. Unlike many Chinese pancakes, which often contain savory meat fillings, today hotteok are stuffed with sweet fillings, to suit South Koreans' culinary tastes. Hotteok, Kyunghyang News, 2003-11-20. Retrieved 2010-06-27.  Varieties  The types of hotteok have been changing continuously although many favour the traditional cinnamon and peanut filling. Many variations have developed since the early 21st century, such as green tea hotteok,photo pink bokbunja hotteok, corn hotteok, pizza hotteok and more. Commercially-produced hotteok products are developed and sold by companies such as Samyang, Ottogi, and CJ. Such products are designed to be cooked at home.  Nutrition  Hotteok is usually eaten during the winter season. Due to its high sugar content, a single hotteok may have as many as 230 calories. Winter snacks, Kukinews, 2007-01-07.  Phrases using hotteok Koreans say \\"The hotteok store is burning (호떡집에 불났다.)\\" to refer to noisy situations. It is believed that the origin of this phrase is that Chinese merchants were considered very noisy by Koreans. If their Hotteok stores were burnt, the merchants must have talked to each other about the reason of fire, or the accidents, in the tonal Chinese language. 호떡, 가난한 쿨리의 가장 먹기 편한 음식, The Hankyoreh, 2012-04-27.

Originally from Hungary, Pándy is believed to have killed his wife, ex-wife, two biological children, and two step-children who disappeared mysteriously, with the assistance of his daughter, Ágnes. Additionally, he had started abusive incestuous relationships with Ágnes and a third step-child who survived. In 1992, Belgian and Hungarian police began investigating Pándy, which resulted in his arrest in 1997, and conviction in 2002. Furthermore, the skeletal remains of seven more unknown women and one man were found in one of his houses. A religious teacher and clergyman, he was dubbed \\"Father Bluebeard\\" by some of the Belgian press. Pándy had been serving a life sentence without parole when he died on 23 December 2013.De Standaard, 23 december 2013 Serial killer Andras Pandy is dead  Early life and marriages  Pándy was born on 1 June 1927, in Chop, Carpathian Ruthenia (then under Czechoslovak administration), a village just across the border from Hungary, to Hungarian parents. Pándy was a church councillor for the Reformed Church in Hungary when he met his first wife, Ilona Sőrés. Following the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1956, they fled to Belgium where Pándy became a pastor for a small Hungarian Protestant community in Brussels, and a religious teacher for the United Protestant Church. The couple had a daughter, Ágnes, the following year and two sons: Dániel (born 1961) and Zoltán (1966). Shortly after the birth of Zoltán, the couple separated when Pándy accused his wife of infidelity. Ilona moved out of the house with their sons, leaving daughter Ágnes behind with Pándy. Then 11 years old, Ágnes soon became the victim of an incestuous relationship with her father. At the beginning of the 1970s after his separation from Ilona, Pándy began courting other women through dating services in Hungarian newspapers, often giving them a false name and job description while using the motto \\"European Honeymoon\\". By the end of the decade, he had begun regularly visiting Hungary again, meeting his future second wife, Edit Fintor. A married woman, Fintor had three children from two previous marriages: three daughters—8 year old Tünde, 15 year-old Tímea, and 7 year-old Andrea. Fintor's then-husband claimed that Pándy had seduced his wife, who eloped with him to Belgium along with her children, where they married in 1979 after Pándy's divorce from Ilona Sőrés was finalized. Shortly after their marriage they had two children: a son András Junior, and a daughter Reka. In 1984, Pándy started a second abusive incestuous relationship with his step-daughter, the now 20-year-old Tímea, whom he had impregnated after raping her. Tímea's claims of sexual abuse were brushed off by her family members, stating that she had probably used a towel containing Pándy's semen to impregnate herself. She was sent to live in a different house with Ágnes, and in what was believed to be a fit of jealousy, Ágnes tried to bludgeon Tímea to death with an iron bar in the basement of the home, until she was startled and stopped. After being hospitalized, Tímea attempted to report her abuse but her claims were again dismissed, and she later gave birth to a son, Marc. In 1986 Tímea escaped from her family, first staying with relatives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, before starting a new life in Hungary.  Disappearances Shortly before running away to Vancouver, Tímea had told her mother that the father of her son was Pándy, and that he had been sexually abusing her. This sparked a fierce argument between Fintor and Pándy, and soon after this time Fintor and the now 14 year-old Andrea disappeared. Pándy had told the police that Fintor had left him for another man and the two had moved to Germany with her new lover, using a forged telegram as evidence. Two years later in 1988, twenty years after their separation, Pándy's ex-wife Ilona and their two sons disappeared. Pándy first claimed that they had moved to France, but then changed it to South America. By 1990, Fintor's 18-year-old daughter Tünde was still alive and living with Pándy many years after the disappearance of her mother and sister. Pándy sent Ágnes away on a vacation with his younger children, András Jr. and Reka, only for her to find upon her return that Tünde had also disappeared. She was told by Pándy that she had become \\"disturbed\\" and been sent to live with another family.  Investigation, arrest and conviction  Police investigation of the disappearances had previously been very limited and low-effort, with Pándy managing to avoid suspicion by using false testimony and forged evidence to trick the police into believing they had simply migrated away from Belgium. In 1992, two years after the last disappearance, Ágnes attempted to report her father to the police for sexual abuse. Although initially no real action was taken, suspicion against Pándy increased and the police interest in the disappearances grew. Hungarian police became involved in the investigation due to a possible connection with Pándy to cases of many missing women in Hungary. Pándy frequently visited Hungary, owning a summer home near the River Danube, and during his trips he was known to charm local women and offer to take them with him to Brussels. This theory lead the two police forces began a joint investigation. Later, two siblings from the town, Eva Kincs and Margit Magyar, claim to have both accepted Pándy's offer, each with the hopes of becoming his wife. According to the two women, they were locked in the Brussels home by Pándy and forced to cook and clean, telling them that they would raise suspicions if they wandered out on the streets unable to speak anything but Hungarian. After rejecting separate marriage proposals, the women demanded he send them back to Hungary, and he surprisingly did. The United Protestant Church in Belgium, Pándy's employer, had never made an official complaint against him in his role as a teacher and Protestant pastor, however in 1988 his colleague, the Dutch minister Andries den Broer, apparently became aware of abuses at home and the lack of police interest. Andries supposedly wrote to the Belgian Ministry of Justice and Queen Fabiola because of his suspicions, but received no answers. By 1996 it was discovered that he used false testimony and fake letters. Pándy was arrested on 16 October 1997 - coincidentally the same date as the \\"White March\\", a large demonstration for the victims of another Belgian serial killer Marc Dutroux, who had sexually abused and killed several girls in Charleroi a few years prior. The Dutroux case was controversial in Belgium, and brought police incompetence and corruption into the national spotlight. In addition to Dutroux's case, Pándy's case had worldwide media coverage, especially after Pándy's deadpan reaction to his surroundings. = Ágnes's confession = In November 1997, Ágnes herself was arrested by the police, and a few days later confessed to participating with her father in most of the murders of her disappeared relatives. According to Ágnes, she was solely responsible for the murder of her mother Ilona, and took part in the murders of Dániel, Zoltán, Edit and Andrea, but was not involved in (and possibly unaware of) Tünde's death. It is believed that the killing of Tünde was the only murder Pándy had committed without Ágnes's assistance. The modus operandi presented by Ágnes was, in at least two cases, murder by a handgun, and head trauma caused by a sledgehammer. The corpses were dismembered, partly dissolved in a bath filled with liquid plumber in the basement, and then the remaining parts were taken to a local abattoir in Anderlecht for disposal. = Trial and sentencing = Pándy had denied the charges, but largely due to Ágnes's testimony and assistance, enough evidence was gathered to convict him. In court, Pándy dismissed the proceedings as a \\"witch trial\\" against him, and told the jury that the allegedly dead were still alive and he is \\"in contact with them through angels.\\" When asked why the missing family members could not be traced in four years of searching, Pándy replied: \\"It is up to justice to prove they are dead. When I'm free again, they will come and visit me.\\" On March 6, 2002, a Belgian court convicted Pándy for the murder of six family members, attempted murder, and rape of three daughters. Pándy was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, and housed in Leuven Centraal prison before was moved to a prison in Bruges due to health reasons. In 2007 when he turned 80, prison authorities had considered re-housing him in a retirement home.Index - Életfogytiglant kapott Pándy Ágnes Pándy, now 44 years old, received a 21-year sentence for being an accomplice in five murders and one attempted murder. Prosecutors had requested a 29-year sentence for Ágnes, but her lawyers pushed for leniency, saying Ágnes had been under the \\"overwhelming irresistible spell\\" of a father who was raping her and coerced her into collaborating in the killings of her mother and siblings. Ágnes said in her closing statement: \\"I had no way out. I was completely in his grip.\\" András Pándy died on 23 December 2013, from natural causes in the Bruges prison infirmary.  Aftermath and possible additional murders  = Sint-Jans-Molenbeek residences = Pándy owned several homes within the Sint-Jans-Molenbeek area in central Brussels, along the River Senne. This included rowhouses on Vandemaelen Street, Nijverheidskaai/Quai de l'Industrie (where the majority of the murders had occurred), and Vandenbrande Street. During an excavation at the home on Vandemaelen Street following Pándy's arrest, the skeletal remains of seven women and one man of unknown origin were discovered within the concrete of the home's basement. In January 1998 DNA analysis of the bone fragments revealed that the deceased were not relatives of Pándy, and it remains unclear if their deaths were related to the case at all. Due to Pándy's prolific uses of Hungarian dating services, there are suspicions that they could be the skeletons of Hungarian women brought to Belgium. During an investigation of the home on Vandenbrande Street, several firearms including three rifles and four handguns were found stashed in a hidden compartment built into the ceiling. The Valdemaelen Street and Nijverheidskaai/Quai de l'Industrie houses were later demolished. = Possible additional murders = After his arrest, further investigation speculated that Pándy and Ágnes may have committed several additional murders of non-relatives, before and during the killing of their family members. On November 26, 1997, a month after his arrest, the Hungarian newspaper Népszava reported that Pándy had fostered an unknown number of Romanian children—orphan refugees from the 1989 revolution that toppled communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu—at his home in Brussels. The children were supposedly recruited by a charity called YDNAP (Pándy spelled backwards), and Népszava reported that \\"nobody knows what happened to them or if they returned home\\" to Romania. Police also linked Ágnes to the 1993 disappearance of a 12-year-old girl whose mother was romantically involved with Pándy. Hungarian authorities had searched interconnected basements of Pándy's former home at Dunakeszi, north of the Hungarian capital Budapest. The findings were concealed, but suggested that an \\"old family tragedy\\" might have been responsible for Pándy's killing spree. In fact, they suggested that the prisoner in Belgium might not be Pándy at all, but rather a sibling of the real Pándy, whose death had been officially recorded in 1956, the same year of Pándy's migration to Belgium.

It is a strategic infrastructure project to create a new gas supply corridor. When completed in October 2022, it will transport natural gas from the North Sea to Poland via Denmark. The project is being developed by the Danish gas and electricity transmission system operator Energinet and the Polish gas transmission system operator Gaz-System. The project is recognised as a project of common interest of the European Union. History The project started in 2001, when Danish oil and gas company DONG and Polish oil and gas company PGNiG signed an agreement on construction of the pipeline and Danish gas supply to Poland. It was agreed to establish a pipeline consortium with two-thirds of the shares belonging to DONG and one- third to PGNiG with possible Statoil participation. However, shortly afterward the project was suspended, because of economic feasibility. The project was revived in 2007. On 2 May 2007, PGNiG and Energinet, a Danish transmission system operator, which was taken over Danish natural gas transmission network from DONG, signed an agreement to explore the possibility of construction the Baltic Pipe. In August 2008, the Polish Government replaced PGNiG with the fully state-owned pipeline operator Gaz-System as the project partner. On 18 May 2009, the European Commission launched a call for proposals for grants in the framework of the European Energy Programme for Recovery. It proposed to allocate about €150 million for implementation of Skanled and Baltic Pipe projects. The European Commission provided €3.2 million for technical design of the pipeline. However, on 16 June 2009 Gaz-System suspended the implementation of the project due to suspension of the Skanled project and lack of natural gas demand in Poland. The project was reactivated by Poland in February 2010 after reviewing the project. The current project was initiated in 2016 when a new feasibility study was conducted. The project was included in the first list of projects of common interest by the European Commission in 2013, and the binding list on 18 November 2015. On 24 November 2017, it was included for the third time. In mid-2017, Energinet and Gaz-System launched the open season procedure. In January 2018, they signed 15-year capacity agreements with market participants. In 2018, public hearings took place in Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Poland. In July 2018, a €18.3 million subsidy was granted from the Connecting Europe Facility. In April 2019, €214.9 million funding was granted to the project by the European Commission. In 2018-2020, the analytical, survey and design works are being carried out in order to obtain the required permits for construction and operation of the Baltic offshore pipeline. Technical features The original submarine pipeline was to connect Faxe South in Denmark and Niechorze-Pogorzelica in Poland. The cost of building that pipeline was estimated at €335-350 million, depending on the diameter of the pipe. It was planned to be built allowing gas flows in both directions. The current project consists of five major segments: * The North Sea offshore pipeline – An offshore pipeline between the Norwegian gas system in the North Sea and the Danish gas transmission system. It will be tie-in to Europipe II, which connects Norway and Germany. Its landfall will be on the west coast of Denmark near Blaabjerg. The offshore pipeline will be built and operated by Energinet. * Onshore Denmark – expansion of the existing Danish transmission system from West to East, including of new pipelines. The planned expansions in Denmark include construction of a new pipeline from Blaabjerg to Nybro, construction of a receiving plant at Nybro, construction of a new pipeline from Egtved to the Little Belt, construction of a new pipeline across the Little Belt, construction of a new pipeline over Fyn from the Little Belt to Nyborg, construction of a new pipeline on Zealand from Kongsmark to the Baltic Sea offshore landfall at the southeaster part of Zealand. It will be built and operated by Energinet. * A compressor station in Denmark located on the eastern part of Zealand, which is necessary for the pipeline between Denmark and Poland. It will also ensure the reverse flow. It will be built and operated by Energinet, and it is co-financed by Gaz-System. * The Baltic Sea offshore pipeline of between Denmark and Poland providing bi-directional transmission of gas. The route goes through the Danish and Polish maritime areas and Swedish exclusive economic zone with the preferred landfalls in Faxe South Denmark and in Niechorze–Pogorzelica in Poland. The offshore pipeline will be built and operated by Gaz-System. * Onshore Poland – expansion of the Polish gas transmission system, including new pipeline and three gas compressor stations. It consists of construction of the onshore gas pipeline connecting the offshore gas pipeline to the national transmission system, construction of the Goleniów–Lwówek pipeline, extension of the Goleniów gas compressor station, construction of the Gustorzyn gas compressor station, and extension of the Odolanów gas compressor station. It will be built and operated by Gaz-System. It will have gas transportation capacity of from Norway to Denmark and Poland, and from Poland to Denmark. The pipeline from the North Sea to Poland is expected to have a total length of .

At the 2016 census, it had a population of 3,749 people. The town, located along Quebec route 321, is about north of Papineauville and Quebec route 148 (and the future extension of Quebec Autoroute 50) and about an hour away from Downtown Ottawa. History It was in 1841 that the first settlers arrived in the townships which Saint-André- Avellin today lies. As being part of a large valley near the Ottawa River, it had agriculture potential but was located very far from the main corridor of the Saint Lawrence River and the main area in which there was significant agriculture development in large townships on both sides of the river between Montreal and Quebec City. Due to the more remote location and the lack of efficient transportation, the development during much of the remainder of the 19th century was fairly slow until several economic crises forced authorities to look for newer land to develop. Throughout most of the century, it was mostly used for the logging industry due to the proximity of extensive forest areas in the higher valleys and hills of the region. The parish municipality was created in 1851 and it was in 1890, that the first school was built in the area. Population gradually increased, especially during the 1970s by a wave of rural development. The parish and the village that was made official in the second half of the 19th century merged in the late 1990s.MRCpapineau.com Demographics Features and festivals It is one of the major sites of what it is called La Petite-Nation and is the site of two major summer events including the annual Western Rodeo Festival, as well as Musique en Nous, a county-wide event which it presents newer musical talents in the region as well as popular Quebec singers.

Early life Rusanov was born in a merchant's family in Oryol. His early life was marred by hardship when his father went bankrupt before dying while Rusanov was still a child. Rusanov's widowed mother struggled to bring up the family but managed to send her son to the Oryol Gymnasium (Grammar School). Rusanov however began to be involved with Marxist revolutionaries. He was arrested by the police who while they could not prove anything informed the gymnasium leading to his expulsion. Rusanov therefore joined a theological seminary. Rusanov entered the natural sciences faculty at Kiev University in 1897. At Kiev he was involved in Marxist activities and was again expelled and briefly imprisoned. While in jail he was inspired by books about Fridjtof Nansen's Arctic voyages and resolved to become a polar explorer. Rusanov was released in 1899 but subject to police over watch. Sent into internal exile in Siberia, Rusanov became a statistician for the local council in Ust Syslosk, where he conducted scientific observations in addition to his duties. At the end of his term he was not allowed to reside in any major Russian city, depriving him of a chance to further his education, he therefore went to study in Paris at the Sorbonne. Russanov specialised in geology and wrote his thesis on the geology of Novaya Zemlya. He was allowed to return to Russia in 1907 Arctic Exploration In 1909–1911 V. A. Rusanov carried out explorations in Novaya Zemlya. He was helped by Tyko Vylka, his guide, who later became the Chairman of the Novaya Zemlya Soviet (local Council) In 1912 Rusanov had been appointed to command a government expedition to Svalbard to investigate the coal potential.Pinkhenson 1962 p. 489 He sailed from Aleksandrovsk-na-Murmane (now Polyarnyy, near Murmansk) on 26 June on ship Gerkules under Captain Alexander Kuchin, Roald Amundsen's South Pole navigator. The personnel consisted of thirteen men and one woman, Rusanov's French fiancée Julie Jean. Apart from Rusanov there was another geologist and a zoologist. At the end of a very successful summer’s field work, three members of the expedition (the geologist, the zoologist and the ship's bosun) returned to Russia via Grønfjorden in Norway.Pinkhenson 1962 p. 492 The remaining ten, however, without consultation with the authorities in St. Petersburg, set off with Rusanov in an incredibly rash attempt at reaching the Pacific Ocean via the Northern Sea Route. Their ship Gerkules was too small for the kind of expedition Rusanov had in mind. The last to be heard of Rusanov's expedition was a telegram left at Matochkin Shar on Novaya Zemlya, which reached St. Petersburg on 27 September 1912. In it, Rusanov indicated that he intended rounding the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya, and heading east across the Kara Sea but nothing was heard from the Gerkules thereafter. He and his 11-man team, including Alexander Kuchin, disappeared without trace a year later in the Kara Sea, off the northern coast of Siberia. Hercules ketch In 1914-15 the almost impossible task of searching for Rusanov (as well as for the similarly disappeared Captain Georgy Brusilov and the Brusilov Expedition), was entrusted to Otto Sverdrup with the ship Eklips. His efforts, however, were unsuccessful. In 1937 the Arctic Institute of the Soviet Union organized an expedition to the Nordenskiöld Archipelago on ship Toros. Relics of the ill-fated 1912-13 Vladimir Rusanov’s expedition on the Gercules were found on Popova-Chukchina Island located at (74° 56'N, 86° 18'E) off Kolosovykh Island in the Kolosovykh group. Commemoration A glacier in October Revolution Island, in the Severnaya Zemlya group has been named after Vladimir Rusanov. Rusanov is dutifully remembered in the city of his birth, Oryol, where the Rusanova Street is named after him.

Players competing in the inaugural tournament were Rafael Nadal, David Ferrer, Carlos Moyá, Sergi Bruguera, Pat Cash and Joachim Johansson. The winner was David Ferrer, who beats Rafael Nadal in the final (7/5). Rules Unlike regular tennis, games are set to a 30-minute time limit with a klaxon on the fifteenth minute to signify a change of ends from the next game onwards. If games are level after 30 minutes the winner is decided by a sudden death point, but there have been some changes and you have to win 2 out of 3 sudden death points to win the match. Other main differences include a 15-second maximum time limit for serves which, if exceeded, results in the player losing the point automatically; lets on serves are also played.

Osip Aaronovitch Piatnitsky (; 1882 – 1938), born Iosif Aronovich Tarshis, was a Russian revolutionary. Piatnitsky is best remembered as head of the International Department of the Communist International during the 1920s and early 1930s, a position which made him one of the leading public faces of the international Communist movement. Biography =Early years= Iosif Aronovich Tarshis was born January 17, 1882, the son of an ethnic Jewish carpenter in the town of Vilkomir (today known as Ukmergė), in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania). As a boy Tarshis worked briefly as a tailor's apprentice in Vilkomir before moving to the big city of Kovno (today's Kaunas) in 1897.Susan Causey, \\"Osip Piatnitskii,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: M-Z. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pg. 754. There he took up his father's trade of carpentry and was radicalized by the illegal trade union movement among the city's carpenters, joining a workers' self-education circle. In 1898 Tarshis became active in the Kovno's illegal tailor's union, helping to conduct educational and organizational work on its behalf. =Underground revolutionary= Tarshis became a convert to Marxism and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1899, moving that same year to Lithuania's largest city, Vilna (today's Vilnius). There Tashis became involved in the Vilna organization of ladies' tailors. As a member of the underground movement, Tarshis adopted the pseudonym \\"Piatnitsa\\" (translation: \\"Friday\\") as a means of avoiding detection by the Okhrana, the Tsar's secret police.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 362-364. This early \\"party name\\" became the root of Tarshis's best-known pseudonym, Osip Piatnitsky, and it is by this name that he will henceforth be referred to here. In 1901 Piatnitsky became associated with the Internationalist wing of the RSDLP, a group prominently including Vladimir Ul'ianov (N. Lenin), which was at the time publishing the revolutionary newspaper Iskra from emigration in Germany. Piatnitsky became involved in the smuggling of this newspaper across the German frontier into Russia,N.K. Krupskaya, Reminiscences of Lenin. New York: International Publishers, 1970; pg. 173. also helping to organize the transportation of party members to and from the country. This dangerous work placed Piatnitsky in harm's way, and arrest by the secret police followed in 1902. Although jailed in 1902, Piatnitsky managed to make his escape and he returned to Germany to continue his work as a courier for the Iskra group. He was a delegate to the 2nd Congress of the RSDLP in London in the Summer of 1903 — a gathering which split the RSDLP into rival Bolshevik and Menshevik wings. Piatnitsky sided with Lenin and the Bolsheviks at that gathering and he remained a loyal member of that faction throughout the pre-revolutionary years. In the spring of 1905 Piatnitsky attended the 3rd Congress of the RSDLP in London. He returned to Russia later in that same year, going to Odessa in the Ukraine, where he worked as a Bolshevik organizer primarily among the tobacco workers there. Piatnitsky was an active participant in the Revolution of 1905, helping to organize a general strike in Odessa. Unsurprisingly, this activity again drew the scrutiny of the secret police and in January 1906 Piatnitsky was arrested again by the Okhrana. Following this second arrest, Piatnitsky remained in jail until 1908. Following his release, Piatnitsky returned to Germany where he once again took up work for the Bolshevik Party, coordinating secret communications from the party center abroad to its network of activists inside Russia. In January 1912 Piatnitsky was again chosen as a delegate to a Bolshevik conclave in Prague, remembered as the 6th All-Russian Conference of the RSDLP.A.A. Solov'ev, S\\"ezdy i kkonferentsii KPSS: Spravochnik (Congresses and Conferences of the KPSS: Handbook). Moscow: Politizdat, 1986; pp. 80-90. As he sought to return to Russia to work in industry, Piatnitsky went to Paris following the Prague party conference, where he trained as an electrician. He returned to Russia in 1913, taking a job as an electrician in the town of Volsk in Saratov Oblast, located on the banks of the Volga River. There Piatnitsky led a strike before being transferred to Samara. His political and union activities drew the attention of the secret police and Piatnitsky was arrested for a third time in June 1914. This time Piatnitsky was sentenced to Siberian exile, which removed him from revolutionary politics until after the February Revolution of 1917. =Communist functionary= Freed by the February Revolution, Piatnitsky relocated to Moscow, where he became a member of the Bolshevik Party's Moscow Committee. Following the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917, Piatnitsky became a government functionary. From 1919 to 1920 he served as head of the Railroad Workers' Trade Union. Piatnitsky was chosen as head of the Moscow Committee in 1920 and elected an alternate member of the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) at the party's 9th Congress that same spring. Piatnitsky moved from work in the Soviet trade unions and the Russian Communist Party to work in the Communist International in 1921, when he was elected by Executive Committee of the Communist International to the post of treasurer of the Comintern and head of the Comintern's International Liaison Department (OMS). Following the 4th World Congress of the Comintern in November 1922, Piatnitsky was chosen as a member of the Comintern's Organization Buro and budget commission. In June 1923 the 3rd Plenum of the Comintern elected Piatnitsky as of four top leaders of the organization to sit on the body's governing Secretariat. Piatnitsky was joined as a member of the Comintern Secretariat by the Bulgarian Vasil Kolarov, the Finn Otto Kuusinen, and Mátyás Rákosi of Hungary. Piatnitsky remained a top official of the Comintern throughout the 1920s and the first half of the 1930s. The 5th World Congress of 1924 returned him as a member of the Secretariat, Orgburo, budget commission, and ECCI. Following the fall of Grigory Zinoviev in 1926, the post he formerly held as \\"President\\" of the Comintern was eliminated, to be replaced by a new Political Secretariat, to which Piatnitsky was elected. Piatnitsky's role was subsequently confirmed by the 6th World Congress of 1928 and the 11th Plenum of 1931. In addition to his leading role in the Comintern, Piatnitsky held several positions of high importance in the hierarchy of the Russian Communist Party. In 1924, he was elected a member of the Communist Party's Central Control Committee, a body in charge of matters of party discipline, remaining in that position through 1927.K.A. Zalesskii, Imperiia Stalina: Biograficheskii entsiklopedicheskii slovar' (The Empire of Stalin: Biographical Encyclopedic Dictionary). Moscow: Veche, 2000; pg. 379. In that year, Piatnitsky was made a full member of the governing Central Committee of the RKP(b) in which he continued until the time of his arrest in 1937. Piatnitsky seems to have fallen from grace towards the middle of the 1930s. While he addressed the 7th World Congress in 1935, he was pointed not re-elected to any of the positions in the organization which he had held previously. Thereafter he returned briefly to work in the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks). =Arrest and execution= In the midst of the secret police terror known as the Yezhovshchina, Osip Piatnitsky objected to the massacres, expressed doubt that charges against party comrades were valid when the Central Committee met in plenary session and was asked to sanction what had been happening. Equal to calling Stalin a tyrant and fraudster, Pyatnitsky refused to back down. As a result, in October 1937, he was removed from his position on the Central Committee, stripped of party membership, and arrested by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. This suicidal act of courage was extremely rare He remained in jail for a year before finally being given a summary trial and sentenced to death. On October 30, 1938, Osip Piatnitsky was executed. He was 56 years old at the time of his death. =Legacy= Osip Piatnitsky was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956, following the 20th Congress of the CPSU, at which Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev revealed the systemic abuses of the Soviet secret police during the Stalin period in a so-called \\"Secret Speech.\\" Footnotes Works * The Organisation of a World Party.

Summary Purporting to be an autobiography, Diary of an Oxygen Thief begins with the narrator, an Irish advertising executive living in London, describing the pleasure he used to receive from emotionally abusing women. After the narrator starts attending AA meetings, he sobers up and looks back on his past relationships with a measure of remorse. After taking a job in the United States, the narrator is confronted externally by the absurdity of corporate America, culture shock, and the conflict of moving from the lower to upper- middle class. Internally he grapples with paranoia, addiction, and a legacy of pain. Later, he meets a young, aspiring photographer in New York and falls in love with her. The \\"Oxygen Thief\\" in the title refers to narrator's low self- esteem. Because of his sense of self-loathing he seems to go through life unworthy of the very air he breathes.

In the United States, such structures are literally named \\"Federal Building\\", with this moniker displayed on the property. There are design issues specific to federal buildings, relating to their multipurpose functions and concerns related to the fact of their association with the government. For example, as symbols of the government, they may potentially be focus of protests or threats, so there are security issues. Also environmental impacts and environmentally sound design may be more important. A committee set up by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 issued \\"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\\". Towards improving design of federal buildings in the United States, \\"the committee recommended architecture that would convey the 'dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.' Designers and officials were encouraged to pay special attention to site selection and layout, including landscape development.\\" Some architects specialize in federal building designs. History The first U.S. Federal building authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1807, with an appropriation of $20,000 to build, in New Orleans, a post office, courthouse, or custom house. Historically, the authorization and construction of the first federally-funded building in a small town often has been a major event. Sometimes these were simply a post office or a courthouse; often they were combination buildings. The Treasury Department of the U.S. established a Department of Construction office in 1852. From 1864 on the Office of the Supervising Architect handled design of federal buildings. William Gibbs McAdoo, the Secretary of the Treasury from 1913–1918, and the Supervising Architect at the time, James A. Wetmore promoted standardization of government building design. They instituted the policy that buildings were to be designed with \\"scale, materials and finishes\\" that directly reflected their \\"location, prominence and income\\". This push to standardization of public building design was in conflict with the Tarsney Act, which permitted private architects to design federal buildings after being selected in a competition under the supervision of the Supervising Architect. The act, under which several prior buildings were designed, was repealed in 1913 as it was felt that designing building with government architects would most efficiently cause the desired standardization. Buildings were to be designed with specific criteria, A \\"Class A\\" building was one which was on a major street of a major city, surrounding by expensive building and expected to generate at least $800,000 in revenue. These buildings would have marble or granite exteriors, marble interiors, ornamental bronze, and other similar fixtures. A small post office with revenue of under $15,000 would be made of brick, with standard wood windows and doors and would appear \\"ordinary\\". Critics felt the system would make public buildings too plain. The growth of cities and government functions has led to the need for large multipurpose highrise federal buildings. An example is the 32-story $120 million construction in Cleveland of the Anthony J. Celebrezze Federal Building. In the United States, multipurpose federal buildings are generally managed by the U.S. General Services Administration. The GSA recognized its top 20 federal buildings in 2014.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2008. It was written by Michael Price and directed by Michael Polcino, and it guest starred Jon Stewart and Dan Rather as themselves. This episode became controversial in Argentina for a joke made about the government of Juan Perón. Michael Polcino was nominated for Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for directing the episode. Plot Homer leaves work, and when he is reminded that his diet is starting on the first day of the month (which is that day), he decides to have one last binge at Springfield's Fast- Food Boulevard. After filling up, he decides to throw away his wrappers and the contents of his car in a trash can in the shape of Sideshow Mel’s head outside of a Krusty Burger, tossing away a leaky battery and a lit match. The acid from the leaky battery eats a hole in a gas main, with the lit match igniting the gas and starting a fire which soon causes nearby gas pipes to explode, completely destroying Fast-Food Boulevard. At a town hall meeting, the enraged residents of Springfield demand that Fast-Food Boulevard be rebuilt immediately. To fund the reconstruction, a bond measure is proposed. As the next election is not until June the next year, Mayor Quimby moves it to the upcoming Tuesday, making Springfield's presidential primary the first in the nation. Candidates and reporters head to Springfield when they hear the news. The candidates flock to the Simpsons, who are undecided. Their home is filled with people and their yard is covered with reporters; helicopters and news vans surround the lot. When voting day arrives, an angry Homer and other citizens hold a meeting in Moe's Tavern. Homer suggests the people vote for the most ridiculous candidate, whom they choose after Chief Wiggum suggests himself. The same night, Kent Brockman announces an unexpected turn of events; Springfield has rejected all the leading candidates and voted for 8-year-old Ralph Wiggum. He wins the primary, much to the shock of Lisa Simpson. Ralph is immediately embraced as the leading candidate, and Homer and Bart become his fans. Lisa, however, is miserable, as she knows how slow Ralph is. A news report (called Headbutt) shows Ralph has no idea of which party's nomination he is seeking. Both the Democratic and Republican parties contend to secure Ralph as their candidate. The leaders of both parties break into Ralph's home, wanting to fight for him. Lisa confronts Ralph amongst the media frenzy, attempting to convince him not to run. Ralph tells Lisa he wants to run so he can bring peace between warring parties and his earnest kind heartedness wins her support. He is proven to be a formidable candidate, and both the Republicans and the Democrats support Ralph for president. The episode ends with a political commercial for Ralph, sponsored by both parties.

Reception An estimated 8.2 million people tuned into the episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad said that it was an episode with many jokes and sight gags, his favorite being the episode's guest stars and the many references. His only disagreement was the abrupt ending. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode had all the ingredients that seem to make it a classic episode. He enjoyed the theme of Homer and Fast-Food Boulevard, the political mocking, and the centering of Ralph, and like Keller, he felt the show seemed to shun Ralph until the end; he gives the episode a rating of 6/10. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly reveals (five days after the episode was broadcast) that it received positive reviews from the site, and Ralph Wiggum had their vote. =Controversy= The episode caused controversy prior to its broadcast in Argentina, over an exchange between Lenny and Carl. Carl says \\"I could really go for some kind of military dictator, like Juan Perón. When he 'disappeared' you, you stayed 'disappeared'!\\". Carl's comment is a reference to the Dirty War in Argentina, a period of military dictatorship (1976-1983) during which as many as 8,000According to the Unified Register of Victims of State Terrorism https://www.infobae.com/politica/2016/11/07/un-informe-oficial-revelo-que- hubo-al-menos-6348-desaparecidos-durante-la-dictadura/ Argentines disappeared, and is largely regarded as having begun during Perón's last government with the Triple A, a death squad which killed many left-wing dissidents. However, these disappearances occurred systematically during the military dictatorship, which began almost two years after Peron's death. The clip was viewed on YouTube over ten thousand times in Argentina and some politicians in the country called for the episode to be censored or banned. , former Argentinian congressman and president of the Juan Domingo Perón Institute said \\"this type of program causes great harm, because the disappearances are still an open wound here.\\" Some reacted negatively to Lenny's response to Carl's comment: \\"Plus, his wife was Madonna\\", a reference to the film Evita where Madonna played Eva Perón. Pepe added \\"the part about Madonna—that was too much.\\" Pepe's request for banning the episode was rejected by the Federal Broadcasting Committee of Argentina on freedom of speech grounds. In an unprecedented decision, Fox decided not to air the episode in Hispanic America. In an e-mail sent later to the media, the network said that this decision was based on \\"the possibility that the episode would contribute to reopen wounds very painful to Argentina\\". The Federal Broadcasting Committee made it clear that the episode was not aired in Argentina by Fox's own choice. Nevertheless, some national TV networks in the region (such as Caracol in Colombia, Canal 13 in Chile, Televen in Venezuela and TV Azteca in Mexico) have aired the episode. Finally, on February 19, 2013, Telefe broadcast the episode dubbed in Argentina. FOX Latin America finally aired the episode for the first time on September 6, 2016 after 8 years of censorship, due to the end of Kirchnerism in Argentina and the HD remaster of the episodes.

It is on the banks of the Achigan River, a tributary of the L'Assomption River. According to the town's website, the population is approximately 4,500 and growing steadily as a result of the suburban sprawl in the North Shore of Greater Montreal. History The first settlers arrived near the 1770s and built a flour mill on a township located alongside the Rivière de l'Achigan. The area was located on the northern edges of the first developed lands that were located along both sides of the Saint Lawrence River. In 1787, the Saint-Roch- de-l'Achigan Parish was formed and in 1832, its post office opened, three years after the construction of its first school. In 1845, the parish municipality was established. It was abolished in 1847 when it became part of the County Municipality of Lachenaie, but was reestablished in 1855 as the Parish Municipality of Saint-Roch. In 1921, Saint-Roch lost a part of its territory when the Municipality of Saint-Roch-Ouest was formed. In 1957, it regained its original name when \\"de-l'Achigan\\" was added in order to distinguish it from other places named \\"Saint-Roch\\". In 2006, it changed statutes and became the Municipality of Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan. Transportation The town is accessible via Autoroute 25 which links Laval and Montreal towards the northeastern suburbs including Terrebonne and Mascouche. Since the Olivier-Charbonneau Bridge connecting Montreal and Laval was opened to traffic in 2011, it also has a direct link to the south shore of Montreal and Autoroutes 20 and 40. The municipality is located near the northern terminus of the Autoroute which continues further north via Route 125 towards the Mont-Tremblant Provincial Park north of Saint-Donat and Rawdon.

It served at Frying Pan Shoals, off Cape Fear in North Carolina, for over 30 years. Frying Pan Shoals station In 1854, because of complaints from mariners that the height of the existing Bald Head Lighthouse was inadequate, and the light of its third-order Fresnel lens was not bright enough to warn mariners of the shallow waters of the treacherous Frying Pan Shoals off the coast of Cape Fear in North Carolina, United States, the first lightship was stationed on the shoals,http://www.itpi.dpi.state.nc.us/caroclips/FRYINGPAN.html in lieu of a proposal to improve Bald Point Lighthouse. The Bald Point lighthouse, and others, were turned off during the Civil War to avoid aiding the Northern ships. Lightships remained on station for 110 years. On July 29, 1944, Lieutenant (jg) Clarence Samuels, USCG, became the first Hispanic-American of African descent to command a lightship when he assumed command of Frying Pan. The ship was replaced by a lighttower in 1964. The lighttower, a Texas tower, was manned until 1979, is known as a diving spot and still stands.

Osborne was formerly an auxiliary bishop of the Patriarchate of Moscow from 1991 to 2006 and a titular bishop under the Ecumenical Patriarchate from 2006 to 2010. He was returned to lay status, at his own request, in February 2010 after indicating to the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople that he wished to resume a family life and be free to remarry (having formerly been married and widowed prior to his consecration as a bishop). Osborne held the position of Bishop of Sergievo as a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church and the position of Bishop of Amphipolis within the Ecumenical Patriarchate, in which he served as an assistant bishop in its Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe, charged with the care of its people in Great Britain and Ireland.  Biography  Osborne was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1938, but grew up in the United States. He was introduced to Orthodoxy in 1957 by Father Michael Gelsinger, Professor of Classics at the University at Buffalo, New York. Osborne married his wife, Rachel, in 1962, after a time of service in the US Army. He received his doctorate (in classics) from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1969. His wife died in 1991. Osborne was ordained to the diaconate by Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh (Moscow Patriarchate) in 1969 and priest in 1973, serving the Russian Orthodox Parish of the Annunciation in Oxford. Following his wife's death in 1991 he was consecrated in 1993 as Bishop of Sergievo in the Moscow Patriarchate, to assist Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh. Following Metropolitan Anthony's death in 2003, he was appointed temporary administrator of the Diocese of Sourozh, which position he held until 2006. =Departure from the Russian Orthodox Church: 2006= In 2006, Osborne left the Patriarchate of Moscow and sought reception into the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople - a process which caused much controversy and ecclesiastical friction. After a lengthy dispute between the two patriarchates over the situation and the canonical questions raised by a bishop who seeks entry into a new jurisdiction without release from his current patriarchate, the situation was eventually resolved and Osborne was received into the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a titular bishop with the title of Bishop of Amphipolis. As with all other titular bishops in the Ecumenical Patriarchate who do not have sees, he was technically known as one of the \\"bishops of the throne\\" (i.e. a bishop who serves the patriarchate in a titular manner, rather than being head of a diocese). Osborne's reception into the Ecumenical Patriarchate came at the end of a period of intense controversy.Details and a chronological history . He was forcibly retired from his position as administrator of the Sourozh diocese after seeking incardination into the Ecumenical Patriarchate without receiving release from Moscow. In a letter sent to the Patriarch of Moscow without notice to his clergy, Osborne requested that he and the whole of the Diocese of Sourozh (and not simply the members who wished to follow him) be released from the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate in order to be received into the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch as a new diocese existing alongside Constantinople's Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe.See Osborne's letter of 24 April 2006. On taking this decision without consulting his clergy or diocesan council, see his statements online Without awaiting a full response from the Patriarchate of Moscow, he wrote to the Ecumenical Patriarch on 2 May 2006, again repeating his desire to establish a new diocese under Constantinople.See the text of his brief letter to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In this letter, unlike his original letter to the Moscow Patriarchate, he indicates that the new diocese would be made up of himself, \\"together with those clergy and parishes that wish to follow me.\\" Announcement of Osborne's retirement by the Synod of Moscow followed upon his refusal to withdraw this letter to Constantinople. On 9 May 2006, Patriarch Alexy II issued a decree saying Osborne was relieved of his duties as administrator of the Diocese of Sourozh. On 16 May 2006, Osborne appealed the decision to the Ecumenical Patriarchate on the basis of Canons 9 and 17 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council and also Canon 28 of the same council. Such canons, some argue, endow the Constantinopolitan Patriarch with the privilege of the ekkliton (read, hearing appeal) and grant it jurisdiction over regions not already subject to the other four senior patriarchates, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. This interpretation of these canons is not undisputed and runs contrary to the classical interpretations of the canons found in the canonical commentaries of the Church. Osborne's request to have himself and his diocese received into the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a new diocese was not granted by that body; however, the Ecumenical Patriarchate subsequently accepted him into its jurisdiction on the basis of his appeal which followed, although Moscow had not issued a canonical release and had instructed him not to be received into another patriarchate until matters could be looked into by an appropriate commission. Additionally, it requested his presence in person numerous times, which Osborne refused to heed on all occasions, instructing others to do likewise.As reported by the commission established to investigate the issue. This report also noted Osborne's use of the internet to propagate information on the disputes outside of official channels. Given these circumstances, the Moscow Patriarchate did not regard his incardination into the Ecumenical Patriarchate as valid, nor did it recognise the title \\"Bishop of Amphipolis\\" given to him by the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople on 8 June 2006. Considering him still a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, but in retirement, it referred to him in official correspondence without titular connection, as 'The Right Reverend Bishop Basil (Osborne)'. Similarly, it did not regard as valid the 'letters of release' issued by Osborne to his former clergy in the Diocese of Sourozh - letters either backdated or prepared earlier, in early February. Osborne was summoned to appear before the Moscow Patriarchate synod on 17 July but declined to appear. From 19 July 2006 the Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate placed him under temporary suspension, forbidding him \\"from celebrating divine services until his repentance or until the decision of the matter by a court of bishops\\". The resolutions of the Moscow Patriarchate of 19 July 2006 therefore made Osborne's canonical stature a matter of intense dispute between Moscow and Constantinople. According to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Osborne could legitimately celebrate as a bishop; according to Moscow, he was forbidden to do so. Accordingly, no communicant of the Moscow Patriarchate who wished to remain faithful to the decisions of his hierarchy could knowingly participate in a liturgy at which Osborne celebrated as a bishop, nor could they receive Holy Communion from him. Similarly, after these resolutions, no Moscow Patriarchate priest could concelebrate with Osborne. The patriarchates of Alexandria (19 June 2006) and Jerusalem (June 6), along with the Church of Cyprus (June 14) and the Church of Albania (August 12)—all of whom have close social, ecclesiastical and political ties to the Ecumenical Patriarchate—later confirmed their support of its authority to act in the manner that it had. The ruling archbishop of the Church of Greece publicly \\"deplored\\" Constantinople's decision to accept Osborne into its jurisdiction and in this context expressed regret at both \\"emerging threats to constructive co-operation between local ethnic diasporas\\" and \\"violations of Church order and troubles, harmful primarily to the unity of the Holy Orthodox Churches.\\" In March 2007 negotiations took place in Geneva between representatives of the two patriarchates (Moscow and Constantinople). These concluded with the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate releasing Osborne from its jurisdiction on 27 March. Commenting to the media on the synod's decision, Metropolitan Kyrill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department of External Church Relations, said that \\"The problem arose because Bishop Basil went over to Constantinople without any request from Constantinople and without any consent from the Moscow Patriarchate. Now Constantinople has requested his documents, which customarily include a letter of release. This means that the Moscow Patriarchate has granted Bishop Basil a canonical leave.\\" In response to this, Osborne wrote: ::\\"On Wednesday, 27 March 2007, the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Moscow decided to accede to the request of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and to forward my personal dossier to His Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew. This means that they have accepted the situation as it is, i.e. that I am a bishop in good standing within the Ecumenical Patriarchate and that from their point of view there is no longer any problem about their clergy celebrating with me or with the clergy under me. This is a welcome move - though one that could have been made many months ago. It restores normal relations between the Patriarchates and will make life easier for us all.\\" = Ecumenical Patriarchate: 2006-2009 = As Bishop of Amphipolis, Osborne was appointed assistant bishop within the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Archdiocese of Parishes of the Russian Tradition in Western Europe (i.e. the 'Exarchate'), under the headship of Archbishop Gabriel of Komana. In his brief time as assistant bishop in the Exarchate, Basil's authority was over a newly formed vicariate of parishes in the British Isles who had followed him in his departure from the Russian Orthodox Church into the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This body was given the title Episcopal Vicariate of Great Britain and Ireland, and consisted of some twelve parishes and some smaller Eucharistic Communities (details are disputed: these are enumerated and discussed here). As part of this role, he sat on the council of the Exarchate. The Vicariate, as it existed under its vicar-bishop, was made up of a number of full-time parishes and some parishes and communities that meet less frequently. It was created by an act of the Council of the Archdiocese during an extraordinary meeting held on 9 June 2006, one day after the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople had met (8 June 2006) and issued a statement receiving Bishop Basil of Sergievo into the Patriarchate of Constantinople - an act that caused substantial controversy, as he had not been released from the Moscow Patriarchate.See details under . The same statement gave Bishop Basil the new title, Bishop of Amphipolis (taken from an ancient see in Greece that no longer has a bishop), and charged him with the care of parishes in Great Britain and Ireland, as auxiliary bishop under Archbishop Gabriel of Komana in Paris. At that time, no such parishes existed. After his appointment a number of parishes and communities, as well as some of the clergy and laity of the Diocese of Sourozh, followed Bishop Basil into the Archdiocese and came to constitute the Episcopal Vicariate. Other parishes and communities were formed later, where none had previously existed, for example in Cumbria, and Northampton. Bishop Basil's first liturgical service as a member of the Archdiocese was a concelebration of the Divine Liturgy with Archbishop Gabriel in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Paris on 18 June 2006. Statutes were adopted by the Episcopal Vicariate on 23 June 2007, and the Vicariate was registered as a charity (registration number 1124252) on 29 May 2008. Retirement In 2009, Osborne requested retirement and announced to his local clergy that he would retire at the end of November, giving as his own reasons his age and desire to spend more time with his family. Bishop Basil announced his retirement in a letter to parishioners on 1 September 2009, stating in that letter that he intended to retire on 28 November 2009, the same day that the Archdiocesan Council would meet to, presumably, discuss the Vicariate's future. However, when the Council met on 23 September 2009, under the presidency of Archbishop Gabriel, it moved Bishop Basil's retirement forward, to be effective from 12 October 2009. In its communique No. 05-09 (dated 23 September), it noted that Bishop Basil \\"will not have any further pastoral, liturgical or administrative mission in the Vicariate\\" from his retirement. Archbishop Gabriel made clear that the life of the [Vicariate's] parishes and communities in Great Britain and Ireland \\"are continuing, and that new communities are in formation and the ordinations of new clerics in preparation.\\" Osborne's retirement from active ecclesiastical office was accompanied by retirement as rector of the Parish of the Annunciation in Oxford. The episcopal vicariate that he had formerly headed was changed to the status of a deanery within the archdiocese. Return to lay status In early 2010, Osborne petitioned the Patriarchate of Constantinople for a return to lay status \\"to enable him to have a family home with the possibility of marrying again\\". This petition was granted, although the precise terms of the decree of the Holy Synod bringing about the return to lay status have not been published. Osborne's approach to the Ecumenical Patriarch was effected, at his request, by his ruling archbishop, Gabriel of Comana. On 20 February 2010 Archbishop Gabriel informed members of his archdiocese that the decision to \\"return Bishop Basil to lay status\\" had been made the previous week.

At the height of its production, the HBC employed about 500 men in quarrying and finishing the stone. Most of the skilled workers were Italian, German, and Scotch-Irish immigrants. However, because the nature of the stone made it impossible for the stone to be quarried in the cold of winter, only the skilled workers were kept on during the winter months. Although not as large as the vast brownstone quarries at Portland, Connecticut, the Hummelstown operation was their equal in every respect and a viable competitor of most other brownstone quarries including those at Medina and Moscow, New York.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 2, 2008, and features Topher Grace as guest star and a cameo by radio host Terry Gross. A new troublesome student named Donny arrives at Springfield Elementary School, prompting a gleeful Bart to befriend him as his partner in pranks. Meanwhile, Marge wrecks the family car, and Homer gets a new luxury vehicle as a loaner car, which he grows attached to. The episode is a parody of the 2006 film The Departed. Plot Marge drives Bart and Lisa to school in Homer's car when the children begin fighting. When Marge tries to stop the children from fighting, she crashes into the car of Hans Moleman, who is suffocated by the airbag. Later at school, Bart is shocked to find his seat taken by a new student, named Donny, who was recently kicked out of his former school, which his first in-episode words defame. Donny is a lot like Bart, but with a sharper edge and more grace. While trying to imitate Donny, Bart ends up humiliating himself. Feeling his social rank among his peers slipping, Bart sulks. Meanwhile, Homer has taken his car to get fixed. The Wiseguy informs him of a loaner car, resembling the Cadillac CTS, that he could use in the meantime. The loaner car is significantly better than Homer's old car, and he embraces it, and begins driving it everywhere. One added feature is that it can create a miniature thunderstorm within the vehicle, which happens when \\"the heater fights the air conditioner.\\" The following day, to prove to Donny that he is the head mischief-maker in the school, Bart plays a prank on Principal Skinner, employing magnets and metal sole pads in Skinner's shoes. While on the school stage, the magnets cause Skinner to dance involuntarily and uncontrollably, and ultimately be hurled outside of the school into a container filled with old retainers. Bart regains the respect and admiration of his peers, but when Skinner attempts to find who is responsible, Donny takes the blame for Bart's prank, leading Bart to accept him as a friend. However, when Skinner takes Donny to his office, Donny is revealed to be in fact an informant hired by Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers to get Bart suspended -- the first informant on Bart to go undiscovered (after failed attempts utilizing Üter Zörker, Ralph Wiggum and \\"Doug the hip guidance counselor\\"). Blissfully unaware of the new kid's other side, Bart invites Donny into his clique alongside Nelson Muntz and Milhouse Van Houten, and they plot school pranks. To signify Donny's entrance into the group, Bart rewards him with Blue Vine licorice sticks, which he claims are only sold in Europe and turn the eater's tongue blue, and the now-augmented group begins their friendship by spraying Lisa (and each other) with juice. Homer takes Marge out on a romantic evening cruise. Then the Wiseguy calls Homer, informing him that his old car is ready to be picked up. Homer, however, refuses to give up his luxury car. At the school, Bart is perplexed when Skinner repeatedly anticipates and foils his pranks. Groundskeeper Willie informs Bart that a snitch is among them, but after a lengthy montage depicting an ultimately failed chase after the rat, Bart wrongly suspects Milhouse, not noticing Donny's apparent nervousness. With the aid of Nelson and Donny, Bart has Milhouse imprisoned in a locker, which Cletus subsequently mistakes for an outhouse using Milhouse as a \\"robo-potty.\\" With Milhouse indisposed, Bart plans a final prank on Skinner involving pelting his house with ostrich eggs. The next day, while helping Skinner hang up a banner (which reads “SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY: PRANK-FREE FOR 14 DAYS”), Bart notices that Skinner's tongue is blue. Bart figures out that the snitch is Donny, who had given Skinner the Blue Vines. While driving past the car dealer with Lisa, Homer sees the Wiseguy selling his car for $99. Homer realizes that his car is like his child and furiously barges into the scene to take it back, abandoning the loaner car and almost leaving Lisa, whom he mistakenly calls Maggie, behind. At midnight, Bart, Nelson and Donny go to the school storage building, where Willie lets them in. Donny asks why the change in plans was necessitated, and Bart promptly denounces a nervous Donny as the rat and Nelson grabs him. Donny pleads with Bart, explaining how he was claimed from an orphanage in Shelbyville by Skinner and Chalmers. Touched but unmoved, Bart still plans to place him in Skinner's office, where he and Nelson will mix Diet Coke and Mentos, of which they have a huge amount. They are interrupted by the arrival of Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner (toting a video camera), and Willie, who has snitched on Bart in exchange for something he could never give him: an elementary school diploma. After Nelson runs out the door, Chalmers tells Bart he will be sent to the toughest juvenile detention center there is (disregarding his earlier statement that Bart's punishment will be 10 days' suspension from school, the stiffest disciplinary action that can legally be taken against him). Donny then feels guilty, as Bart was the only person who ever cared for him. As Skinner leads Bart away, Donny shoves the crates of Mentos into the Diet Coke, causing the fizzy explosion. The two boys escape through the roof as Skinner, Chalmers, and Willie are caught in the explosion. Bart and Donny shake hands and Donny leaves, telling Bart he will always remember their friendship, and they promise to meet up with each other sometime in the future. The episode ends with Ralph in a trash can as a rat runs across a fence, and Ralph cheerfully remarks \\"the rat symbolizes obviousness!\\" explicitly referring to the very last scene of The Departed. Cultural references * The title and plot of the episode reference the 2006 film The Departed and the episode contains several elements of the film, including the use of the Dropkick Murphys song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\", Donny's attire being similar to what Leonardo DiCaprio wears for parts of the film, Bart suspecting he is being sabotaged just as Jack Nicholson's character began to suspect he had a mole in his criminal crew, a minor event in the story leading to someone figuring out who is betraying them, and Principal Skinner employing Donny in Bart's crew just as Martin Sheen's character does with DiCaprio's character. The scene where Bart is chasing Donny through the school and the playground was an exact replica of the scene in the film where DiCaprio chases Matt Damon through the city streets. The episode also ends with the appearance of a rat, just like the film does. * Topher Grace's character Donny is visually inspired (in both facial features and clothing) by the Marvel Comics character Eddie Brock, who Grace played in the 2007 film Spider-Man 3. * Bart references the infamous Diet Coke and Mentos eruption by doing the same stunt on a larger scale. * Homer's loaner car closely resembles a Cadillac CTS. * Lisa is reading a book called The Joy of Sax, which is a parody of the book, The Joy of Sex. * As Marge and Homer take a drive, D'Angelo's cover of Smokey Robinson's \\"Cruisin'\\" can be heard. * Homer improvises the song he sings to himself in the loaner car to the tune of \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" by Yes. * When Willie and Skinner play basketball, Skinner refers to himself as \\"Air\\" Skinner, a play on Michael Jordan's sobriquet. * Bart gives Donny Blue Vines, which are a reference to Red Vines. * The table and cooler in Bart's treehouse are the same table and cooler used in Eric Forman's basement in That '70s Show, a reference to Topher Grace guest starring. Reception The episode had an estimated 7.86 million viewers and received a 9 percent audience share. Richard Keller of TV Squad enjoyed the episode and liked the fact that it focused on Bart. \\"I enjoyed this episode more than the usual ones that have aired during this post-Simpsons Movie season. There were plenty of good moments and a few of them that I actually laughed at.\\" Robert Canning of IGN said, \\"This was a fun and funny episode.\\" He thought Homer's loaner car scenes were \\"just silly enough to make an impact.\\" Canning thought both Topher Grace and Terry Gross did great jobs with their parts. He gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10. Joel H. Cohen was nominated for Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for writing the episode. He was also nominated for an Annie Award nomination for Best Writing in an Animated Television Production.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 17, 2008, three days after Valentine's Day. It includes three self-contained stories about romance. The three tales are parodies of Bonnie and Clyde, Lady and the Tramp and Sid and Nancy. Plot The episode begins on a Valentine's Day afternoon. As a Valentine's Day treat, Homer takes Marge to a carnival, where they leave the kids in order to spend the day with one another in the Tunnel of Love. Inside, the two enjoy each other's company; however, Bart attempts to spoil his parents' happiness by filling the water with Jell-O, causing Homer and Marge's boat to stop. Trapped, Homer decides to pass time by telling Marge the story of Bonnie and Clyde. =Bonnie and Clyde= In 1933, during the Great Depression, Bonnie Parker (Marge) rejects a man trying to get her attention (Cletus), saying she is looking for someone exciting. Clyde Barrow (Homer) then arrives, and after robbing a store (which he ironically co-owns with his father), the two run off. Clyde discovers Bonnie's passion is violence, and the two go on a crime spree by robbing banks. After tricking a citizen (Flanders) into helping them, the two garner intense popularity across the country. The citizen they tricked soon realizes what had happened, and snitches to the police after learning they are an unmarried couple. The Texas officers soon arrive, and the cops gun Bonnie and Clyde down. While being shot, Bonnie tells Clyde that she is looking for a man with more excitement, and that they would never have been together. Back at the Tunnel of love, Bart and Lisa arrive at Homer and Marge's boat, and want them to tell a child- friendly story. Marge tells the story of Shady and the Vamp. =Shady and the Vamp= Vamp (Marge) is a royal and luxurious female dog. Shady (Homer) is in love with Vamp and eyes her from a distance, vowing that he will win her. After Shady is trampled by a mob of children, Vamp comforts him, and he asks her out for dinner. The two go to Luigi's, where, after a romantic pasta dinner (Except for the part were Shady nearly swallows Vamp over a string of spaghetti), the two run off onto a hill when the health inspector comes. In the morning, Vamp wakes up with nauseous feelings, and Shady leaves her, claiming that a fox hunter is near, knowing she is actually pregnant. In a musical number entitled \\"Any Minute Now\\" (featuring canine versions of Lenny, Carl and Barney backing up for Shady), the two dogs await for one another's return, though the cats living with a now-pregnant Vamp (Patty and Selma) convince her that Shady would never come back, whilst the dog who is friends with Shady (Moe) convinces him that he should stay with them rather than be \\"stuck\\" with Vamp and their puppies. Two of her puppies (Bart and Lisa) decide to go look for their father, and after being kidnapped by the dog catcher (Groundskeeper Willie), Shady arrives to save his children. Shady returns them home and reunites with Vamp, choosing to stay with her, but then Vamp informs Shady that there were actually nine other puppies in the litter (all of whom resemble Bart and Lisa with the exception of one, who resembles Maggie). When Homer eventually gets bored with Marge's story, Bart tells the story of Sid and Nancy. =Sid and Nancy= Nancy Spungen (Lisa), a young model student, walks into a rock concert by the Sex Pistols with her friend Milhouse, where she is enamored by the eccentric bassist, Sid Vicious (Nelson). After viewing him throw his bass at a fan at his concert, she decides to go after him. A chocolate dealer (Otto), who is in fact an undercover policeman and arrests Nancy's friend (Milhouse) shortly afterwards, sells her a chocolate bar which she gives to Sid, who soon begins dating her. As shown in a montage, the two begin having their lives spiraled out of control while gaining a chocolate addiction. Sid soon begins ditching the Sex Pistols, angering lead singer Johnny Rotten (Bart) and guitarist Steve Jones (Jimbo). Sid arrives in the middle of a performance after a major chocolate spree, and knocks into an amplifier which topples over and crushes their drummer, Paul Cook (Dolph). Nancy arrives to defend Sid, and informs the Pistols that Sid does not need them, and the two go off trying to sing a soft type of music, performing at CBGB (Comic Book Guy's Bar). When they are kicked out for playing music against everything that punk rock represents (which, according to the Comic Book Guy, is nothing), the two decide to go back to their addiction and kiss in the alley as garbage (emptied by Homer) rains down on them. Homer wishes everyone a Happy Valentine's Day and to \\"shut your gob.\\" Cultural references * The title of the episode is a take-off of Love, American Style. * The song played at the beginning of the episode is \\"L-O-V-E\\" by Nat King Cole. * In the Bonnie and Clyde segment, the radio actors performing \\"The Bonnie and Clyde Hour\\" are drawn to resemble George Burns and Gracie Allen.

Censorship This episode was first broadcast in the UK and Ireland on Sky1 on December 21, 2008 at 9.30pm. It was the second episode of The Simpsons to be broadcast after the watershed hour (after Weekend at Burnsie's) because the adult content was deemed too strong to be shown before then. Particularly in the Sid and Nancy story, where several scenes depict Nelson and Lisa ingesting chocolate as if it were an illegal substance and one scene where Bart repeatedly sings the word \\"bollocks\\", and the end of the Bonnie and Clyde story where Homer and Marge are shot countless times and do not bleed or die. It has since been repeated on Channel 4, where it was heavily edited. The Bonnie and Clyde section ends just as the police begin firing at the car, missing Bonnie's final comments to Clyde. The Shady and the Vamp section cuts the scene where the Goofy-like character enters the gas chamber, although he is seen in the dog pound. The Sid and Nancy section was also edited in a way that was similar to the edits in the Sky1 broadcast. Reception 7.81 million viewers watched this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad enjoyed the episode. He said that, \\"This time around they seemed to focus on the stories themselves rather than overload them with gags as they tend to do. The result were some pretty nice stories.\\" His favorite was the second story. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode \\"left out the fun and funny\\". Canning said the Bonnie and Clyde segment \\"Jokes, were far from fast and furious\\" and that the segment \\"had no punch\\". The \\"Shady and the Vamp\\" story, \\"Was what you'd expect, and the lack of surprise made the whole thing quite boring.\\" Canning thought, \\"The best was saved for last\\" on Bart's retelling of the Sex Pistols and Sid Vicious. He went on to say, \\"This segment really did contain the best throwaway gags...But overall, the segment wasn't funny enough to redeem the two bland installments that came before it.\\" Canning gave the episode a 5.5 out of 10.

The band's name (which has been described as \\"ludicrous\\") was reportedly inspired by the Tom Hanks film Joe Versus the Volcano, though the band has never revealed the inspiration for the name. History The band's beginnings can be traced back to 1998. At the time, Mark Duplass was touring the country in support of his solo debut, Small Hands. This earned him a record deal with Mercury Records. After another solo release, Duplass moved from Austin to New York City to pursue his music career. Shortly after arriving in New York, Duplass was diagnosed with tendinitis in both of his arms, and was told that playing the guitar would further aggravate his injury. Wanting to remain in music, Duplass enrolled in City College of New York to study composition. He turned to playing the organ as it was the only instrument which he was able to play pain-free. Duplass returned to Texas in late 2002 to record songs he had written. This resulted in Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!'s debut EP, Carbon Copy. The Austin Chronicle favorably compared \\"The New Brad\\" from Carbon Copy to Rufus Wainwright. While touring to support this release, the band was noticed by Polyvinyl, who released the group's full-length eponymous debut. The band drew inspiration from acts such as Elvis Costello, Guided By Voices, Death Cab For Cutie, Beulah and Wilco, according to Duplass. Rumors of a reunion have circulated throughout Brooklyn in 2010. Other pursuits In addition to their activities with Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!, the individual band members have collaborated with other artists. Craig Montoro contributed to Mates of State's 2003 release Team Boo as well as Sufjan Stevens's Illinois in 2005. Duplass has written, produced, and starred in many films such as Humpday and Cyrus and starred in the FX sitcom The League.

Loosely connected to Newman's The Quorum, Life's Lottery is written in second-person and invites the reader to assume the role of the protagonist, an Englishman named Keith Marion, and make decisions that determine the character's life and death. Because Life's Lottery can be read not only as a standard novel but also in a traditional gamebook format, it is often classified as a \\"Choose Your Own Adventure book for adults\\". Plot summary Life's Lottery opens speculating on the question of free will and predestination. The reader is invited to decide for themselves which philosophy to follow in reading the book and then is presented with Keith's birth in England on October 4, 1959. Keith is raised in England by a successful banker and has, as the author points out, \\"been dealt a better hand than many\\". The boy is spoiled by his parents and enters primary school shy and timid. The book offers its first choice on the first day, when Keith is confronted and teased by a gang. The consequences of the choice - \\"Napoleon Solo or Illya Kuryakin?\\" - set Keith on a path that determines his lifelong friends, enemies, and opportunities. Following this key point, the plot paths diverge wildly, and range from Keith winning the lottery, becoming a distinguished novelist, making a bomb threat, having an incestuous affair, committing a murder, and making a deal with the Devil. =Non-interactive= Should the reader decide to disregard the novel's interactive nature and read through it as any other book, he is presented with both immediate outcomes of the first decision and perspective then switches to the two doctors who are observing Keith; one confirms that this is Keith Marion, \\"of Marion syndrome\\", and the other remarks that although he is in a coma, he looks \\"quite ordinary\\", considering his symptoms. The rest of the novel includes every possible scenario that the reader could encounter, all of them playing out in Keith's mind. The stream of thought is occasionally interrupted by another scene with the doctors, each of which slowly leaks information to the reader, who eventually learns that he is not assuming the role of a man named Keith Marion. Rather, the protagonist is a woman named Marion Keith, who, in her coma, spends her time speculating on what her life might be like had she been born a man. Eventually, she settles on an outcome in which she is a man laboring for a living in Tibet. 1999 British novels English novels Psychological novels 1999 science fiction novels 1999 speculative fiction novels Novels by Kim Newman Simon & Schuster books ","title":"Life's Lottery"},{"id":"13279133","text":"A Drunkard's Reformation is a 1909 American drama film directed by D. W. Griffith. Prints of the film survive in the film archive of the Library of Congress. Biograph advertised the feature as \\"The most powerful temperance lecture ever depicted\\". Plot John Wharton, the husband of a true and trusting wife and father of an eight-year-old girl, through the association of rakish companions becomes addicted to the drink habit, and while the demon rum has not fastened its tentacles firmly, there is no question that given free rein the inevitable would culminate in time. Arriving home one afternoon in a wine besotted condition, he is indeed a terrifying spectacle to his little family. Later, after he has slept off the effects to some extent, while at supper, the little girl shows him two tickets for the theater, begging him to take her. After some persuasion he consents to go. The play is a dramatization of Émile Zola's L'Assommoir, which shows how short a journey it is from peace and happiness to woe and despair by the road of rum. At the final curtain of the play, he is a changed man, going homeward with a firm determination that he will drink no more, which he promises his wife upon his return. Two years later we find the little family seated, happy and peaceful, at the fireside and we know that the promise has been kept. ::Moving Picture World (1909) Cast A Drunkard's Reformation * Arthur V.

Dehl proposed \\"that they bring the Reverend Billy Sunday to Moline and have him preach the best sermon in the list, and they bring a great temperance lecturer here and instruct him to make his best effort\\". Dehl said once they had left, he would put on two reels of film at his theater, and if the public does not vote one of them a greater temperance sermon than what the speaker had delivered, and the other a greater religious appeal than the sermon by Sunday, he would donate the money to a local hospital. The films he had referred for showing were The Drunkard's Reformation and The Resurrection. Variety reported that Biograph had received a letter from an exhibitor in an Iowa town, stating that when the film was shown there, it had caused the town to \\"go dry\\" at the election which occurred the week after it had been featured.

It is on the Machars peninsula, in the traditional county of Wigtownshire. The parish is about in length, varying in breadth from , and contains . The Parish It is thought that the name derives from the Saxon for \\"bare hill\\". It is located near Whithorn and includes the village of Monreith, the area called Kirkmaiden and two mansions, namely Glasserton Park and Physgill, together with Woodfall Gardens. The Statistical Account remarks that the church \\"stands near to Glasserton-House, and is romantically embosomed in wood, which sheds around it a vernerable gloom, as if it were a druidical temple, or the sacred grove of some Syrian idol.\\"Statistical Account of Scotland, vol 5, page 401; republished 1983 Legend has it that Saint Ninian, otherwise called Saint Ringan, the first Bishop of Galloway, lived for a while in a cave near Physgill by way of penitence, and he was the founder of Whithorn Abbey. Loch and sea fishing are available, and the area is a haven for birdwatchers and wildlife enthusiasts. Low Knock on the outskirts of the village is an open farm where one can see the otters, ornamental ducks, and cattle. Kirkmaiden-in-Fernis, otherwise Kirkmaiden Church, now a ruin, stood at Lag Point in the Glasserton side of Monreith Bay south. The restored chancel is the burial vault of the Maxwells of Monreith including the historian and naturalist Sir Herbert Maxwell. In 1761 Rev. James Laing was Minister of Glasserton and Kirkmaiden-in-Fernis. Maxwell's Otter. The memorial to Gavin Maxwell - Maxwell's Otter looks over Front Bay Near the church is the bronze otter, sculpted by Penny Wheatley, standing as a memorial to Gavin Maxwell, the author of the book Ring of Bright Water, which was made into a successful film. Gavin Maxwell was often seen exercising his tame otter, about which he wrote his book, on the beach below the Kirkmaiden church. There is a signposted walk from the southern end of the village at Clarksburn giving an extensive view of Monreith Bay to Gavin Maxwell's otter. Monreith Monreith was called \\"Milltown of Monreith\\" so named by the watermills driven by the waterpower of Monreith Burn. Kirkmaiden church was one of the oldest churches in Scotland and the resting place of many of the McCulloch and Maxwell family members who had owned the Monreith estate. Legend has it that when this parish was united with Glasserton, the pulpit and bell were removed from Kirkmaiden church and were to be transported by sea across Luce Bay to a church of the same name in Kirkmaiden Parish in Rhins, Wigtownshire. A strange storm blew up and the boat foundered, sinking the pulpit and bell. The story goes that on the approaching death of any descendant of the McCullochs of Myrton, the wraith-bell rang from the depths of Luce Bay. The church is opposite the car park of St. Medans Golf Club. In the 1870s Monreith Estate covered about and was partly in Glasserton and partly in the Mochrum area. Monreith House, still owned by the Maxwell family, is surrounded by woodlands, and looks towards the White Loch of Myrton in Mochrum area. The original home of the Maxwells was the tower house known as the \\"Dowies\\" behind the Fell of Barhullion, the highest point overlooking Monreith Village. When the Fell was owned by the Maxwell family, a member of the family boasted that he owned a Fell from which five kingdoms could be seen on a clear day, the kingdoms of Scotland, England, Ireland, Mann, and finally, the Kingdom of Heaven. The Dowies, or Old Place of Monreith, now owned by the Landmark Trust, has been renovated. It may also have been known as Moure Castle or Mowir or Mowr Castle. Monreith has sandy beaches, quite rare on this section of the Galloway coastline, with safe swimming areas, rock pools and some interesting caves, one of which is streaked red and known as the \\"Butcher's Cave\\". The remains of a man-made flounder pool can be found at the extreme end of the Black Rocks sands and was built to catch flounders as the tide receded; at Ben Buoy, which is a sheer rock face, an interesting cave allows a very careful person to cross through the cliff and emerge in a small bay between Knock Farm and Cairndoon farm. On 16 December 1617 Joanni Kennedie junior de Blairquhan and his wife Marie Stewart had \\"baroniam de Remistoun\\" & fortalicio and lands of Lochtoun alias Remistoun. This was also known as Ravenstone, Ravinstone and Remeston. On 26 October 1625 Alexander Macdouell de Machrimoir (Machermore) was heir of his father Petri Macdouell de Machrimoir, to land in \\"parochia de Glassertoun\\". On 14 July 1662 James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Galloway, had a charter no.278 in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, vol. XI p. 140, for many lands including the 8 merkland of Bordland of Ravinstoun, with the castle, etc., (Baroniam de Remistoun) the 4 merklands of Bowtoun of Ravinstoun, the 4 merk lands of Grenan in the parish of Glassertoun; and the 4 merk lands of Barledyon, 4 merklands of Culkae, 8 merklands of Doweltoun alias Dowellistoun alias Machir-Stewart (of McDowell of Machermore ?), 4 merklands of Culnog, in the parish of Sorbie. Ravenston or Castle Stewart, of W. Stewart Esq., is shown on Ainslie's 1782 map as being in the north-west Glasserton area. Woodfall (Glasserton) house, park and gardens were built on the large estate on the orders of the Honourable Admiral Keith Stewart, the second surviving son of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway who was given the \\"Barony of Glasserton\\" in 1767. The Statistical Account gives in 1795 a detailed description of his agricultural improvements, based on continued raising of the traditional black cattle.Statistical Account of Scotland , vol 5, pages 398-400; republished 1983 He died in 1795, and was succeeded by his son, Rt Hon James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie, but the house was let and the contents were sold. He sold the house and grounds in 1819 to Stair Hathorn-Stewart at the neighbouring Physgill estate. That which is now called \\"Woodfall Gardens\\" was a part of the Glasserton and Physgill estate which was sold some thirty years ago and are now on show to the public. On the 1782 map Robert Stewart Esq. was at Physgill near Kidsdale, just south of Adm. Keith Stewart of Glasserton. Just south of Physgill in Whithorn area was Tonorghie of Hugh Stewart Esq. Carleton, Glasserton, of MacCairill is mentioned in \\"History of the Lands and Their Owners in Galloway\\" by Peter Handyside M'Kerlie, vol. 1, p. 334 Archaeology Archaeological and Historical Collections relating to Ayrshire and Galloway reported that there were four ancient forts in Glasserton: #Fell of Barhullion Hill fort has two concentric ditches and banks with entrances in the south and north. The site on the photo is viewed from one of the Cup & Ring marked rocks in the area. (NX3641: Cup & Ring marked stone, Fell of Barhullion) #Near Carleton there was a fort, \\"Laggan Camp hill fort\\" #There are ruins at Port Castle #Glasserton Hill Mote fort or settlement at NX43NW 2, situated partly within Broad Lane Wood. Cup and ring markings can be found at Glasserton Mains and various locations near Monreith. The area is renowned for several groups of Standing Stones, thought to date back to 2000BC. Historic Scotland funded the excavation of archaeological remains at Blairbuy Farm. While ploughing, a large stone was unearthed that turned out to be the capstone from a cist burial. Three cists were found and one contained the remains of a skeleton. The cists are likely to date from the Bronze Age some 3-4,000 years ago when nearby monuments Drumtroddan standing stones and the Wren’s Egg were erected. On the shortest day of the year, if you stand on top of The Wren's Egg, a standing stone at Blairbuy Farm, Monreith, the sun will set directly behind Big Scaur ( \\"Scaur\\" meaning \\"isolated rock in the sea\\") which is situated out in Luce Bay. On every other day it sets further west.

In Early Christianity lamps, fire and light are conceived as symbols, if not as visible manifestations, of the divine nature and the divine presence. In the Christian world view Christ is the true Light,John i. 9. and Christians are viewed as children of Light at perpetual war with the powers of darkness. There is no evidence of any ceremonial use of lights in Christian worship during its first two centuries. It is recorded,Acts xx. 7, 8. that on the occasion of St. Paul's preaching at Alexandria in Troas there were many lights in the upper chamber; but this was at night. And the most that can be hazarded is that a specially large number were lighted as a festive illumination, as in modern Church festivals.Martigny, Did. des antiqs~. C/fret. As to a purely ceremonial use, such early evidence as exists is all the other way. TertullianA pal. xxxv. writes of the Christian practice during the 2nd century; \\"on days of rejoicing, he says, we do not shade our door- posts with laurels nor encroach upon the day-light with lamp laurels\\" (die lacto non laurels pastes obumbramus nec lucernis diem infringimus). Lactantius, writing early in the 4th century, is even more sarcastic in his references to the heathen practice. They kindle lights, he says, as though to one who is in darkness. Can he be thought sane who offers the light of lamps and candles to the Author and Giver of all light? .Divinarum Institutionum vi. de vero cultu, cap. 2, in Migne, Patrologia Latina vi. 637. This is primarily an attack on votive lights, and does not necessarily exclude their ceremonial use in other ways. There is, indeed, evidence that they were so used before Lactantius wrote. The 34th canon of the Synod of Elvira (305), which was contemporary with him, forbade candles to be lit in cemeteries during the daytime, which points to an established custom as well as to an objection to it; and in the Roman catacombs lamps have been found of the 2nd and 3rd centuries which seem to have been ceremonial or symbolical.J. Toutain, in Daremberg and Saglio, Diaionnaire, s.v. Roman oil lamp, around 200 A.D., underside, showing crosses. Again, according to the Acta of St Cyprian (d. 258), his body was borne to the grave praelucentibus cereis, and Prudentius, in his hymn on the 2nd and martyrdom of St Lawrence,Peristeph. ii. 71, in Migne, centuries. Patr. Lat. lx. 300. says that in the time of St Laurentius, i.e. the middle of the 3rd century, candles stood in the churches of Rome on golden candelabra. The gift, mentioned by Anastasius,in Sylv. made by Constantine to the Vatican basilica, of a pharum of gold, garnished with 500 dolphins each holding a lamp, to burn before St Peters tomb, points also to a custom well established before Christianity became the state religion. It is difficult to determine early Christian customs regarding lamps, due to services being held primarily at night. By the close of the 4th century the ceremonial use of lights had become firmly and universally established in the Church. This is clear, to pass by much other evidence, from the controversy of St Jerome with Vigilantius. Vigilantius, a presbyter of Barcelona, still occupied the position of Tertullian and Lactantius in this matter. We see, he wrote, a rite peculiar to the pagans introduced into the churches on pretext of religion, and, while the sun is still shining, a mass of wax tapers lighted. ... A great honor to the blessed martyrs, whom they think to illustrate with contemptible little candles (de pilissimis cereolis). Jerome, the most influential theologian of the day, took up the cudgels against Vigilantius, who, in spite of his fatherly admonition, had dared again to open his foul mouth and send forth a filthy stink against the relics of the holy martyrs.Hier. Ep. cix. al. 53 ad Ripuarium Presbyt., in Migne, Patr. Lat. p. 906. If candles are lit before their tombs, are these the ensigns of idolatry? In his treatise contra VigilantiumPatr. Lat. t. xxiii. he answers the question with much common sense. There can be no harm if ignorant and simple people or religious women, light candles in honor of the martyrs. We are not born, but reborn, Christians, and that which when done for idols was detestable is acceptable when done for the martyrs. As in the case of the woman with the precious box of ointment, it is not the gift that merits reward, but the faith that inspires it. As for lights in the churches, he adds that in all the churches of the East, whenever the gospel is to be read, lights are lit, though the sun be rising (jam sole rutilante), not in order to disperse the darkness, but as a visible sign of gladness (ad signum ketitiae demonstrandum). Taken in connection with a statement which almost immediately precedes this Cereos autem non clara luce accendimus, sicut frustra calumniaris: sed ut noctis tenebras hoc solatio temperemus , this seems to point to the fact that the ritual use of lights in the church services, so far as already established, arose from the same conservative habit as determined the development of liturgical vestments, i.e. the lights which had been necessary at the nocturnal meetings were retained, after the hours of service had been altered, and invested with a symbolical meaning. Already they were used at most of the conspicuous functions of the Church. Paulinus, bishop of Nola (d. 431), describes the altar at the eucharist as crowned with crowded lights, and even mentions the eternal lamp. For their use at baptisms we have, among much other evidence, that of Zeno of Verona for the West, and that of Gregory of Nazianzus for the East. Their use at funerals is illustrated by Eusebius's description of the burial of Constantine, and Jerome's account of that of Saint Paula. At ordinations they were used, as is shown by the 6th canon of the Council of Carthage (398), which decrees that the acolyte is to hand to the newly ordained deacon ceroferarium cum cereo. This symbolism was not pagan, i.e. the lamps were not placed in the graves as part of the furniture of the dead; in the Catacombs they are found only in the niches of the galleries and the arcosolia, nor can they have been votive in the sense popularized later.

His older brother Tan Chu Boon was arrested and charged on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but 'subversive' tombstone, which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause. The story of the case was later taken up in London by The Sunday Times a few months after the trial, making the case an internationally known issue.Brazil, \\"The End of a Movement\\", pp. 234–245. History The Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF), an organisation of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), was formed in 1968 to support the overthrow of the governments of Singapore and Malaysia. The countries had been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the armed struggle included planting booby trap bombs in public places.Soh, \\"Phoenix: Innovation and Modernisation (1970–2000)\\", pp. 93–94. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand. In 1976, after a prolonged investigation, Singapore's Internal Security Department arrested hundreds of MNLF members together with many documents, arms and explosives in a sting operation in Singapore. Twenty- three members were released after interrogation, seventeen were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and ten turned over to the Malaysian police for suspected involvement in terrorist activities in Malaysia. =Tan Chay Wa= A bird's eye view of Pudu Prison in Malaysia Tan Chay Wa (1948–1983), a political dissident and a senior official of the MNLF, managed to escape from Singapore to Malaysia as the ISD officers closed in on him. Chay Wa was a bus driver and a married man living in Singapore. On 2 June 1979, Chay Wa was arrested at a vegetable farm in Johor; he had a .32 Llama semi-automatic pistol and seven bullets in his possession. He was convicted under Malaysia's Essential Security Cases (Amendment) Regulations (ESCAR) by Johor Bahru's High Court, which provides for a mandatory death penalty. During his detention, there was an offer by the Government of Belgium to grant him political asylum should he be allowed to leave Malaysia.Gunn, \\"Death and the State in Malaysia\\", p. 119. but he was hanged on 18 January 1983 in Kuala Lumpur's Pudu Prison. Chay Wa's body was brought back to Singapore by his older brother, Tan Chu Boon. Chu Boon arranged for his brother's body to be buried in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery on 20 January 1983. However, Chu Boon was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Secret Society Investigation Branch at his flat on 28 May 1983 on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but subversive tombstone, which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause. ='Subversive' tombstone trial= At his November 1983 trial, Chu Boon argued in court that he was neither a communist nor did he have political leanings of any kind; he did not monitor or even read the proposed inscription handed to him on a piece of paper by his brother's widow, which was given to the tombstone inscriber.Brazil, \\"Story of a short life\\", p. 235. The inscription in Chinese, written in emotive language, read: The court then heard that the CID started investigating the tombstone on 11 May 1983 and had seized the original piece of paper from the tombstone-maker's shop in Choa Chu Kang.Brazil, \\"The Trial of Tan Chay Wa\\", pp. 236–237. Chu Boon's defence lawyer was J.B. Jeyaretnam who had long been a consistent thorn in the side of Singapore's political establishment. Jeyaretnam established that the instigation for the CID investigation and arrest had come from \\"a government department\\". In mitigation, Jeyaretnam made the point that, apart from immediate family and friends, the public would not have known about the 'subversive' tombstone nor its inscription in Singapore's biggest cemetery. The court threw out Chu Boon's defence plea and he was convicted on grounds that he had \\"under his control, the tombstone of his brother, Tan Chay Wa, on which was engraved in Chinese characters an inscription which tended to advocate acts prejudicial to the security of Singapore.\\" He was sentenced to a year in jail; on appeal this was reduced to a month. =Unintended publicity= The court case hearing of Chu Boon had one unintended consequence; it made Chay Wa much better known to the public than he may otherwise have been. As a result, the story was later taken up in London by The Sunday Times a few months after the trial, making the case internationally known and depicting the Singapore government in a hostile manner. Robust \\"don't interfere in our internal affairs\\" retorts soon emerged from government circles. When the public debates were over, the case was not completely forgotten. In his 1986 book The Tiger and the Trojan Horse, British author Dennis Bloodworth noted that \\"the ideograms in stone, chiselled by a sentient hand, were proof that this was the epitaph of a man, not a movement.\\" The tombstone today Chay Wa's grave is in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery's Buddhist sector, grave number 3222, Block 8. It is difficult to locate, as it stands in a sea of tombstones that stretch almost as far as the eye can see. In 1985, it was reported that the inscription of the tombstone had been whited out with plaster by members of Tan's own family who wished to obscure any glorification of Chay Wa's \\"martyrdom\\" in the communist cause. At that time, all that could be seen clearly was a photograph of Chay Wa and some lettering showing his name and the years of his birth and death.

It educates primary and secondary school-age children and adults and has a sixth form. History =Grammar school= It was founded in 1938 as Preston Manor County Grammar School and its first headteacher was Mr W.P. Bannister. He remained headmaster until his death in 1963. It provided a traditional grammar school curriculum with science and languages streams. The school motto was \\"Munus prae jure\\" which may be translated as \\"Duty before right\\". =Comprehensive= It became a Technology College in 1993. =Preston Manor as a Science College= Preston Manor was amongst the first cohort of schools nationally to become a specialist Science College in 2002 with Mathematics as an additional specialism. Science and Maths achievement have increased dramatically and continue to improve since becoming a specialist college. Results for both subjects are significantly above the National Average across all key stages. It has four local primary partner schools in the borough that it works with throughout the year as part of its specialist science community work. Pupils at Ark Academy, Oakington Manor, Byron Court, Preston Park and Wembley Manor pay regular visits to its laboratories or receive outreach lessons from its trained science teachers. It also works closely with its secondary community partners, JFS and the KS3 Pupil Referral Unit pupil to provide an enriched and motivating curriculum for their students. It is continuing to develop its community work, offering workshops to parents and members of the local community on Science and Health related issues. =Academy= The school converted to academy status in February 2013. Academic results Over the past five years, achievement of students at Key Stage 3 have been consistently above the national average in all three core subjects. At Key Stage 4 the percentage of students achieving 5 or more A* to C grades at GCSE has risen steadily over the past 3 years (from 70% in 2004 to 74% in 2006). The percentage of students achieving 5 or more A* to G grades has remained steady over the same period (at 98% or 99%). In summer 2006 it achieved its highest ever examination successes at GCSE and Post 16, putting Preston Manor in the top 25% of schools nationally. As a result of the innovative practice within the school, it hosted over ten visits for educationalists from the Department for Education and Skills (including the Secretary of State) and other schools to showcase good practice in raising achievement with African-Caribbean boys, whole school literacy and most importantly the personalisation of education. It gets the second best GCSE and A-level results in Brent, with well-above average results, although the GCSE results are better than those at A-level. The best in Brent is JFS, which gets results similar to a grammar school. =Ofsted Reports= In November 2005, Ofsted judged the school to be outstanding overall, recognising Preston Manor as a forward-thinking school, whose commitment and level of care to students is outstanding. In recognition of its consistently high standards, it gained High Performing Specialist School status and was asked to take on a second specialism, which will add to its already extensive collaborative work with local primary and secondary schools. Preston Manor has now started to teach food technology with Mr DT. These options will be available to choose from GCSE options in many more years to come. Expansion As of September 2008 Preston Manor began admitting forty more students into its cohort. To facilitate this the school needed to expand. Work began in January 2008 on a £4.5 million project which will see a new teaching block and a 4 court sports hall built, amongst other new facilities.

Club career =Early career= Worgan began his career by coming through the youth ranks at Wimbledon and was one of a few players to stay with the squad during the move to become Milton Keynes Dons. However, he never managed to establish himself there and spent two weeks on loan at Wycombe Wanderers during the 2003–04 season when they suffered a goalkeeper injury crisis with Steve Williams, Frank Talia, and Tom Gott all out injured. In August 2004 he joined Rushden & Diamonds on a free transfer but again failed to establish himself and at the end of the year he was released and was signed by Cardiff City on another free transfer. He did not make a league appearance for Cardiff but did play in the FAW Premier Cup on one occasion. He was released by Cardiff at the end of the 2005–06 season after having spent some of the season on loan at Merthyr Tydfil. Since then he has played for Eastbourne Borough and in October 2006 he signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Hastings United, making his debut in a 2–1 win over Croydon Athletic in the FA Trophy. In his first year, after helping the side to promotion, he was unanimously voted the Supporters' Club player of the year and was quickly offered a one-year extension to his contract. =Tonbridge Angels= In May 2008 he signed for Tonbridge Angels. He received a red card on his competitive debut for Tonbridge against Wealdstone. In March 2011, he won the 'Sells Goalkeeping Academy Good Hands' award for the best defensive record in the Isthmian League Premier Division that month, conceding three goals in six games. Worgan was named Tonbridge Angels player of the year for the 2010/11 season,http://www.tonbridgeangels.co.uk/?p=2114 with performances against Bury Town and Wealdstone particularly impressing fans.http://www.tonbridgeafc.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,8286.0.html At the end of the 2012–13 season, Worgan was named in the Conference South team of the year with performances against Dover, Salisbury and Hayes and Yeading particularly impressing managers and fans alike but after five years at Tonbridge, more than 200 appearances in all competitions and one promotion, Worgan announced that he was leaving the club. =Maidstone United= On 15 May 2013, Worgan joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Maidstone United. The stopper cited the size of the club and its infrastructure as his reasons for the move. He swept up the club's player of the season awards in his debut season, receiving the accolade from supporters, teammates, and the manager. He was a pivotal part of the side that won promotion to the National League South in 2014-15 and made his 100th consecutive league appearance for the club on 5 September 2015 in the 0 - 0 draw away at Gosport Borough. Following the departure of Steve Watt, Worgan was made club captain at the Gallagher Stadium. Worgan was once again a vital cog in the Stones machine that won an unlikely promotion to the National League at the climax of the 2015–16 season, with the goalkeeper going down in club folklore for his promotion-winning penalty save from Danny Kedwell in the playoff final against Ebbsfleet United. The promotion meant the club had gone up three times in 4 years, and it was Worgan's second consecutive promotion with the club. During the 2016–17 season, Worgan's first ever in the top tier of non league football, he made his 150th consecutive league appearance for the Maidstone against Gateshead in October 2016. =Dover Athletic= On 29 October 2018, Worgan joined Kent rivals Dover Athletic on a -year deal that would also see him take up a coaching role. He made his debut for the club in a 2–2 home draw with Havant and Waterlooville in the FA Trophy first round. On 12 August 2020, Worgan has his contact terminated by mutual consent in order to focus on a full-time career in teaching. =Chelmsford City= On 13 August 2020, Worgan stepped down a division, signing for Chelmsford City.

He is regarded as one of Kilkenny's greatest ever players. Playing career = Club = From a young age Doyle showed exceptional talent at the game of hurling and he quickly joined his local Mooncoin club. He won his first senior county title in 1906 and added two more in 1908 and 1913. Long after his inter-county career had ended Doyle finished off his club career by winning three consecutive county titles in 1916, 1917 and 1918. = Inter-county = Doyle's first appearance outside of Mooncoin was not for Kilkenny but for his province. He was a spectator at a Railway Shield game at Carrick-on-Suir when some of the Leinster team had failed to turn up. Although aged only 17 he was called in and began his hurling career. Doyle made his debut for Kilkenny in 1903 and captured a Leinster title. Kilkenny were later defeated by Cork in the All- Ireland 'home' final. In 1904 Doyle won his second Leinster medal before later winning his very first All-Ireland medal following a victory over Cork. The following year he won a third provincial title before adding a second All- Ireland medal to his collection. In 1907 Doyle captured a fourth Leinster medal as well as a third All-Ireland medal following yet another victory over Cork. He won his fourth All-Ireland medal in 1909 following a comfortable victory over Tipperary. In 1911 Kilkenny were named All-Ireland champions without having to play in the final, thus giving Doyle his fifth All-Ireland medal. In 1912 he captured yet another Leinster title. Doyle later collected his sixth All-Ireland medal. In 1913 Kilkenny completed the three-in-a-row with Doyle collecting an eighth Leinster medal and a record seventh All- Ireland medal. He remains one of only a handful of Kilkenny players to win seven All-Ireland medals on the field of play. This record was later surpassed by Christy Ring of Cork and John Doyle of Tipperary.

It continues after Jacky and her schoolmates return to Boston after being on a slave ship for several months. The Bloody Jack series begins with Bloody Jack, Curse of the Blue Tattoo, Under the Jolly Roger, In the Belly of the Bloodhound, and continues with My Bonny Light Horseman, Rapture of the Deep, The Wake of the Lorelei Lee, The Mark of the Golden Dragon, Viva Jacquelina!, Boston Jacky, and Wild Rover No More. Plot summary In Mississippi Jack, the fifth installment in the Bloody Jack series, the intrepid Jacky Faber, having once again eluded British authorities, heads west, hoping that no one will recognize her in the wilds of America. There she tricks the tall-tale hero Mike Fink out of his flatboat, equips it as a floating casino-showboat, and heads south to New Orleans, battling murderous bandits, British soldiers, and other scoundrels along the way. Characters * Jacky Faber- The main protagonist of the entire series; now sixteen years old and proclaimed a pirate by King George, Jacky takes up the American Wilderness and starts a casino showboat business. * James 'Jaimy' Emerson Fletcher- Jacky's lover for the entire book series; throughout the series, he's always been one step behind Jacky. On grounds of their distant relationship, Jaimy has an affair with country girl, Clementine Jukes. * John Higgins- Jacky's devoted butler and right-hand man throughout Jacky's adventure through America. * Mike Fink- An American keelboat legend and feared by the Yankee townfolk, Mike Fink knows the rivers like the back of his hand and being victim to Jacky's wit, he loses his keelboat to her and vows to kill her. * Clementine Amaryllis Jukes- The daughter of an alcoholic, murderous farmer; Clementine saves Jaimy from death and sails with Jaimy in pursuit of Jacky before she learns Jacky is another woman and Clementine takes up a position on Jacky's showboat. * Yancy Beauregard Cantrell- The sharp card- dealing Creole gentleman, Cantrell's widowed and raises a daughter that serves a purpose in an Abolitionist scam of his. Cantrell serves a primary role in the book as he is one of the many guests that take the entire route to New Orleans aboard Jacky's casino-boat. * Captain Lord Richard Allen- A womanizing young captain of King George's fleet who is in charge of a deal with the American Indians to kill for scalps and money. Jacky begins an affair with Allen as soon as they come to terms. * Jim Tanner- Another right-hand man of Jacky's; Tanner is always given secondhand jobs and it's obvious he does not appreciate some of the assignments he is given but after Clementine's split from Jaimy, she takes up perfectly with Tanner. * Lieutenant Flashby- An antagonist of the book, Flashby is part of Allen's partnership with the Indians and secretly knows who Jacky Faber truly is. He has Allen kidnap Jacky, but their plan is foiled, and Jacky forces him, along with his cohort Moseley, to walk the plank into the Mississippi. * Crow Jane- Jacky's showboat cook and personal bodyguard. * The Hawkes Boys ('Thaniel and Matty)- Some hoodlums Crow Jane used to run with that hired as Jacky's bodyguards. * Mam'selle Claudelle de Bourbon- A prostitute from New Orleans, Jacky resorts with her once she reaches New Orleans. * Lightfoot, Tepeki, Chee-a-Quat, and the Indian tribe- An Indian tribe Jacky befriends before being exposed by Flashby; even though Lightfoot and Chee-a-Quat are evidently angered and shocked, they come back to rescue her from the British. * Solomon- A negro slave that Jacky and the crew up with and save from slave masters. Solomon is proven to be very intelligent with a guitar and is the reason Jacky is tarred and feathered in New Orleans for by the feared Beam family. * Katy Deere- Another dear friend of Jacky's from her Lawson Peabody serving-girl days. Katy continues to be developed in this book, heading out west with Jacky to settle an old family score. * Chloe Cantrell- The daughter of Yancy Cantrell. Plays the harpsichord. * Reverend Clawson- A Christian preacher that leads a revival as part of Jacky's routine show. He is one of the many guests that go with Jacky the whole route to New Orleans. * Daniel Prescott- A boy who fell victim to the Cave-in-Rock bandits. He travels with Jacky the whole way to New Orleans. * The Beam Family- A Bible-thumping group of hypocritical racists that has Jacky arrested and punished (tar and feather) for helping Solomon escape to freedom. They are all eventually killed by Katy, Lightfoot, and Chee-a-quat. * Mr. McCoy and Mr. Beatty- Two highwaymen that nearly kill Jaimy. * Captain Rutherford- The ruthless captain in charge of arresting Jacky and sending her back to King George in the beginning. * The Lawson Peabody School Girls- Jacky's allies that try to help free her from Captain Rutherford and the British. * Ezra Pickering- Jacky's trusted attorney. References to actual events Jacky begins to market her own patent medicine consisting of an alcoholic tincture of opium (better known as laudanum) and Kentucky bourbon, which she markets during medicine shows. Most patent medicines of the time were made up with similar ingredients and similar lavish claims for their efficacy. Use of these compounds was widespread and unregulated. The crew encounter a secret abolitionist running a slave-selling scam in which the \\"slave\\" is sold, and then escapes to be sold again and again. Similar plots were sometimes used to trick runaways into cooperating with a sale which would turn out to be final. After the import of foreign slaves was forbidden, the demand for slaves became very high and numerous types of deceit and slave- stealing became common. Jacky's crew encounters a family of rogues who make their living trying to repossess escaped slaves in the fashion of Patty Cannon. Jacky herself attempts to pass for quadroon or octoroon as a disguise at one point, in an inversion of the usual trick, which was to pass people who were an eighth or a quarter African heritage as white. Several times, Jacky reflects on the diversity of her crew, which includes Native Americans, Africans and African-Americans, American Appalachians, British such as herself and her butler (or First Mate) Higgins, and so on. This reflects the reality of pirate crews of the day, which often contained escaped black slaves. References to famous characters * Mike Fink was a real keelboater, reputed to tell tall tales. * The Lafitte brothers were real pirates, and as Meyer has a subsidiary character note as Jacky's crew approaches New Orleans, Jean Lafitte made most of his money as a fence of stolen goods and a source of illegally imported slaves. * Near the end of the book, an adopted white Shawnee called Lightfoot, a rifleman who always travels with his native Shawnee \\"brother,\\" reveals his white surname to be \\"Bumpus\\" in an obvious tribute to James Fenimore Cooper's Natty Bumppo. * Crow Jane's niece might be a reference to Sacajawea, as she \\"has been on that Lewis and Clark Expedition across the new Louisiana Territiory\\".

The JS 9 mm is capable of using any 9×19mm round, including the popular 9×19mm Parabellum round but has specifically been chambered for the indigenous, armour-piercing 9×19mm DAP92-9 round. Development Following the unveiling of the QCW-05 submachine gun at the 2005 International Police Equipment Expo in Beijing, Jianshe Industries (Group) Corporation, a company under the China South Industries Group Corporation state-owned conglomerate presented an export variant of their latest submachine gun at the 2006 MILIPOL expo named the 'JS 9 mm'. The submachine gun was a bullpup, select-fire, open bolt, blowback operated submachine gun with a screwable suppressor that is capable of using many different 9×19mm cartridges.

The only difference between the two submachine guns is that the JS 9 mm is slightly smaller and lighter compared to the QCW-05 and uses the common 9×19mm round. The JS 9 mm is also capable of accepting widely used MP5 magazines along with its own double-column, 30-round, box magazine. As the JS 9 mm does not share the QCW-05's carry handle, the sight bridge is mounted on top of a receiver on a Picatinny rail and can be removed in favour of a multitude of aiming equipment.

History Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the settlement dates back to the 13th century when it consisted of timber-framed farmhouses on the hillsides above the valleys of the Calder and Ryburn rivers. They were replaced by stone houses in the 17th and 18th centuries and housed workers in the woollen industry that developed at this time. As the industry thrived, some houses built by yeoman farmers were substantial such as Lower Old Hall (dated 1634) and Fallingworth Hall (dated 1642). Norland Hall, lower down on the hillside near Milner Royd, was typical of an older timber-framed building encased in stone in the late 17th century. In 1911 it was struck by lightning and dismantled in 1914. The American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst bought the stones in 1922 with the intention of re-building the hall in the USA. However, his plan came to nothing and eventually material was incorporated into a chapel in San Simeon, California, in 1968. The village church, St Luke's, opened in 1866. Three other former places of worship, Mount Pleasant Methodist Chapel (1819–1962), Mount Zion Chapel and Bethel Baptist Chapel (1865–?), are now private residences. The primary school was built as a Sunday school in 1871 and opened as a Church of England day school in January 1872. It has since been extended in 1894 and 2003. The war memorial was erected in 1920 and the park around it created four years later on the site of the village pinfold. In 2000 a millennium sundial was added and a time capsule buried by the children of Norland School.  Norland Moor  Norland Moor (approx. 250 acres) above the village is an example of heather moorland rising to at the trig point at the southern end. There is evidence of ancient use with a small number of standing stones, ditches and banks having been identified. The Ladstone, a large outcrop near the trig point, has been linked with Druids as a possible place of ritual sacrifice (Celtic llad = kill or cut). The moor bears the scars of quarrying carried out chiefly in the 18th and 19th centuries on its north-western edge. The moor has been a place of recreation for generations but it has attracted illegal gambling dens and prize fights. Previously owned by Lord Savile, a large section of the moor was auctioned in 1932 to pay death duties. It was purchased by Mr Francis Longbottom for £250. Subsequently, the Parish Council launched an appeal (which raised £373 in eleven days) and Norland Moor passed into its care for the benefit of the local population. In 1937 control passed to Sowerby Bridge Urban District Council and in 1974 to Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council. In 2002 Norland Moor was designated a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). In 2011 moves were in place to create a Friends of Norland Moor group so that local interests are respected in the moor's management. Norland today Norland has an estimated population of about 600 compared to about 1,500 in the mid–19th century. Most people commute out of the village to work. It no longer has any shops but has a public house, \\"The Moorcock\\", and the Norland Working Men's Club, reputedly one of the smallest working men's clubs in the country. The \\"Blue Ball\\", dating back to at least the 1820s, closed in December 2009, and the \\"Hobbit\\" (previously the \\"West Bottom Tavern\\") closed in 2011. The Hobbit has reopened.

Gurudwara Sahib Patshahi Navmi Shri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji Gurudwara Sahib Patshahi Naumi, Phaguwala According to local tradition Phaguwala had not been founded when the Sikh guru Tegh Bahadur Ji passed through this area whilst on his journey from Bhawanigarh to Sunam. According to this tradition the guru met a brahmin peasant ploughing his fields near Bhawanigarh; the peasant served the Guru Ji with food and drink before the guru continued on his journey. To honor the Guru's visit, the Brahmin is said to have constructed a platform and began worshiping it as a sacred site. The site is one kilometer north of the present village. After sometime the construction of the original platform, a room was constructed and a fair was held to celebrate Basant Panchmi - the fifth day of the light half of the Hindu lunar month of Magh (January–February), the first day of spring. This shrine was eventually developed into a proper gurdwara and was called Gurudwara Sahib Patshahi Naumi \\"The gurdwara of the ninth master\\" during the time of Maharaja Narinder Singh of Patiala (1846–62CE) who is also said to have presented a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib for installation here.

Conceived and subsidized by San Francisco venture capitalist Warren Hellman, the festival has been held every year since the first event in 2001. From its outset, the festival has been subsidized by Hellman. Various corporations have offered to sponsor the event over the years, but Hellman always turned them down, saying in an interview, \\"I want to keep it entirely free and noncommercial\\". For some performers, the unique fact that the event is unsponsored is very important to character. In an interview with Hellman, Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show said that part of what keeps the event focused on the music and the community is Warren's decision to ensure it is not \\"consumption driven\\" and the audience is not \\"bombarded with signage\\". Originally Hellman intended only to invite bluegrass musicians. But soon artists from other genres were invited to the event, and in 2004 the word \\"Hardly\\" was added to reflect its expanded scope. The festival draws very large crowds, nearly equal in number to the entire population of San Francisco. In 2011, the festival drew an estimated 750,000 people over the course of the three-day event. History Hellman first mentioned his dream of holding a festival for bluegrass music in the park to Jonathan Nelson in 2001. Nelson had worked for Bill Graham Presents, and introduced Hellman to booking agent and executive producer Dawn Holliday, and production manager Sheri Sternberg at a lunch. Holliday and Sternberg agreed to help and would continue to produce the festival, respectively, each year thereafter. From the start, Hellman most wanted Hazel Dickens to perform at the festival. But Dickens, who was known for political songs about workers' strikes, was wary of performing because of Hellman's wealth and background. She later agreed, and went on to perform at the festival every year from 2001 until her death in April 2011. The 2011 festival was dedicated to the memory of Dickens, a personal friend of Hellman, who died five months earlier. The festival name and scope was changed when, at the very first festival in 2001, Emmylou Harris played with her not strictly bluegrass band. Hellman was a fan of her bluegrass sound under the band name Nash Ramblers, but at the time she was touring as Spyboy. She played the festival as Spyboy, which had a New Orleans style rhythm section. Hellman did not complain, and \\"Hardly\\" was eventually added to the name of the festival in 2004. Before her set in 2009, Emmylou Harris was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music by the president of the college.

By 1937, the School of Nursing had become an independent college, with accreditation by the State Board of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Initially, the college offered B.S. degrees in Nursing and Nursing Education. It continued to do so until September 1964, when a single revised professional nursing program was developed for both basic and registered nurse students. In the Fall of 1982, a new baccalaureate program was added, tailored to the needs of registered nurses. In 1986, the Graduate Nursing Program was inaugurated to offer a Master of Science degree in Nursing. In 1994, the school began to offer a Ph.D. program and in 2008 began to offer a DNP in the discipline. In 1997, the Duquesne School of Nursing was the first university in the nation to offer an online Ph.D. in nursing.

Born in Threecastles, County Kilkenny, Rochford first played competitive hurling and cricket in his youth. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his senior debut during the 1902 championship. Rochford immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won seven All-Ireland medals and nine Leinster medals. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Rochford won three Railway Shield medals. At club level he was a two-time championship medallist with Threecastles and Tullaroan. He also played with Erin's Own. Throughout his career Rochford made 41 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling during the 1916 championship. In retirement from playing Rochford became involved in coaching. He was co- trainer of the Kilkenny team that won the All-Ireland title in 1922, a role he also played with the 1931 Leinster title-winning side. Rochford is widely regarded as one of Kilkenny's all-time greatest players and as one of the greatest full-backs of all-time. Playing career =Club= Rochford began his club hurling career with Tullaroan in his late teenage years. By 1901 he had joined the Threecastles club and lined out in his first championship decider. A 5-10 to 3-7 was Rochford's lot on that occasion, ironically at the hands of Tullaroan. Two years later in 1903 Rochford was back in the championship decider with Threecastles. A 2-10 to 0-5 defeat of Kilmanagh gave him his first championship medal. After defeat by Mooncoin in the 1908 championship decider, Rochford joined the Erin's Own club before later rejoining Tullaroan. In 1915 Rochford won his second and final championship medal following a 7-2 to 2-2 trouncing of Dicksboro. =Inter-county= Beginnings Rochford made his debut with the Kilkenny senior team during the 1902 championship, however, their campaign ended in a single-point defeat by Dublin in the Leinster decider. In 1903 Rochford picked up his first Leinster medal. The game against Dublin ended in a 1-5 apiece draw, however, Kilkenny were subsequently awarded the title by the Leinster Council. Rochford's side later trounced Antrim before lining out against Cork in the All-Ireland home final which wasn't played until 11 July 1905. Cork's Andy \\"Dooric\\" Buckley scored at least six goals as Kilkenny were humiliated by 8-9 to 0-8. Early successes Rochford added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1904 as Kilkenny recorded a 2-8 to 2-6 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final was delayed until 24 June 1906, with three-in-a-row hopefuls Cork providing the opposition. It was the beginning of a hugely successful era for \\"the Cats\\" as Cork were heading into decline. A first half goal by Dick Doyle put Kilkenny in the driving seat, while goalkeeper Pat \\"Fox\\" Maher made a great save in the dying moments of the game to help Kilkenny to a 1-9 to 1-8 victory. It was Rochford's and Kilkenny's first All-Ireland triumph. In 1905 Rochford won a third successive Leinster medal as Dublin were once again bested by 2-8 to 2-2. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 April 1907 saw Cork provide the opposition once again. The game was a high-scoring affair with Cork winning by 5-10 to 3-13. The game, however, had to be replayed as Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and Kilkenny's Matt Gargan had earlier played with Waterford in the Munster championship. The replay was another high-scoring one, with Jimmy Kelly scoring 5-2 for Kilkenny. A puck-out by Cork's Jamesy Kelleher is said to have bounced and hopped over the Kilkenny crossbar. Kilkenny won the game by 7-7 to 2-9, with all seven of their goals coming in a thirty-minute spell. It was Rochford's second All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny lost their provincial crown to Dublin in 1906 as the Tullaroan players withdrew from the team in a dispute over the selection policy, however, the team returned in 1907 with Rochford capturing a fourth Leinster medal following a 4-14 to 1-9 defeat of Dublin. On 21 June 1908 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All- Ireland decider for the third time in four years. A high-scoring, but close, game developed between these two great rivals once again. As the game entered the final stage there was little to separate the two sides. Jimmy Kelly scored three first-half goals while Jack Anthony scored Kilkenny's winning point at the death. Cork went on two late goal hunts, however, the final score of 3-12 to 4-8 gave Kilkenny the win. It was Rochford's third All-Ireland medal. The game became the benchmark by which all subsequent All-Ireland performances were judged. Kilkenny surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1908 by refusing to take part in the competition, however, the team returned in 1909. A 5-16 to 2-7 trouncing of Laois gave Rochford a fifth Leinster medal. The All-Ireland decider on 12 December 1909 pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary, a team that had never lost an All-Ireland final. Before the game itself there was internal fighting within the Kilkenny camp and a selection row left the team short of substitutes. In spite of this, the team still went on to win the game, courtesy of three goals by Bill Hennerby and a fourth by Jimmy Kelly. The 4-6 to 0-12 victory gave Rochford a fourth All-Ireland medal. Three-in-a-row It would be another two years before Rochford won his sixth Leinster medal. The 4-6 to 3-1 defeat of Dublin allowed 'the Cats' to advance to the All-Ireland series once again. Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 18 February 1912, however, the pitch at the Cork Athletic Grounds was water-logged and the game was refixed for Thurles on 12 May 1912. Limerick were unable to attend the replay and Rochford's fifth All-Ireland title was awarded to him rather than being won on the field of play. Kilkenny later defeated Tipperary in an alternative to the final, however, Limerick later defeated Kilkenny in a challenge game. Rochford won a seventh Leinster medal in 1912 following a 6-6 to 2-4 defeat of Laois. Yet another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, with Cork providing the opposition on 17 November 1912. The game was an extremely close affair with Sim Walton proving himself to be the goal-scoring hero. A speculative Matt Gargan shot also hopped past the goalkeeper to give Kilkenny a narrow 2-1 to 1-3 victory. It was Rochford's sixth All-Ireland medal. In February 1913 Rochford wrote to the Kilkenny County Board intimating his desire to \\"resign\\" from the county team and citing his age as his primary reason for doing so. His letter was read at the subsequent meeting, however, it was treated as a \\"joke\\" and the \\"resignation\\" was rejected. As a result of this Rochford later went on to win his eighth Leinster title in ten years following a 7-5 to 2-1 victory in a replay against Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 November 1913 saw Kilkenny square up to Tipperary for the second time in five years in the first 15-a-side All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny led by 1-4 to 1-1 at half-time and eventually hung on to win on a score line of 2-4 to 1-2. This victory gave Rochford a record-breaking seventh All-Ireland medal, a record that he shared with fellow Kilkenny players Sim Walton, Dick \\"Drug\\" Walsh and Dick Doyle. Decline Three years later in 1916 Rochford won his ninth Leinster medal after an 11-3 to 2-2 trouncing of Wexford. An All-Ireland final date with Tipperary beckoned on 21 January 1917, however, he refused to play due to a disagreement over selection policy. Rochford is said to have thrown his hurley and togs into the River Liffey in disgust, as he brought his inter- county career to an end. =Inter-provincial= In 1905 Rochford was at full- back on the all-Kilkenny Leinster team that faced Connacht, represented by Galway, in the very first final Railway Shield final. A 4-10 to 4-5 victory gave him, and Leinster, a first Railway Shield medal. Leinster failed to retain the title in 1906, however, they reached the decider again the following year. A 0-15 to 1-8 defeat of an all-Tipperary Munster team gave Rochford a second Railway Shield medal. In 1908 Rochford was a key member of the defence as Leinster faced Munster in the decider once again. A 0-14 to 2-5 victory gave Rochford a third Railway Shield. Personal life Born in Tulla, Threecastles, Rochford was the second of three children born to Michael Rochford (born 1852), a journeyman tailor, and Catherine \\"Kate\\" White (born 1845). After his primary education at Clinstown and Ballydaniel, Rochford followed in his father's footsteps by also becoming a tailor. Rochford's work brought him to Dublin after his retirement from inter-county hurling. Here he met, and subsequently married, Catherine Gallagher (1883-1982), a teacher from Glenties, County Donegal. Four of their five children, Michael, Katherine (Kate), Christine and Carmel, were born in Dublin, while their youngest daughter, Marie, was born in Kilkenny after the family relocated there in the late 1920s.

Butler (1860 - 27 January 1927) was an Irish silent film actor. He appeared in 262 films between 1908 and 1917. An Irish immigrant to the United States, moved his family from Ohio to Hollywood, California, in 1908. At the age of 48, he wanted to get involved in a new industry called motion pictures. He appeared in more than 200 silent films. He made frequent appearances in films made by famed silent film producer/director D. W. Griffith, who made more than 500 films beginning in 1908. In addition to acting, Butler was a crew member and screenwriter of early films. William's son, Larry Butler, born in Akron, Ohio, just prior to the family's move to Hollywood. Larry grew up in the film business, dropped out of Burbank High School to work with his father on special effects projects. In 1940, Larry won his first of two Oscars. He was nominated five times for Oscars. His first Oscar was for special effects work done on The Thief of Baghdad. Larry is credited with inventing the blue screen and the traveling matte, both processes were necessary for all special effects and are used today. Butler's grandsons, Michael C. Butler and David Butler, became highly respected cinematographers. William's grandson, Christopher Butler, is also a cinematographer. The Butler family which began with William Butler in 1908 have made movies for 100 years, and the generations span the silent era, the studio era, the independent director era and the current era.

It centers on a vaudeville act composed of Tip-Toes, her brother and her uncle, who try to pass her off as an aristocrat to snare a millionaire husband. Farcical complications ensue involving Tip-Toes' temporary amnesia and a marital infidelity subplot. The musical was modestly successful on Broadway in 1925 and in London in 1926. It was quickly adapted as a silent film starring Dorothy Gish and Will Rogers. Production history Tip-Toes was produced by Alex A. Aarons and Vinton Freedley, to satirise the Florida land boom, which was then at its peak. They reunited the creative team of Lady, Be Good!, which had been a hit the previous year with Fred and Adele Astaire. The Broadway production opened at the Liberty Theatre on December 28, 1925 and ran for 192 performances. It was directed by John Harwood, and the dance numbers were staged by Sammy Lee and Earl Lindsay. The cast included Queenie Smith as Tip-Toes, Allen Kearns as Steve Burton, Jeanette MacDonald as Sylvia Metcalf, Andrew Tombes as Al, and Harry Watson Jr. as Hen. A West End production featuring Dorothy Dickson, Laddie Cliff, Allan Kearns, John Kirby, Vera Bryer, Peggy Beaty and Evan Thomas opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on August 31, 1926 and ran for 182 performances.Tip-Toes at the Guide to Musical Theatre An Australian production opened at the Victoria Theatre in Newcastle, New South Wales, on May 4, 1927, before a national tour. Also in 1927, the show was made into one of the last silent films, starring Dorothy Gish as Tip-Toes (spelled Tiptoes in the film) and Will Rogers as Hen. In 1982, original orchestra books for the show were among many documents unearthed in a warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey, and in 1989 two concerts were presented at the Library of Congress to celebrate the discovery. In 1998, Carnegie Hall decided to present the show as part of its two-year Gershwin Centenary program, and a full restoration of the project was undertaken by reconciling original programs and scripts with the existing musical materials. Of this performance, Stephen Holden of the New York Times said, \\"the songs and orchestrations have that irresistible fizz that at its perkiest conveys a compressed frenzy of euphoria.\\" New World Records liner notes by Rob Fisher In 2001, New World Records released a CD with the scores for both Tip-Toes and Tell Me More, another 1925 musical by the Gershwin brothers, which included the cast from the Carnegie Hall concert.Tip Toes at Amazon.com In 2007, the musical was given its first full staging following its 1998 restoration by the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, California.Gold Star Events Variety described the production as \\"an exuberant reminder of the let's-put-on-a-show spirit characterizing the best musical productions of any era.\\" Variety review Plot summary ;Act I There is a land boom in Florida in roaring 1925. At the train station in upscale Palm Beach, flirtatious Rollo Fish Metcalf is surprised to see his socialite wife, Sylvia, planning to give a party for her millionaire brother, Steve, who is coming to visit her. Steve is set to inherit the family glue factory. Rollo agrees to wait for the vaudevillian entertainers, the \\"Komical Kayes\\" (Tip-Toes, her brother Al and Uncle Hen), who are arriving to entertain at Steve's bash. It turns out that Rollo once had a flirtation with Tip-Toes Kaye, who was not at all pleased to find out that he is married, and Sylvia has seen an incriminating photo of the pair. When Rollo sees that Tip-Toes is one of the performers, he pays the troupe to leave. The Kayes are so poor that Tip-Toes had to travel in the luggage to avoid paying for a ticket. They stay in Palm Beach to see if they can find a millionaire for Tip-Toes to marry (they are socially ambitious). Tip-Toes runs into Steve at the station, as he helps her avoid the porter who was trying to get her to pay her fare. She thinks he's swell. Later, people are happily gambling at the Palm Beach Surf Club. Sylvia wants to make Steve appear more sophisticated, so she introduces him to two young ladies, Binnie and Denise, who are to give him lessons at dancing, elocution, music, golf and bridge. Meanwhile, Tip-Toes (pretending to be a wealthy girl, \\"Roberta Van Renssalaer\\") plays a game at the club that leads to her being kissed by Steve, who she remembered from the station. The two are immediately and powerfully attracted to each other. Al meets Binnie and Denise, and they all decide to go to the Blues Café. Al and Uncle Hen quarrel after Tip-Toes tells them that she doesn't want to trick Steve now that she really likes him. Tip-Toes is nearly run down by a car. Although she is not seriously injured, she develops amnesia and thinks that she is really Roberta Van Renssalaer. Al and Uncle Hen are happy about this. ;Act II Everyone is getting ready for the party on Steve's yacht the next evening. \\"Roberta\\" and Steve are very happy to have found each other. However, since she thinks she is rich, she is spending more money than Al and Uncle Hen have. Rollo discloses Tip-Toes' real identity to Steve, in order to protect his secret, but Steve is despondent. He confronts Tip-Toes, who now remembers who she is, but she tells him that she really loves him and is not after his fortune. Steve reveals that he is bankrupt. He tells her to go after one of the other millionaires at the bash and storms off. Tip-Toes stays aboard the yacht all evening, and when Steve returns, she insists that she loves him and will stay aboard all night \\"without a chaperone\\". He is persuaded that she is telling the truth. Back at the hotel the following day, Tip-Toes pays her family's hotel bill by performing one of her dances for the guests. Steve proposes and gives her an engagement ring. She is delighted, even though she assumes that it is a fake, since Steve has no money. But it turns out to be real, because Steve is really still a millionaire.

Washington, DC: American Psychological AssociationWesten, D.; Burton, L. & Kowalski, R. (2006) Psychology: Australian and New Zealand Edition. Milton, QLD. John Wiley and Sons. This process is most commonly discussed with respect to children in developmental psychology. The word modeling refers both to the behavior of the learner and the teacher.  Study by Albert Bandura  The concept of behavioral modeling was most memorably introduced by Albert Bandura in his famous 1961 Bobo doll experiment. In this study, 72 children from ages three to five were divided into groups to watch an adult confederate interact with an assortment of toys in the experiment room, including an inflated Bobo doll. For children assigned the non-aggressive condition, the confederate ignored the doll. For children assigned the aggressive condition, the confederate spent the majority of the time physically aggressing the doll and shouting at it. After the confederate left the room, the children were given the opportunity to individually interact with similar toys. Children who observed the non-aggressive confederate's behavior played quietly with the toys and rarely initiated violence toward the Bobo doll. Children who watched the aggressive confederate were more likely to imitate the confederate's behavior by hitting, kicking, and shouting at the Bobo doll.  Factors influencing behavioral modeling  = Psychological factors = Bandura proposed that four components contribute to behavioral modeling. # Attention: The observer must watch and pay attention the behavior being modeled. # Retention: The observer must remember the behavior well enough to recreate it. # Reproduction: The observer must physically recreate the actions they observed in step 1. # Reinforcement: The observer's modeled behavior must be rewarded = Neurological factors = The mirror neuron system, located in the frontal lobe of the brain, is a network of neurons that become active when an animal either performs a behavior or observes that behavior being performed by another. For example, the same mirror neurons will become active when a monkey grasps an object as when it watches another monkey do so. While the significance of mirror neurons is still up for debate in the scientific community, there are many who believe them to be the primary biological component in imitative learning.  In neuro-linguistic programming  Modeling is an important component of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), which field has developed specialized techniques involving modeling.

Frank Baum and his successors. He is first introduced in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900).Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 148. His name is Omby Amby, but this was so obliquely stated that he also became known briefly as Wantowin Battles. Classic Oz books In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Soldier with the Green Whiskers (real name not yet revealed) is the head guard of the Royal Army of Oz. His job is to protect the Emerald City and its residents. He gladly escorts the four main protagonists Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion through the streets of the Emerald City upon their first visit. He leads them all to the royal palace of the Wizard of Oz, where he forces them to wipe their feet upon a plush green carpet before entering. When he blows upon his green whistle, a pretty maid dressed in green silk named Jellia Jamb appears to show the four guests to their private rooms while staying in Oz's palace. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers appears to be the tallest citizen in the city, and is often described as being \\"very tall\\" with a very thick and long green beard that flows nearly to the ground. After the Wizard's departure from Oz, he leaves the Scarecrow to rule the city in his stead. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers is the one who tells the King Scarecrow that Glinda the Good Witch might know of a way for Dorothy to get back to her homeland in Kansas. The four protagonists take his advice and travel to the land of the southern Quadlings to seek its ruler. In the second Oz book The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904), it is revealed his appearance is largely for show. When attacked by General Jinjur's all female Army of Revolt, he admits that his gun, which was usually drawn containing flowers, is not kept loaded for fear of accidents. He tells her to \\"wait right here\\" while he looks for the powder and shot that he has misplaced. After his ineffectual attempts to save the Emerald City from invasion, which the Scarecrow chastizes, he vows to disguise himself by shaving his beard. However, he lets it grow back once Princess Ozma has been established on the throne as Oz's true ruler. Omby Amby In Ozma of Oz, we are introduced to the Royal Army of Oz, consisting of twenty-six officers and one private. This private, Omby Amby, proves to be the only brave soldier in the Army, so Princess Ozma promotes him to Captain- General and makes him her personal Body Guard. He has a fierce moustache (not noted in the text until The Emerald City of Oz, but shown in the illustrations from the beginning), but is capable if gentle-natured, unlike the pompous officers, who come up with excuses not to fight and act very cowardly when facing the Giant with the Hammer. Omby Amby gets inadvertently flung onto the arm of the Giant and must jump down onto the soft body of the Scarecrow, and the officers more outwardly show their fear than the private. An officer mentions that they have a few other privates, but Omby Amby is the only one we ever see. He is cleaning the barracks when Ozma calls him into the banquet for his promotion. When the Wizard returns, he recognizes Omby Amby, who greets him accompanied by Jellia Jamb, but wonders what happened to his \\"green whiskers.\\" Omby Amby admits to have shaven them off. As Omby Amby, he appears briefly in The Road to Oz and is tour guide to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in The Emerald City of Oz. It is he who informs them of the \\"Defensive Settlements of Oz\\" such as Rigmarole Town and Flutterbudget Center, where people are exiled for talking too much or worrying too much, respectively. In later books When next we see him, in The Patchwork Girl of Oz, he is again referred to as the Soldier with the Green Whiskers; he is the only soldier in the Army, his beard is back to its normal length, and is now said to make him look taller than he really is. He is also referred to as the Emerald City Police Force. This may explain why Jack Snow described Oz's jailer, Tollydiggle, as his wife -- in The Magical Mimics in Oz, Betsy Bobbin is shown giving Omby Amby flowers and asking them to give them to his wife, Tollydiggle. No indication of any such relationship is found in Baum's books. Indeed, Baum does state that the Soldier has a wife, but she is one with a \\"terrible temper\\" -- at least according to Jinjur -- something not in evidence in Tollydiggle. Two lines may indicate where this interpretation comes from -- he addresses Tollydiggle as \\"my dear\\" (fairly commonly used with friends in Oz books, especially from the Wizard), and that he says, \\"I know that very well,\\" when Tollydiggle says, \\"it is impossible for anyone to escape from this house.\\" While he continued to appear in most Oz books, his next major appearance was not until The Wishing Horse of Oz, in which his beard turning red was the first indication of the magic of Skamperoo in his bid to conquer the Emerald City. It is initially suspected to be the red magic of Jinnicky, but Gloma, the Witch of the Black Forest (implicitly the Good Witch of the West), assures Dorothy that it is green magic at work. With Ozma and many of her advisers, he is imprisoned at the bottom of Lake Lightning. In Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz, author Ruth Plumly Thompson constructed an elaborate family history for him under the name Wantowin Battles. In this book, Thompson portrays Wantowin as a pompous coward with bad aim who loves to eat pickles. Jack Snow gave Wantowin, without a surname, his own entry in Who's Who in Oz as a result.Who's Who in Oz, p. 235. John R. Neill's editor picked up on the name and used it once in the rewritten portion of The Wonder City of Oz. Snow also described him as Keeper of the Gates and Royal Army of Oz, and omitted an entry from Who's Who in Oz of the Guardian of the Gates,Who's Who in Oz, p. 85. who is clearly not the same person, as they speak to each other in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Marvelous Land of Oz, and The Patchwork Girl of Oz. In The Scalawagons of Oz, Omby Amby offers to take the Guardian's place so that he can take a Scalawagon to see his cousin, Oompa. James Haff did a major analysis of the character in The Baum Bugle.James E. Haff, \\"The Man Nobody Knows,\\" The Baum Bugle, #63 (Winter 1978). He notes that he does not seem to have any real friends, although Haff does not note that he is shown playing checkers with Pastoria in The Yellow Knight of Oz, and in Neill's books he appears to be good friends with the Guardian of the Gates, and is even shown waltzing with him in The Scalawagons of Oz after getting up from a game of marbles when the music begins to play and having no one else around. Ironically, although Neill both wrote and illustrated, the Soldier is shown in illustration dancing with a woman in spite of the text. Portrayals The Soldier with the Green Whiskers appears in many adaptations, though he often lacks that description for a lack of green whiskers. The following films have featured a version of the character: *The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914) - Frank Bristol as The Soldier with the Green Whiskers *The Land of Oz, a Sequel to the 'Wizard of Oz' (1932) - Caryl Roberts as The Soldier with the Green Whiskers (also Glenna Vaughn as Jellia Jamb disguised as the Soldier) *The Wizard of Oz (1939) - Frank Morgan as \\"The Guard\\" (who allows Dorothy and her three companions into the Wizard's castle) *Journey Back to Oz (1974) - Dallas McKennon as Omby Amby *The Marvelous Land of Oz (1981) - Oliver Osterberg as Soldier of Oz *Mago de Oz Cuento de Frank Baum (1985) - Jorge Rosette as the Guard The Guard also made a brief appearance in the musical Wicked. He first appeared in the Emerald City to inform Glinda and Elphaba that the Wizard has granted them audience, and is later seen at Glinda and Fiyero's engagement party.

Salisbury forms a natural boundary between the Southern Railway core routes in the counties surrounding London, and the long route connecting with the Devon and Cornwall lines. Network The routes within the scope of this article spring westward from Salisbury, which was reached from Waterloo station in London, 84 miles away. From Salisbury the main line continued broadly west, passing no major population centre until reaching Exeter. The difficult terrain, with numerous hills and valleys crossing the direction of the route, made selection of the alignment difficult, and several medium-sized towns were passed at a distance of a few miles. Many of these towns had to accept a horse omnibus connection from a remote station on the main line; later, some of them—Yeovil, Chard, Lyme Regis, Seaton, Sidmouth and Exmouth—gained their own branch line. At Exeter, the LSWR had its own station, Queen Street, more conveniently situated than the St Davids station of the Bristol & Exeter Railway (B&ER;), but its elevated location made onward extension into west Devon difficult. When it eventually did so, it descended by a steep and curved connection into the B&ER; station, running a few miles northward on that line and then diverging to the west, to Crediton. The line onward led into several main line branches: to Barnstaple and Bideford (and later Ilfracombe); to Halwill and Holsworthy, with Halwill itself becoming a junction later; and to Plymouth, reached at first over part of the route of the rival broad gauge interest.Derek Phillips and George Pryer, The Salisbury to Exeter Line, Oxford Publishing Company, Sparkford, 1997, R A Williams, The London & South Western Railway: Volume 2: Growth and Consolidation, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, Derek Phillips, From Salisbury to Exeter -- the Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, 2000, Securing territory Map of the Southern Railway routes in the West of England The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) was formed from the London and Southampton Railway, one of the earliest long-distance lines, which opened from 1838. The first line was successful, and the company then extended its network, at first by building branch lines from the original main line, and then by building new lines. Securing territory, by building a route to \\"capture\\" an area quickly became an objective as a part of growing the company's business, and it was a natural consequence that this developed into a competitive battle with companies whose territory lay adjacent. This competition developed especially fiercely with the Great Western Railway (GWR). This company had opened its main line from London to Bristol in 1838, and developed alliances that extended its influence to Exeter. Most of the railways being built at that time used the standard track gauge (the spacing between the rails) of , but the GWR used a broad gauge of .Until 1892 when they finally converted all their routes to the standard gauge Often new railways in a locality were promoted by local interests, often wishing their line to be worked, or purchased, by one of the larger companies. Operation would be inconvenient if it were built to the gauge used by the rival, and the choice of gauge had to be made when seeking parliamentary authority for the construction. That choice implied—perhaps forced—alignment to one or other of the larger prospective parents. This led to the competition being characterised as the \\"gauge war\\".R A Williams, The London & South Western Railway -- Volume 1 -- The Formative Years, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, As the territory in the counties near London became saturated, thoughts of expansion turned to the relatively undeveloped west of England. The GWR and the Bristol & Exeter Railway working in partnership had formed a through route from London to Exeter in 1844, and with the South Devon Railway was to reach PlymouthLaira Green in 1848; the three companies formed the powerful \\"broad gauge alliance\\".E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 The broad gauge route to Exeter ran via Bristol, leaving much territory as yet unsecured, and despite the agreement, the LSWR determined to build a line to Exeter. But although it had reached Salisbury, this was a branch line from Bishopstoke (Eastleigh), and Exeter was 88 miles away. The onward development forms the main content of this article. Development of LSWR routes =Salisbury first= On 17 January 1847, the first LSWR goods train, headed by the locomotive Rhinoceros entered the Salisbury station, at Milford at the south-eastern edge of the city. This event was hugely significant to the city, bringing the possibility of industrial development, so that \\"Salisbury might become the Manchester of the South\\".Unnamed speaker quoted in the Salisbury & Winchester Journal, in WhiteH P White, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 2: Southern England, Phoenix House, London, 1961 Under the guidance of W J Chaplin,Chaplin became Chairman in 1843 the LSWR had been dealing with the demands of Southampton and Portsmouth, and it had neglected the clamour for railway connection from towns and cities to the west. An energetic solicitor from Wimborne, A L Castleman, had developed a scheme for a railway from Southampton to Dorchester, with the possibility of extending westward from Dorchester to Exeter and beyond. His line was so full of curves and diversions that it was called \\"the water snake\\" or \\"Castleman's Corkscrew\\". His discussions with the LSWR were so forceful that the company rebuffed him, and he turned to the GWR as an ally. The GWR welcomed him and agreed to lease the line (if it were built) on good terms, as it would give the GWR access to Southampton. Meanwhile, there were competing attempts by the GWR and the LSWR to reach Newbury, and this led to a determination by a Board of Trade committee in favour of the GWR route. But an agreement was forged between the GWR and the LSWR: the GWR would relinquish any encouragement of Castleman's line, in return for which the LSWR agreed not to promote any competing lines westward of Salisbury or Dorchester; the agreement was signed on 16 January 1845.C F Dendy Marshall, revised R W Kidner, History of the Southern Railway, Ian Allan Ltd, reprint 1982, Castleman got his company, called the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, incorporated and the line between Southampton and Dorchester via Ringwood and Wimborne opened on 1 June 1847; the Southampton and Dorchester was amalgamated with the LSWR by Act of 22 July 1848 and Castleman was given a seat on the LSWR board.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, Now the Railway Mania was in full spate, with a frenzied promotion of railways everywhere, and three schemes to reach Exeter were presented in Parliament in 1847. Two were approved, including the LSWR scheme which would have provided a direct line between Basingstoke and Salisbury as well as reaching westwards, but suddenly the financial bubble had burst, and the LSWR and its competitors found that money was too scarce to permit building new railways. It was not until 1 May 1857 that the direct line from Basingstoke to Salisbury was opened, also to the Milford station: a connection from there to the present-day Salisbury station, involving a tunnel, followed on 2 May 1859. =Salisbury to Yeovil= The truce created by the agreement over the Southampton and Dorchester line required the LSWR not to promote a line westward of that line. This agreement was proving to be much regretted: now the GWR promoted the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, already by 1851 reaching Salisbury and Frome, and building onwards to Dorchester and Weymouth. In 1853 the directors of the company proposed a scheme to extend from Dorchester to Exeter, having been encouraged by declarations from the military that communications across the country without a break of gauge were strategically important; however at a special meeting of the proprietors on 15 November 1853, the proposals were rejected. However, in 1854 an independent company, the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR;) got its Act of Parliament (on 7 August) to build from Salisbury to join the GWR and B&ER;, both of which were already in Yeovil. It was not until 21 July 1856 that the LSWR Coastal Scheme (reaching Exeter via Dorchester) was dropped. The first section of the S&YR; opened from Salisbury to Gillingham on 2 May 1859. The Salisbury station was a new station at Fisherton Street, opened the same day, located immediately south of the GWR station that had opened on 20 June 1856, serving its line from Westbury. On the same day the LSWR opened connecting lines from the Bishopstoke and Basingstoke lines to Fisherton Street, and closed the Milford station to passengers. The Salisbury and Yeovil Railway arrives at HendfordThe Salisbury & Yeovil company extended its line to Sherborne on 7 May 1860 and from there to Yeovil on 1 June 1860 (to passengers; goods on 1 September). The Yeovil station was the Bristol and Exeter Railway station, Hendford, up until then the terminus of their line from Durston. The two companies planned a joint station—it became Yeovil Town, and the B&ER; made a separate narrow gauge track from the point of junction to Hendford, providing mixed gauge track in their goods yard there. From Yeovil to Exeter When the S&YR; had been authorised and the Coastal Scheme abandoned, the course of the LSWR route to Exeter was clear, and they now easily got an Act for the line on 21 July 1856. Construction was swift, and the line opened throughout from Yeovil to Exeter Queen Street on 19 July 1860—seven weeks after the opening of the S&YR.; The Bristol & Exeter Railway, a broad gauge company, had reached Exeter 16 years previously.David St John Thomas, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 1: The West Country, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966 The LSWR line made a junction with the S&YR;—in reality simply a continuation of the main line—at Bradford Abbas, and built a station called Yeovil Junction, and a connecting line from the Hendford line, forming a triangle. The LSWR worked the S&YR; line from the outset.It acquired it in July 1878 The main line from Salisbury to Exeter Queen Street was single throughout, with intermediate crossing stations at Wilton, Dinton, Tisbury, Semley, Gillingham, Templecombe, Milborne Port, Sherborne, Yeovil Junction, Sutton Bingham, Crewkerne, Chard Road, Axminster, Colyton, Honiton, Feniton, Whimple, and Broad Clyst. The route traversed difficult terrain, with most river valleys running transverse to its direction, so that gradients were significant, 1 in 80 being typical.Gradients of the Main Line Railways, The Railway Magazine, Westminster, 1947 Nonetheless only three tunnels were needed: Buckhorn Weston (sometimes known as Gillingham Tunnel, 742 yards long, two miles west of Gillingham; Crewkerne (206 yards, a mile west of Crewkerne station) and Honiton (at 1,345 yards the longest on the LSWR system, two miles west of Honiton). Due to the difficulty of the landscape, the line passed by most of the important towns in the area, and this led to the eventual construction of several branch lines to bring railways to the towns. Yeovil after the opening of the LSWRYeovil Town station opened on 1 June 1861, and LSWR passenger trains ceased to run on to Hendford; goods trains continued to use the yard there. In 1860 there were four passenger trains each way between Salisbury and Exeter, and at least one each way ran via Hendford, using the Bradford Abbas curve between the Salisbury line and Hendford, with others having a connecting shuttle from the Junction station. The siding accommodation at Hendford was very cramped, and to facilitate goods exchange traffic, the GWR built a short goods branch line to Yeovil Junction from the Weymouth line; it was officially referred to as the Clifton Maybank Siding, and it opened on 13 June 1864. It was broad gauge and there was no common siding accommodation; the exchange was by transhipping the goods. The east curve was closed on 1 January 1870, after which trains from Salisbury to Yeovil Town reversed at Yeovil Junction. On 1 July 1870, the entire line between Salisbury and Exeter was doubled. Exeter and North Devon The LSWR was building a line to a station central to the city, at Queen Street, but westward extension seemed to be blocked by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;) and South Devon Railway (SDR) line, which ran north–south on the low-lying ground below it. However an agreement was made with the broad gauge companies on 14 March 1860 to extend the line from Queen Street down to the St Davids station; the B&ER; would lay mixed gauge at the station and on to Cowley Bridge Junction, where the Crediton line diverged. The B&ER; agreed to facilitate the operation of LSWR trains with minimal restrictions, but there was a provision that the LSWR had to stop every passenger train at St Davids station. The line descended to St Davids at the exceptionally steep gradient of 1 in 37, with a 184-yard tunnel, and special precautions were taken in operation on this incline. The connecting line cost £19,550 and it was opened on 1 February 1862. Long before this, seeing a strategic advantage in developing territory in Devon, the LSWR took a great interest in local railways being promoted between Exeter and North Devon. When the Taw Vale Extension Railway (TVER) was promoted and obtained its Act of Parliament for construction in 1846, the LSWR bought shares in the adjacent Exeter and Crediton Railway (E&CR;), and in 1847 the LSWR concluded a lease of the TVER which itself leased the E&CR.; When the lines finally opened on 1 August 1854 the LSWR had control of a railway from Exeter to Fremington, just beyond Barnstaple. However, these had been required by the Board of Trade to be on the broad gauge, and the LSWR did not have broad gauge rolling stock, so for some time the Company had to arrange for the Bristol & Exeter Railway to work its trains for it. After the LSWR reached Exeter, an arbitration award required the Bristol & Exeter to lay mixed gauge track from Exeter St Davids to Cowley Bridge Junction: the point of divergence of the North Devon lines from the B&ER; main line. This permitted the LSWR to run standard gauge trains to Crediton from 1862, and throughout to Fremington from 1863. The Bideford Extension Railway built a line from Fremington to Bideford, opened in 1855, worked by the LSWR on the broad gauge with B&ER; trains until 1863. The LSWR extended the Bideford line to Torrington, after local pressure to fulfil an earlier undertaking, opening in 1872. These developments are more fully described in the article North Devon Railway. Extension of the line from Barnstaple to Ilfracombe took place in 1874. The route was very difficult and involved steep gradients and sharp curves. Into Cornwall and to Plymouth Seeking further westward expansion, the LSWR encouraged an independent company, the Devon and Cornwall Railway, to promote a line from Coleford Junction, north-west of Crediton, to Lydford (at first spelt Lidford,) round the northern edge of Dartmoor. At Lydford the line made a junction with the South Devon & Tavistock Railway, a broad gauge company that had reached there in 1865, and running powers were obtained to continue to Plymouth. The D&CR; line was opened slowly in stages between 1865 and 1874, and the completion was accompanied by the opening of the LSWR's own terminus station at Devonport; its trains ran through Plymouth from Tavistock Junction, making a Plymouth call at Mutley station and later North Road station, then continuing to the Devonport station. Goods traffic was dealt with at Friary station, on the south-east side of Plymouth. This reliance on a competing company's line—one which had never been intended as a main line—was unsatisfactory, and the LSWR encouraged the formation of an independent company, the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway (PD&SWJR;), which was formed to build an independent line from Lydford to Plymouth. The PD&SWJR; obtained its authorising Act on 25 August 1883 for a line from Lydford passing to the west of Tavistock, then down the valley of the River Tamar to reach Plymouth. In 1889 the idea of a central station in Plymouth was abandoned in favour of running to Devonport and converting Friary to a passenger terminus.A J Cheeseman, The Plymouth, Devonport & South Western Junction Railway Oakwood Press, Blandford Forum, 1967, The PD&SWJR; line opened on 2 June 1890 and this changed Devonport into a through station. A new curve allowing trains from Devonport to run directly to Friary was brought into use on 1 April 1891, and Friary became the Plymouth passenger terminal for the LSWR. Trains to London started from Friary and ran through Plymouth from east to west, calling at North Road, and continuing westwards through Devonport before heading north alongside the Tamar. The Lydford line enabled the LSWR to launch a railway to Holsworthy, an important market town, in 1879, extending that line to the Cornish harbour town of Bude in 1898. This route is described in the article Okehampton to Bude Line. Branch Lines between Salisbury and Exeter Map of the branch lines The challenging terrain between Salisbury and Exeter made it difficult for the main line as constructed to serve several important towns near its path. This resulted in several important branch lines being constructed to serve them, in many cases promoted by local interests. Most of the branch lines made a junction with the main line at a place other than a town, reducing the commercial effectiveness of the route. Even the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway served Yeovil itself by a branch from Bradford Abbas, a fact which lost it much initial support in Yeovil when it became known at the promotion stage. When the Yeovil branch opened, on the same day as the S&YR; main line on 1 June 1860, the Yeovil station was not ready and the trains continued on the Bristol & Exeter line to Hendford, the B&ER; station on the western limits of the town. The B&ER; laid mixed gauge track for the purpose, having reached there in 1857 connecting with the GWR at Pen Mill. The magnificent Yeovil joint station opened on 1 June 1861, jointly operated by the B&ER;, the GWR and the LSWR, and the LSWR trains ceased running through to Hendford. Chard was served by a railway promoted by the Chard Railway company; when construction was partly complete the LSWR purchased the railway on 1 January 1863 and the line opened on 8 May 1863, from Chard Road to Chard Town. When the Bristol & Exeter Railway reached Chard from Taunton in 1866, the LSWR line was extended, by-passing the original station and running to a new Joint station, called New Chard or \\"Chard Joint\\", opened on 26 November 1866. The original station remained open, but was reduced to goods-only status in 1917. Lyme Regis was the last of the intermediate branches to be built after several earlier schemes from 1864 failed; the Lyme Regis branch line ran from Axminster station with 1 in 40 gradients and sharp curves, opening on 24 August 1903. Constructed and worked by the Axminster & Lyme Regis Light Railway, it was absorbed by the LSWR on 1 January 1907. Although a southwards branch, it ran from the up (north) side of Axminster station and crossed over the main line. There was a spur to the down sidings at Axminster station. The Seaton branch was constructed by the Seaton and Beer Railway; it opened on 16 March 1868 from Colyton Junction (later Seaton Junction) with intermediate stations at Colyton Town, Colyford and Seaton. The line was leased by the LSWR from 1 January 1880 and absorbed by it on 1 January 1888. The Sidmouth and Exmouth lines in 1908The Sidmouth Railway got its Act of Parliament on 29 June 1871 and opened its line on 6 July 1874 from Feniton, with intermediate stations at Tipton and Ottery St Mary. The Sidmouth station was somewhat short of the town itself. Feniton had been renamed Ottery Road in 1861, but was renamed Sidmouth Junction when the Sidmouth line opened. (After closure of the branch line it reverted to Feniton in 1971). A light railway called the Budleigh Salterton Railway got its Act on 20 July 1894 and opened its line in 1897 from Tipton St Johns (the earlier Tipton station, renamed in 1881) to Salterton, with an intermediate station at Budleigh. In 1898 it renamed Salterton to be called Budleigh Salterton; Budleigh was renamed East Budleigh, and a new station was opened at Newton Poppleford. The LSWR already operated an Exmouth branch, and it filled in the gap by opening its Exmouth & Salterton Railway from Budleigh Salterton to Exmouth, with an intermediate station at Littleham, on 1 June 1903. Much earlier, the Exeter & Exmouth Railway had opened its line from the LSWR at Exmouth Junction on 1 May 1861; it was worked from the outset by the LSWR. Independent railways There were three other lines in Devon and Cornwall that were associated with the LSWR or its successor the Southern Railway. The Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway (PD&SWJR;) has been referred to above as responsible for the construction of the line between Lydford and Devonport; on completion, it leased that line to the LSWR and took no role in its operation. However, it also constructed a branch line from Bere Alston to Callington, partly constructed over the earlier East Cornwall Mineral Railway line. The branch line was operated by the Company, which remained independent until nationalisation of the railways under the Transport Act 1947. The Lynton and Barnstaple Railway was a narrow gauge line joining the coast resort of Lynton to the market town of Barnstaple. It opened in May 1898, using the track gauge of 1 ft 11½ in (597 mm). It was not commercially successful; it was absorbed into the Southern Railway group at the grouping of the railways in 1923, but it closed in September 1935. The North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway opened on 27 July 1925, after narrow gauge mineral tramways built to serve the china clay industry were upgraded. The line remained independent until the nationalisation of the railways in 1948. =The Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway= The Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway formed a most important connecting line for the LSWR, intersecting at . The line had originally been promoted by a local line, the Dorset Central Railway, which started from the LSWR's Southampton–Dorchester line at and had made a connection with the LSWR at Templecombe in 1862. At the same time, the line amalgamated with the Somerset Central Railway to form the Somerset & Dorset Railway, at this stage only aspiring to connect the port of Poole with Burnham-on-Sea on the Bristol Channel. However, the little company completed its extension to in 1874, there connecting with the Midland Railway, and instantly forming an important through route to the Midlands and the North, avoiding dependence on the Great Western Railway. However the capital expenditure in building the Bath extension ruined the S&DR;, and it leased its line to the LSWR and Midland Railway companies in 1876; they operated the line as the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway, with the Midland company providing the engine power and rolling stock, and the LSWR providing infrastructure and operations staff. The Joint line connected with other LSWR routes at and , and that was the most important passenger flow, with a lower usage of the Templecombe connection with the Salisbury–Exeter line. Freight traffic interchange at Templecombe was considerable, however. Grouping of the railways In the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth, Parliament had fostered competition between railway companies, seeing most cooperative alliances as anti-competitive. However the demands of the First World War, in which the railways had been directed by Government, and had been unable to renew and maintain their systems normally, coupled with the general external competitive situation, had led to a situation in which continued competition was unsustainable, and the Government enacted the Railways Act 1921 which compelled the major railway companies of Great Britain to combine into four groups—the so-called \\"big four\\". This took effect on 1 January 1923, when the LSWR was absorbed into the new Southern Railway along with its southerly neighbour, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The GWR formed a group of its own (combining with a large number of smaller lines). Competition to the south, to Portsmouth and Epsom ceased, but critically, competition in the West with the GWR was unaffected.C F Dendy Marshall, History of the Southern Railway, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1982 reprint (revised by Kidner), Michael R Bonavia, The History of the Southern Railway, Unwin Hyman, London, 1987, Peter Semmens, Great Western Railway -- 1: Consolidation 1923 - 1929, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1985, The Somerset & Dorset remained a joint railway, owned by the Southern and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, new owners of the Midland Railway, who also remained fiercely competitive with the GWR.

Hanna's bituminous coal properties were put into the newly formed Consolidation Coal Company in 1945 in return for CCC stock. 1950s In the early 1950s the company began diversification under George Humphrey producing high-grade iron ore pellets and establishing Iron Ore Company of Canada. Hanna also acquired interests in mineral companies in Latin America as well as beginning the mining of nickel in Oregon and silicon in Washington. In 1958 Hanna's subsidiary, the Hanna Coal & Ore Company, became the independent Hanna Mining Company while M. A. Hanna continued with mineral sales and in its investment firm work until liquidation in 1965. 1970s By the early 1970s, Hanna Mining was the world's second-largest producer of iron ore with United States Steel being the largest. Also during this decade, Hanna secured interests in petroleum, low sulfur coal, and mineral exploration. Hanna executives believed that the name Hanna Mining did not reflect the entire scope of what the company embodied and the name returned to M. A. Hanna Company in March 1985. During the 1980s under CEO Martin D. Walker, M. A. Hanna began acquiring plastic and polymer companies while divesting itself of mining and energy property. Hanna purchased Burton Rubber Processing Company in 1986 and other polymer industries totaling sales of $1.1 billion in 1990. By 1993, M. A. Hanna's revenue from polymer processing was 99% of all revenue. By 1998, annual sales reached $2.3 billion annually. Hanna merged with polyvinyl chloride giant Geon Company, a former division of the B. F. Goodrich Company that became a separate entity in 1993. The merger produced PolyOne Corporation, a company worth $3.5 billion and ranked in the Fortune 1000.Case Western Reserve, Encyclopedia of Cleveland History: M. A. Hanna References *F.S.

Trained as a realist painter with noted Connecticut artist Charles Noel Flagg, he worked for a short period as staff artist for The Hartford Times, and then as an art critic for The Hartford Courant. Britton was a prolific painter, earning his living for the most part from painting portraits and for his pleasure landscapes, as well as woodblock prints and drawings. He was also often short of money, which meant that instead of being able to buy new canvases for his work he simply painted over what he happened to have at hand. Among his surviving works are several paintings on cereal boxes and in one case a small egg carton, as well as a large number of very small postcard- sized landscapes . He painted at various times in his native Connecticut, New York City, and Sag Harbor. As well as being a painter in his own right, he was also an organizer of artists and art students, in Connecticut being one of the founders of the Connecticut Art Students League. In New York he was one of the founders of a group called The Eclectics, with whom he exhibited regularly. In his years in New York he occasionally worked as art critic for the weekly American Art News. And to reflect his interest in getting out the news on American painters, whom he believed to be substantially unknown and under- appreciated by the art world and public alike, in 1919 he created, edited and published an art periodical, Art Review International, which lasted until 1925. As a critic for American Art News, he reviewed contemporary events such as the [Armory Show] of 1913. Britton had three children: James Jerome, born 1915; Teresa, born 1916; and Ruth born in 1919. In 1928 he was involved in a traffic accident, seriously injuring his hip and leaving his mobility compromised. He died on April 16, 1936 at the age of fifty-eight. His work has been the object of some revival in recent years.

A name the team contest was held in which Blue Jays was the winning selection. When it came to the development of a team logo, Bavasi sought a symbol as easily recognizable as Kroc's golden arches. The logo featured a Blue Jay, superimposed on a baseball with a red maple leaf stuck in its ear. A key issue for Bavasi was hiring a manager.

The station also broadcasts the National Premier Leagues NSW competition each week in divisions 1, 2 & 3. In addition the station became the first in Australia to broadcast a World Rugby Sevens Series event in broadcasting all three days of the 2017 Sydney Sevens, and the station also broadcasts at least one game a week in the Shute Shield Sydney club rugby competition after previously broadcasting Penrith Emus games from 2001-2003.  Controversy  In October 2015, The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found Hawkesbury Radio in violation of its licence as a community broadcaster for failing to encourage community participation in the operations of the station. Following a lack of improvement by the station, the ACMA revoked Hawkesbury Radio's licence as a community broadcaster with the licence expiring on 3 October 2017.

Background  It is not known when Dai Zhide was born. His uncle Dai Zhou served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong but was sonless, and so adopted Dai Zhide as his son. After Dai Zhou's death in 633, Dai Zhide therefore inherited the title of Duke of Dao, a title that Emperor Taizong posthumously created Dai Zhou.  Service under Emperor Gaozong  Not much is known about much of Dai Zhide's career as an imperial official, although it was known that he was serving as an assistant to Li Hong, the son and crown prince of Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong in 671, when Emperor Gaozong and his wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) left the capital Chang'an and took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang, rarely returning to Chang'an thereafter. Emperor Gaozong left Li Hong in charge of Chang'an, but because Li Hong was often ill, it was said that the major decisions were largely made by Dai and his colleagues Zhang Wenguan and Xiao Dezhao (蕭德昭). As of 667, Dai was serving as Xi Tai Shilang (西臺侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (西臺, Xi Tai), when he was given the additional designation of Tong Dong Xi Tai Sanpin (同東西臺三品), making him a chancellor de facto. In 672, he became the minister of census and continued to serve as chancellor de facto. In 675, Dai became Puye, a co-head of the important examination bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), serving with the famed general Liu Rengui. It was said that they rotated listening to the people's petitions on every other day, and that Liu, who often would give the petitioners encouraging words, quickly gained a good reputation among them, while Dai was more careful with his words with them but often advocated for them before the emperor. Nevertheless, because of Liu's words, the common people came to believe that he was capable and Dai was not, and on one occasion, it was recorded that an old lady submitted a petition to Dai, believe that he was Liu, and once she realized her mistake, she yelled at Dai, \\"I thought I am giving my petition to the Puye who can do things, but instead I am giving it to the useless Puye. Give me back my petition!\\" Dai laughed and gave her petition back to her. When asked about this, Dai said, \\"Awards and punishments are within the authority of our sovereign. Given that we are subjects, how can we fight for this authority with him?\\" When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he greatly approved of Dai. Dai died in 679, and Emperor Gaozong sent the imperial officials to his house to mourn him.

It was the first spinning roller coaster in the United States to feature trains with multiple spinning cars, rather than an individual spinning car, like those found on a Reverchon or Zamperla Twister Coaster. It was also one of the first roller coasters to feature on- ride video recordings, as opposed to the traditional still on-ride photograph. History At the ACE Halloween Haunt event for the Southern California Region of American Coaster Enthusiasts, Jack Falfas, COO of Cedar Fair, hinted at something different in the coming year. Construction began shortly after the announcement with the removal of the Paddlewheel Boat Ride and relocation of Woodstock's Air Mail. Trains Sierra Sidewinder features two trains with four cars with two rows each, seating two per row back-to-back. Each car is locked in position in the station for stability during loading and unloading. Once the train leaves the station the cars spin freely on their own axis. After the train returns to the station, the cars are rotated back to the home position and the rotation is locked. The coaster is the first free-spinning model from Mack Rides of Waldkirch, Germany. Mack had previously built the spinning coaster, Euro-Mir, at its home park in Rust, Germany, but the car's rotation on that ride is controlled by a motor. The rotation is also locked during certain portions of the ride. The Sierra Sidewinder ride structure and transfer track are unusual because the train storage is beneath the ride as opposed to being next to the ride. The on-ride video recording that was present on the trains when the ride opened was removed as of the 2011 season. Small holes on the fronts and rears of each car indicate where the video cameras were mounted.

The magazine was marketed to people who enjoy \\"crafting\\" things and features projects which can often be completed with cheap materials, including household items. The magazine was in circulation between 2006 and 2009. Subjects Unlike more traditional craft magazines and how-to books, Craft: projects were aimed at a younger (18-35) audience. Projects in the first issue included making a stitched robot doll, a silver-thread and microprocessor- based programmable LED tank top, knit slouch boots, a minimalist 'catnip castle,' and an ant-farm room divider. Articles with names like \\"Subversive Cross Stitch,\\" \\"Battle Chic - craft a wardrobe of medieval armor with DIY chainmail,\\" and \\"The Lost Ipu Art of Ni‘ihau\\" are typical of the magazine's eclectic indie themes. Demographic Craft: was aimed at the emerging DIY culture in North America and Europe, particularly female, that enjoys not only the fashion of handmade items and crafts, but also the philosophy and politics inherent in recycling, DIY clothing, and ecology. The ads featured in Craft: targeted a readership that is largely liberal, and interested in locally produced, handmade, ecological, and organic goods and craft supplies. The demographic also is heavily computer literate, and blogs about their crafts and the crafts of their peers, thus ads for services such as web hosting and flickr were also found in the magazine's pages. Cancellation of the print version On 11 February 2009, e-mails were sent to Craft: subscribers explaining that due to rising production costs and shrinking ad markets, the print version of Craft: would be discontinued but would remain as an online presence. Also, all further printed content would be incorporated into Make:.

He was born in Ghent, Kentucky, his father died when he was 5 and his mother died the following year. He and his younger sister, Caroline, moved to Madison, New York to live with their grandfather Abner Burnham, a soldier of the American Revolutionary War, but Abner died soon thereafter. Burnham graduated Hamilton College, New York, in 1852 and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. On July 18, 1852 he was ordained, after having been stated supply at Columbus City, Iowa and he became a student at Union Theological Seminary in New York (1852–55). He graduated in 1855 and was licensed as a preacher of the gospel. He was a teacher in Pennington, New Jersey (1855–56), and a Pastor of Congressional Church in Wilton, Minnesota (1859–61). At Tivoli, Minnesota, an Indian Reservation, he preached and served as a missionary and also served as stated supply (1861–71). An exceptional marksman with a Kentucky long rifle, Burnham could consistently split in two a soft lead slug placed on an axe head from 100 and 200 yards. To most he was known as, \\"a Kentucky frontiersman and rifle shooting parson who could bark a squirrel, swing an axe or dispense Gospel with equal ferver and efficiency.\\" Rebecca Russell Burnham, wife Burnham was a key figure in the defense of New Ulm, Minnesota, helping to prevent the town from total destruction as it was attacked by Taoyateduta (Little Crow) and his Sioux warriors in the Dakota War of 1862. While he was in Mankato, Minnesota procuring lead and powder, his wife Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham was left alone in the cabin with Fred, the couple's not quite two-year-old boy. While brushing her hair, she froze at the flashing glimpse of war paint and war bonnets moving through the forest. Gathering up baby Fred, she realized she could not escape while carrying him, so she hid her baby in a stack of green corn shocks, running fast and deceptively to evade the Sioux war party. She reached a friendly homestead six miles away in time to see the smoke of her cabin. Returning the next morning with armed neighbors, Rebecca saw her burned-down cabin and she found her baby Fred still in the corn husks and still alive. Sometime after the Sioux hostilities had ended, Burnham sustained major injuries which led to his early death. He was carrying the logs from the ruins of his former cabin to build a barn when he slipped on an ice patch. As he fell, the log he was carrying crushed his chest resulting in compound rib fractures and the puncturing of one of his lungs. His failing health compelled him to give up the ministry, and in 1870 he moved his family to California—then a two-week trip by rail through still visible buffalo herds. From 1871 to 1873 he was an invalid. He died of consumption (tuberculosis) in Los Angeles, California. With the passing of Edwin, Rebecca and her two surviving children, Fred, then 11, and Howard, then 3, were left destitute. An uncle in Clinton, Iowa offered the family a home, but there was no money for the return journey. A family friend in Los Angeles, Mrs. Porter, lent Rebecca $125 for the trip; however, Fred steadfastly refused to leave, determined to find a job to provide his family some support and to repay Mrs. Porter, so Rebecca boarded the train with only baby Howard. Fred was an outstanding horse rider, and he knew the environs around Los Angeles, so he landed a job as a mounted messenger with Western Union. Even at this young age, Fred had already learned woodcraft from his frontiersman father. By the time he was 12, Fred was an expert with rifle or shotgun, hunting deer in Los Angeles, and at 13 he bought a Winchester model 1873 carbine, caliber .44-40. By 14, he had repaid his mother's debt to Mrs. Porter and he left California to live with his mother, brother, and uncle in Iowa. Family Maj Frederick Russell Burnham, eldest son Howard Burnham, youngest son Burnham was a descendant of Thomas Burnham (1617–1688) of Hartford, Connecticut, the first American ancestor of a large number of Burnhams. His father was Dr. Frederick Burnham (November 16, 1787 – ca. March 31, 1829) of East Hartford, Connecticut, a soldier invalided in the War of 1812 who went south to Kentucky to practice medicine, and his mother was Harriet (Woolridge) Burnham (April 14, 1794 – April 23, 1830). On July 3, 1860, he married Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham [Clapp] (July 12, 1842 – 1905) of Westminster, Middlesex, England in Sterling Township, Blue Earth, Minnesota. The family had three sons and one daughter, all born in Minnesota: * Frederick Russell Burnham (May 11, 1861 – September 1, 1947), the eldest son, became a highly decorated Major in the British Army, scouting in Africa and the United States, and the father of the international Scouting movement. * Edward Russell Burnham (November 29, 1863 – September 4, 1866) * Mary Maylin Burnham (November 7, 1867, July 14, 1868) * Matther Howard Burnham (May 27, 1870 – 1918), moved to Africa with his brother Fred, he was the chief chemist for a mine in Johannesburg, South Africa.

He served as gaikoku bugyō and rōjū in the Tokugawa administration. Biography Matsudaira Yasuhide was born in Edo to the high-ranking hatamoto Matsudaira Yasuzumi;Yasuzumi was the head of a branch family of the Matsui-Matsudaira, a collateral branch of the Tokugawa family his childhood name was Mantarō. He succeeded Yasuzumi upon the latter's retirement early in 1848, taking the name of Yasunao. Yasunao served in a variety of minor posts in the Tokugawa shogunate, before being appointed to the concurrent posts of gaikoku bugyō and Kanagawa bugyō in early 1860. From 1860 to 1861, he was involved in boundary negotiations with Russia, and was a member of the Tokugawa shogunate's embassy to Europe. Yasunao was adopted as the successor to Matsudaira Yasuhiro,Head of the main Matsui- Matsudaira family. lord of the Tanakura Domain, in late 1864. Shortly after his succession, he received the title of Suō no Kami and changed his name to Yasuhide. Yasuhide was slated for transfer to the Utsunomiya Domain in the spring of 1865; however, this was canceled. Soon afterward he was appointed to the position of rōjū. In 1866, he was again slated for transfer, this time to the Shirakawa Domain; however, because of the current ruling family's financial situation, this move was also canceled; Yasuhide was instead moved to the Kawagoe Domain. In Kawagoe, he is remembered for having opened the domain's school, the Chōzenkan (長善館). Yasuhide was relieved of his duties as rōjū during the disintegration of the Tokugawa government in early 1868.

Twohy wrote the screenplay, which is loosely based on the 1946 novella \\"Vintage Season\\" by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore (writing as Lawrence O'Donnell). Plot Haunted by the death of his wife, Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels), has recently returned to his hometown and purchased an old guest house on the outskirts of town, which he is renovating with his young daughter Hillary (Ariana Richards). When local bus driver Oscar arrives with a tour group from \\"South California\\", the group's leader insists on renting out the rooms at the guest house, pointedly rejecting Ben's suggestion that they could stay at his friends' large hotel in the middle of town. Ben soon begins to note their peculiar behaviour, manner and dress. Oscar points out the fact that, while they purport to be tourists, they do not carry cameras or take photographs. Shortly after they settle into their rooms, another stranger, Quish (David Wells), arrives to join them, and Ben notices the odd fact that Quish's clothes have a fine covering of ash. Ben's suspicions are heightened by events of the following day, when Quish has a minor accident while walking through the town. Ben helps him, in the process recovering Quish's dropped American passport, which he discovers has been stamped with locations inside the United States that are dated many decades apart. The local doctor then shows Ben an X-ray of Quish's head, which reveals that there is a mysterious object embedded in his skull. As they leave the surgery, Wilson confronts Quish, having deduced that the stamps correspond to the times and places of famous disasters, including the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the crash of the Hindenburg and the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption (hence the ash on Quish's clothing). Unnerved, Quish will only respond by warning Wilson to leave town immediately and not return until he is sure it is safe. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Ben, his vengeful father-in-law, Judge Caldwell (George Murdock) -- who blames Ben for his daughter's death -- has secretly arranged to have Hilary taken away from Ben on the grounds that he is an unfit parent. When Ben returns home, he finds Hilary gone and confronts the judge but is threatened with arrest; defeated, he goes to stay at the local hotel. There he is visited by Reeve, one of the Tourists, who confirms his suspicions about their true nature: they are time- travellers from the future who visit the scenes of famous disasters as part of a \\"Grand Tour\\" of the past. She then gives Ben a euphoric substance and seduces him, leaving him unconscious. Late that night, Ben is found and revived by Oscar. They return to the guest house to find out why the Tourists have come, but minutes later the town is struck by a large meteorite, resulting in almost total destruction. Ben races to the judge's shattered home, where he finds Hilary alive; heading back into town he finds the hotel destroyed and his friends dead, while the Tourists stroll through the devastation with an air of detached fascination. Ben and Hilary work through the night helping the survivors, who are taken to Hilary's local school, which has become the local disaster relief centre. When Ben and Oscar return to the guest house the next day, Ben is alarmed to discover that, although the Tourists have left the house, their luggage is still there. He and Oscar track them to an abandoned factory outside the town, where Ben realises that they are awaiting a second disaster which is about to strike the school. The tourists try to detain him, but he evades them and races to the scene, hoping to save Hilary. Meanwhile, maintenance workers accidentally damage a gas pipeline in the boiler room of the school, and just as Ben arrives, a hurricane lamp in the gymnasium ignites the leaking gas, destroying the school in a massive blast and killing most of the people inside, including Hilary and Quish, who has followed Ben to the building. Ben regains consciousness to find that he has been taken prisoner by the Tourists and that an official from their time, the Undersecretary (Robert Colbert), has arrived to investigate and try to remedy the disruptions to Ben's \\"Timescape\\". He explains that his people have discovered that time is more resilient than they had first believed. However, because of the changes enacted by Ben and the Tourists, all time excursions have been suspended pending a full investigation. Just before they depart, Ben attacks Reeve for her lack of humanity, but as she leaves she embraces him, secretly slipping Quish's passport into his hand. On examining the passport Ben discovers that it conceals one of the Tourists' time travel devices. He eventually makes it work and returns to the previous evening to try and save his daughter and the townsfolk from the disaster. Realising that Hilary is then at her grandfather's house, he tries to sneak her away, but he is caught and thrown into jail, which is itself soon to be destroyed. However he convinces the deputy to allow him his one phone call and manages to contact his pre-existing self at the hotel, just as that self is meeting with Reeve. This alternate self helps the 'original' Ben to escape from the jail and together they manage to alert and save most of the people by ringing the bells in the old church on the other side of town. Leaving Hilary with his 'earlier' self, the 'original' Ben walks through the scene of the impact; there he is again confronted by the Undersecretary, who had returned to take Ben back to his proper point in time. He warns Ben not to interfere any further and threatens to alter the past again to eliminate Ben's actions, but Ben challenges him by arguing that if the Undersecretary's assertions were true, his people would have already done so. In the final scene, we see Hilary taking bookings for the completed guest house, while Ben reads through old love letters from his late wife. When Hilary looks up, Ben has vanished and as the movie closes Hilary suddenly hears and is drawn towards the sound of someone playing her mother's favourite tune on the piano.

The Dockyard was suffering from a shortage of seasoned timber at the time Rodney was being built. In consequence the hull was built from unseasoned wood which quickly shrunk and rotted when exposed to seawater. After just three years at sea all of the hull fastenings had given way and Rodney was returned to Deptford for decommissioning.Albion 2000, p. 395 In 1827 she was reduced to a 50-gun ship, and in 1836 Rodney was sold out of the Navy.

Life  Paul Druecke received a B.F.A. in 1987 from Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design. In 1993, he started exhibiting with the Hermetic Gallery (1993-2001), an influential Milwaukee project space run by Nicholas Frank.Wireless in Wisconsin, Michelle Grabner Between 1996–2001, Druecke's one-person organization, Art Street Window, oversaw an innovative series of site-specific installations in vacant downtown storefronts.Urban Ingenuity, James Auer Druecke received a Mary L. Nohl Fellowship for Established Artists in 2010. His work was included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2014, he also contributed a site-specific project for Broadway Morey Boogie, organized by Marlborough Chelsea and the Broadway Mall Association in New York City.  Work  Paul Druecke is described as a conceptual artist.Green Gallery, Table of Contents His conceptual interests manifest as hybrid projects that combine vernacular materials, populist sentiments, subtle poetics, and a rigorous examination of site. Donna Stonecipher summarizes Druecke's nuanced art practice in her essay on his project Garden Path (2014), “As such, the work fits perfectly into Druecke's body of work, which ingeniously and tenaciously examines the fault lines of social space using a variety of idiosyncratic approaches.”Garden Path, Donna Stonecipher, exhibition catalog, Lynden Sculpture Garden Druecke's A Social Event Archive (1997–2007) foreshadowed the role of social media in blurring boundaries between the personal and public. Andrew Goldstein, writes “A Social Event Archive is viewed as having prefigured social sites like Instagram by inviting people to give him personal snapshots that he then displayed.”10 things the Whitney Biennial List will Tell Us, Andrew Goldstein David Robbins describes the Archive as “a People’s Photography,” saying the pictures reveal “the theatricalizing influence of cameras upon the human community.” and “... Paul Druecke is fascinated by the collective mind. The platform he’s invented employs both pictorial and structural means to present it.”Party Platform, David Robbins In 2000, Druecke christened a public expanse of concrete—that has no identifiable purpose—as Blue Dress Park. The project purposely blurred distinctions between artistic and civic agency by including city officials without seeking official sanction. For the ten-year anniversary of the park's christening, Druecke along with Sara Daleiden and numerous board members, formed the Friends of Blue Dress Park—a self-styled board that explores agency, legacy, and the social dynamics of board structure.Return to Blue Dress Park, Mary Louise Schumacher Writing about Druecke's five-city A Public Space (2003-2010), Stephanie Barber summarizes the project's deconstruction of authority and authorship, “Druecke's use of strangers and their perspectives in the creation of what is essentially a portrait is neither a collaboration nor could it be clearly be said to have been created by Druecke ... . It is a portrait of portraiture and portrait of interconnectivity and influence.”A Public Space, Stephanie Barber A discussion of Druecke's work, co-authored with Amanda Douberley, is included in the anthology, Blackwell Companion to Public Art (2016). Druecke has published two books, Life and Death on the Bluffs (2014) and The Last Days of John Budgen Jr. (2010), with Green Gallery Press.

Each HSF unit was placed with either a Regular Army or Territorial Army regiment or battalion for administrative purposes and given that formation’s title, cap badge and recruited from volunteers aged 18–60 with previous British forces (TA or regular) experience. It was introduced to guard key points and installations likely to be the target of enemy special forces and saboteurs, so releasing other units for mobile defence roles. It was stood down in 1992. History The pilot started in September 1982 and consisted of four companies that were used to relieve the army of guarding key points. The personnel consisted of 18- to 60-year-olds with a training obligation of 4-5 weekends per year. In 1984, there were platoons in 11 cities and the force began expanding to 5,000 persons nationwide, with the goal of establishing a platoon in every Territorial Army company by 1988. It was decided to disband the HSF in 1991 and the last unit was disbanded in 1993. There was never a common cap badge or regimental/corps crest for the Home Service Force. Each officer and soldier wore the cap badge of their sponsoring regiment or battalion. A modern crest does exist, granted to the Home Service Force Association, but to avoid confusion, it is not shown here. It can be viewed on The HSF Association website. Recruitment Comprising ex-regular, ex-territorial and ex-uniformed service personnel and the results proved to be much better than anticipated. The recruitment of ex-servicemen with a minimum of two years experience enabled units to come up to operational readiness very quickly. HSF Sub-Units There were at least 50 HSF squadrons or companies formed by 1985. Only one was a Royal Artillery battery. Each of these usually comprised three troops or platoons. Each company-sized unit operated under the command of a regiment or battalion. Regiments, in this case, were formations comprising three to four batteries or squadrons. Battalions had a similar number of companies, but could have many more. Secondly, on inspection of the list (below), there is a high potential for confusion between the HSF formations that existed at the time, and the Veterans' Groups that have been created since. As a general guide, it should be remembered that the HSF was designed to have a county presence; and this can be useful in ensuring accuracy. Some HSF formations had its headquarters and two platoons in one county, and a strong detached platoon in an adjacent county; other formations had all its platoons spread amongst separate towns; some formations had their entire organisation based at the same TA Centre. Many HSF troops and platoons (comprising approximately 30 soldiers) were based at a TA Centre that was managed by another unit; and local arrangements were necessary in order to operate. As a result, the personnel in that troop or platoon created a very strong bond of mutual friendship that ensured their survival, and which continues today in retirement. As a result, many HSF Veterans have become focused on their own troop or platoon experiences, sometimes to the detriment of those of their parent unit. As a result, troops or platoons may be listed (below), but they were actually part of a larger HSF formation. The Pilot HSF Companies (1982 - 1984/85) Four pilot Companies, formed in 1982, quickly became very popular and grew rapidly in personnel and in territory. In 1984/5, when plans to make the HSF official became known, their territories split, spawning new neighbouring units. For example, E (HSF) Coy 2nd Bn, The Wessex Regiment spawned HSF squadrons or companies in Devon, Wiltshire and Somerset. * Z (HSF) Coy 1st (V) Bn, 51st Highland Volunteers (HQ in Perth).

Cross references have been attempted. They are listed according to modern regiments or corps existing in 2012. While restructuring and realignment is always difficult to accept in a culture of intense rivalry such as this, the word \\"association\\" may have a variety of meanings. Each regiment and corps of the British Army has a number and even if absorbed into a new regiment or corps, its order of precedence can be calculated. It is hoped that the following order conforms to this. The HSF was organised in districts between 1985 and 1992, and while that order is offered on the HSF Association website, the order below has been attempted.

History and structure On 25 October 1918, a decision was made to establish the directorate of the chief of staff of the Polish Army. In 1928 the General Headquarters of the Polish Army was established, known commonly as the at the time as the Main Staff (Sztab Główny). In September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, all the institutions of the General Staff ceased to function and were transferred to joint German and Soviet. control. On 8 August 1944, the General Command of the Polish Army was created and on 1 January 1945, the National Council of Poland decided to establish the General Staff of the Polish Army, the head of which was appointed Soviet-Polish General Vladislav Korchits. The General Staff consists of the following organizational units in the Ministry of National Defence (MON): * Management Board of the Organization and Additions (P1) * Management of Intelligence and Reconnaissance Intelligence (P2) * Armed Forces Planning and Training Management Board (P3/P7) * Logistics Management (P4) * Management Board of Armed Forces Development Planning and Programming (P5) * Management and Command Board (P6) * Material Planning Board (P8) List of Chiefs =Kingdom of Poland (1917–1918)= ;Head of the Inspectorate ;Chief of Staff =Second Polish Republic (1918−1939)= =Polish government-in-exile (1939−1946)= =Republic of Poland / People's Republic of Poland (1945−1989)= =Third Polish Republic (1990−present)= Notes See also Badge for certified officers (with an academic degree) serving in the Polish General Staff (1918–1939). *Staff (military) *General Inspector of the Armed Forces References External links * Homepage 1918 establishments in Poland Military of Poland Poland ","title":"Polish General Staff"},{"id":"13280354","text":"Brobdingnagian Fairy Tales is a compilation of Irish pub songs, various pop culture inspired songs and parodies, and live versions of songs from the Bards' previous albums.

In the human body, the arms and the legs are commonly called the upper limbs and lower limbs respectively, to include part of the shoulder and hip girdles. Arms and legs are connected to torso or trunk. Many animals use limbs for locomotion, such as walking, running, or climbing. Some animals can use their forelimbs (which are homologous to arms in humans) to carry and manipulate objects. Some animals can also use hind limbs for manipulation. Human legs and feet are specialized for two-legged locomotion – most other mammals walk and run on all four limbs. Human arms are weaker, but very mobile, allowing them to reach at a wide range of distances and angles, and end in specialized hands capable of grasping and fine manipulation of objects. Though human dexterity is relatively unique, grasping behavior is widespread among tetrapods.  Terminology  The overall patterns of the forelimbs and hindlimbs are so similar ancestrally, and branch out in similar ways; that they are given shared names. Limbs are attached to the pectoral girdle or pelvic girdle. The one bony element of the upper limb is the stylopodium, the two bones of the lower limb are the zeugopodium. The distal portion of the limbs, that is, the hands or feet, are known as autopodia. Hands are technically known as the manus, and feet as the pes, which are both composed of carpals and digits. As metapodials, the metacarpals and metatarsals are analogous to each other.  Development  Limb development is controlled by Hox genes. All jawed vertebrates surveyed so far organize their developing limb buds in a similar way. Growth occurs from proximal to distal part of the limb. On the distal end, the differentiation of skeletal elements occurs in an apical ectodermal ridge (AER) which expands in rays. A Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA) at the rear part of the AER coordinates the differentiation of digits.

In addition to the comics and other promotional material, trading cards were released by Skybox in 1995 to preview this event. Card types The \\"DC Versus Marvel Comics\\" card set contained 100 normal cards (including checklist). The normal cards are divided into 4 basic types. Superman Hulk \\"Rival\\" type card Rival cards depict one Marvel and one DC hero with similar powers battling. The text on the back also tells the story of how the Marvel Vs. DC crossover came to be, and how it progressed. The back also only contains a single \\"Artist\\" attribution, whereas other cards differentiate between who did pencils, inks, and CGI where applicable. Wolverine \\"Hero\\" type card Hero cards show heroes from either Marvel or DC and having a red or blue back to the card respectively. Also the text on the back of the cards is written as though it is either Clark Kent (Superman) or Peter Parker (Spider- Man) speaking about the hero. Peter Parker (a Marvel character) talks about DC characters and Clark Kent (a DC character) talks about Marvel characters. The background on the back of a Hero cards is an indistinct explosion of some kind. Some, but not all, Hero cards also show a Marvel hero in a DC universe context (i.e. a location or holding an object specific to one universe) and the vice versa for DC characters. The Joker \\"Villain\\" type card Villain cards are laid out similar to Hero cards. They still have Clark Kent and Peter Parker text on the backs, with red and blue colors to show a villain's source universe, but the backs of the cards are slightly different. The background on the backs of a Villain card is a pair of evil-looking eyes. Similar to the Hero cards, some images show villains in contexts from their non-native universe. Azrael Vs. Sabretooth \\"Battles\\" type card Battles cards depict battles between a hero and another hero, a villain and another villain, or a hero and a villain. When it is a hero and a hero or villain and villain battling, it is similar to the Rival cards in that they share similar powers. When it is a hero and villain battling, it is often the case that the hero is battling the villain who is traditionally associated with the similar hero from the alternate universe. For instance Captain America battled Batman during the Marvel Vs. DC voting, and thus there is a card showing Captain America battle Batman's villain Bane. The Marvel Vs. DC trading card set contained 4 types of chase cards. 18 Impact cards were divided into 2 sets of 9 cards which each made a 9 card combined image when placed in standard 9 card protective sleeves. Additionally these cards were embossed giving them a raised texture. 12 Holo F/X card feature images from the normal cards \\"Rivals\\" types, but with special translucent and reflective foil layered over top to accentuate features such as the energy coming from Silver Surfer in the Silver Surfer Vs. Green Lantern card. Only the number one card, Sabretooth vs Azrael is a new different image. 2 Mirage cards featured lenticular images which changed as they are moved. These were special in that they showed not only one Marvel and one DC character, they also showed the Amalgam character that the two would be combined into in the future Amalgam comics and cards. The Mirage cards show the overlays of Spider-Man/Super-Boy/Spider-Boy and Wolverine/Batman/Dark Claw. 4 Amalgam Preview cards were also randomly inserted into packs. These cards were of the same style as the soon-to-be- released Amalgam card set. Two cards were of Dark Claw and two cards of Spider-Boy.

Life and career Sifton was the son of Bamlet Sifton (1793–1876) and his wife Mary (née Evans), members of the Anglo-Irish gentry who arrived in Upper Canada in 1832 from County Tipperary, Ireland. Members of the Sifton family, including Sifton's grandparents, Charles Sifton (1752–1842) and his wife, Rebecca (née Wright), had already established themselves in around present-day London, Ontario, in 1818 and 1819. Born in London Township, Ontario, he was educated at local schools. He married Kate Watkins (d. March 1909), third daughter of James Watkins, of Parsonstown, Kings County, Ireland in October 1853. and became a farmer and oil producer in Lambton County. Following the birth of his son, Clifford, in 1861, the elder Sifton became a railway contractor in Brant County and then a businessman in London, Ontario. The Siftons went on to have five children in all. In religion, Sifton was a Wesleyan Methodist, and in politics he was a Reformer, and supporter of and campaigner for George Brown and Alexander Mackenzie. When Mackenzie as Prime Minister formed Canada's first Liberal government in 1874, Sifton was rewarded with contracts to build two sections of rail line between northern Ontario and Manitoba and telegraph lines in the latter province. In 1875, Sifton relocated to Manitoba, settling in Selkirk, and became involved in the new province's political life. Sifton was twice elected to the Manitoba legislature including in the 1879 provincial election as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for St. Clements, and served as the first Liberal Speaker of the body from February to December 1879 when he left the legislature. He was elected again as MLA in 1881 representing the new constituency of Brandon, however, he was defeated in his bid for re-election. He attempted to regain a seat in the 1886 election, but was defeated once again. Sifton moved to Brandon, Manitoba to take part in the town's land boom, but suffered when the boom turned into a bust. He operated a large farm there and served two terms as reeve for the Rural Municipality of Cornwallis. After his 1886 defeat he moved to California for two years. He eventually returned to Manitoba and filled a series of patronage positions serving as deputy minister of public works in the government of Thomas Greenway and then as inspector of public institutions. In 1902, Sifton became vice-president of the Manitoba Free Press Company and subsequently served as its president. He was also a strong supporter of prohibition and advocated passage of the Canada Temperance Act. One of his sons, Sir Clifford Sifton, would subsequently be elected in the 1888 provincial election, however, and served as Attorney-General of Manitoba and Education minister in the 1890s and would go on to have a successful career in federal politics under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Another son, Arthur Lewis Watkins Sifton, would serve as Premier of Alberta.

Vacek and J. Michl, A molecular \\"Tinkertoy\\" construction kit: Computer simulation of molecular propellers, New J. Chem. 21, 1259 1997. it has several molecular- scale blades attached at a certain pitch angle around the circumference of a shaft, aligned along the rotational axis. The molecular propellers designed in the group of Prof. Petr Král from the University of Illinois at Chicago have their blades formed by planar aromatic molecules and the shaft is a carbon nanotube. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these propellers can serve as efficient pumps in the bulk and at the surfaces of liquids. Their pumping efficiency depends on the chemistry of the interface between the blades and the liquid. For example, if the blades are hydrophobic, water molecules do not bind to them, and the propellers can pump them well. If the blades are hydrophilic, water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the atoms in the polar blades. This can largely block the flow of other water molecules around the blades and significantly slow down their pumping. Driving Molecular propellers can be rotated by molecular motors that can be driven by chemical, biological, optical and electrical means, or various ratchet-like mechanisms. Nature realizes most biological activities with a large number of highly sophisticated molecular motors, such as myosin, kinesin, and ATP synthase. For example, rotary molecular motors attached to protein-based tails called flagella can propel bacteria. Applications In a similar way, the assembly of a molecular propeller and a molecular motor can form a nanoscale machine that can pump fluids or perform locomotion. Future applications of these nanosystems range from novel analytical tools in physics and chemistry, drug delivery and gene therapy in biology and medicine, advanced nanofluidic lab- on-a-chip techniques, to tiny robots performing various activities at the nanoscale or microscale.

The episode was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Ken Whittingham. It first aired in the United States on October 11, 2007 on NBC. In this episode, Dunder Mifflin prepares for the launch of their new website. Dwight tries to outsell the website, Andy makes a move for Angela, and Michael kidnaps a pizza delivery boy (Kevin McHale).  Plot  In the opening scene, Michael has arranged a meeting to discuss making the Quarterly Report more exciting, unaware that the office workers are all more interested in the DVD screensaver, and believes their disappointment whenever the bouncing box on the screensaver doesn't make it into a corner are reactions to his statements. Eventually, the box does make it into a corner, and the cheering employees all leave, to his confusion. Dunder Mifflin is preparing a party for the launch of their new website \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\". Since Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) doesn't want to go to the launch party, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) invites Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), who makes Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) take her place. Only after they reach New Jersey does Jim realize that Michael received an \\"invitation\\" to a chat room, not the actual party. Jim also reveals that he turned down the Corporate job that Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) accepted. Michael returns to Scranton dejected and attempts to plan a better party. This irritates party planner Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), who has already been in an exceptionally irritable mood. She viciously and patronizingly takes out her frustrations on fellow Party Planning Committee member Phyllis, who quits the committee in frustration. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) decides to compete against the website to see who can make more sales. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) keeps a running tally of reams sold, blowing an airhorn each time Dwight makes a sale. Irritated by the distraction, Jim and Pam plot a prank. They send Dwight instant messages pretending to be the company's computer system, taunting Dwight to believe it has achieved self-awareness. Dwight wins the challenge, but when he gloats to Angela about his victory, she rejects him outright and makes it clear that they are broken up for good. She also asks Pam to set her up with a single friend of hers. Pam, feeling sorry for Dwight, sends another message as the computer acknowledging him as a superior being. Andy later sets up a conference call with some of his old Cornell friends to serenade Angela with \\"Take a Chance on Me\\"; she doesn't agree to date him, but appears to be somewhat charmed by the spectacle. Michael finally realizes that Ryan doesn't respect him, and once he gets online for the party's chat room he snaps that Dwight single-handedly outsold DMI and curses at Ryan. But his emotional reactions haven't stopped for the night: he is angered after everyone complains that he confused the office's favorite pizza place (Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, which is a real restaurant in Scranton) with a terrible pizza place (Pizza by Alfredo, which is fictional). When his coupon is then refused, he takes a stand for justice and holds the teenaged delivery driver (Kevin McHale) hostage, with both he and Dwight acting out their frustrations about Ryan and Angela, respectively. After some time, Michael realizes he is breaking the law and lets the kid go, and then heads up to crash the party in NYC and get some sushi, with Dwight joining him. They get to enjoy a little leftover food, but Michael's most cheered when one of the younger Corporate workers says they liked his rant against Ryan and \\"It was funny to see Ryan embarrassed by all that\\", and heads home in good spirits. Production \\"Launch Party\\" was the sixth episode of the series directed by Ken Whittingham. Whittingham had previously directed \\"Health Care\\", \\"Michael's Birthday\\", \\"The Convention\\", \\"The Merger\\", and \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\". \\"Launch Party\\" was written by Jennifer Celotta, making it the sixth episode written by her. According to Jennifer Celotta, the idea for the first scene of the episode where the office workers are watching a logo bounce around a television screen, came when the writers were in a room watching the DVD logo bounce around the television screen, and were arguing about whether it would ever hit the corner. Reception \\"Launch Party\\" received a 5.2 Nielsen Rating and an 8% Share. The episode was watched by 8.91 million viewers and achieved a 4.7/11 in the key adults 18–49 demographic. \\"Launch Party\\" received mixed reviews from critics. TV Squad's Jay Black wondered why the writers \\"feel the need to veer off into increasingly more ridiculous places\\", especially because The Office is \\"hailed by critics and adored by fans for its ability to find humor in the smallest pieces of real-life human interaction\\". Black did say that except for the kidnapping, he \\"thought tonight's episode was the best of the season.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN wrote that \\"Launch Party\\" was \\"a very entertaining episode with some terrific moments.\\" Fickett did say that with all the hour-long episodes \\"things start to feel stretched and some scenes take on a sense of redundancy and certain storylines seem to peter out before they even get going.\\" References External links *\\"Launch Party\\" at NBC.com  The Office (American season 4) episodes 2007 American television episodes The Office (American TV series) episodes in multiple parts ","title":"Launch Party"},{"id":"13280525","text":"Ana Lenchantin is an Argentine-American cellist of French ancestry,\\" \\" known for frequent appearances with American rock bands such as Train, Into the Presence, The Eels, Gnarls Barkley, No Doubt, Arthur Lee and Love, A Perfect Circle, Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Brian Wilson, Billy Corgan, Billy Howerdel, Glenn Hughes, Jenny Lewis, Melissa Auf der Maur, Damien Rice, Kerli, Lenka, and many more.

The Heraclians presided over a period of cataclysmic events that were a watershed in the history of the Empire and the world in general. At the beginning of the dynasty, the Empire's culture was still essentially Ancient Roman, dominating the Mediterranean and harbouring a prosperous Late Antique urban civilization. This world was shattered by successive invasions, which resulted in extensive territorial losses, financial collapse and plagues that depopulated the cities, while religious controversies and rebellions further weakened the Empire. By the dynasty's end, the Empire had evolved a different state structure: now known in historiography as medieval Byzantium, a chiefly agrarian, military-dominated society that was engaged in a lengthy struggle with the Muslim Caliphate. However, the Empire during this period was also far more homogeneous, being reduced to its mostly Greek-speaking and firmly Chalcedonian core territories, which enabled it to weather these storms and enter a period of stability under the successor Isaurian Dynasty. The Heraclian dynasty was named after the general Heraclius the Younger, who, in 610, sailed from Carthage, overthrew the usurper Phocas, and was crowned Emperor. At the time, the Empire was embroiled in a war with the Sassanid Persian Empire, which in the next decade conquered the Empire's eastern provinces. After a long and exhausting struggle, Heraclius managed to defeat the Persians and restore the Empire, only to lose these provinces again shortly after to the sudden eruption of the Muslim conquests. His successors struggled to contain the Arab tide. The Levant and North Africa were lost, while in 674–678, a large Arab army besieged Constantinople itself. Nevertheless, the state survived and the establishment of the Theme system allowed the imperial heartland of Asia Minor to be retained. Under Justinian II and Tiberios III the imperial frontier in the East was stabilized, although incursions continued on both sides. The latter 7th century also saw the first conflicts with the Bulgars and the establishment of a Bulgarian state in formerly Byzantine lands south of the Danube, which would be the Empire's chief antagonist in the West until the 12th century. Background The Byzantine Empire after Heraclius reconquered the Eastern Provinces from the Sassanids. Ever since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire continued to see Western Europe as rightfully Imperial territory. However, only Justinian I attempted to enforce this claim with military might. Temporary success in the West was achieved at the cost of Persian dominance in the East, where the Byzantines were forced to pay tribute to avert war. However, after Justinian's death, much of newly recovered Italy fell to the Lombards, and the Visigoths soon reduced the imperial holdings in Spain. At the same time, wars with the Persian Empire brought no conclusive victory. In 591 however, the long war was ended with a treaty favorable to Byzantium, which gained Armenia. Thus, after the death of Justinian's successor Tiberius II, Maurice sought to restore the prestige of the Empire. Even though the Empire had gained smaller successes over the Slavs and Avars in pitched battles across the Danube, both enthusiasm for the army and faith in the government had lessened considerably. Unrest had reared its head in Byzantine cities as social and religious differences manifested themselves into Blue and Green factions that fought each other in the streets. The final blow to the government was a decision to cut the pay of its army in response to financial strains. The combined effect of an army revolt led by a junior officer named Phocas and major uprisings by the Greens and Blues forced Maurice to abdicate. The Senate approved Phocas as the new Emperor and Maurice, the last emperor of the Justinian Dynasty, was murdered along with his four sons. The Persian King Khosrau II responded by launching an assault on the Empire, ostensibly to avenge Maurice, who had earlier helped him to regain his throne. Phocas was already alienating his supporters with his repressive rule (introducing torture on a large scale), and the Persians were able to capture Syria and Mesopotamia by 607. By 608, the Persians were camped outside Chalcedon, within sight of the imperial capital of Constantinople, while Anatolia was ravaged by Persian raids. Making matters worse was the advance of the Avars and Slavic tribes heading south across the Danube and into Imperial territory. While the Persians were making headway in their conquest of the eastern provinces, Phocas chose to divide his subjects rather than unite them against the threat of the Persians. Perhaps seeing his defeats as divine retribution, Phocas initiated a savage and bloody campaign to forcibly convert the Jews to Christianity. Persecutions and alienation of the Jews, a frontline people in the war against the Persians helped drive them into aiding the Persian conquerors. As Jews and Christians began tearing each other apart, some fled the butchery into Persian territory. Meanwhile, it appears that the disasters befalling the Empire led the Emperor into a state of paranoia — although it must be said that there were numerous plots against his rule and execution followed execution. Among those individuals who were executed was the former empress Constantina and her three daughters. Heraclius =Phocas deposed by Heraclius the Younger= Solidus of Heraclius' reign, showing his son Constantine III as co-emperor. Due to the overwhelming crisis facing the Empire that had pitched it into chaos, Heraclius the Younger now attempted to seize power from Phocas in an effort to better Byzantium's fortunes. As the Empire was led into anarchy, the Exarchate of Carthage remained relatively out of reach of Persian conquest. Far from the incompetent Imperial authority of the time, Heraclius, the Exarch of Carthage, with his brother Gregorius, began building up his forces to assault Constantinople. After cutting off the grain supply to the capital from his territory, Heraclius led a substantial army and a fleet in 608 to restore order in the Empire. Heraclius gave the command of the army to Gregorius' son, Nicetas, whilst command of the fleet went to Heraclius' son, Heraclius the Younger. Nicetas took part of the fleet and his forces to Egypt, seizing Alexandria towards the end of 608. Meanwhile, Heraclius the Younger headed to Thessalonica, from where, after receiving more supplies and troops, he sailed for Constantinople. He reached his destination on 3 October 610, where he was unopposed as he landed off the shores of Constantinople, citizens greeting him as their deliverer. When Phocas was delivered to Heraclius, an interesting conversation took place: The reign of Phocas officially ended in his execution and the crowning of Heraclius by the Patriarch of Constantinople two days later on 5 October. A statue of Phocas that rested in the Hippodrome was pulled down and set aflame, along with the colors of the Blues that supported Phocas. =Early failures= After having married his wife in an elaborate ceremony and crowned by the Patriarch, the 36-year-old Heraclius set out to perform his work as Emperor. The early portion of his reign yielded results reminiscent of Phocas' reign with respect to trouble in the Balkans. The Avars and Slavs poured through the western Adriatic, as well as through the southern and eastern portions of the Aegean area. Their sweeping movement into Dalmatia engulfed several Byzantine cities, namely Singidunum (Belgrade), Viminacium (Kostolac), Naissus (Niš), Sardica (Sofia), and destroyed Salona in 614. However, numerous attempts to take the city of Thessalonica by the Slavs and Avars ended in failure, allowing the Empire to hold onto a vital city in the region. In 613, the Byzantine army suffered a crushing defeat at Antioch, allowing the Persians to move freely and swiftly in all directions. This surge caused the cities of Damascus and Tarsus to fall, along with Armenia. More seriously, however, was the loss of Jerusalem, which was besieged and captured by the Persians in three weeks. Countless churches in the city (including the Holy Sepulchre) were burnt and numerous relics, including the True Cross, the Holy Lance and the Holy Sponge, present at the time of Jesus Christ's death, were now in Ctesiphon, the Persian capital. The Persians remained poised outside of Chalcedon, not too far from the capital, and the province of Syria was in total chaos. Despite Nicetas' earlier efforts, Egypt was also conquered, resulting in a significant loss in manpower, food supplies and revenue. However, the situation was not entirely hopeless. Constantinople's walls were as powerful and well-defended as ever, and Heraclius still had a large, better-trained, and better-armed fleet than any of his \\"barbarian\\" opponents (especially the Slavs and Avars). The Persians had no vessels in the Bosporus, and thus unable to effectively besiege the city. =Byzantine counter offensive= The Arsanias River, now known as the Murat River in modern Turkey. To recover from a seemingly endless number of defeats, Heraclius went about a reconstruction plan of the military, financing it by fining those accused of corruption, increasing taxes, and debasing the currency to pay more soldiers and forced loans. The Patriarch of Constantinople, Sergius, placed the finances of the Church into the hands of the State, a surprising but well-needed sacrifice. Heraclius now aimed to eliminate one of his dangerous foes, the Sassanid Empire. The Persians had conquered extensive amounts of territory in Anatolia, Mesopotamia, the Levant, and North Africa, but had yet to consolidate their hold on it. Heraclius decided to negotiate a peace with the Avars and Slavs by paying them a large amount of tribute so that he could freely move his armies from Europe to Asia in order to launch counter-offensives against the Persians. With his Eastern opponents still outside Chalcedon, in the spring of 622 Heraclius took the field. He sailed his newly created army down the Ionian coast and landed at Issus, the exact site where Alexander the Great had decisively defeated the Persians some 1,000 years prior. At Issus, Heraclius oversaw the extensive training of his men. In the autumn of that year, he marched his army northwards and encountered a Persian force in the Cappadocian highlands. Despite having no military experience in leading an army in the field, the Byzantine Emperor decisively routed the forces of the experienced Persian General Shahrbaraz, boosting his army's morale and recovering large amounts of territory. In early 623, Heraclius led his forces through Armenia and modern- day Azerbaijan. By moving towards Armenia, this forced the Persians to move from their positions in Asia Minor and to follow the army \\"like a dog on a chain\\". It was in Armenia that the Byzantine army once again found success against the Persian general Shahrbaraz, winning a large victory. Events in the capital forced Heraclius and his army to return to Constantinople, as the Avar Khan was threatening action on the city. Heraclius was forced to increase the tribute being paid to the Avars, even having to go as far as sending hostages to the Khan to ensure payment. This once again shored up his rearguard, allowing him to re-engage the Persian army in March 623, as the Persian king Chosroes II had become ever more belligerent in his attitude, spurning a truce. On the way to Persia, the Byzantine army pillaged and looted extensively, including the destruction of the Persian palace at Ganzak. Burning numerous cities of his opponents, Heraclius made a risky decision and led his troops deep within the heartland of the Sassanid Empire to Ctesiphon, the Persian capital. However, Shahrbaraz began cutting off Heraclius' supply lines, forcing the latter to withdraw to the western shore of the Caspian Sea. There, his second wife and niece (Martina) safely delivered a child, although the marriage was seen by many as incestuous. In 624, Heraclius led another campaign towards Lake Van. However, the victory that he sought would not come to him until the following year. Leading his army through Ararat down the Arsanias River for some to capture the cities of Martyropolis and Amida, Heraclius finally encountered a Persian army north of the town of Adana after marching through Mesopotamia. Initially, the battle went well for the Persians, as they obliterated the vanguard of the Byzantine army. However, Heraclius then seized the initiative by launching a seemingly suicidal charge across the River Euphrates, thus turning the tide of the battle. Shahrbaraz expressed his admiration at Heraclius to a renegade Greek: =Siege of Constantinople= Battle between Heraclius and the Persians. Fresco by Piero della Francesca, c. 1452 Victory belonged to the Byzantines, and now, the honours of the war were even. However, the Persian threat was not yet diminished. The long-awaited assault on Constantinople was finally beginning to materialize — the Avars began moving siege equipment towards the Capital (the siege began on June 29, 626) whilst Shahrbaraz was ordered by King Khosrau II to send his army to Chalcedon and link up with the Avars. Khosrau began conscripting able-bodied men into a new army, raising a crack force of approximately 50,000 men. Heraclius, it seems, was not only being outmaneuvered, but being outmaneuvered by several larger armies. However, Heraclius attempted to match the Persians by duplicating their strategy and dividing his forces into three separate contingents. One army would defend the capital, whilst another, under the command of the Emperor's brother Theodore, would face the 50,000 conscripts in Mesopotamia who were commanded by the Persian General Shahin. Meanwhile, the third, which would be personally commanded by the Emperor, would march through Armenia and the Caucasus and into Persia, which he believed would have been stripped of most of the able- bodied men due to Khosrau's conscription. This would allow his forces to easily advance into the heartland of Persia. Theodore's contingent fared well against Shahin in Mesopotamia, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Persians. During this battle, at Constantinople, the city was well defended with a force of some 12,000 cavalry (presumably dismounted), supported by the entire city's population. Indeed, the efforts of the Patriarch Sergius in whipping up the population into a religious and patriotic frenzy cannot be overlooked. When the Byzantine fleet annihilated a Persian and an Avar fleet in two separate ambushes, the besiegers appeared to have withdrawn in panic. And when word of Theodore's victory in Mesopotamia came, it was concluded by the besiegers that Byzantium was now under the protection of the Romans' Christian God. =Triumph= Heraclius overcoming Khosrau II; plaque from a cross (Champlevé enamel over gilt copper, 1160–1170, Paris, Louvre) For Heraclius, 626 was a year of little action — it appears that in an attempt to bolster his forces, he promised the hand of his daughter Epiphania to the Khan of the Western Turkic Khaganate, Ziebel. Impressed by the offer, the Khan fielded some 40,000 troops on the Byzantine side. However, the Khan died just two years later, in 628. Nonetheless, Byzantium made good use of the boost in troops when Heraclius marched into Mesopotamia the following year. His objective was clear: to destroy the Persians' army and march to Ctesiphon, doing what no Roman Emperor had done in nearly three-hundred years (since the days of Julian the Apostate): . His army marched cautiously into this hostile terrain. It was known to Heraclius that a Persian force was close and an ambush was always a possibility. Meanwhile, Rhahzadh, the new Persian commander, was also not keen to face Heraclius until his army was ready for a pitched battle. After spending a greater part of 627 in Mesopotamia, Heraclius finally encountered the Persian army close to the ruins of the city of Ninevah. For eleven hours, the Byzantines and the Persians fought each other continuously. In the thick of the fighting Razates issued a challenge to Heraclius, who accepted. Despite being wounded, Heraclius managed to decapitate Razates. When the sun finally began to set, the Persians had been defeated and both armies rested. Heraclius later moved on to the Great Palace of Dastagird only to discover that Khosrau II had fled his Palace. In a fit of rage, Heraclius ordered that everything be burnt to the ground. Moving on, he soon found that Khosrau no longer commanded the loyalty of his subjects — as they refused to rally to defend Ctesiphon. Heraclius waited a week or two before marching his army back. Khosrau's son Siroes took power as Kavadh II and had his father shot to death with arrows. Later, the formation of a peace treaty favourable to the Byzantines led to the restoration of the pre-war boundaries. As an added bonus, all captives and Christian relics that had been captured by the Persians were returned. Thus, it was at the head of the True Cross that Heraclius entered the Capital on September 14, 628 triumphant. Leading a procession which included four elephants, the True Cross was placed high atop the altar of the Hagia Sophia. By this time, it was generally expected by the Byzantine populace that the Emperor would lead Byzantium into a new age of glory. However, all of Heraclius' achievements would come to naught, when, in 633, the Byzantine-Arab Wars began. =Decline= The threat of the Arabs from Arabia was overlooked by both Persia and Byzantium for several reasons — most compelling of all were the wars between the two powers, and the lack of communication across the desert expanse. Nonetheless, efforts were conducted, sometimes cooperatively, by the Byzantines and the Persians to stop the advance of the Arabs. On 8 June 632, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad died of a fever. However, the religion he left behind would transform the Middle East. In 633, the armies of Islam marched out of Arabia, their goal to spread the word of the prophet. In 634, the Arabs defeated a Byzantine force sent into Syria and captured Damascus. The arrival of another large Byzantine army outside Antioch forced the Arabs to retreat. The Byzantines advanced in May 636. However, a sandstorm blew on 20 August 636 against the Byzantines and when the Arabs charged against them they were utterly annihilated: Jerusalem surrendered to the Arabs in 637, following a stout resistance; in 638, the Caliph Omar rode into the city. Heraclius stopped by Jerusalem to recover the True Cross whilst it was under siege. In his old age he was becoming increasingly unstable in his rule. Once the commander of his father's fleet, he developed a phobia of the sea, and refused to cross the Bosporus to the capital. Only when several boats were tied along the length of the strait with shrubs placed along to hide the water did he ride across, \\"as if by land\\" as a contemporary put it. Because of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 both Byzantines and Persians exhausted themselves and made them vulnerable for the expansion of the Caliphate. The Arab invasions and loss of territory was not all that bore heavily upon the Emperor's mind. It was rumoured that the incestuous marriage to his niece had incurred the wrath of God — of the nine children that he had, four had died in infancy, one had a twisted neck and one was deaf and dumb. Furthermore, it appears that the Empire was not even considering the Arab threat as a danger. The religious controversies once again emerged when the Patriarch of Constantinople Sergius proposed monothelitism as a compromise to the Chalcedonian Christians and the Monophysites. Heraclius agreed to the proposal. However, it received much criticism from both sides of the theological debate of Christ's true nature. When Sophronius, a major critic of monothelitism was elected as Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Empire began once again to tear itself apart. To some in the Empire the Arabs' promise of religious freedom seemed preferable to the other, seemingly blasphemous politically motivated proposals. At his death bed on 11 February 641, Heraclius died whispering that he had lied; he was reluctant to support monothelitism. It appears that unity was all that he sought. The Byzantine Empire after the Arabs conquered the provinces of Syria and Egypt. At the same time the Slavs laid pressure and settled in the Balkan. Before his death Heraclius was \\"persuaded\\" by his wife Martina to crown her son Heraclonas (Flavius Heraclius) co-heir to the throne of the Empire with Constantine, the son of Heraclius' first wife Eudocia — all the meanwhile ignoring the numerous Byzantines who saw her as the reason for Byzantium's recent misfortunes. Her ambitions for power ensured that Byzantium would continue to succumb to disorder. =Assessment for his rule= Heraclius's reign was one of mixed fortunes. He started his reign by losing the eastern provinces, brought it to its peak by retaking them against all odds, and ended it by losing them again. It was Heraclius who first withdrew the eastern field armies into Anatolia, sowing the seeds of the Theme system, and it was he who, through depopulation and the razing of fortifications, stabilized the Anatolian frontier, which would remain largely unchanged for the next 350 years. By Heraclius's late reign, proper Latin had been reduced to a military and ceremonial role outside of the Exarchates, replaced by Greek as the language of court and high administration. This was the result of natural demographic shifts, and there was never an official change from language one to the other, as is sometimes claimed. He was also the first emperor to, after defeating the Persians, officially adopt the title of Basileus, \\"King\\" in Greek, though the title had been used unofficially for centuries; Procopius used the title frequently, for example. There is no indication, as is, again, sometimes claimed, that Basileus became Heraclius's \\"primary\\" title, and other prominent Imperial titles since ancient/Latin era of the Empire, such as Augustus and Imperator, remained in varying degrees of use for the remainder of the empire's lifetime. Had Heraclius lived only until 629, he might have been remembered for his successful military reorganization and impressive handling of the last Persian war, which saw hope and victory snatched from the jaws of defeat. However, his lengthy life meant that the Byzantines remembered him for his religious controversies, failures against the Arabs, and incestuous marriage to his niece, which many believed to have brought divine retribution upon the entire Empire. After his death, Heraclius' corpse remained unburied for three days, guarded by his soldiers until it was laid to rest in the Church of the Holy Apostles within a sarcophagus of white onyx next to the founder of his Empire, Constantine I. The Theme system The establishment of the themes in the Byzantine Empire The army of the Empire that Heraclius worked so hard to improve eventually was reorganized in Asia Minor into four Themes, in what is now known as the Theme system. This system was originally credited by Byzantine historians like George Ostrogorsky to Heraclius. He provides Theophanes as a source, quoting the expression \\"the district of the themes\\" in the year 622, showing the themes had begun to be created at this time. Ostrogorsky states in the footnotes that in Theophanes 303(under the year 622), \\"the expression 'the districts of the themes' shows that the process of establishing troops (themes) in specific areas of Asia Minor has already begun at this time.\\" However, there is evidence presented by some modern historians that it could possibly be credited to Constans, Treadgold in the footnotes states that Constantine VII's De Thematibus first mentions the system under Constans in 668, and that because he was in the West at the time, Constans had to have first organized the themes before 662. Treadgold supposes that Constantine had access to state archives when he wrote it in the 10th century. and yet others leave the door open that Heraclius could possibly have done so in the late 630s in Cilicia. In any case, the debate over exactly when the thematic system originated continues on. The administrative regions created from this system were to be governed by a strategos, a military governor. The aim of these Themes was to maximize military potential — many able-bodied men and their families were settled in these four themes and given land for farming. In return for land, these men were to provide the Empire with loyal soldiers, and so began the Thematic armies of the Byzantine Empire that would prove to be reliable, though not unbeatable fighting force for centuries to come. Nonetheless, a native, well-trained army loyal to the state would serve the Empire far more than ill-disciplined mercenaries, whose loyalty to coin could be manipulated and turned against the state itself, as had been exemplified during the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. Constans II =Death of Heraclius= Solidus of Constans II. Heraclius' inability to rule the Empire as his death neared did Byzantium no favors. After Heraclius' death in 641, the former Empress Martina declared herself, her son, Heracleonas, and her stepson, Constantine, co-emperors of the Byzantine Empire. However, the citizens of Constantinople refused to accept this. And so, when Constantine III died sometime between May 24 and May 26, 641 (considered by the majority of the Byzantines to have been done by Martina's hand), Heracleonas and his mother were deposed the following summer. Heraclonas' nose was slit and Martina's tongue was wrenched out. These acts ensured that Heraclonas could never become Basileus (Emperor) – the physical deformation would have made it impossible. However, as suspects of committing regicide, their exile to the island of Rhodes was a light punishment. With Constantine dead, the populace of Constantinople turned to his 11-year-old son (also known as Heraclius) who was crowned as the Byzantine Emperor, and changed his name to Constans, thus becoming Constans II. =Wars with the Arabs= Constans II had inherited from his grandfather Heraclius the war with the Arabs, who were bent on conquering the Byzantine Empire and spreading the word of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Upon his ascension, there was little time to implement a defence for Egypt — and when the province fell in 642, Constans II could hardly be blamed. The loss of Egypt and the Levant was catastrophic — along with the manpower from these regions, the substantial supply of food from Egypt was now but a thing of the past. Food shortages were now added to an increasing list of problems that the Emperor was facing. And to make matters worse for the Byzantines, the Arab armies gave no respite — by 647 the Exarchate of Carthage had been decisively defeated — another costly defeat as Africa was the Empire's main source of grain, aside from already lost Egypt. The list of defeats would continue to grow, as in 644, the Arabs began building a sizable fleet to take on the centuries of Greco-Roman naval dominance. In 657, the Arab fleet was sent to raid the Byzantine island of Cyprus — the island was barely defended, and the Arabs sacked the chief city of Constantia, destroyed its harbor installations, and ravaged the countryside. In 654, the Muslim fleet continued unopposed to the island of Rhodes. After the island fell, Constans II suffered another humiliating defeat at the Battle of the Masts, when he sent his fleet to engage the Arabs off Lycia. During the engagement, Constans II, fearing the possibility of being captured, exchanged clothing with another man so that he could escape without being identified. Though never captured, the experience was rather embarrassing for the so-called \\"King of Kings\\". Respite By this point, the Arabs appeared to the Romans as invincible, and thus, could only hinder themselves. Fortunately for Byzantium, the Arabs began to do just that. The Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated in Medina. As a result, Ali, the Islamic Prophet Muhammed's son-in law was elected as his successor. However, Muawiya, the governor of Syria who led the Arab fleet against Byzantium, was proclaimed Caliph in Syria, as well. Only when Ali was assassinated in 661 did the civil strife end, much to Byzantium's disappointment. =Attempts to deal with religious controversies= Clearly, Byzantium stood no chance whatsoever of defending herself against her opponents when bishops tore the Empire over theological debates. Constans II saw this and it seems that he had enough of it. In 648, Constans still only 18 years of age, declared an edict that no one would raise the monethelism/chalcedon controversy under the pain of banishment, following an excommunication by the Pope Theodore I to the Patriarch of Constantinople Pyrrhus. When Theodore's successor, Martin I once again added fuel to the fire by summoning a council in condemnation of Monethelitism in October 648, he was arrested, brought to the capital and badly mistreated as a common criminal. In prison it is said that his mistreatment was \\"such that blood was on the floor.\\" Finally, after being accused of treason and regicide he was banished to the Crimea. Such was the frustration of the Emperor. =To the West= Constans II decided to turn his attention to the West in the hope of achieving better luck. Whilst the Saracens were establishing themselves in former Byzantine territory, the Avars and Bulgars still remained along the Danube river, as did the Slavs, whose annual payment to the Empire was falling short. Constans II then decided to move his capital to Syracuse in Sicily in 662. Some say that this was to escape horrible visions of his brother whom he had murdered 2 years past. His stay in Italy and Sicily can only be imagined as unpleasant for the locals. Everything of any value in Rome was requisitioned by the Byzantine army — even copper from the rooftops. It was to many people's relief that Constans II was murdered while bathing by his Greek servant on 15 September 668. Constans II left the Empire in a worse state than he had found it. The Byzantine-Arab wars became increasingly one-sided and the immense resources of the Caliphate meant that any reconquest was now remotely unlikely — and more so whilst disunity through dissatisfied peasants and restless Bishops lingered on. =Tang-dynasty China= Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649) giving an audience to Gar Tongtsen Yulsung, ambassador of the Tibetan Empire, in a painting by Tang Chinese artist Yan Liben (600-673 AD) There also seem to have been interactions between the Byzantine realm and China at this time. Byzantine Greek historian Procopius stated that two Nestorian Christian monks eventually uncovered how silk was made. From this revelation monks were sent by Justinian I as spies on the Silk Road from Constantinople to China and back to steal the silkworm eggs.Durant (2011), p. 118. This resulted in silk production in the Mediterranean, particularly in Thrace, in northern Greece,LIVUS (28 October 2010). \\"Silk Road\\", Articles of Ancient History. Retrieved on 22 September 2016. and giving the Byzantine Empire a monopoly on silk production in medieval Europe until the loss of its territories in Southern Italy. The Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, writing during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), relayed information about China's geography, its capital city Khubdan (Old Turkic: Khumdan, i.e. Chang'an), its current ruler Taisson whose name meant \\"Son of God\\" (Chinese: Tianzi, although this could be derived from the name of Emperor Taizong of Tang), and correctly pointed to its reunification by the Sui Dynasty (581-618) as occurring during the reign of Maurice, noting that China had previously been divided politically along the Yangzi River by two warring nations.Yule (1915), pp 29-31; see also footnote #4 on p. 29; footnote #2 on p. 30; and footnote #3 on page 31. This seems to match the conquest of the Chen dynasty in southern China by Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581-604).Yule (1915), p. 30 and footnote #2. The Chinese Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang mention several embassies made by Fu lin (拂菻; i.e. Byzantium), which they equated with Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire), beginning in 643 with an embassy sent by the king Boduoli (波多力, i.e. Constans II Pogonatos) to Emperor Taizong of Tang, bearing gifts such as red glass.Hirth (2000) [1885], East Asian History Sourcebook. Retrieved 2016-09-22. These histories also provided cursory descriptions of Constantinople, its walls, and how it was besieged by Da shi (大食; the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate) and their commander \\"Mo-yi\\" (摩拽伐之; i.e. Muawiyah I, governor of Syria before becoming caliph), who forced them to pay tribute.Henry Yule expressed some amazement that even the name of the Byzantine negotiator \\"Yenyo\\" (i.e. the patrician Ioannes Petzigaudias) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines; see Yule (1915), pp 48–49; and for the brief summary of Edward Gibbon's account, see also footnote #1 on p. 49. Henry Yule highlights the fact that Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651), last ruler of the Sasanian Empire, sent diplomats to China for securing aid from Emperor Taizong (considered the suzerain over Ferghana in Central Asia) during the loss of the Persian heartland to the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, which may have also prompted the Byzantines to send envoys to China amid their recent loss of Syria to the Muslims.Yule (1915), pp 54–55. Tang Chinese sources also recorded how Sassanid prince Peroz III (636–679) fled to Tang China following the conquest of Persia by the growing Islamic caliphate.Schafer (1985), pp 10, 25–26. Other Byzantine embassies in Tang China are recorded as arriving in 711, 719, and 742.Yule (1915), pp 55-56. From Chinese records it is known that Michael VII Doukas (Mie li sha ling kai sa 滅力沙靈改撒) of Fu lin dispatched a diplomatic mission to China's Song dynasty that arrived in 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song.Sezgin et. al. (1996), p. 25. Constantine IV Constantine IV would prove to be a much wiser and able Emperor than Constans II was. =Siege of Constantinople= The Arabs failed to breach the heavy walls of Constantinople. Like his predecessors, the wars with the Saracens continued relatively unabated. Before becoming Emperor, Constantine IV was the administrator of his father's lands for the eastern portions of the Empire, what few territories they were. They became fewer still when the Arabs began taking one Imperial Byzantine city after another along the coast of Ionia. Finally in 672, Muawiya the Caliph captured the peninsula of Cyzicus, only from Constantinople. The scene was all too depressingly familiar — the capital was under threat and the odds were not favorable to the defenders — the Arabs had brought with them heavy siege weapons and began the siege of Constantinople in 674. Despite this, Constantinople was simply too much for the Arabs — where else before disunity, sheer bad luck or skill & zeal had given the warriors of Islam victory, now it was the defenders of the capital who, armed with Greek fire repelled every Arab assault. Finally in 678, after suffering massive casualties, the Saracens withdrew and Muawiya accepted an offer of peace. By 680, Muawiya was dead and Constantine IV, now at the height of his popularity, had managed to defeat the Arabs, both at land in Lycia and at sea. =Wars with the Bulgars= With the Saracen threat averted, the Byzantines turned their attention to the west, where the Bulgars were encroaching on Imperial territory. In 680, Constantine IV launched a naval expedition to drive them back — the expedition failed and the Bulgars grew even bolder. Unable to stop them by force, Constantine settled for a humiliating, but not disastrous treaty whereby \\"protection\\" money had to be paid to the Bulgar King. The greatest implication of this treaty was that Byzantium would no longer have to worry about the Bulgars for the rest of Constantine's reign. =Third Council of Constantinople= Constantine IV was determined to solve the problem of the monotheletism/chalcedon controversy once and for all. Calling forth representatives from all corners of Christendom to discuss the matter at hand, they debated until in 681 when Constantine IV, who had presided over much of the meetings, endorsed the virtually unanimous findings. Four years later in 685, Constantine IV died. His death at thirty three years robbed Byzantium of a good Emperor who had defeated her enemies from within as well as without. Constantine's wife Anastasia had given him a son, Justinian. As it would turn out, his name would dictate his foreign policy in an attempt to emulate Justinian I's conquest of the West — a risky move considering what few resources the Empire had to defend herself. Justinian II =Victories= The beginning of Justinian's reign continued the successes his father had enjoyed against the Arab invaders. Campaigning into Armenia, Georgia and even Syria, he was able to enforce a renewal of a peace treaty signed by his father and the Caliph. With the wars in the east favorably concluded, Justinian II turned his attention to the west where he sent an expedition against the Slavs between 688 and 689. His success in the west was crowned with a triumphant entry into Thessalonika, the second city of the Empire. Following these victories, Justinian set about attempting to increase the Opsikion Theme by bringing in some 250,000 settlers of Slavic origin into Asia Minor. The benefit of the move was twofold — in addition to opening up more agricultural land, there would also have been an increase in the population and a larger number of Thematic militia troops could be raised — allowing the Empire to wage war with more. Furthermore, the increase in the lower classes shifted the balance of power from the aristocracy to the class of well-off peasants. These self-sufficient peasants, who owned their own land formed the backbone of the Thematic armies. Under such circumstances the power of the Empire and the Emperor increased simultaneously. Since pre-Imperial times the Plebeians looked towards a military champion to combat the rule of the aristocracy, thus the Plebs supported a strong emperor. =Failures= In 691, war with the Arabs resumed and Justinian began increasing taxes in order to finance the conflict. However, in the face of these extortionate requisitions some 20,000 Slavic soldiers deserted to the Arabs — with them went Armenia to the enemy. Enraged, Justinian ordered the extermination of all Slavs in Bithynia — countless men, women and children were put to the sword in rage. Justinian then turned his attention to religious matters, which had been quieted down by the efforts of his father. When he called another council to wrap up loose ends from the previous (fifth and sixth - thus called Quinisext Council) ecumenical councils, trivial and strict proposals were laid out including excommunication for \\"crimes\\" ranging from provocative or seductive hair curling, the mention of the pagan gods (especially Bacchus during the grape harvest), the selling of charms, dealing with fortune tellers and even dancing. Hermits were forbidden from talking with townsfolk or presenting themselves in a particular manner. To make matters worse, no representatives were summoned from Rome so when Pope Sergius I was asked to approve of 102 canons he not only refused but managed to use the militias of Rome and Ravenna against the Exarch Zacharias. The clemency of the pope allowed the Exarch of Ravenna to escape with his life. Upon hearing of this, Justinian is said to have gone into another one of his rages. He was already unpopular at the young age of 23. His heavy handedness in extracting the tax money from the peasants and the rich made him deeply resented, especially with his use of torture, which included the use of fire and whips. It was therefore to no one's surprise (though to many a Byzantine's delight) that rebellion came from the ranks of the aristocracy. The revolt found a leader in a professional but disgraced soldier, Leontius. Non-dynastic: Leontius =Prisoner= The ruins of Carthage Leontius was in prison when a monk once told him that he would one day wear the Imperial diadem. Such talk was not only dangerous for the monk (who if discovered would have been blinded and exiled for treason) but also dangerous for the man whose ears received — and preyed upon Leontius' mind until in 695 (after being released) he immediately began a relatively unplanned coup. Fortunately for him many of his comrades had also been imprisoned (suggesting that perhaps his entire unit may well have been disgraced) so when he marched upon his former prison to release the inmates, many declared their support for him. =Rise and Fall= Marching on to the Hagia Sophia, he was fortunate enough to find the support of the Patriarch Callinicus I — whose recent insults to the incumbent Emperor left him in fear of his life and with little choice. With the support of the fanatical Hippodrome Blue team, Leontius and his men overthrew Justinian II, cutting his nose off in the oriental process of rhinokopia and declaring himself as Basileus. Justinian's Father, though on more friendly terms with Leontius still lost his tongue and his nose as well. Leontius' rule was both brief and a miserable failure. The armies of Islam were once more on the march and this time the Exarch of Carthage was in serious trouble. Earlier defeats had established Arab supremacy in the region. Leontius, despite his military background, had an unsuccessful expedition sent to Carthage. Rather than report their loss and face the inevitable wrath of the Emperor, the defeated troops decided to name one of their own as Basileus (a German called Apsimar) and with the support of the Hippodrome Green team (a serious rival of the Blue team that promoted Leontius to the Imperial throne) established Apsimar as Basileus Tiberius III. Non-dynastic: Tiberius III Tiberius' rule was equally short but slightly more impressive for his successful campaigning against the Saracens — indeed it seems that his Germanic heritage had given him the same appetite for war that had allowed many of his \\"barbarian\\" kind to conquer the Western Empire, with his troops reaching into Armenia and even Muslim-held Syria. But by that time in 705, he was overthrown by military force. Justinian, who for ten years was in exile, returned. The Byzantine population could not have asked for a worse overthrow. Justinian II (restored) =Years in exile= After having been deposed by Leontius, Justinian escaped to the Khagan of the Khazars who welcomed him and even gave his sister as a wife to him. Renaming his wife Theodora he settled at Phanagoria at the entrance to the Sea of Azov where they could keep an eye on Imperial events. Justinian was forced to act when in 704 word reached that he was wanted dead or alive for a handsome reward. Such rumors were confirmed when a band of soldiers arrived at his location. Realizing that his life was in danger, he invited two of the officers (whom he suspected as the assassins) to his house and murdered them. Leaving his wife in the safety of her brother, he fled to Bulgaria, Byzantium's chief opponent in the West. There he secured a pact with the Bulgar King Tervel granting him the title of Caesar if he aided him in regaining the throne of Byzantium. =Restoration & rule= In the spring of 705, Constantinople found herself surrounded by yet another army of Slavs and Bulgars, led by Justinian. After three days of scouting his men found an abandoned conduit running across the walls and managed to slip inside. There he surprised the sleeping guards at the Palace of Blachernae. Within moments, the building was his and Tiberius fled to Bithynia whilst the citizens of the capital surrendered — the alternative would have been a savage sack that in the mind of the vengeful Justinian, was what it needed. The following day, Justinian was given the title of Caesar and a purple robe. With his coup successful, Justinian II set about bringing his wife back and settling the numerous scores he had with his disloyal subjects. Tiberius and his predecessor Leontius were both executed the previous day after a humiliating pelting at the Hippodrome. Next the Patriarch Callinicus, whose offence had led to his hasty support of Leontius and the crowning of both of Justinian's successors led to his blinding and exile to Rome. After that Justinian set about killing Tiberius' brother, Heraclius who was perhaps the best general in the Empire. With him and his staff of officers dead, Byzantium's neighbours lost no time in exploiting the weakened army — suffering major defeats against the barbarian tribes near the mouth of the Danube and losing the vital stronghold of Tyana in Cappadocia. =Expeditions of revenge= Ravenna Bent upon making others suffer as he had, Justinian had an expedition sent against the Exarchate of Ravenna, for reasons which elude historians today — though sheer madness cannot be ruled out. Upon arriving there the expedition led by Theodore sacked the city whilst his men deceptively invited the officials to a banquet where they were seized and sent to Constantinople. Upon arrival they were met by Justinian, who had them all executed except the Archbishop, who nonetheless suffered a blinding and the usual exile — not being able to return until Justinian was in his grave. It was this execution that led to Ravenna being looted by Theodore and his men. In Rome however the mood was calmed by the Pope Constantine the Syrian. Relations between the Pope and the Emperor had greatly improved — with the Emperor kissing the Pope's feet and sending an impressive delegation before him to meet the Pope (consisting of the Patriarch of Constantinople and Justinian's son and co-emperor). Arriving at Constantinople in 711 he came to an accord with Justinian finally approving half of the 102 canons still outstanding from the Quinisext Council (dealing with the trivial matters he addressed before his exile) and agreeing to drop the other, perhaps less important canons. Satisfied he allowed the Pope a safe journey to Rome. Cherson Map of the Crimea. The Ancient Greeks had colonized the region as a trade outpost for the Black sea Justinian then targeted his former place of exile in the Crimea. There his brother-in-law, the Khagan, had infringed on Imperial territory by establishing a Khazar governor of his own to run Cherson. Upon arriving there, the expedition set about doing its work — countless citizens were drowned (apparently with weights attached) and seven were roasted alive. The Tudun, the governor appointed by the Khagan was sent to Constantinople with 30 others. However, a storm destroyed his army and his fleet when he ordered it to return. Justinian is said to have greeted the news with great laughter. Another fleet was sent but the arrival of the Khagan's army made Justinian reconsider his move to a more diplomatic one. He decided to send the Tudun back to the Khagan with his apologies and had George of Syria to present the Imperial apology. The citizens of Cherson were naturally in no mood to hear any apology after what Justinian had done. When the Tudun died along the way, the Khazars took it upon themselves to send his 300-strong escort to the afterlife with him. Overthrow After the fiasco of the Cherson expedition, the citizens there proclaimed a new man, Bardanes (an exiled General) the Basileus of Byzantium. Justinian was enraged at these turn of events. Once more he began redirecting resources to another expedition under the Patriarch Maurus against Cherson, resources that could have been better spent against the Arabs or the Bulgars. The Khazars appeared at the scene preventing the expedition from destroying no more than two defense towers before being obliged to make terms. The Patriarch realized that returning to the capital in defeat would undoubtedly lead to a violent retirement at the hands of Justinian. Therefore, in a similar case to Leontius and Tiberius' usurpation, he defected and, with the army and navy under his command, declared his support for the renegade Bardanes, who changed his name to Philippicus. As Philippicus headed for the Capital Justinian was making his way to Armenia, a warzone between the Byzantines and Arabs. He reached as far as Nicomedia when attempting to turn back, he was caught at the twelfth mile stone of the Capital and executed on the spot. Philippicus had arrived before he could and was greeted with open arms at the capital. Theodora, the Khazar wife of Justinian II escaped to a nearby monastery with her son and former co- emperor Tiberius. The young boy was holding on to the True Cross when a soldier entered and forced his hand from it. It is said that the soldier then laid the Cross with great respect on the altar. Following this rather pious act, he then dragged the boy outside and beneath the porch of a nearby church, butchered the line of Heraclius into extinction forever.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for King's Norton in Birmingham from 1935 until he was killed in action, aged 33. He was the brother of Barbara Cartland. Early life He was the son of Major Bertram Cartland and Mary Hamilton Scobell, and the younger brother of prolific romance author Barbara Cartland. He was the maternal nephew of Major- General Sir Sanford John Palairet Scobell. His paternal grandfather was a wealthy Birmingham brass founder who died four years before Ronald's birth. When the family's wealth diminished following the death of Ronald's grandmother, his father and his family moved to a rented farmhouse near the town of Pershore, Worcestershire. In 1910, Bertram went to work for the local Conservative Party office, where he managed the election of the candidate. When he won the election, the new MP offered Bertram the post of private secretary. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Bertram volunteered for military duty and was killed near Berry-au-Bac, France, in June 1918. In 1919 Mary Cartland, along with Ronald, her 18-year-old daughter Barbara and 8-year- old son Anthony, moved to London, and Ronald gained a scholarship to Charterhouse School, a public school in Surrey. While there he expressed his desire to become a Conservative MP, but at the same time, he held progressive views that were at odds with the party and the prevailing social norms at Charterhouse. When Ronald was a child, Mary would take him with her on her trips to some of the poorer areas of Pershore, giving him a first-hand look at their dire economic straits. After he left Charterhouse, since Mary could not afford to send her son to university, Ronald went to work at Conservative Party Central Office in London. Parliamentary career After Lionel Beaumont Thomas decided to retire on health grounds in 1933, Cartland was chosen to replace him in Herbert Austin's former constituency of King's Norton, Birmingham. His selection was supported by the Chamberlain family, long the most powerful force in Birmingham Conservative circles. He won in the 1935 election and became one of the youngest MPs in the Commons. Cartland's maiden speech to the Commons, in May 1936, attacked the National Government of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin for its less-than-enthusiastic attitude in aiding 'distressed areas', the parts of the UK that were suffering from extreme economic difficulties, with unemployment rates as high as 40%. In 1936, he delivered a rebuke to the Treasury for balancing the budget on the backs of Britain's poor, attacking Neville Chamberlain, then serving as Baldwin's Chancellor of the Exchequer, despite Chamberlain's role in Cartland's selection as a Conservative candidate. After Chamberlain succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister, Cartland earned the wrath of the Conservative Party's hierarchy by taking a stand against the Government's policy of appeasement of Germany and Italy, which brought him to the attention of other Conservative dissident backbenchers, as well as Winston Churchill. Before Cartland's election in 1935, he and his sister Barbara had visited Germany, where Ronald was appalled at the Nazi persecution of Jews. On his return, he warned his fellow MPs of Adolf Hitler's expansionist plans for Austria and other countries of Central Europe and that sooner or later, Britain would be at war with Germany. He served as a backbench MP in Chamberlain's government. He is most famous for a speech that he gave to the house in August 1939 in which he accused the Prime Minister of having \\"ideas of dictatorship\\". Chamberlain had decided to adjourn the House until 3 October and instructed Conservative MPs that a majority vote for adjournment would be seen as a vote of confidence. That caused outrage in the House and prompted Cartland to stand up and make his famous speech, which also included what turned out to be prophetic words for himself: \\"We are in the situation that within a month we may be going to fight, and we may be going to die.\\" Military career Cartland achieved the rank of major in the British Army. In February 1937, he was commissioned in the Territorial Army. By August 1939, he was a lieutenant in the Worcestershire and Oxfordshire Yeomanry. When the Germans commenced the French and Low Countries campaign in May 1940, he was serving in the 53rd Anti-Tank Regiment (The Worcestershire Yeomanry), Royal Artillery. The unit was assigned to defend the town of Cassel, a hilltop site near one of the main roads leading to the Channel port of Dunkirk, France. Cartland and his men held off the Germans from 27 to 29 May. On the evening of 29 May, Cartland and his unit split up and joined the retreating British Expeditionary Force, which was heading towards Dunkirk. On 30 May 1940 during the Battle of Dunkirk, while he was reconnoitering his position from a ditch, he was shot and killed near Watou, Belgium. Cartland was initially listed as missing. His family did not learn of his fate until January 1941 when his mother received a letter from one of Cartland's men, who was now a German prisoner-of-war. The soldier described Cartland's death in detail. His brother, James, had died the previous day and is buried at Zuidschote. A memorial service was held for Ronald Cartland on 18 February 1941, at London's St Martin-in-the-Fields Church. He is now buried at Hotton War Cemetery, in Hotton, Belgium. Personal life Cartland was gay. Legacy He is commemorated with his father and brother with a calvary at Tewkesbury Abbey. His name is to be found on the Memorial Chapel at Charterhouse School. His sister Barbara published a memoir of him. She described him as \\"terribly inspiring\\" and said Winston Churchill \\"adored him\\" for his opposition to Chamberlain's policy of appeasing Hitler. In her autobiography The Path To Power, Margaret Thatcher referred to Cartland as a \\"Young, Idealistic, Conservative MP\\". Cartland was played by Tom Burke in the 2008 television film In Love with Barbara, inspired by the life of Barbara Cartland.

Daniel Joseph Jenkins in Charleston, South Carolina. Jenkins was a businessman and Baptist minister who encountered street children and decided to organize an orphanage for young African Americans. The original site of this orphanage was at 660 King Street, but the number of orphans on roll quickly outgrew the facilities. In 1893, the orphanage moved to the Old Marine Hospital at 20 Franklin Street. This National Historic Landmark, designed by Robert Mills, served as home of the orphanage until 1937. Its present-day location is in North Charleston, South Carolina. Jenkins Orphanage Bands A black and white photograph postcard of the Jenkins Orphanage Band of Charleston, South Carolina. The orphanage took in donations of musical instruments. Not being a musician, Jenkins hired two local Charleston musicians — P.M. \\"Hatsie\\" Logan and Francis Eugene Mikell — to tutor the children in music. Upon its establishment, it became the only black instrumental group organized in South Carolina. The band's debut was on the streets of Charleston with the permission of the mayor, police chief, and Chamber of Commerce. The Jenkins Orphanage Band, wearing discarded Citadel uniforms, performed throughout the United States and even toured England raising money for the support of the orphanage. It played in inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft. It appeared at the St. Louis Exposition and the Anglo-American Exposition in 1914. It toured the United States from coast to coast, and played in Paris, Berlin, Rome, London, and Vienna. As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The band ceased to exist in the 1980s.Edgar, Walter. South Carolina Encyclopedia (2006) pp. 590-591, In 2003, a 10-minute Fox Movietone News newsreel feature about the band, filmed on November 22, 1928, was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". William \\"Cat\\" Anderson, Jabbo Smith, Tom Delaney, and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who made it to the big time. The orphanage was responsible for providing numerous children with another chance, which many took advantage of by going on to lead productive lives, including teachers and attorneys. Luther M. Reames Jr., Esq. is a vice-president with a major bank and an example of a Jenkins Orphanage success story.

The experience inspired Kaufman to become involved with waterbed sales, and during the 1980s, he rented space in 24 New England stores for selling waterbeds. By 1990, waterbed sales had dwindled, and Kaufman partnered with Gene Rosenberg, owner of Wholesale Furniture, where Kaufman had rented space for waterbed sales. Rosenberg acquired a building in Newington, Connecticut that was previously owned by a furniture company that had become bankrupt. In 1991, the Newington, Connecticut location became the first Bob's Discount Furniture store.Marks, Paul. New Investors Have 'Come on Down' To Bob's Discount Furniture (article preview).

By 1997, the company operated a dozen stores in Connecticut and two in western Massachusetts.

It is located eight miles east of the Mississippi River and approximately 18 miles north of Natchez at the intersection of highway 553 and Church Hill Road. Church Hill was a community of wealthy cotton planters before the American Civil War. Soil erosion, which had been going on since well before the Civil War, caused the area to decline into a poor farming community with none of the land under cultivation by 1999. The area is remarkable because its antebellum buildings are mostly intact with few modern buildings having been built. History Wagners grocery store in Church Hill, believed to have been in operation in 1837 Springfield Plantation owner's residence Christ Church cemetery Map of Church Hill The Church Hill community got its name from Christ Church - an Episcopal Church located on a terraced hill at the intersection of Church Hill Road and Highway 553. It is the last of three successive buildings. The first building of 1820 was made of logs on population ridge. The second building of 1829 was half mile to the south east of the first on land formerly owned by James G. Wood. The third building was completed in 1858 in the same general location as the second building. This land was donated by Ms James Payne. The fine craftsmanship and decorative details of the third church reflect the great wealth of the area planters in 1858. All of the massive beams in the hammer-beam roof (one of the few in Mississippi) have been stained and false grained. Three of the workmen signed the false graining before it dried. Across the intersection from the Christ Church is Wagner's Store, which closed in 1998. The store building dates stylistically to ca. 1855-1880 and is one of the oldest country stores remaining in Mississippi. The old community post office operated from the store. Remarkably, the original interior store counters survive. Church Hill was a community of wealthy cotton planters before the American Civil War. In antebellum times, most of the area plantations were essentially each self- contained communities isolated in clearings in the woods. With a few exceptions travellers along the area roads just saw woods, with occasional gates that led into the plantations. Soil erosion in the 1800s continually decreased the amount of land that was suitable for farming. After the Civil War the main crop remained cotton until around 1933 when the boll weevil destroyed cotton farming in the area. By this time soil erosion had caused the area to become a poor farming community, and it remained so throughout the twentieth century. Almost none of the land is being farmed as of 1999; thus, the area is more wooded than it was in antebellum times. A large number of the owner's residences and other buildings on these former plantations remain and are privately owned. Among these are The Cedars, Oak Grove, Pecan Grove (also known as the Bluffs), Richland, Springfield, Woodland, and Wyolah. Antebellum plantations (Gayoso, Pecan Grove, Logonia, Oak Grove, Cedars, Woodland and Springfield) line a twelve-mile stretch of highway 533 that includes Christ Church. Details about many of the area plantations are as follows. * In about 1776 the first group of settlers came to the area by flat boat from Virginia. Some of the family names were Noble, Donahoe, Hamberlin, and Fletcher. ** Isaac Noble had a large plantation near Church Hill. ** Lochiel Plantation was the home of Isaac's daughter Maria and her husband Charles Donoho. ** Mount Ararat Plantation belonged to a Marine called Captain Magruder who settled in the area in about 1776. His descendants, the Drakes, kept Mount Ararat Plantation. * In about 1800 the Baker brothers from New Jersey, Colonel James G. Wood from Maryland, James Payne and William Brooks settled in the Church Hill community. ** Pecan Grove Plantation (also known as The Bluffs) which adjoined the Green family property belonged to Thomas Baker. Thomas Baker first married into the Brooks family and next into the Green family who owned Gayosa Plantation. The Greens also owned nearby Richland Plantation and Springfield Plantation. ** Auburn Hall Plantation belonged to James G. Wood. It was very large extending from Church Hill to Selsertown. Wood divided the large tract into plantations for his many children. *** Oak Grove Plantation belonged to Jane Wood and her husband James Payne. *** Woodburn Plantation belonged to Walter Wood. *** The Cedars Plantation, which adjoined Oak Grove, belonged to Maria Wood and her husband Thomas Elam. At times, the Cedars was part of the Plains Plantation, which was owned at various times by Joseph Dunbar (a Church Hill lawyer), David Hunt, and Benjamin Beavin. *** Woodland Plantation belonged to Robert Y. Wood and his wife Virginia Smith. *** Lagonia Plantation, located across the road from Oak Grove Plantation, belonged to Eliza Wood and her husband James Blanchard. Dr. Bisland Shields, a descendant of Colonel James G. Wood, later owned Lagonia. ** The Miskell Place belonged to John Brooks. * Judge Thomas Rodney and Judge William Shields came to Rodney, Mississippi (formerly known as Petit Gulf) in 1802. ** Rokeby Plantation in Church Hill was Judge Shields and his wife Victoria Benoit's home. After Judge Shield's death, young Seargent Smith Prentiss, who later was a famous lawyer, was a tutor on Rokeby plantation for the Shields children - Joseph Dunbar Shields, Thomas Rodney Shields, Gabriel Benoit Shields, Francina Shields and William Bayard Shields.

It was written by the group's principal guitarist and singer Peter Green, with an additional credit for manager C.G. Adams. The song is an upbeat 12-bar blues shuffle and is representative of the group's early repertoire of conventional electric blues. The lyrics deal with the common blues theme of the unfaithful lover and share elements with earlier songs. \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" was first released in mid-1968 as the B-side of \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\", which appeared on the UK singles chart. A different take of the song was later used as the opening track on Fleetwood Mac's second UK and US albums. Music writers have viewed the song favourably, with Green's guitar work singled out as a highlight. Other artists, such as Gary Moore and Aerosmith, have recorded renditions for their blues-inspired albums. Lyrics \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" is credited to Peter Green and C.G. Adams, Fleetwood Mac's manager, who also used the name Clifford Davis. Only two of the song's 12-bar verses include vocals: the first uses the common call and response or AAB pattern, while the second includes four bars of stop-time, before concluding with the same refrain as the first: In 1948, Detroit blues harp player and singer Walter Mitchell recorded the similarly titled \\"Stop Messin' Around\\" for J.V.B. Records. Mitchell uses an AAB pattern, but includes a reference to a .44 caliber pistol. Both songs use similar phrasing to the first eight bars of Sonny Boy Williamson I's 1945 adaptation of Robert Johnson's 1938 song \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\". Johnson's song uses the refrain \\"Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down\\". Recording and musical style Fleetwood Mac recorded \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" at the CBS studio in London on 28 April 1968. The core group—guitarist Green, bassist John McVie, and drummer Mick Fleetwood—were augmented by pianist (also future McVie wife and full-time group member) Christine Perfect, and saxophone players Steve Gregory and Johnny Almond. Five takes were attempted: the first three were incomplete and the fourth yielded the master later included on the group's Mr. Wonderful album in 1968. The fifth take was used for the single release. In order to capture a sound more typical of live performances, a public address system (PA system) was used in the recording studio. Producer Mike Vernon describes it as providing a \\"dirtier, gutsier soundcloser to that generated at a club performance\\" than a typical recording studio. Multitracking, a common studio technique, was not used: \\"[T]here is a full density of sound that... is a result of having recorded the full band and guest musicians as one unit. No overdubs\\", he adds. In a 1999 interview, Vernon singled out \\"Stop Messin' Round\\": Fleetwood Mac biographer Donald Brackett describes the approach on Mr. Wonderful as \\"the straight goods in terms of gritty white blues within a traditional format\\" and the material as \\"pure scintillating blues, rough in form and raw in content\\". Critic Richie Unterberger sees it as an attempt to emulate the sound of the Sun Studio in Memphis and Chess Studios in Chicago, where many of the classic electric blues songs were recorded. However, he describes the overall album sound as \\"rushed, raw, and thin\\". Chicken Shack co-founder and bassist Andy Silvester recalled Green as a perfectionist, who advised Fleetwood on his drum parts. At Green's request, Silvester played Fleetwood a Jimmy Reed song: \\"[I played Reed's] 'My Bitter Seed', which just had this amazing groove to it: the tempo was really slow and yet it shuffled along with a lot of swing... it just flowed [but Fleetwood's drumming] already had that\\". (Fleetwood later remarked: \\"Shuffles... I'm sick to death of fuckin' shuffles!\\") The most prominent feature of \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" is Green's guitar work: only two 12-bar verses have vocals, the remaining four (album version) are devoted to Green's guitar soloing. Author Douglas J. Noble points out that Green's early blues guitar style reflects \\"a fluid approach to phrasing\\", where his notes are slightly behind or ahead of the beat. He adds \\"Green made great use of quarter tone bent notes\\", which is a feature of blues guitarists, such as B.B. King, to whom he was often compared. Noble's transcription shows a tempo of 132 beats per minute (or allegro) in the key of C, which he describes as \\"a straight- forward medium tempo shuffle blues\\". Green also uses both a C blues scale and C pentatonic major scale. Releases In mid-1968 in the UK, Blue Horizon released the 2:38 fifth take of \\"Stop Messin' Around\\" as the B-side to \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\", which was recorded during the same sessions. The single reached number 31 on the UK Singles Chart on 23 July 1968. Epic Records issued the single in the US, but it did not reach the record charts. Subsequently, the shorter 2:18 fourth take of the song was added to Fleetwood Mac's second British album, Mr. Wonderful (1968) and their second American album, English Rose (1969). The album version of the song usually appears on early compilations of Fleetwood Mac songs, such as The Pious Bird of Good Omen (1969), Black Magic Woman (1971), Greatest Hits (1971), and Vintage Years (1975). The anniversary band retrospective boxed set 25 Years – The Chain (1992) includes it, along with eight other Green compositions. The Mike Vernon produced The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1967–1969 (1999) has all five takes of the song. A live recording by the BBC from 1 September 1968, shortly after Danny Kirwan joined the group, appears on Live at the BBC (1995). Critical reception \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" has received positive comments from music writers, with Green's guitar playing being singled out. In a song review for AllMusic, critic Matthew Greenwald noted: In a review of English Rose, critic Bruce Eder describes it as one of the songs \\"representing the stronger tracks\\" from Mr. Wonderful. Richie Unterberger calls it \\"Mr. Wonderful's one gem\\" among the album's more derivative tunes. In Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists, \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" is identified as one of six \\"guitar high points\\" in Peter Green's career. Renditions pickup, 1970 Irish guitarist Gary Moore recorded the song for his first blues album, Still Got the Blues (1990). For a while, Moore owned Green's 1959 Gibson Les Paul, which Green frequently played with Fleetwood Mac and used to record many of the group's most well-known songs. Moore used the guitar to record his tribute album to Green, Blues for Greeny (1995), which features Fleetwood Mac-era compositions by Green. Welsh guitarist and Savoy Brown co-founder Kim Simmonds recorded an acoustic ensemble version of the song, which appears on the tribute albums, Rattlesnake Guitar: The Music of Peter Green (1995) and Peter Green Songbook (2000). In a 1996 review for Cadence magazine, Bob Rusch describes it as \\"a surprisingly jazzy rendition\\". American rock group Aerosmith recorded the song as \\"Stop Messin' Around\\" for their blues tribute album, Honkin' on Bobo (2004). Group guitarist Joe Perry provides the lead vocals, with Steven Tyler contributing the blues harp. Perry later explained: \\"[Steven]'s not a technical player... He just let's it rip and he's great. Ripping is what we do best.\\" The two played the song during the \\"Tribute to the Blues\\" concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City in February 2003. Their performance is included as a bonus track on the DVD of Lightning in a Bottle, the 2004 concert documentary film by director Antoine Fuqua.

Johnson as a one-design racer and first built in 1932.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 72-73. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Johnson Boat Works starting in 1932 and later by Melges Performance Sailboats in the United States. Johnson Boat Works went out of business in 1998, but the boat remains in production by Melges. Design The X Boat is a simple, sail training and racing sailboat, intended for junior sailors under 16 years of age. Originally constructed of wood, it is now built predominantly of fiberglass, with wooden trim. It has a fractional sloop with aluminum spars, a spooned raked stem, an angled transom, a rounded, transom- hung rudder controlled by a tiller fitted with a tiller extension and it has a retractable centerboard. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended. The boat can be transported on a trailer. For sailing the design is equipped with a boom vang, a stern-mounted mainsheet traveler and two sets of hiking straps. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 97.7 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors. Operational history The class is supported by the Inland Lake Yachting Association, which organizes racing regattas. The annual association championship for the class often attracts over 100 boats to compete. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"The X Boat was designed as a low-performance training boat for junior programs.

SIR-2 Instrument parts  Mission  The mission of the instrument is to map the lunar surface in the near infrared spectrum from 0.9 - 2.4 μm with an unprecedented resolution of 6 nm. The purpose of this is to obtain information on the mineral composition of the moon, which in turn will help getting insight into a number of questions: * What is the cause of the global asymmetry of the moon, which on the far side has a thicker crust and lacks the Mare structures which are characteristic for the near side? * What was the early thermal evolution of the moon? * What is the vertical and lateral structure of the lunar crust and how did it develop? * What is the composition and structure of the lunar mantle? * Why is the moon different from other planets and how do planets work in terms of surface processes, heat transfer, and geologic evolution? * Are the Apollo geophysical measurements representative of the moon, or are they only valid for the small regions around the Apollo landing sites? = Similar missions = The instrument is a redesigned version of SIR, which was flown on board the SMART-1 technology satellite. SIR performed the same mission, but had a problem with dark current induced noise due to varying temperatures caused by differences in heat flux from the light and dark side of the moon. SIR-2 will attempt to improve this, mainly by using a detector with an embedded thermoelectric cooler and a digital controller to keep the detector temperature stable. This will stabilize the dark current noise, making it simple to subtract it since it will have an almost constant level.  Electronics  The control unit of SIR-2 is based on a System-on-a-chip design, minimizing the size and power consumption of the unit. A central component is the radiation hardened RTAX2000S Axcelerator FPGA, containing a LEON (LEON3FT) SPARC compliant CPU, communications interface Intellectual property cores, and custom interfaces to the rest of the instrument.

It is generally known as being made completely out of wood, usually without particle board or laminate. The styles most often used by the Amish woodworkers are generally more traditional in nature.  History  Amish furniture first gained attention in the 1920s, when early American folk art was \\"discovered\\", and dealers and historians placed great value upon the beauty and quality of the pieces. Many different styles of Amish furniture emerged. The Jonestown School began in the late 18th century in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. The Jonestown School is most widely known for painted blanket chests decorated with flowers on three panels. Examples of these chests are on display at both the Smithsonian Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Another distinctive style of Amish furniture is the Soap Hollow School, developed in Soap Hollow, Pennsylvania. These pieces are often brightly painted in red, gold, and black. Henry Lapp was a furniture maker based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and it is his designs that most closely resemble the furniture we think of today as Amish-made. He was one of the first to abandon the painted, Germanic-style influence in his furniture and opted for an undecorated, plain style, following more the styles of Welsh furniture making of the time. The order book he offered to his customers contained watercolor paintings of his pieces and is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The record price for American folk-painted furniture was sold at Sotheby's in 1986. It was a tall case clock made in 1801 by Johannes Spitler that sold for $203,500. Techniques Belt and pulley wood shop similar to what Amish currently use. Exhibit at Ohio Historical Society. Because Amish beliefs prevent the use of electricity, many woodworking tools in Amish shops are powered by hydraulic and pneumatic power that is run on diesel compressors. Most communities permit some technology, and allowances can be made in the case of woodworking, as the craft often supports multiple families within the community. Great attention is paid to the details of the wood in the furniture-making process. Each piece of wood is hand-selected to match the specific furniture in mind. Attention is paid to the grain of the wood, both in gluing pieces together and in achieving the desired look of the finished piece. Amish furniture is also valued for its sustainability and is considered a \\"green\\" product. The Amish woodworkers pride themselves in their work and view their products as both pieces of art and furnishings to be used and lived in for generations. Styles Amish furniture is made in many different styles. The Mission and Shaker styles share a few characteristics. Mission is characterized by straight lines and exposed joinery. It is often considered to be clean and modern in design. The Shaker style is plain, yet elegant and has a very simple and basic design aimed at functionality and durability. The Queen Anne style is in direct contrast to the Mission and Shaker styles. It is considered traditional, with ornate moldings, unique foot details, and carved ornamentation. Other styles available include Southwestern, Rustic, Cottage, Country, Quaker, and Beachfront. Amish furniture-making is often a skill passed through many generations. Most Amish children rarely attend school beyond eighth grade, often to help out at home, or in the shops. Many families become known for their specific design details and niches. Some woodworkers focus only on outdoor furniture, others on pieces for the living room or bedroom. No piece of furniture is ever identical to another because of the care taken to select the wood. The grain is different on every piece of wood, and the craftsmen often try to highlight the features of each individual piece. Technology During the second half of the 19th century, Grand Rapids became a major lumbering center, processing timber harvested in the region. By the end of the century, it was established as the premier furniture-manufacturing city of the United States. For this reason it was nicknamed “Furniture City”. After an international exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, Grand Rapids became recognized worldwide as a leader in the production of fine furniture. A furniture-makers’ guild was established in 1931 to improve the design and craftsmanship of Grand Rapids furniture. National home furnishing markets were held in Grand Rapids for about 75 years, concluding in the 1960s. By that time, the furniture-making industry shifted to North Carolina. Much of Grand Rapids furniture has now been outsourced to Asia. In that time, Amish builders have acquired much of the old machinery once used. However, because Amish beliefs prevent the use of electricity, many woodworking tools in Amish shops are powered by hydraulic and pneumatic power that is run on diesel compressors. In recent years, the Amish furniture market has expanded to include online sales. The Amish craftsmen, because of their beliefs, are prohibited from running the websites. Non-Amish retailers often attend Amish furniture expositions in Ohio and Indiana to see Amish furniture on display and meet the craftsmen behind the pieces. Relationships are often developed, and the retailer becomes the middleman between the simple life of the Amish woodworker and the modern buyer. Amish furniture is now available to a wider market and to those who may not be in close proximity to an Amish woodworking shop. It is no longer necessary to visit a retail location to select the unique wood and stain combination desired; this can all be done on the Internet, and there are dozens of different wood, stain, and upholstery options to choose from. The finished furniture is shipped directly from the stain shop to the consumer. Wood options Common wood types for Amish furniture include (clockwise, from top left) Oak, Brown Maple, Pine, Cherry, Elm, Hickory, Quarter Sawn White Oak, and Walnut. Amish furniture is made with a variety of quality hardwoods, including northern red oak, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry, maple, beech, elm, mahogany, walnut, hickory, cedar, and pine. Northern red oak is a very popular choice for American consumers for its warmth, color, and durability. It is typically grown in Eastern U.S., particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. White oak is slightly harder than red oak and can be cut to show more ray fleck. The antique look of white oak makes it ideal for Mission and Shaker styles. Cherry has a light reddish-brown color that will darken with light exposure. Maple wood offers a spectrum of beauty from different angles. It is significantly harder than oak and is growing in popularity because of its beauty. American beech is white with a red tinge and bends readily when steamed. Elm ranges in color from nearly white to brown with a red tinge and is fairly stiff and heavy. Mahogany is typically used in high-class furnishings because of its attractive finish. As mahogany matures its color varies from yellowish or pinkish to deep red or brown. Walnut is heavy, hard, and stiff and ranges in color from nearly white in the sapwood to dark brown in the heartwood. Walnut holds stain, paint, and polish well. Hickory is harder than oak and distinguished by extreme contrasts of light and dark colors. Hickory's sapwood is a creamy white while hickory's heartwood is a red, pink or reddish-brown color and often referred to as red hickory. Cedar has a deep rosy glow and stripes of light golden sapwood. Eastern white pine is a soft wood. It tends to have more knots than a hardwood and can yellow with age.

Erected on a hill above the Gunpowder River Valley, the mansion is an excellent example of late colonial and early 19th-century life in eastern Baltimore County. History Construction began under Corbin Lee, who died in 1773. It was completed under Harry Dorsey Gough, a wealthy Baltimore merchant, in 1776.Colwill, Stiles T. Francis Guy, 1760–1820. Maryland Historical Society, 1981. Gough named the estate Perry Hall, after his family's ancestral home of the same name within what is now Perry Hall Park, in Perry Barr, England, a northern suburb of Birmingham. From the 16-room mansion, Gough administered his vast plantation operation, where dozens of slaves tended cattle, various food crops, and stands of tobacco. The Perry Hall estate was so influential that maps from the period typically identify modern-day Bel Air Road (U.S. Route 1) as \\"Perry Hall Road\\" or \\"Gough's Road.\\" Gough died on May 8, 1808. Due to his statewide prominence, more than 2,000 people attended his funeral, which was held at the Perry Hall estate. The mansion was generally viewed as being at its zenith during the early Nineteenth Century. Visitors commented on the distinctive architectural features of the home as well as the lush gardens on the surrounding grounds. When one looks at the mansion as it existed in Gough's time, it is clear that the house included features that mirrored the diverse facets of Harry Dorsey Gough's life. The impressive wine cellars and expansive grand hall used for entertaining symbolized Gough's socially prominent life before his conversion to Methodism. After his conversion, Gough built a chapel near the mansion's eastern wing that allowed him to quietly pursue his religious worship, along with his family, servants, and other neighboring landowners. Perry Hall remained under the ownership of Gough's descendants until 1852 when it was sold to investors who subdivided much of the property among immigrant families who built dozens of farms. The mansion remained in private ownership for over two centuries, and by 2001, the vast estate had been whittled down to approximately four acres. That year, the mansion was sold to Baltimore County for future use as a museum and community center. The home in its original form appears in three large paintings made about 1803 by Francis Guy. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Friends of the Perry Hall Mansion Since its acquisition by the Department of Parks and Recreation for Baltimore County, the Perry Hall Mansion has received a comprehensive exterior renovation. In addition, a structure has been created to allow the public to be directly involved in shaping the future of this historically significant property. The Friends of the Perry Hall Mansion is a freestanding organization, formed in September 2007, that aims to work to complete the renovations at the mansion, and care for the structure once the project is finished. The officers and directors will work to achieve the group's mission to educate the public about the Perry Hall Mansion and provide input to the Baltimore County government on its uses and operations. The Friends' agenda includes continued fund-raising for the interior renovation of the building, the initiation of an archaeological dig on the property, and the completion of a master plan to help guide the future use and continuous improvement of the mansion and grounds. Current members of the board of directors are as follows: Jeffrey Smith, president, Neil Miller, vice president, Tim Kosiba, treasurer, Linda Polesne, secretary, Colleen Bowers, membership chairperson, and Wayne Schaumburg, Vince Pecora, Ann Palrang, Laura Kimball, Melissa Redmer, and Peggy Neidlinger, directors.

During his career, he made over 300 appearances in the Football League for Cardiff City and Chester City, scoring over 100 goals. He remains a cult favourite among the fans of his former teams. Club career Dale started his career at Arsenal, where he was on schoolboy forms, but was released by the club and instead began his senior playing career at Welsh side Conwy United. He was a prolific scorer for the North Walian side, scoring 47 goals during the 1984–85 season which remained a club record until 1996 when it was surpassed by Ken McKenna, and followed it up by finding the net on a regular basis for their neighbours Rhyl and Bangor City. This prompted a move from Bangor City to English Football League side Chester City in May 1988, for £12,000. Unlike many strikers to move up from non-league to professional football, Dale remained prolific in Division Three. He made his debut as a substitute in the opening game of the 1988–89 season against Blackpool, with his first goal following a fortnight later against Bristol City. He ended the season with 24 goals to his name, with 22 of them coming in league matches as he struck up a successful forward partnership with Steve Johnson. The highlight was a hat-trick in a 7–0 demolition of Fulham in April 1989, with Dale comfortably finishing as the club's top scorer and player of the season. Although he struggled to hit the same heights over the next two years, Dale still enjoyed a decent strike rate and attracted interest from other league clubs. He rejected a new contract with Chester in 1991 and seemed set to join Maidstone United, but the transfer deal collapsed at tribunal stage and Cardiff City snapped up the North Walian for £82,000. Dale went on to spend the majority of his playing career at Cardiff where he played over 200 league games for them and became a firm favourite with the club's supporters. During his time at Cardiff he won a division three championship and two Welsh cups with the team. As a result of his time there he is currently one of Cardiff's top ten all-time top scorers. He eventually left Cardiff to sign for Yeovil Town where he only spent one year. He helped the non-league side reach the FA Cup third round, where the luck of the draw meant he was handed a trip back to Cardiff in January 1999. Dale scored to give Yeovil the lead, but Cardiff snatched a late equaliser and won the replay.\\"Dale's Ninian return rocks Cardiff resolve\\" The Independent Retrieved on 20 December 2008 Two months later, Dale returned to South Wales when he joined Newport County, where he finished his playing days. Despite being a consistent performer for his club sides Dale never earned a cap for the Wales national side although he did play for them at schoolboy level. This is mainly down to the fact that at the time Wales had a strong premier division strike force while he was playing in the likes of Ian Rush, Mark Hughes, Dean Saunders and emerging talents like Nathan Blake and John Hartson. He was though called into the full Welsh squad when in prolific form at Chester in 1989, although he was not selected in any matches.

In 2006 and 2007 she presented some relief shifts for BBC News between 2 pm and 5 pm. She has anchored editions of Newsnight with an economic focus. On a Newsnight programme in August 2007, Flanders interrogated Conservative Party leader David Cameron about his proposed policy of tax breaks for married couples while questioning him with other journalists, asking him whether he had ever met anyone who would get married for an extra £20 per week. As an unmarried mother, she also asked Mr. Cameron whether the Conservative Party would like her to be married. BBC economics editor Flanders (right) in January 2013 In February 2008 it was announced that she would replace Evan Davis as BBC economics editor, since he was moving to present Radio 4's Today programme. She took up this position on 17 March, although from June of that year until January 2009, deputy economics editor Hugh Pym temporarily replaced her as the main economics editor whilst she was on maternity leave. She presented a programme called \\"Stephanomics\\" on BBC Radio Four during July 2012. This programme asked questions about the world's economy, such as whether China or the United States would be the more important economic power. Another series of this programme began to be broadcast on Radio Four in April 2013. In 2012, Flanders presented Masters of Money, a BBC Two documentary series exploring the lives of Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, and Friedrich Hayek. In August 2012 Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith made a formal complaint to the BBC claiming that there was a pro-Labour bias in her coverage of unemployment figures. The BBC stated in response that they were satisfied that their coverage was impartial. Aside from her work as economic editor, Flanders presented The Andrew Marr Show during August 2009 to cover for Andrew Marr, and was an occasional relief presenter of Newsnight until she left the BBC. In 2009, Flanders played herself in a BBC Radio production of the Julian Gough short story The Great Hargeisa Goat Bubble. Set in Somaliland in the 1980s, the story is an allegorical analysis of certain aspects of modern economics, such as automatic trading, and complex financial derivatives. On 26 September 2013 it was announced that Flanders would leave the BBC to join J.P. Morgan Asset Management where she would be chief market strategist for Europe and the UK.John Plunkett \\"BBC's Stephanie Flanders to join JP Morgan\\", The Guardian, 26 September 2013 Guardian columnist Peter Preston mourned the BBC's loss, writing \\"She wasn't a simple reporter, talking to people and reading the runes: she was an intellectual player in a vital, but often arcane, area.\\" She was replaced as economics editor by the BBC's business editor, Robert Peston. She still occasionally appears as an expert and presents programmes for the BBC. In September 2017 Flanders co-presented two editions of BBC Radio 4's Today programme with Justin Webb. She subsequently joined Bloomberg News as Senior Executive Editor for Economics and head of Bloomberg Economics. Academia Since 2008 she has been a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford. On 28 February 2013, she presented the 2013 Bob Friend Memorial Lecture at the Pilkington Lecture Theatre at the University of Kent's Medway Campus in Chatham.

Of all the so-called English \\"virginal books\\" this is the only one to mention the name of the instrument (the virginal) in the title, the others being so-called at a far later date. The manuscript The manuscript is a folio volume of sixty pre-lined pages of six staves containing 94 pieces for keyboard and 18 Voycall [vocal] Lessons. It was rebound using part of the original covers, in 1949. The first page bears the inscription Elizabeth Rogers hir virginall booke. February ye 27 1656. However, on the same page the name Elizabeth Fayre is written, and it has been suggested that these two Elizabeths are the same person, before and after marriage. There are various other writings, including the name \\"John Tillett\\", who may have been a subsequent owner of the manuscript, some poetic fragments, and a note concerning the tuning of the viol. There are also three incomplete tables of contents. Four different hands have been discerned. The manuscript is now in the British Library, catalogued as Add MS 10337. The American Institute of Musicology published an edited version by George Sargent in 1971. Contents The pieces contained in the manuscript are relatively simple, and written for the amateur performer. There are settings of popular tunes, dance movements and vocal pieces. None of the keyboard pieces bear a composer's name, and only a few of the vocal pieces are attributed, but many are identifiable from other sources. These include: William Byrd, with his Battel suite, dating from at least 1591; Orlando Gibbons; Henry Lawes and his brother William; Robert Johnson; and Nicholas Lanier. Several pieces are attributed to Thomas Strengthfield, of whom nothing is known, but who may have been Elizabeth's music teacher. Other pieces are attributed to John Balls (died 1622), a wait or public musician of the city of London; and John Wilson, who replaced him. #Sr Tho: ffairfax Marche #Nanns Maske (Orlando Gibbons) #Almaygne #The ffairest Nimphes the valleys or mountaines euer bred, & c. #The Scots Marche #Prince Ruperts Martch #One of ye Symphon(ies) #One of ye Symphon(ies) (William Lawes) #Selebrand (Sarabande) #When the King enioyes his owne againe #Almaygne #A Trumpett tune #Essex last goodnight #Almaygne per Tho: Strengthfield #The Corrant to ye last Alm(aygne) per Tho: Strengthfield #Ruperts Retraite #Almaygne per Tho: Strengthfield #Corrant to ye former Alma(ygne) per Tho: Strengthfield #[Untitled] #The Nightingale #Corrant Bear #Selebrand Beare #Corrant Beare #Almayne #Corrant #Corrant Beare #Corrant Beare #The Battaile (William Byrd): The Souldiars summons #The Martch of ffoote #(The) Martch (of) horse #The Trumpetts #The Irish Martch #Bagpipes #The Drum and fflute #The Martch (to) ye ffight #Tarra- tantarra #(The) Battell Joyned #Retrait #The Buriing of the dead #The Souldiers delight #Corrant #Selebrand #A Maske #Corrant #Selebrand #Ly still my Deare #The Chestnut #Cloris sight (sighed) #Now ye springe is comne #Oh Iesu meeke #Corrant #Corrant #Maske #Corrant #Almaygne #Lupus Ayre (Thomas Lupo?) #Could thine incomparable eye #Almaygne: Mr Johnson (Orlando Gibbons) #Mock-Nightingale #What if the King should come to ye City #The Kings Complaint #Almaygne #Corrant #Selebrand #My delyght #A Scotts Tuen #An Irish Toy #Allmayne #The spaynard (Spaniard) #[Untitled] #Selabrand #The ffinex (Phoenix) #The faithfull Brothers #A Corant #This soldier loues #Carron o carron (Charon) #A horne pipe #Almaygne #Corrant per Tho: Strengthfield #Selebrand #Almaine #Corant #Almaygne #I wish noe more (Nicolas Lanier) #[Untitled] #Selebrand #Loue is strange #Almaygne Mercure #Glory of ye North #Almaine #Merceur (Mercury) #Corrant #Corrant #Phill: Porters Lamentation #Psalme 42 (William Lawes) #Must your faire #Since tis my fate #No flattring pellow #Baloo my boy #Ile wish no more #Deerest loue #No noe I tell ye no #O that myne eyes #Yes I could loue #Lett god the god of Battaile Rize #Sing to the king of kings (William Lawes) #Psalme 39. verse 12 (William Lawes) #I preethe sweete (Henry Lawes) #fyer (Nicholas Lanier: lyrics by Thomas Campion) #Come you pritty (Thomas Campion) #All you forsaken louers #Think not deare (William and Henry Lawes) See also * The Mulliner Book * The Dublin Virginal Manuscript * My Ladye Nevells Booke * Susanne van Soldt Manuscript * Clement Matchett's Virginal Book * Fitzwilliam Virginal Book * Parthenia * Priscilla Bunbury's Virginal Book * Anne Cromwell's Virginal Book References Further reading * Elizabeth Rogers hir Virginall Booke, edited by Charles J.

The film is based on a short story sometimes published as \\"How About You\\" and sometimes published as \\"The Hard Core\\" in This Year It Will Be Different, a 1996 collection of short stories by Maeve Binchy.Fitzpatrick, Michael. \\"Books: Michael Fitzpatrick recalls Maeve Binchy\\" (New York Irish Arts, August 3, 2012) It tells the story of a young woman named Ellie who is left in charge of the residential home run by her older sister, during Christmas period. Most of the residents have gone with their families during the holidays, but four residents, known as the hardcore, remain.Brussat, Frederic and Mary Ann. \\"How About You\\" review at Spirituality Practice: Resources for Spiritual Journeys (11/08). Their behaviour will cause much trouble and will lead to the residence facing closure. Synopsis Ellie Harris (Hayley Atwell) goes to her sister Kate's (Orla Brady) residential home, Woodlane, in search of a job. Ellie has some trouble adjusting to her new job but quickly befriends a resident named Alice (Joan O'Hara). Ellie decides to have talks with Alice and neglects parts of her job, much to her sister's annoyance. She also has trouble doing what she is told by the residents. Because of her friendship with Alice, Ellie decides to help her feel better by taking her down to the river (which is against the nurse's orders) and giving her marijuana to ease her pain. The next day, however, Ellie finds out that Alice has died. Kate gets news that their mother had a stroke and decides to be with her. She asks Ellie to stay behind with the four residents that are staying over the Christmas holiday because Ellie and her mother do not get along. Georgia Platts (Vanessa Redgrave) is a former actress and singer. The Nightingale sisters, Heather (Brenda Fricker) and Hazel (Imelda Staunton), are spinsters who moved in after spending years taking care of their mother. Donald Vanston (Joss Ackland) is a recovering alcoholic who enjoys playing piano and used to be a judge. These four residents are driving out others with their eccentric ways. They also seem to believe that, because they pay to be there, they can act however they please. While Ellie is watching over them, she learns more about the residents. Donald requests his breakfast in his room at 6 o'clock instead of in the dining room at the usual time at 8. After he gets upset that his order is wrong, she tells him that he can have breakfast in the dining room like everyone else. Donald reveals to Ellie that the music he plays at night is his late wife's favourite song and that he regrets not sobering up before she died. Heather demands that she be given any letters addressed to her sister to keep from upsetting her. However, Kate neglected to tell Ellie this and she got a letter for Hazel from the postman. When Ellie goes to give the letter to Hazel in her room, she notices sketches and paintings in her room and realises that Hazel is a talented artist. Hazel finds Ellie in her room and demands that she leave. Ellie then slips the letter under the door. It is then revealed that Heather has been writing as Hazel when Hazel's son Simon, whom she was forced to give up for adoption, tried to find her. Heather later tells Hazel that she was afraid that Simon would take Hazel away from her. Hazel then tells Heather that she will always love her and they decide to meet Simon together in the new year. Georgia constantly asks for Ellie to make her martinis and makes frequent trips to the local pub to entertain the patrons. Georgia tells Ellie that after her husband died, she decided to get back into the theatre, but realised that everything had changed since she was young. She then moved into Woodlane because she hated being alone and that abusing everyone is \\"part of the fun\\". Ellie decides to have a Christmas dinner with the residents and they all go out to buy decorations and food (Including Hazel, who is terrified of being outside the Woodlane property). They decide to have a drink in the pub and Ellie points out Hazel's paintings hung on the wall behind them. Heather then shows everyone her talent at playing pool. They all drive back to the home while singing carols. They then have their Christmas dinner together and start to get along with each other. The next day, Mr. Evans (Darragh Kelly), from the Department of Health, arrives and is shocked that Kate would leave residents alone. The residents band together saying that they wanted to stay and that they are a family. Donald then asks if he wants to stay for dinner, but Mr. Evans leaves, startled. He then comes back saying that he was upset because his wife just left him and he stays for dinner. Later, when Kate returns, Heather is shown keeping a garden, Hazel is painting outside, and Donald and Georgia are handing out tea to some boys who are raking the lawn. Ellie then tells Kate that she has decided to leave and will spend some time with their mother. At the end, Donald and Georgia are dancing outside, singing \\"How About You?\\".

Plot  In 1934, the researcher Maple White and his assistant Azbek discover an unknown world populated by dinosaurs situated on a plateau in Mongolia. After having found a Quetzalcoatlus's egg in a cave, White celebrates the discovery with Azbek, uncorking a bottle of champagne and listening to classical music. However, Azbek is attacked and killed by Eudimorphodons, which also attack White, who falls from the plateau holding onto a rope; he survives but is seriously wounded. White is found again and taken care of by Myar and Djena, respectively Azbek's brother and sister. He asks the two to bring him his friend George Challenger, to whom White gives an account of his adventures, proposing to Challenger that he should try to fully explore the plateau in his place. Challenger returns to London, England and organizes a lecture, trying to persuade some to finance an expedition to prove that dinosaurs still exist despite scientific belief to the contrary. During the lecture, Challenger is derided and humiliated not only from the students but also from his colleagues Leo Summerlee and Lord Thomas. However, Lord Thomas ultimately grants permission for the expedition on the condition that Summerlee accompanies Challenger to act as a \\"critical eye\\". Subsequently, Oscar Perreault, a spectator at the lecture, proposes to pay for the expedition's expenses if the scientists capture a living dinosaur and exhibit it to the public wherever he wishes and his associate John Roxton joins the expedition in order to represent his interests. Challenger unwillingly accepts the proposal. After concluding the lecture, Challenger bumps into the young journalist Arthur Malone, whom he asks to join the expedition in order to document it. After granting permission to Malone, Challenger is confronted by the same woman who had interrupted his lecture earlier, who reveals herself to be the late Dr. White's daughter, Amanda, who also insists on joining the team in order to represent her father's interests. In the following days, the team heads to Mongolia. They stop on the way in order to pick up their guides, who include the young siblings Myar and Djena. After they resume their journey, their transportation suffers a breakdown, and the team is forced to continue the trip on foot. One of the guides is killed by an insect that is presumably a prehistoric; however, despite misgivings expressed by the guides, the team continues after conducting a funeral in accordance with the local rites. The team finally reaches the foot of the plateau, where Amanda White is abducted by two neanderthals. Noticing Amanda's disappearance, the team searches for her. Challenger and Roxton quickly find her suspended from a ritual framework by her abductors. In rescuing her, they are also forced to face the neanderthal tribe, which is defeated due to modern weaponry. The team escapes the charging natives with a hot air balloon, in which they fly up from the plateau. Using binoculars, Summerlee observes three Quetzalcoatlus nearby. The animals prove to be hostile and immediately attack the balloon, knocking Myar from it and then causing an irreparable tear to the balloon, causing the whole team to plummet to the plateau below. Upon arriving, the team is amazed to see a Brontosaurus. Meanwhile, Djena is bitten by an unknown creature in a water court but saved by Challenger. The team searches for and finds shelter in a cave, where it discovers a series of intricate symbols on the walls. Roxton decides to return to the wreckage of the balloon in order to recover his supplies. Upon his return he presents the team with a young Centrosaurus, which he wants to sell for $100,000. Roxton then reveals to the team that he intends to make the plateau an area exclusively for high-risk game hunting and has planned to do so all along. Then Roxton orders Malone to tie up Djena and Challenger to do the same Malone. Taking advantage of Roxton's temporary distraction, Challenger succeeds in disarming Roxton instead and recovers the rifle. However, Roxton aims a knife Djena's neck, forcing Challenger to return the rifle to him. Djena once again distracts Roxton by biting Roxton's hand, and Challenger attacks him. Ultimately, Challenger is able to render Roxton unconscious. Meanwhile, Amanda White and Professor Summerlee are deciphering the symbols on the cave walls. They are attacked by a dinosaur but fight it off. At the same time, Challenger, Malone and Djena are returning with the tied-up Roxton and are attacked by a giant crocodile. It snaps only Roxton, leaving the other three unscathed. Returning to the cave, Amanda White reports of Mongolia's lost history revealed through the symbols. These tell of a tribe, the kerraks. They interacted with prehistoric creatures: they hunted some dinosaurs, some of which became extinct; for this, their native predecessors, the neanderthals, chased the kerraks in order to avoid the total destruction of the lost world, becoming the plateau's guardians. After hearing the story, Professor Summerlee reveals to the team that he does not want to return to London, deciding to pass the rest of his life in studying the plateau's environment. Shortly after this a neanderthal appears in the cave and shoots Summerlee with a poison dart. It causes Summerlee to become very disoriented and experience hallucinations; under its influence, he exits the cave and is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The rest of the team finds the dead body of Summerlee, which it covers with a British flag. Returning to the cave, Amanda White and Challenger discover that there is, in fact, a larger cave behind the first, the same one discovered by Maple White in the film's first scenes. Exploring the cave, the two come across the skeleton of Azbek and White's vinyl record. In the same instant, a battered John Roxton reveals to Amanda White and to Challenger that the cave is full of explosives and that the two cannot be not be saved once he lights the fuse. Roxton is also in possession of a Eudimorphodon, which frees itself and attacks him, causing him to fall from the plateau and die. Before falling, however, Roxton manages to light the fuse; and Amanda and Challenger barely succeed in escaping. While trying to prepare a parachute, Djena finds a dead Velociraptor and is attacked by Eoraptors, which then attack the other team members. Later that night, a Tyrannosaurus attacks the camp. The team tries to escape, but Djena is once again attacked by the Eoraptors. When the Eoraptors disperse, Djena is attacked and killed by the Tyrannosaurus. Wanting to avenge Djena, Malone distracts the T.rex by throwing rocks at it. He is ultimately able to kill the T.rex with a large blast of fire by igniting flammable gas caused by a nearby volcano. Amanda White and Challenger are saved from the hot flash by throwing themselves down from the plateau's frame with the parachute that Djena had been preparing earlier. Returning to London, Challenger communicates the death of his companions to the students. On account of the danger present at the place, he chooses to state that the expedition found nothing, thus ensuring that no further expedition would to the plateau would be made. In the last scenes of the film, Malone, the film's narrator, has remained on the plateau and adapted to life there.

It is the third screen adaptation of the 1882 novel Vice Versa by F. Anstey. The film was produced by Two Cities Films and distributed by General Film Distributors. Plot The film begins with an elderly Paul Bultitude seeing his son, Dick, and new daughter-in-law Dulcie off after their wedding. He then directly addresses the audience, implied to be reporters, about a story he has been embarrassed to discuss for years about how he and his son have had such a strong relationship. During the British Raj, unscrupulous Marmaduke Paradine steals the Garuda Stone, the magical eye of an Indian idol, which grants one wish to each possessor. He had been warned that the thief of the stone would have bad luck; convinced by the time he returns to England, he gives it to the recently widowed Paul, his former brother-in-law. Paul, a wealthy stockbroker, cannot understand why his eldest son Dick is reluctant to return to boarding school after a holiday. Paul recalls the carefree days of his youth and casually wishes he could take Dick's place while holding the stone. As a result, he finds himself looking just like his son. When Dick realizes what has happened, the neglected boy uses his wish to take on his father's appearance, eager to enjoy the perks of being an adult. Dick cheerfully sends his protesting father off to school, while he throws parties, flirts with Alice, the maid, and even carries on with his father's girlfriend Fanny Verlayne. He also enters into a partnership in a new horseless carriage business, becoming even wealthier. Meanwhile, Paul's pompous behavior soon antagonizes his classmates and the disciplinarian headmaster, Dr. Grimstone. He also puzzles Grimstone's daughter Dulcie, who cannot understand why her once-attentive beau seems to be smitten with a much-older Fanny. Paul escapes the bullying at school and returns home, only to overhear Paradine tell Fanny how he plans to trick Dick into signing away control of his horseless carriage company. He pleads with his son to restore them back to their proper bodies, but Dick cannot remember where he left the stone. Paul finally finds it in the hands of his younger son Rollie and gets him to wish things back. Chastened by his experience, Paul becomes more understanding of Dick's situation and has Dr. Grimstone, who had followed him home, removed from the premises. Back in the present, Paul explains that Fanny left him and that two years prior, Dr. Grimstone died of a heart attack while beating a boy. He is forever remembered for being humiliated by the Bultitudes. The Garuda Stone was stolen by an eager thief who accidentally wished himself away from the police to the North Pole. Paul warns the audience that if they were to find a green-grey stone with a handle on it to not make any wishes. Being lonely, he ended up marrying Alice the maid who gives him an earful for wasting his time telling the story.

This may bring him into conflict with lovers of the original story. But the fact remains that this spectacular burlesque has many novel touches and gets the laughs.

It also focused on sustainable design, independent music and DIY culture. The magazine was marketed to people who enjoy creating unique items to have at home and wear and featured projects which could often be completed with everyday materials, such as household items. History ReadyMade was founded by chief editor Shoshana Berger and publisher Grace Hawthorne in Berkeley, California. The inaugural issue was published in Winter 2002, with quarterly issues produced until the magazine moved to bimonthly issues with the March/April 2004 publication. In 2006, the Meredith Corporation purchased the magazine. In January 2009, Meredith announced it was relocating the magazine's creative staff to Des Moines, Iowa due to company- wide budgetary concerns (though the ReadyMade title itself was reportedly successful). None of the editorial staff chose to relocate, and Better Homes and Gardens executive editor Kitty Morgan assumed editorial duties for ReadyMade on an interim basis. On June 16, 2011, ReadyMade announced on its blog that Meredith had discontinued the magazine. Subjects Unlike more traditional home improvement magazines and how-to books, ReadyMade's projects were aimed at a younger (21–39) audience. Projects in their issues included: * making a lamp out of a cd spindle * altering a car stereo to accept an iPod input jack * instructions on how to run for local office in the United States * recycling broken speakers to become light fixtures, coffee tables, or bookcases and similar projects with an emphasis on creating an urban indie aesthetic. Demographic ReadyMade was aimed at the emerging DIY culture in North America that enjoys not only the fashion of handmade items and interior design, but also the philosophy and politics inherent in recycling, DIY attire, and ecology. The ads featured in the magazine targeted a largely liberal readership interested in locally produced, handmade, ecological, and organic goods, but also featured ads from companies such as PF Flyers shoes, Urban Outfitters, and similar corporations looking to appeal to a young hipster audience. The music featured in the articles was generally independent rock, featuring such artists' own DIY projects, such as an article where The Flaming Lips showed how to make a mock space station out of junkyard parts.

The star is classified as an \\"extreme horizontal branch star\\". It is small, with only half the mass and a bit less than one quarter the diameter of the Sun. It has luminosity 34 times that of the Sun. It could be quite old, perhaps in excess of 10 Gyr. It is a pulsating variable star of the V361 Hydrae type (or also called sdBVr type). It is believed that the star's mass when it was still on the main sequence was between 0.8 and 0.9 times that of the Sun. Formation Subdwarf B stars such as V391 Pegasi are thought to be the result of the ejection of the hydrogen envelope of a red giant star at or just before the onset of helium fusion. The ejection left only a tiny amount of hydrogen on the surface—less than 1/1000 of the total stellar mass. The future for the star is to eventually cool down to make a low-mass white dwarf. Most stars retain more of their hydrogen after the first red giant phase, and eventually become asymptotic giant branch stars. The reason that some stars, like V391 Pegasi, lose so much mass is not well known. At the tip of the red-giant branch, the red giant precursors of the subdwarf stars reach their maximum radius, on the order of 0.7 AU. After this point, the hydrogen envelope is lost and helium fusion begins—this is known as the helium flash.  Hypthesized planetary system  In 2007, research using the variable star timing method indicated the presence of a gas giant planet orbiting V391 Pegasi. This planet was designated V391 Pegasi b. This planet around an \\"extreme horizontal branch\\" star provided clues about what could happen to the planets in the Solar System when the Sun turns into a red giant within the next 5 billion years. However, subsequent research published in 2018, taking the large amount of new photometric time-series data amassed since the publication of the original data into account, found evidence both for and against the exoplanet's existence. Although the planet's existence was not disproved, the case for its existence was now certainly weaker, and the authors stated that it \\"requires confirmation with an independent method.\\"  References  Sources *  External links  * B-type subdwarfs Pegasus (constellation) Very rapidly pulsating hot stars Pegasi, V391 ","title":"V391 Pegasi"},{"id":"13281328","text":"Corona–West is a Metrolink station in west Corona, California, on the 91 Line and Inland Empire-Orange Country Line.

He represented the Soviet Union on the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). He worked closely with Hugh Dryden, his American counterpart, to promote international cooperation on space projects at the height of the Cold War. Anatoli adopted a dog named Tsygan, one of the first dogs to make a successful sub-orbital flight in 1951. Start of US/Soviet spaceflight cooperation Blagonravov was instrumental in opening the door to international cooperation in human spaceflight. After John Glenn's orbital flight, an exchange of letters between President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev led to a series of discussions led by Blagonravov and NASA Deputy Director Hugh Dryden. Their talks in 1962 led to the Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on December 5, 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the U.S. Echo II balloon satellite. Unfortunately, as the competition between the two nation's manned space programs heated up, efforts to further cooperation at that point came to an end. In April 1970, he held informal talks in New York City with NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, about the possibility of performing a rendezvous and docking of a US and Soviet spacecraft. This led to an agreement signed on May 24, 1972, by US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, calling for such a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other. On July 17, 1975, the crews of a US Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft performed such a docking, visiting each other's spacecraft, shaking hands, exchanging gifts, and performing joint experiments in space.

Located in Hillsborough, New Jersey the property is managed by the Doris Duke Foundation after the death of Doris Duke, the second owner. After extensive reorganization \\"Duke Farms\\" was opened to the public on May 19, 2012. History Starting in 1893, \\"Buck\\" Duke started to buy land next to the Raritan River in rural New Jersey. His vision was to create a farm similar to those in North Carolina where he had grown up. He engaged a number of architects and engineers to fulfill his dream, including Buckenham & Miller, James Leal Greenleaf and Elizabeth Biddle Shipman. Eventually he had assembled about 2,700 acres (11 km²) of farm and wood lands that contained 45 buildings, 9 lakes, 18 miles of roads, 810 acres of woodlands, 464 acres of grassland bird habitat and 1.5 miles of stone walls. Duke died in 1925, and his 12-year- old daughter, Doris Duke, gained control of the property after suing her mother. She restored it and moved in at the age of fifteen. She was very invested in the property and made it her main residence. She incorporated innovative ecological farming methods she learned from Louis Bromfield's Malabar Farm. Starting in 1958 she created and designed over a five-year period a unique botanical display in the Horace Trumbauer conservatory and greenhouses known as Duke Gardens. Duke Gardens opened to the public in 1964. Doris Duke died in 1993. Duke Farms as park for the public  The Orchid Range Duke Farms is owned by the Duke Farms Foundation (DFF) that was established in 1998 to manage the estate. The Foundation, in turn, is part of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. A decision was made to renovate the estate as \\"a model of environmental stewardship in the 21st Century and (to) inspire visitors to become informed stewards of the land.\\" While reorganizing the estate little was accessible to the public. In 2008, the DFF created some controversy when it permanently closed Duke Gardens demolishing the indoor display gardens that had been created by Doris Duke. Over the years, the DFF created new indoor and outdoor display gardens that are eco-friendly, use native plants, and are wheelchair accessible. In the process of rehabilitation numerous invasive foreign plants were removed including Norwegian maple and Asian Ailanthus and replaced by native species. The property has a number of notable trees, including four of the ten oldest trees of New Jersey, and two champion trees, a Northern Red Oak and an Amur Cork Tree. On May 19, 2012, Duke Farms opened to the public. After a $45-million renovation, Duke Farms now include 30 endangered species and 230 varieties of birds, among which are the great blue heron and the bald eagle. As part of the rehabilitation the conservatory and greenhouses known as the Orchid Range were renovated and became more energy-efficient. The Farm Barn was remodeled to become the Orientation Center.

She belonged to the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique. When launched on 21 March 1905 in a ceremony attended by the Ministers of Public Works and Commerce along with the First Secretary of Marine, La Provence was the largest ship in the French merchant marine and the largest built in France. La Provence La Provence was length overall by beam and, at design draft of , limited for the relatively shallow harbor of Havre from which the ship was to operate, displaced 19,190 metric tons or 18,870 gross tons. A proposal to power the ship with turbines was rejected and two conventional triple expansion steam engines chosen instead driving two screws with 30,000 IHP for an expected speed of 23 knots. Four steam driven dynamos supplied electric power. The ship was designed with accommodation for 397 first class, 205 second class and 900 third class passengers served by 435 crew members for a total of 1,937 persons. The ship operated on the Havre—New York route, making one crossing in six days and four hours for an average of 21.63 knots. Armed merchant cruiser Provence II The ship was taken over by the French government to become the French Navy's Provence II, an armed merchant cruiser that was converted to a troopship in order to support the Gallipoli Campaign and Macedonian campaign in World War I. Provence II was transporting troops from France to Salonika when she was sunk by the German U-boat commanded by Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière south of Cape Matapan. The ship listed so quickly that many of the lifeboats could not be used. There were 742 survivors. Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the sinking. Contemporary reports from Paris indicated nearly 4,000 persons aboard and 3,130 lives lost. Modern accounts of losses revise those numbers downward to about 1,700 troops aboard and under 1,000 lost. The wartime reports from Paris for losses in this one sinking are quite close to the total, 3,180, for three troop ships sunk in connection with the Salonika troop movements: Provence II, (October 1916) and (Januari 1917). The Sydney Morning Herald for 8 March 1916, and several other English-language papers, reported: > M. Bokanowski, a French Deputy, who is one of the survivors of the French > auxiliary cruiser Provence, which was torpedoed and sunk in the > Mediterranean, narrates that a battalion of the Third Colonial Infantry was > aboard.

It would later be supplemented by similar programs such as Night Ride and Night Moves.\\"Global serves up some quiet night magic\\". Broadcast Week, July 2, 1988. Despite having a seven-year run on Global, only two episodes of Night Walk and one episode each of Night Ride and Night Moves were originally produced, and were repeated nightly during late-night hours. The programs are now considered as one of the early forays into the concept of slow television.\\"Creators look back on late-night Toronto TV classic: 'Night Moves'\\". As It Happens, May 14, 2015. Production Each of the shows was a first-person view of a trip through part of Toronto during the late-night hours, accompanied by jazz music.\\"A late-night ride around the dial: Between reruns and test patterns lies a low-budget pocket of Canadian programs that takes viewers down the parkway and up to the heavens\\". Toronto Star, November 28, 1987. The original Night Walk strolled through the Yorkville district of the city and the Yorkdale subway station; Night Ride drove down the Don Valley Parkway and the Gardiner Expressway, thence onto King Street and ended in the city's Chinatown; Night Moves followed Queens Quay to Front Street, ending in a hotel nightclub. Night Ride also included a brief segment during which the film crew was stopped by a police officer. The second episode of Night Walk consisted of other footage from the same trip as Night Moves. The programs were created by Michael Spivak, then vice-president of production for Global, as a substitute for a test pattern. Spivak, also a hobby composer, wrote the musical score. The soundtracks were performed by an ensemble consisting of local musicians Guido Basso, Jimmy Dale, Eugene Amaro, Mike Malone, Joe Sealy, Sara Hamilton, David Hamilton and Sharon Lee Williams. Bill Elliott was the director, and David Crone was the cinematographer. According to Elliott, the programs were actually created as a revenue stream, as the use of original music owned by the network enabled Global to collect royalty payments from SOCAN, which were pure profit to the network as the repeated reuse of the same episodes meant that the shows had no ongoing production costs. However, SOCAN soon caught on to what Global was doing, and changed its rules so that music played after midnight was valued at just 10 per cent of the normal rates. Media coverage identified the shows' largest audiences as insomniacs and prison inmates.\\"Night Moves: Prison inmates, insomniacs and night owls are among the legions of fans of Global's three hours of T.O. at night\\". Toronto Star, June 25, 1988. Legacy In 2015 John McGill, a staffer for the CBC Radio news program As It Happens, released \\"Night Ride Redux\\" to YouTube, which recreated the original Night Ride route to illustrate the ways in which the city had changed since the 1980s. The route was not able to be perfectly recreated, as one street depicted in the original film, Temperance Street, is now a one-way street in the opposite direction of travel. In 2016, the entertainment website The A.V. Club profiled the program as part of its regular \\"Great Job, Internet!\\" feature.\\"Sign off for the weekend with a vintage late-night broadcast\\".

Early life and education Miller was born in Camargo, Oklahoma and worked as a locomotive engineer before becoming a songwriter. Although he was never educated beyond high school, he taught songwriting at the University of Tennessee. Career His first published song, written in the mid-1930s, was \\"I Love You, Honey.\\" In 1946, he wrote what was to become his biggest hit, \\"Release Me,\\" though at first he could not get anyone to record it. Eventually he recorded it himself, and it was covered by several singers and was commercially successful. He was the founder of the Country and Western Music Academy in Hollywood, as well as a co-founder of the Nashville Songwriters Association International (of which he served as the first president and also another term in the presidency). Miller wrote a country opera, \\"The Legend of Johnny Brown,\\" and a gospel opera, \\"It Was Jesus.\\" \\"Legend of Johnny Brown\\" was a concept project that was released on Tower Records. The project featured Kay Adams as Mary Lou, Ray Sanders as Sheriff Tom, Alice Rene as Jezebel Jones and Jerry Naylor as Johnny Brown. Miller pitched this project to Capitol Records, with a demo version he had already recorded with Alice Rene performing all of the female vocals. Miller actually wanted Rene for the Mary Lou character, but Capitol Records went with Kay Adams. Miller pressed the label to use Rene and secured her the part of Jezebel Jones. The irony is, that the only recorded version Adams had to learn this music, were the original demos previously recorded by Rene. He died in Nashville, Tennessee at age 57. Awards and recognition Miller received Performance Awards from BMI for \\"There She Goes\\" (1954), for \\"Thanks a Lot\\" (1964), and \\"Release Me\\" (1954, 1962, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, and 1973, as well as a Most Performed Song award in 1968 and a Pop & Country Performance Award in 1974). His publisher, Four Star Publishing, gave him platinum records for \\"Release Me\\" and \\"There She Goes.\\" The Oklahoma Music Association awarded him its All Time Great Songwriter's Award.

They are usually round, but can also be square or rectangular. They usually range from ; most are in diameter. They have gratings that are made of metal or plastic. The floor around the drain is also sloped to allow the water to flow to the drain. Many residential basements have one or more floor drains, usually near a water heater or washer/dryer. Floor drains can also be found in commercial basements, restrooms, kitchens, refrigerator areas, locker/shower rooms, laundry facilities, and near swimming pools, among other places. A floor drain should always have a strainer secured over it to prevent injury, entry of foreign objects, or introduction of unwanted pests into the facility. However, if the strainer is not smooth enough, hair and other objects can still get stuck in it, clogging the drain. A floor sink is a type of floor drain primarily used as an indirect waste receptor.

There are several subspecies and also hybrids, rendering the identification of this species more difficult, but typically, the flowering spike is robust with a hollow stem, 25–60 cm tall, and bearing up to 50 flowers. Plants grow to a height of from 15 to 70 cm. The 4–7 erect yellowish-green leaves are hooded at the tip. The inflorescence is 4–12 cm long, with up to 50 blooms. The labellum appears long and narrow, since its sides are strongly reflexed (folded back). The tip is shallowly three-lobed. The flower is often flesh-coloured (the meaning of incarnata) and the labellum normally has loop-shaped markings. The flowering period is from May to mid-July, dependent on latitude and subspecies.

Design and development The prototype M.5 Sparrowhawk was developed from standard Miles Hawk components as an entry into the King's Cup Race of 1935 piloted by F.G. Miles. The standard Hawk fuselage was shortened and accommodation was for only one pilot, sitting as low as possible. The top decking was reduced in height, a special high-compression version of the de Havilland Gipsy Six engine was fitted, and the undercarriage track was widened. Although the Sparrowhawk won the 1935 speed prize at an average of over , because of heavy handicapping, it only came ninth overall in the race. Sparrowhawk prototype in 1949 A further five Sparrowhawks (designated M.5A) were also built as King's Cup Racers and three were delivered to customers but they did not perform spectacularly. In 1936 Victor Smith entered Sparrowhawk G-AELT into the Schlesinger Race from Portsmouth to Johannesburg but had problems with oil after Salonika and eventually retired in Khartoum.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202705.html The final two M.5A Sparrowhawks were built in 1936 but were not flown until 1940. One was modified and flown to meet a requirement for an experimental aircraft for high-lift flap research with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, it was later de-modified and used as a communications aircraft. The sixth Sparrowhawk was modified with short span wings and wide chord flaps for experimental work. The prototype, registered G-ADNL, was modified in late 1953 as a jet-powered racer for Fred Dunkerley. The front fuselage and tail unit were modified and it was re-designated the M.77 Sparrowjet. The Sparrowjet was powered by two Turbomeca Palas gas turbine engines fitted in the wing roots and eventually achieved its original purpose and Dunkerley won the King's Cup Race in 1957 at an average speed of . Operational history The prototype Sparrowhawk survived the Second World War and was flown by Fairey Aviation test pilot C.G.M. Alington in several UK air races until 1950. It was then sold back to Miles and was modified into the M.77 Sparrowjet.Jackson, Volume 3, p. 485 The third Sparrowhawk was sold to South Africa in October 1937 as ZS-ANO. It was fitted with a cabin top and was impressed into service with the South African Air Force in 1940.

It is also found in Algeria, Morocco, and western Siberia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesAltervista Flora Italiana, Orchide macchiata, Dactylorhiza maculata (L.) Soó includes European distribution map  Etymology  The name of the genus Dactylorhiza is formed from Greek words δάκτυλος \\"daktylos\\" meaning \\"finger\\" and ρίζα \\"rhiza\\" meaning \\"root\\" and refers to the tubers of this plant, that are split into several tubercles. The specific Latin name \\"maculata\\" (=spotted) refers to the stained leaves. The scientific binomial name of this plant was initially Orchis maculata, proposed by the Swedish naturalist and botanist Carl von Linné (1707–1778) in 1753. The name has been subsequently amended to the one currently accepted (Dactylorhiza maculata), by the Hungarian botanist Károly Rezső Soó (1903–1980) in 1962. In German this plant is called Geflecktes Knabenkraut, in French is called Orchis tacheté, in Italy is called Orchide macchiata.  Description  Close-up on a flower of Dactylorhiza maculata Dactylorhiza maculata reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . These plants are bulbous geophytes, forming their buds in underground tubers or bulbs, organs that annually produce new stems, leaves and flowers. Furthermore, these orchids are \\"terrestrial\\", because unlike \\"epiphyte\\" species they do not live at the expense of other large plants. This orchid has an erect, glabrous and cylindrical stem, with a streaked surface. The leaves are oblong or oval-lanceolate, with dark ellipsoid-shaped \\"spots\\" on the surface (hence the species name). The leaves are amplexicaul and can be either radical (basal) or cauline. The underground part of the stem has two webbed tubers each one more or less deeply divided into several lobes or tubercles (characteristic of the genus Dactylorhiza), the first one plays the important functions of supplying the stem, while the second one collects nutrient materials for the development of the plant that will form in the coming year. The inflorescence is long and it is composed of flowers gathered in dense spikes. The flowers are placed in the axils of bracts membranous and lanceolate-shaped. Their colors vary from light pink to purple or white with darker streaks mainly on the labellum (sometimes at the margins of tepals). The flowers reaches on average . The flowers are hermaphrodite and insect pollinated.  Habitat  The heath spotted orchid prefers sunny places on lowlands or hills, it can be found in slightly damp meadows, but also in the undergrowth of dry forests, in areas with bushes and at the edges of streams. They grow on siliceous and calcareous substrate, at an altitude up to above sea level.  Ecology  Orchids in the genus Dactylorhiza are mycorrhizal generalists. D. maculata has been found to form associations with a range of common species of mycorrhizal fungi in the Tulasnellaceae, as well as with species in the Ceratobasidiaceae and Sebacinales.PLoS One - Variation in Mycorrhizal Associations with Tulasnelloid Fungi among Populations of Five Dactylorhiza SpeciesScientific Reports - Habitat Driven Variation in Mycorrhizal Communities in the Terrestrial Orchid Genus Dactylorhiza Dactylorhiza maculata is pollinated by insects, especially bumblebees. The flowers are 'food deceptive', ie. do not provide nectar to their pollinators.Nordic Journal of Botany - Pollination and Reproductive Success of Two Colour Variants of a Deceptive Orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata (Orchidaceae)  Subspecies  Many names have been proposed for species and varieties in the species.

Currently used exclusively by the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF), it has seen use in the Iraq War. It is built by Komatsu Ltd. Defense Systems Division in Komatsu, Ishikawa, Japan. Komatsu's factory designator for the vehicle is KU50W. The exterior resembles the Panhard VBL, used by the French army, but the LAV has 4 doors and a large cabin for carrying soldiers. The LAV can also be transported by air in vehicles like the CH-47J and the C-130H. History A Komatsu LAV with Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group markings in Samawa. Komatsu LAV during demonstration in Yokosuka 2017 The Komatsu LAV was developed in 1997 to meet a JGSDF need for an armored wheeled vehicle that could provide armored protection since their Toyota High Mobility Vehicles and Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Trucks were not adequate to provide protection from small arms fire. They were initially created with the concept of a potential Soviet invasion during the Cold War before they were relegated to anti- terrorist/invasion operations. It had made its first appearance in Kuwait when JGSDF units had deployed the Komatsu LAV prior to humanitarian operations in Samawah, a city in Iraq, 280 km (174 mi) southeast of Baghdad. An initial 400 LAVs were brought into JGSDF service in March 2005. JASDF base security units are also equipped with the LAV as a main vehicle for patrols. In February 2019, Komatsu announced it will no longer develop new models of the LAV, citing high cost in developing a new model and low profit return. Variants No variants are known to be available, but the vehicle appears to have been built in at least three production models, namely KU50W-0002K, KU50W-0003K and KU50W-0005K. Design Komatsu LAVs used by the JGSDF in a military parade. Note the split-type roof hatches and the machine gun shield. The Komatsu LAV has open-split roof hatch of the vehicle provides additional protection to the gunner from all directions, if it is locked in an upright position. The vehicles deployed in Iraq are fitted with reinforced bulletproof windshields, wire cutters and an armoured tub around the gun mount for extra protection. According to reports, the vehicle is bulletproof against 5.56 and 7.62 bullets. It is unknown whether other bullet calibers can easily penetrate the LAV or not. For the LAV's engine, it is fitted with a liquid cooled 4-cycle diesel engine of 160 hp. The power pack is mounted centre forward of the vehicle to distribute weight more evenly between the axles. The propulsion system provides a top speed of 100 km/h, traveling more than 200 miles without refueling. It is fitted with all run-flat tires. The low turning radius allows the vehicle to negotiate narrow passages. The Komatsu LAV can be armed with the Sumitomo M249 LMG or Sumitomo M2HB 12.7mm machine gun for anti-personnel duties. It can also mount the Type 01 LMAT or a Kawasaki Type 87 anti-tank missile for anti-armored missions. Smoke grenade dischargers can be mounted on the rear sides of the vehicle.

Production  The series was recorded at Progressive Studios in Anzac Ave with the assistance of Tim Gummer and Cameron Fisher. Dubber produced, edited and did the sound design using the Hannah Barbera sound effects library. Dubber and Todd discussed characters and storylines and Todd did the writing; Creating the narrative arc, the dialogue and the comedy. On average, each 3–5 minutes episode took around 16 hours to make. About a quarter of that was recording the dialog and the rest was digital editing. Dubber later said that \\"It kinda jumped the shark towards the end, but they kept paying us to make it, so we kept making it after the wheels had fallen off a bit.\\" Producers Andrew Dubber and Belinda Todd would later produce the radio series Claybourne in 1998, which was geared towards a more mature audience.  Distribution  The show was part of a syndicated compilation show for kids called Buckeroo that was broadcast on Sunday mornings on 26 radio stations in New Zealand. In January 2005, Dubber announced on his blog \\"The Wireless\\" that he had registered Ashley's Worlds under a Creative Commons Licence (by-nc-sa 2.0) and seeded a torrent with the series, and in April 2020 he offered the complete sereies for download on his web page.

Batting gloves are a component in bat-and-ball games sportswear. Typically consisting of a leather palm and back made of nylon or another synthetic fabric, the glove covers one or both hands of a batter, providing comfort, prevention of blisters, warmth, improved grip, and shock absorption when hitting the ball. The use of gloves is not obligatory in any level of the game, but they are considered an essential part of Cricket clothing and equipment. History in Baseball Some claim the first player to wear a batting glove was Bobby Thomson of the Giants, who wore golf gloves during spring training in 1949. Others say that Ted Williams was the first to wear a golf glove in batting practice during the summer of 1953, after he returned to the Red Sox from Korea. According to David Cataneo, the veteran sportswriter who wrote I Remember Williams: Anecdotes and Memories of Baseball's Splendid Splinter, Williams' manager, Fred Corcoran, who also managed Sam Snead and Babe Zaharias at that time, was with Williams one day while he was taking an extra batting practice to get back in shape. Corcoran saw the blisters on Williams' hand and pulled out a golf glove and gave it to him to try. Soon, everyone was wearing a golf glove while batting. Ken \\"Hawk\\" Harrelson has been credited with being the first player to wear a batting glove in an actual game (as opposed to usage during batting practice). In 2013, an hour-long documentary, called “Hawk: The Colorful life of Ken Harrelson,” began airing on the MLB Network. At roughly the 22-minute mark of the presentation, Ken describes his involvement in the origin of the batting glove (although he calls it the \\"hitting\\" glove in the documentary). Ken does not state the year, but describes that in his first two years in the big leagues, he made more money playing golf, shooting pool, and armwrestling than he did playing major league baseball, and goes right into a story. Ken describes, after playing 27 holes of golf with fellow players, Ted Bowsfield, Gino Cimoli, and Sammy Esposito, he went straight to the ballpark for a game against the Yankees, whereby he developed a blister on his left hand during batting practice. He goes on to say that he remembered he had his golf glove in the pocket of his jeans and that he went to bat wearing the \\"flaming red golf glove\\" in the 1st inning to face Whitey [Ford]. He claims that in that 1st-inning at bat, Whitey hung him curveball that he hit it \\"450 feet\\" for a home run over the left-center wall. He goes on to say that in about the 6th inning, Whitey hung him another curveball and he hit that one about \\"480 feet\\". He concludes the story by saying the next day, all of the Yankees came out of their clubhouse with flaming red golf gloves on, as Ken stated that Mickey [Mantle] had the \\"clubby (clubhouse attendant) go out and purchase them. Harrelson laughs and states, \\"and that's how the hitting glove got started.” In previous versions of this page (prior to the edition of the paragraph above, which was added in Feb 2020), there had been debate whether the story took place in 1964 while he was with the Kansas City Athletics or in 1968 while he was with the Boston Red Sox, but there is clear evidence from the documentary that the story takes place in 1964 for the following reasons: (1) Ken leads-off the story in the describing his first two seasons in the big leagues, which were ’63 and ’64, (2) the players he states he was golfing with prior to the blister were exclusively his Kansas City Athletics teammates (Ted Bowsfield and Gino Cimoli were his teammates in ’63 and ’64 and Sammy Esposito was his teammate in ’63, Sammy’s final season playing), and (3) ’64 best aligns with homering off of Whitey Ford (discussed further below) and did not homer off Whitey Ford in ’68. Unless the story took place during a spring training game, for which there would be very limited records, Ken is misremembering the story or he has taken liberties to give it a more lyrical and apocryphal spin. Fact-checking was conducted as part of the Feb 2020 update to this page, whereby Ken’s regular season career home run log was reviewed. Ken never hit two home runs off of Whitey Ford in a single game, as he described. He had two homers off of Ford in his career, but they were in different games separated by two years and neither occurred in the 1st inning. Specifically, they occurred on 9–4–64 in the bottom of the 3rd and two years later, on 7–2–66 also in the bottom of the 3rd (during Ken's time with the Washington Senators). Given the paragraph above, Ken would likely be recalling the 9–4–64 home run. This is further supported by the fact that this is the sole home run of the two vs. Whitey, whereby a second home run would follow later in the game, albeit not off a Whitey as Ken describes, but off Pete Mikkelsen, and it was not in the 6th inning; it was in the bottom of the 9th. To further support the 9–4–64 game, there was a game \\"the next day\\" between the KC Athletics and NY Yankees, which would corroborate Harrelson's claim that the entire Yankees team wore the red golf gloves the following day. Additionally, in previous versions of this article, the term batting gloves (plural) was used in association with the Ken Harrelson story, but in the documentary, Ken clearly describes a single golf glove only (which would make better sense, given that golfers only use one glove). Peter Morris' book A Game of Inches says the batting glove may have been used as early as 1901 by Hughie Jennings, and was definitely used by Lefty O'Doul and Johnny Frederick of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932, and later by Bobby Thomson in the 1950s. Morris credits Ken Harrelson with reintroducing and popularizing the batting glove in the 1960s. Roger Maris also used what was thought to be a batting glove, most likely a golf glove, in the 1961 season. Rusty Staub was the first to wear the golf gloves on a daily basis. Batting gloves became an essential and common element of MLB during the early 1980s with Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies spearheading efforts of Franklin Sports to become the choice of the majority of players. Over time Franklin Sports became (and remains today) the official batting glove of Major League Baseball. Purpose Most baseball players wear batting gloves. The majority of baseball players, at any level of play, wear batting gloves. They are worn because they help increase the quality of the grip on the bat. Maintaining a tight and controlled grip is essential to successful hits. Even the slightest slip or variation in grip can cost the team greatly. They also act as a protector of the hand when one slides into a base. Batting gloves today are even worn by fielders because they say that they feel better in their glove. Another prime use for batting gloves, especially in younger leagues that permit aluminum bats, is shock protection. On a cold day, a bad or loose swing can fracture fingers.

Coupled Ionization sources-MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of various sources combined with different MS systems allow for chemical determinations of samples. DESI employs a fast- moving charged solvent stream, at an angle relative to the sample surface, to extract analytes from the surfaces and propel the secondary ions toward the mass analyzer. This tandem technique can be used to analyze forensics analyses, pharmaceuticals, plant tissues, fruits, intact biological tissues, enzyme-substrate complexes, metabolites and polymers. Therefore, DESI-MS may be applied in a wide variety of sectors including food and drug administration, pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. History DESI has been widely studied since its inception in 2004 by Zoltan Takáts, et al., in Graham Cooks' group from Purdue University with the goal of looking into methods that didn't require the sample to be inside of a vacuum. Both DESI and direct analysis in real time (DART) have been largely responsible for the rapid growth in ambient ionization techniques, with a proliferation of more than eighty new techniques being found today. These methods allow for complex systems to be analyzed without preparation and throughputs as high as 45 samples a minute. DESI is a combination popular techniques, such as, electrospray ionization and surface desorption techniques. Electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968, but John Bennett Fenn was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry for the development of ESI-MS in the late 1980s. Then in 1999, desorption of open surface and free matrix experiments were reported in the literature utilizing an experiment that was called desorption/ionization on silicon. The combination of these two advancements led to the introduction of DESI and DART as the main ambient ionization techniques that would later become multiple different techniques. One in particular, due to increasing studies into optimization of DESI is, Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization. In this technique the analyte is desorbed into a bridge formed via two capillaries and the analysis surface. Principle of operation 388x388px DESI is a combination of electrospray (ESI) and desorption (DI) ionization methods. Ionization takes place by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away. The electrospray mist is pneumatically directed at the sample where subsequent splashed droplets carry desorbed, ionized analytes. After ionization, the ions travel through air into the atmospheric pressure interface which is connected to the mass spectrometer. DESI is a technique that allows for ambient ionization of a trace sample at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation. DESI can be used to investigate in situ, secondary metabolites specifically looking at both spatial and temporal distributions. =Ionization mechanism= In DESI there are two kinds of ionization mechanism, one that applies to low molecular weight molecules and another to high molecular weight molecules. High molecular weight molecules, such as proteins and peptides show electrospray like spectra where multiply charged ions are observed. This suggests desorption of the analyte, where multiple charges in the droplet can easily be transferred to the analyte. The charged droplet hits the sample, spreads over a diameter greater than its original diameter, dissolves the protein and rebounces. The droplets travel to the mass spectrometer inlet and are further desolvated. The solvent typically used for the electrospray is a combination of methanol and water. For the low molecular weight molecules, ionization occurs by charge transfer: an electron or a proton. There are three possibilities for the charge transfer. First, charge transfer between a solvent ion and an analyte on the surface. Second, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and analyte on the surface; in this case the solvent ion is evaporated before reaching the sample surface. This is achieved when the spray to surface distance is large. Third, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and a gas phase analyte molecule. This occurs when a sample has a high vapour pressure. \\\\+ S_{(s)} -> {A_{(aq)}} + S^-_{(s)}}} \\\\+ S_{(s)} -> {A_{(g)}} + S^-_{(s)}}} \\\\+ S_{(g)} -> {A_{(g)}} + S^-_{(g)}}} The ionization mechanism of low molecular weight molecules in DESI is similar to DART's ionization mechanism, in that there is a charge transfer that occurs in the gas phase. Ionization efficiency Side view of DESI ion source along with a table containing typical values for the geometric parameters The ionization efficiency of DESI is complex and depends on several parameters such as, surface effects, electrospray parameters, chemical parameters and geometric parameters. Surface effects include chemical composition, temperature and electric potential applied. Electrospray parameters include electrospray voltage, gas and liquid flow rates. Chemical parameters refers to the sprayed solvent composition, e.g. addition of NaCl. Geometric parameters are α, β, d1 and d2 (see figure on the right). Furthermore, α and d1 affect the ionization efficiency, while β and d2 affect the collection efficiency. Results of a test performed on a variety of molecules to determine optimal α and d1 values show that there are two sets of molecules: high molecular weight (proteins, peptides, oligosaccharide etc.) and low molecular weight (diazo dye, stereoids, caffeine, nitroaromatics etc.). The optimal conditions for the high molecular weight group are high incident angles (70-90°) and short d1 distances (1–3 mm). The optimal conditions for the low molecular weight group are the opposite, low incident angles (35-50°) and long d1 distances (7–10 mm). These test results indicate that each group of molecules has a different ionization mechanism; described in detail in the Principle of operation section. The sprayer tip and the surface holder are both attached to a 3D moving stage which allow to select specific values for the four geometric parameters: α, β, d1 and d2. Applications MALDESI of biomolecules on an ice matrix = Laser ablation electrospray ionization = Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) mass spectrometry is an ambient ionization technique applicable to plant and animal tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.  Matrix assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization  Another method good for biomolecules is Matrix assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI). In this technique, it utilizes Infrared laser ionization to excite the sample molecules to allow for the desorbed ions to be ready for MS analysis. The geometry of the source and the distance between the ESI and matrix will have and effect on the efficiency of the sample compound. This technique can also be used with aqueous samples as well. The water droplet can be placed at the focal point of the laser, or the droplet can be dried to form the solid. Planar samples do not need sample preparation to perform this experiment. = Ion mobility mass spectrometry = Schematic of DESI-IMS-TOF mass spectrometer Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is a technique of ion separation in gaseous phases based on their differences in ion mobility when an electric field is applied providing spatial separation prior to MS analysis. With the introduction of DESI as an ion source for ion mobility mass spectrometry, applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also intact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization. A key characteristic of this setup is its ability to separate the distribution of ions generated in DESI prior to mass spectrometry analysis. = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance = As stated before, DESI allows for a direct investigation of natural samples without needing any sample preparation or chromatographic separation. But, because of this unneeded sample prep the spectrum created maybe very complex. Therefore, you can couple a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance to DESI, allowing for a higher resolution. The DESI can be composed of six linear moving stages and one rotating stage. This can include a 3-D linear stage for samples and another with the rotating stage for the spray mount. Coupling of an FTICR to DESI can increase mass accuracy to below 3 parts per million. This can be done on both liquid and solid samples. = Liquid chromatography = Liquid chromatography coupled to DESI-MS. AE is auxiliary electrode, RE: reference electrode, WE: working electrode.DESI can be coupled to ultra-fast liquid chromatography using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It is a strategy through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling can be used to ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that it can be used to directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis. Instrumentation In DESI, there is a high-velocity pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample where it can be desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5 cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300 °C with newer stages having built in CCD's and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.

The Hawcon combined parts from both the Hawk and Falcon and powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. Operational history The aircraft, serial number K5925, was used for thick- wing research by the Royal Aircraft Establishment. It had four interchangeable wings of different thickness. The aim was to investigate the performance penalties of thicker wings, which had structural advantages (lower weight for the same strength) and provided space for fuel etc. The four wings, labelled A to D had root thickness to chord ratios of 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30. The trials showed that the thickness had little effect on maximum speed: wing B was faster than A by 5 m.p.h. (less than 3%) and the other wings fell between. The maximum speed given below is for the D wing, as are the dimensions and weights.Lukins & Russell p.36-7 For comparison, modern low Mach number aircraft have root thickness to chord ratios of 0.14 - 0.20.Fielding p.21 Operators ; *Royal Aircraft Establishment Specifications (M.6) See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Amos, Peter. and Brown, Don Lambert.

His initial career was in organic chemistry but he moved into inorganic chemistry with particular emphasis on gold. His research interests ranged from fish oil through coal liquefaction to X-ray diffraction.  Early life and education  Rapson was one of seven children raised on a small farm in Kaihu, New Zealand. He attended Mount Albert Grammar School where he was a Rawlings Scholar and later Senior National Scholar. He then went on to Auckland University College as a Junior University Scholar, Senior University Scholar, Duffus Lubecki Scholar and lastly Sir George Grey Scholar. He attained his master's degree at the age of 20 and in 1933 he became lecturer in chemistry at the University College. In 1934 he went to Oxford to study organic chemistry with Robert Robinson. He developed the Rapson-Robinson synthesis, while completing his thesis in 1935 at the age of 23. He was then appointed lecturer in organic chemistry at the University of Cape Town (1935–41). Research In 1946 he became Professor designate of Chemistry after having been a Senior Lecturer. He did pioneering work on fruit and fish resource of the Western Cape region which became the foundation for South Africa's fish oil industry. He also researched coal liquefaction and collaborated with physicists at the University of Cape Town on the development of X-ray diffraction. Aerial view of mine tailings dumps He was the first director of the National Chemical Research Laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria. His research areas included South African water and mineral resources. In particular, deacidification and desalination methods for waste dumps and rivers. He identified a type of grass that would grow in the acidic sand of gold mine tailings dumps around Johannesburg to assist with preventing the sand from polluting the nearby rivers. In 1958 he was promoted to Vice-President of CSIR. He was then appointed Research Advisor to the Transvaal and Orange Free State Chamber of Mines, with the aim of improving production and reducing waste. His research, in collaboration with T. Groenewald was published in the journals Gold Bulletin and Gold Technology. In 1978 Rapson and Groenewald co- authored the book Gold Usage, the first textbook on gold to be published since Die Edelmetalle und Ihre Legierungen by E. Raub (1940). Rapson later went on to translate Die Edelmetalle und Ihre Legierungen into English but that version was only published after his death.
