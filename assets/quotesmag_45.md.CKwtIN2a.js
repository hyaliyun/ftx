Lying is the most common position while being immobilized (e.g. in bedrest), while sleeping, or while being struck by injury or disease.  Positions  Supine and prone decubitus. Recovery position. When lying, the body may assume a great variety of shapes and positions. The following are the basic recognized ones. * Supine: lying on the back on the ground with the face up. * Prone: lying on the chest with the face down (\\"lying down\\" or \\"going prone\\"). See also \\"Prostration\\". * Lying on either side, with the body straight or bent/curled forward or backward. ** The fetal position is lying or sitting curled, with limbs close to the torso and the head close to the knees. ** The recovery position (coma position), one of a series of variations on a lateral recumbent or three-quarters prone position of the body, into which an unconscious but breathing casualty can be placed as part of first aid treatment. When medical professionals use this term to describe the position of a patient, they first state the part of the body on which the patient is resting followed by the word decubitus. For example, the right lateral decubitus position (RLDP) would mean that the patient is lying on his or her right side. Left lateral decubitus position (LLDP) would mean that the patient is lying on his or her left side. Another example is angina decubitus 'chest pain while lying down'.Quia Directional Terms and Body Positions In radiology, this term implies that the patient is lying down with the X-ray being taken parallel to the horizon.Indiana University powerpoint presentation on positioning terms  As a treatment  Bedrest as a medical treatment refers to staying in bed day and night as a treatment for an illness or medical condition, especially when prescribed or chosen rather than resulting from severe prostration or imminent death.

It was not developed by BT but was a rebadged Logica VTS-2300 Kennet, and a completely different machine from the Merlin Tonto which was a rebadged ICL OPD. Merlin M4000 was designed as a general purpose computer but was not IBM PC compatible, and so could not run the major business applications around at the time as these were tied to the IBM PC hardware. Hardware Merlin M4000 computers were packaged inside a substantial and heavy steel desktop case weighing approximately 12 kg. Inside the case was the main board, power supply, floppy and hard drives, and expansion cards. The design was reasonably modular as the case and main board were able to accommodate expansion cards and additional memory. A separate keyboard with 114 keys connected to the main unit using a reversed British telephone plug with the clip on the left hand side. Most monitors were amber monochrome but later colour screens were sold. An 8086 CPU was used. The maximum RAM was 768 KB, made up of 256 KB on the main board plus two additional 256 KB RAM cards. A security socket was located on the rear of the main unit although it is unclear how it was used in practice. Networking was accomplished using ARCNET or Cambridge Ring (computer network) LAN cards. An RS-232 optical fibre modem was also available. The M4204T and M4213T computers were TEMPEST certifiedBT Brochure - TEMPEST, System Solutions from British Telecom to BTR/01/202(4). Storage media The M4204T had two internal 720 kB 5¬º-inch floppy drives and the M4213T had one internal 720 kB 5¬º-inch floppy drive and one internal hard drive with a capacity of either 10 MB or 20 MB. An external 76 MB hard drive and/or a 150 MB Tandberg QIC tape drive could also be connected to the M4000. Software The CP/M-86 and Concurrent DOS (CDOS) operating systems were developed for Merlin M4000 computers. PC DOS and MS-DOS applications could not be run directly, but it was practical for vendors to cross-port their applications, if there was sufficient demand. Wordstar was available and Prospero Pascal was a popular development platform. Most Merlin M4000 computers were used to run bespoke software rather than off the shelf applications software. A few applications software packages were commercially available including: * Lex9b word processor. * MerlinWord word processor. * A rather neat telephone directory / database program that was mainly used by switchboard operators. * Software development tools including an 8086 assembler and COBOL compiler. * An Asteroids game - initially as a demonstration of the bitmapped graphics. Usage Merlin M4000 computers were commonplace in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, although most were sold to the public sector as large contracts as opposed to the private sector. Major customers included the Royal Navy as part of the OASIS II project, and the Department of Health and Social Security. Merlin M4000 computers were installed in DSS offices across the country where they were used for Case Paper location (tracking files as they moved from one room to another) and calculating benefits.Hansard, 5 December 1988 Some M4000 computers were used by the Forestry Commission in their offices, and internally by BT although it is not clear if they were ever used in conjunction with System X telephone exchanges. Many theatres in the UK used Merlin M4000 computers running the RITA booking software that was written either by or in conjunction with the Royal Shakespeare Company.

He was the eldest brother of electrical engineer and computer scientist Hisashi Kobayashi. His research interests were in Riemannian and complex manifolds, transformation groups of geometric structures, and Lie algebras. Biography Kobayashi graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1953. In 1956, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of Washington under Carl B. Allendoerfer. His dissertation was Theory of Connections. He then spent two years at the Institute for Advanced Study and two years at MIT. He joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 as an assistant professor, was awarded tenure the following year, and was promoted to full professor in 1966. Kobayashi served as chairman of the Berkeley Mathematics Dept. for a three-year term from 1978 to 1981 and for the 1992 Fall semester. He chose early retirement under the VERIP plan in 1994. The two-volume book Foundations of differential geometry (1963-1969), which he coauthored with Katsumi Nomizu, has been known for its wide influence. Technical contributions As a consequence of the Gauss-Codazzi equations and the commutation formulas for covariant derivatives, James Simons discovered a formula for the Laplacian of the second fundamental form of a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold.James Simons. Minimal varieties in riemannian manifolds. Ann. of Math. (2) 88 (1968), 62‚Äì105. As a consequence, one can find a formula for the Laplacian of the norm-squared of the second fundamental form. This \\"Simons formula\\" simplifies significantly when the mean curvature of the submanifold is zero and when the Riemannian manifold has constant curvature. In this setting, Shiing-Shen Chern, Manfredo do Carmo, and Kobayashi studied the algebraic structure of the zeroth order terms, showing that they are nonnegative provided that the norm of the second fundamental form is sufficiently small. As a consequence, the case in which the norm of the second fundamental form is constantly equal to the threshold value can be completely analyzed, the key being that all of the matrix inequalities used in controlling the zeroth order terms become equalities. As such, in this setting the second fundamental form is uniquely determined. As submanifolds of space forms are locally characterized by their first and second fundamental forms, this results in a complete characterization of minimal submanifolds of the round sphere whose second fundamental form is constant and equal to the threshold value. Chern, do Carmo, and Kobayashi's result was later improved by An-Min Li and Jimin Li, making use of the same methods.Li An-Min and Li Jimin. An intrinsic rigidity theorem for minimal submanifolds in a sphere. Arch. Math. (Basel) 58 (1992), no. 6, 582‚Äì594. In 1973, Kobayashi and Takushiro Ochiai proved some rigidity theorems for K√§hler manifolds. In particular, if is a closed K√§hler manifold and there exists in such that :c_1(M)\\\\geq(n+1)\\\\alpha, then must be biholomorphic to complex projective space. This forms the final part of Yum-Tong Siu and Shing-Tung Yau's proof of the Frankel conjecture.Yum Tong Siu and Shing Tung Yau. Compact K√§hler manifolds of positive bisectional curvature. Invent. Math. 59 (1980), no. 2, 189‚Äì204. Kobayashi and Ochiai also characterized the situation of as being biholomorphic to a quadratic hypersurface of complex projective space.

The taxonomy of the group has seen numerous changes; it was formerly often treated as a suborder of the order Lecanorales. It currently contains two suborders, seven families and about 45 genera such as Lobaria and Peltigera. The fungi form lichens in a symbiotic relationship with one or two photosynthetic partners which may be a cyanobacterium such as Nostoc or a green alga such as Coccomyxa. The majority of species contain just a cyanobacterium, a smaller number have both a cyanobacterium and a green alga while only a few species have just a green alga. The thallus of the lichen may be foliose (leafy), subfruticose (somewhat shrubby) or granular-squamulose (scaly). The thallus attaches to a surface by means of small root-like rhizines. In some species, the thallus may vary in appearance depending on whether it contains a cyanobacterium or a green alga. Sometimes these different morphs of a single fungus were formerly thought to be separate species. The lichens occur worldwide, growing on bark, moss, soil or rocks in humid woodland. The greatest diversity occurs in the Northern Hemisphere although the family Lobariaceae is most diverse in the Southern Hemisphere. Members of the suborder Peltigerineae produce a wide range of secondary compounds, some of which are useful to humans in medicine and dyeing. Former uses include using Peltigera canina (dog lichen) as a remedy for the bite of a mad dog and Lobaria pulmonaria (tree lungwort) as a remedy for lung diseases because of its supposed resemblance to lung tissue.

It marked the start of the First Punic War. In that period, and after the recent successes in southern Italy, Sicily became of increasing strategic importance to Rome. Background The Greek historian Polybius states in Book One of The Histories: \\"Even after long consideration, the (Roman) Senate did not approve the proposal to send help to Messana; they took the view that any advantage which would result from relieving the place would be counterbalanced by the inconsistency of such an action. However, the people who had suffered grievously from the wars that had just ended and were in dire need of rehabilitation of every kind, were inclined to listen to the consuls. These men, besides stressing the national advantages I have already mentioned which Rome could secure if she intervened, also dwelt on the great gains which would clearly accrue to every individual citizen from the spoils of war, and so a resolution for sending help was carried. When his decree had been passed by the people, one of the consuls, Appius Claudius, was appointed to command an expedition, and was given orders to cross to Messana.\\"Historical Background Messana I - 264 BC Romans vs Syracusans.

The battle resulted as the U.S. Third Army pushed northeast from the region of Frankfurt and Mainz. The battle opened on April 1, 1945 and ended with an American victory three days later. Opposing the Third Army's 80th Infantry Division were an infantry replacement battalion, some heavy tanks, and anti-aircraft guns.The complete German order of battle at Kassel is unclear from available documentation. The Faribault Monograph mentions the presence of the 166th and 365th Infantry Divisions around the city, and the number of German POW's taken was far larger than a single infantry battalion supported by tanks and AA-guns. In 1945, Kassel was also headquarters for the German 409th Division, an element of the army that specialized in training replacements. The 409th Division was mobilized as a Kampfgruppe in late March 1945, but it is not clear if it took part in the Battle of Kassel. Although the Germans gave battle at Kassel, their army was on the brink of collapse as the Western Allies and the Red Army made deep inroads into Germany. The defense of Kassel did not materially impede the Allied advance, and, one month after the battle ended, Germany was forced to capitulate.  Background  After the Ardennes Offensive, the U.S. Third Army had pushed east and southeast into Germany, capturing Pruem and Trier. This advance brought General Patton's troops to the Rhine River, which they crossed at Oppenheim, near Mainz, on March 22, 1945. While the U.S. First Army was marching on Paderborn, the Third Army moved on a roughly parallel course further to the east to cover the First Army's right flankWeigley, p. 696. and prevent any German attempt to relieve their troops trapped in the Ruhr Pocket. Moving east from its bridgehead across the Rhine, the Third Army's XII Corps fought through scattered German opposition and reached Frankfurt on March 26. After Frankfurt, Kassel was the largest city in Hessen, having had a population of 200,000 in 1939.Faribault Monograph, p. 1. Another corps of the Third Army, the XX, was directed to capture it. By March 30, elements of the Third Army were nearing Kassel, having moved some in eight days. Much of Kassel's center lay in ruins as the city had been bombed 40 times by the Allied air forces. Among the bombing targets in the city was the Henschel factory complex, which produced Tiger II tanks. As the Americans approached, the Henschel Works finished work on thirteen Tiger II tanks, which were taken over by two companies of the German 510th and 511th Heavy Tank Battalions. Deployed on a military training ground south of the city was a battery of 88 mm anti- aircraft guns manned by Reichsarbeitdienst (RAD) members, a paramilitary labor service of the Nazi Party. Besides the tanks and AA-guns, the Germans had several hundred men of the 15th Armored Infantry Replacement and Training Battalion with which to defend the city. The German high command had designated Kassel a Festung (fortress) with dire orders to \\"resist to the last round\\". In the event, however, the designation of the city as Festung had little impact on the outcome of the battle. In command of the city's defense was Generalmajor Johannes Erxleben,Johannes Erxleben (1893-1972), German communications officer in both World Wars before being appointed the Wehrmacht commander of Kassel on August 1, 1944. Information on Erxleben's career can be found in printed form (Wolf Keilig's Das Deutsche Heer, Part 211 p. 77, Bad Nauheim, Podzun Verlag, 1957) and online at Erxleben's biography. a communications officer with little battle experience.Saft, p. 122.  Battle  On March 30, 1945, seven German Tiger II tanks rolled south, heading for Fritzlar. northeast of Fritzlar, the Tigers fought a meeting engagement with an armored spearhead of the U.S. Third Army, resulting in damage or destruction to six U.S. tank destroyers. The German tanks, however, were forced to retreat when their unit was subjected to heavy artillery fire.Saft, p. 123. On April 1, leading elements of Major General Horace L. McBride'sHorace Logan McBride, U.S. artillery officer in both World Wars, commanded the 80th Infantry Division from May 1942 until September 1945. See McBride obituary for details of his career. U.S. 80th Infantry Division approached Kassel from the south, but were forced to halt by fire from the RAD anti-aircraft battery positioned on the D√∂nche training ground (), a relatively flat area that allowed the 88mm guns to engage in long range fire. On April 2, the Americans again responded with heavy artillery fire, destroying the RAD AA battery. The U.S. 318th Infantry Regiment moved a battalion into the wooded high ground (Habichtswald) west of Kassel, while the U.S. 319th Infantry Regiment crossed the Fulda River and moved north along its east bank. The 80th Division's third regiment, the 317th Infantry, was in divisional reserve. By the end of the day, western and southern suburbs of Kassel had been occupied by the Americans. In the south, German infantry of the 15th Battalion mounted 15 half-tracks and, supported by about 12 tanks, moved south and surprised elements of the 1st Battalion, 318th Infantry. The subsequent exchange of fire saw six U.S. tank destroyers knocked out and one Tiger II damaged. The German infantry was separated from their tanks by enfilading fire from U.S. troops who had pulled back from the road. The German tanks continued south until they were struck by an American 155-mm artillery barrage that destroyed two tanks with direct hits. A second and similar German assault was less successful and also repelled by artillery fire. Having reorganized, 80th Division troops, with the support of M16 half-tracks that mounted four heavy machine guns, closed on the German Kaserne from which the attack the previous day had originated. M16's of the 633rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery (Heavy Weapons) Battalion subjected the German base and its defenders to blistering fire and forced the capitulation of the base's garrison. The U.S. 318th Infantry's advance north into Kassel was blocked by a 15-meter high railway embankment under which a street ran. The underpass was blocked by a German self-propelled gun whose fire commanded the approach to the underpass. After American attempts to take the embankment were repelled by Germans dug in on the other side, the regiment's 1st Battalion managed to cross the embankment to the northwest and approached the German positions from the flank. Early on the morning of April 3, the battalion took the surrender of some 500 German troops who believed their defensive position was compromised.Faribault Monograph, p. 18. Fighting in Kassel was house-to-house from April 2, but the German defenders were too few to defend effectively and the U.S. forces pushed into the city's center, fending off local counter- attacks by infantry and tanks. American tanks and the U.S. 319th Infantry were meanwhile approaching Kassel from the east bank of the Fulda River. The U.S. 317th Infantry was guarding the Americans' flank in the west and the U.S. 318th Infantry pushed through the city, arriving in the vicinity of the command bunker of General Erxleben at 0900 on April 4, 1945. Faced with the collapse of his defenses, Erxleben dispatched a captain early on April 4 to discuss surrender terms with the Americans. The American reply was that the Germans had to cease resistance with no cease-fire to evacuate wounded or civilians, or that the fighting would continue. Around 1100 on April 4, U.S. tanks crossed the Fulda River from the east and moved toward the center of Kassel. At 1200, General Erxleben capitulated and was taken prisoner along with 1,325 others, effectively ending the Battle of Kassel.Saft, p. 130.

Shah Jahan in his turn chose this site to erect the multi-storied marble tower inlaid with precious stones for Mumtaz Mahal. It was built between 1631‚Äì40 and offers exotic views of the famous Taj Mahal. Architecture The Musamman Burj is made of delicate marble lattices with ornamental niches so that the ladies of the court could gaze out unseen. The decoration of the walls is pietra dura. The chamber has a marble dome on top and is surrounded by a verandah with a beautiful carved fountain in the center. The tower looks out over the River Yamuna and is traditionally considered to have one of the most poignant views of the Taj Mahal.

He was the son of a ship manager Johan Christian T√∏nsberg (1788-1830) and Anne Marie Dahl (1788-1837). From the age of 14 he was employed at the office of town clerk and justice secretary and worked as a secretary for several municipal commissions. In September 1834 he was assistant at the Recorder of Bergen. He enrolled in law studies at the University of Christiania graduating with the cand.jur. degree in 1845.

T√∏nsberg also served as consul for several countries: Kingdom of Bavaria, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg, Colombia, Liberia and Romania. Additionally he managed estates, auction and estate sales. When the publishing company of Guldberg & Dzwonkowski was dissolved in 1844, T√∏nsberg assumed a large part of the publisher's legal literature. T√∏nsberg had met Henrik Wergeland in Bergen in 1832 and later became one of the writer's best friends and his main support. He arranged to published Hasseln√∏dder in 1845. At the time of Wergeland's death the following year, he was asked to manage his estate and take care of the widow. He also published works of Andreas Munch, Mauritz Hansen, Magnus Brostrup Landstad, Rudolf Keyser, Nicolay Nicolaysen and Ludvig Daae among others. He was among the founders of the Norwegian Booksellers Association in 1851. T√∏nsberg became strongly influenced by the National Romantic period and was eager to establish a co-operation between the different art forms. The illustrations were drawn by some of the most famous of Norwegian artists including Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen among others. T√∏nsberg continued publishing similar books over the next years. He gathered and published the material in Norge fremstillet i Tegninger with Asbj√∏rnsen in 1848.

Background  In June 2008, after the LRA had attacked and killed 23 people in Southern Sudan, including 14 soldiers, a Ugandan military spokesman said Uganda, DR Congo and Sudan would launch a joint offensive against the LRA if its leader, Joseph Kony, failed to commit to the Juba peace talks. Concurrently, the Southern Sudanese Information Minister, Gabriel Changson, declared that \\"The LRA have started war\\", and that \\"Southern Sudan will not be the place where they can wage this war\\". The same month, diplomats reported that the LRA had acquired new weapons and was forcibly recruiting new soldiers, adding 1,000 recruits to the 600 soldiers it already had. An onslaught against the LRA by Ugandan forces in northern Uganda and across the border in Southern Sudan, led the rebels to relocate to the densely forested Garamba National Park in DR Congo - and when they attacked and killed civilians there, the Congolese government vowed to destroy the LRA.  The operation  In November 2008, the US President George W. Bush personally signed the directive to the United States Africa Command to provide assistance financially and logistically to the Ugandan government during the offensive. The United States military helped in the planning stages of the operation, and also provided financial and technical support in the form of satellite phones and fuel. On 14 December 2008, a statement announcing the operation was released in the Ugandan capital Kampala by the intelligence chiefs of the armed forces of the three countries: the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). \\"The three armed forces successfully attacked the main body and destroyed the main camp of Joseph Kony, code-named Camp Swahili, setting it on fire,\\" the statement said. The Ugandan government stated on 21 December 2008, that 70% of the LRA's camps had been destroyed so far.

However, other reports indicated that the LRA had split up into smaller units and, in reprisals against the offensive, the LRA attacked civilians they suspected of supporting the operation, raping, mutilating and killing villagers.Haken, Nate and Taft, Patricia (26 October 2011) Obama must learn from past mistakes in fight against Uganda's LRA Christian Science Monitor, Retrieved 24 April 2014  Ugandan withdrawal  On 15 March 2009, Uganda abruptly ended its participation in the offensive and began withdrawing its troops from Garamba. The withdrawal, according to Lt. Gen. Ivan Koreta, the Deputy Chief of Defence Forces, was due to an agreement signed with DR Congo. During a handover ceremony in Garamba, the DR Congo Chief of General Staff, Gen. Didier Etumba Longila, said Congo would continue hunting the LRA until they were neutralised although one source described the Congolese army units allocated to the task as poorly trained and underpaid soldiers who often preyed on the villagers they were meant to be protecting.

Biography Hanan Spitzer (later Porat) was born in Kfar Pines during the Mandate era. In 1944, his family moved to Kfar Etzion. In early 1948, during the Arab riots of 1948, Kfar Etzion was besieged, and the children were evacuated to Jerusalem.

It was commissioned as part of the President's Council on Physical Fitness. History \\"Chicken Fat\\" was the theme song for President John F. Kennedy's youth fitness program, and millions of 7-inch 33 RPM discs which were pressed for free by Capitol Records were heard in elementary, junior high school and high school gymnasiums across the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Willson contacted Fitness Council administrator Dick Snider with an offer to write a song to be used to promote exercise for children. Willson's offer was accepted and he consulted with Physical Fitness Council director Ted Forbes to ensure that the song would be effective. The bouncy chorus ended with the words \\"Go, you chicken fat, go!\\" The song was originally recorded on a Warner Bros. Pictures soundstage in early 1962 at the same time as the recordings for the film soundtrack of the Warner Bros. film The Music Man, starring Robert Preston. Recorded on the same three-track 35MM magnetic film as the soundtrack recordings, it features Preston's vocal isolated on one track, with the Bernie Green Orchestra isolated on the second track and a chorus of boys and girls isolated on the third track. However, the location of the original multi-track tapes is unknown. As a result, with only the full-track quarter-inch 15 IPS monophonic composite master being available from which Capitol mastered their records in 1962, no stereophonic version of the song is currently possible and it remains in monophonic sound on the CD re-issue. Versions Two versions of the song exist: a 2:12 minute, radio-friendly length, ‚ÄúDisc Jockey Version\\"; and a longer, 6:30 ‚ÄúSchool Version‚Äù, for use in educational institution gymnasiums. The latter included 11 floor exercises for school children designed by Bud Wilkinson, the head coach of the University of Oklahoma football team. Willson, Preston, and Forbes all donated their services to the project , while Capitol Records, which produced and distributed three million copies of the 33 1/3 RPM record, paid for the backup musicians, studio time, and production and distribution. The original Physical Fitness Council was promoted in 1962 and 1963 through a series of public service TV commercials featuring baseball great Stan Musial, filmed at Roosevelt Elementary School in Tampa, Florida. In popular culture In 2014, \\"Chicken Fat\\" was used in a TV commercial by Apple Inc. to promote its new iOS 8 health application. The commercial shows people swimming, running, and checking their weight while connected to iPhone apps and accessories to a recording of \\"Chicken Fat\\". It was reported to be a 2000 recording by Bernie Knee, a jingle writer and part-time cantor, which was released by Kimbo Educational Music, though he died in 1994. Separately, it was reported that it was a new recording but that Apple would not name the singer. \\"We're Going to the Catskills!\\" (2018 Season 2, Episode 4) of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel used \\"Chicken Fat\\" as the morning calisthenics song for Abe (Tony Shalhoub), despite the anachronism (the episode takes place in 1959).

Commission Design for tapestry The Adoration of the Magi, 1887 Cartoon for the Adoration tapestry, 1888 The original tapestry was commissioned in 1886 by John Prideaux Lightfoot, rector of Exeter College, Oxford, for the Gothic revival chapel built for the college in the 1850s by George Gilbert Scott.Pevsner and Sherwood,pp. 136-7. Lightfoot approached William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, both former students at Exeter, and suggested the subject matter for the tapestry, to which Morris agreed readily in a letter to Lightfoot dated 4 September 1886.Wildman, pp. 293-294Parry 1996, pp. 292-293 The overall composition and the figures were designed by Edward Burne-Jones, who completed a 26 √ó 38 inch modello or design in watercolour and bodycolour heightened with gold in 1887. Large-scale cartoons for the tapestry weavers were created from photographically enlarged panels of Burne-Jones's watercolour. In a letter of 7 September 1886, Morris had suggested that the tapestry's colouration should be \\"both harmonious and powerful, so that it would not be overpowered\\" by the chapel's brilliantly coloured stained glass.Parry, 1996, p. 293 Morris and his assistant John Henry Dearle chose a vibrant colour scheme and added background and foreground details including the flowering plants characteristic of Dearle's tapestry work. All in all, the tapestry took four years to realise, including two years' work by three weavers at Morris's Merton Abbey Mills. The tapestry was completed in February 1890 and displayed in Morris & Co.'s Oxford Street showroom in London that Easter before being presented to Exeter College. Lightfoot did not live to see the finished tapestry; he died at the Rectory at Exeter College on 23 March 1887.

See also The Art Tribune The Star of Bethlehem In 1887, Burne-Jones revisited his tapestry design as a full-scale painting titled The Star of Bethlehem. The colour palette with its rich blue-greens differs greatly from both the original watercolour modello and the Morris tapestry, and its large size allowed him to add a wealth of fine detail not possible in the tapestry version, especially in the clothing. The Star of Bethlehem was completed in 1890 and exhibited at the New Gallery, London, in the spring of 1891 before being sent on to the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, where it remains.

Roxas High School is a secondary (high) school located in Paco, Manila. It is one of the six schools in Manila to provide the Special Science course for selected students. The first building of Roxas High School was situated in Quezon Boulevard near Feati University. It was established in 1948 and is the first high school to be named after a former president, Manuel Acuna Roxas.  Special Science  The establishment of the Special Science curriculum was spearheaded by the Department of Science and Technology- Science Education Institute in the 1980s. For the moment, support form DOST has been withdrawn and Special Science classes are maintained by the Division of City Schools in the implementing schools namely Manuel A. Roxas High School, Ramon Magsaysay High School, Victorino Mapa High School, Cayetano Arellano High School and Manuel Araullo High School, with the exception of Manila Science High School which is a recognized science high school. To be eligible for the Special Science sections, applicants must have final elementary grades no lower than 85 in Science, Math and English and 83 in other subjects. They are subjected to examination which includes knowledge of Sciences and use of Abstract Reasoning. They are provided with elective subjects to fulfill the aim of the program; that is to give the students good grounding in Science, as well as in other subject areas. There are three Special Science sections in Roxas per year level. The student body is headed by the Supreme Student Government with officers elected yearly.  Facilities  The School has seven buildings - the Main (L-Shaped), Vocational, Maceda, Hizon, Home Economics, SEDP and Administration buildings and three makeshift structures, two of which are temporary. The Main, Vocational, Macaeda and Hizon buildings house the academic subject classes. The H.E. building is now used by the Science and Technology Department. The SEDP building is where H.E. classes are held. One of the two Guidance offices, the Museum, and EMIS office occupy the Administration, Marcos-type, building. As of June 2006, the Main building, which is the most used, was declared \\"condemned\\" and unfit for use. This was explained by the impact of the 1990 earthquake that hit Manila. After the declaration, the school was forced to squeeze schedules and rooms. This called for 13 makeshift rooms. On February 22, 2008 President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo led the groundbreaking for the PHP 220 million 4-storey building to replace the old structure. Also present in the event were Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim, Manila 6th District Rep. Benny Abante and 5th District Rep. Amado Bagatsing and Education Secretary Jesli Lapus.

Population: Geography Nartan is situated in the Kabardian Valley of the foothills of surrounding Greater Caucasus mountains located further south. The outskirt of the area, known locally as Upper Nartan, joins the urban sprawl of eastern Nalchik. History Until 1924, the village was called Klishbiyevo () after the noble family that owned it. Most of the members of the Klishbiy family were forced to immigrate to today's Turkey in 1860s. And they founded a village in Kayseri, a mid-Anatolian city, with the same name. The village was named Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Mehmet, who was head of the family. Demographics The majority of the population are ethnic Kabardians. There is, however, also a number of Turkish and Russian inhabitants. Economy Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, locals were mainly occupied in rural economy. The Nartan collective farm had sufficient land holdings and a material and technical basis for a farming economy. The main crops grown are cereals, such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sunflower. In addition, fruits, such as apples and pears, and vegetables were grown, and livestock such as cattle was maintained. As a collective farm, households had individual plots of lands attached for growing for personal consumption and occasionally for market. Some households in Nartan continue to maintain the original personal use lands as gardens. Community and consumer facilities include the local government building, a village club house, a supermarket, three schools, including two secondary and one elementary school, an outpatient clinic (now a village hospital), and a kindergarten. There is also a boarding school for the orphans. At present, the population of the village‚Äîmainly females‚Äîis self-employed working on the lands attached to their residences. The unemployment rate is very high for both qualified and unqualified labor. The leaseholders of the former collective farm properties as the employers are not able to provide the population with suitable work. In the end, the people leave for earnings and for good to Central Russia or foreign countries.

He was succeeded on February 3, 1836, by John Brown, who was born near Brownsville, December 20, 1790, served as a soldier in the War of 1812 and saw action at the Battle of North Point. After the war, in 1824, he built the first homestead in what is now Brownsville, of timbers pre-cut in Hagerstown, and brought to the site by wagon, using hand-made bricks to fill in between the timber framing, and covered by weatherboard cut by hand from South Mountain trees.Forster, R.

John Brown served as postmaster until 1863, when he was succeeded by his son, Cornelius, who (with a break in 1886-89) served until February 1894.U.S. National Postal Archives. Cornelius is listed in the 1880 United States Census as a farmer and tanner. Cornelius's son, George T. Brown, was appointed to the post in February 1898 and held it for over 40 years. St. Luke's Episcopal Church Two churches were founded in Brownsville. The Church of the Brethren was founded by Rudolph Brown in the years following the close of the Revolutionary War. A meetinghouse was erected in the village in 1852 and served the congregation until the building of their present church along MD 67 in 1960. Two additional congregations were founded from the Brownsville Church: West Brownsville at Yarrowsburg (1907-60) and South Brownsville at Garretts Mill (1914-60). Both of these congregations were re-joined to the Brownsville Church in 1960. St. Luke's Episcopal Church was organized August 21, 1837 as a chapel within St. Mark's Parish. The brick church was erected in 1839 and continues to serve the congregation today. During the Civil War, the church was used as a field hospital following the Battle of Antietam. Afterwards, it was burned by the Union Army to prevent Confederates from using the structure given its proximity to the border line at the Potomac River. The church was restored in 1869.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=534558 on 2015-02-01 grass octopus or grass scuttle, is a species of octopus found in shallow areas of the Mediterranean Sea, the warmer parts of the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Indo-Pacific region. This octopus feeds on small organisms which lurk among the branches of corals. Description Callistoctopus macropus grows to a mantle length of with a total length of . The first pair of arms are a metre or so long, and are much longer than the remaining three pairs. The arms are all connected by a shallow web. This octopus is red, with white blotches on its body, and paired white spots on its arms. When it is disturbed, its colour becomes more intense, deimatic behaviour which may make it appear threatening to a potential predator. Distribution and habitat Populations of Callistoctopus macropus form a species complex found in the Mediterranean Sea, the temperate and tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It is also present in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It lives near the shore at depths down to about . Its favoured habitat is sand, rubble or seagrass meadows, and it sometimes buries itself under the sand. Ecology Callistoctopus macropus Callistoctopus macropus is more fastidious in its diet than is the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), a species with which it shares some of its range and which feeds by day. Callistoctopus macropus, by contrast, feeds by night. Its method of feeding is to move from one clump of branching coral to another, often Acropora or Stylophora spp.. The octopus wraps its mantle around a coral head and probes with its arms among the branches, searching for the small fish and invertebrates that seek protection there. It has been found that a number of groupers (family Serranidae) and other predatory fish associate with the octopus when it is feeding, pouncing on small organisms that are flushed from the coral head by the octopus. For many years, the breeding habits of this octopus were not known. Then a female was observed attaching short-stalked eggs, measuring , to a hard surface forming a sheet of eggs. The female then brooded the eggs, caring for them by aerating them and keeping them clean. The female octopus stopped feeding at the time the eggs were laid and died soon after they had hatched, as is common among octopus species. The planktonic larvae which emerged from the eggs were each about in length with short, seven-suckered arms. They fed on zooplankton such as crustacean larvae.

It applies to children between the age of nine and 18 months. Broadly speaking, the attachment styles were (1) secure and (2) insecure (ambivalent and avoidance). Later, Mary Main and her husband Erik Hesse introduced the 3rd category, disorganized. The procedure played an important role in the development of Attachment theory. Structured observation In this procedure of the Strange Situation the child is observed playing for 21 minutes while caregivers and strangers enter and leave the room, recreating the flow of the familiar and unfamiliar presence in most children's lives. The situation varies in stressfulness and the child's responses are observed. The child experiences the following situations: * Parent and infant are introduced to the experimental room. * Parent and infant are alone. Parent does not participate while infant explores. * Stranger enters, converses with parent, then approaches infant. Parent leaves conspicuously. * First separation episode: Stranger's behavior is geared to that of infant. * First reunion episode: Parent greets and comforts infant, then leaves again. * Second separation episode: Infant is alone. * Continuation of second separation episode: Stranger enters and gears behavior to that of infant. * Second reunion episode: Parent enters, greets infant, and picks up infant; stranger leaves conspicuously. Four aspects of the child's behavior are observed: * The amount of exploration (e.g. playing with new toys) the child engages in throughout. * The child's reactions to the departure of its caregiver. * The stranger anxiety (when the baby is alone with the stranger). * The child's reunion behavior with its caregiver. On the basis of their behaviors, the children were categorized into three groups, with a fourth added later. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. Four patterns of attachment =1. Secure (B)= A child who is securely attached to its parent will explore and play freely while the caregiver is present, using her as a \\"secure base\\" from which to explore. The child will engage with the stranger when the caregiver is present, and may be visibly upset when the caregiver departs but happy to see the caregiver on his or her return. The child feels confident that the caregiver is available, and will be responsive to their attachment needs and communications. Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the mother's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style for learning and making use of resources in a non-threatening environment. According to attachment researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the mother is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. Others have pointed out that there are also other determinants of the child's attachment, and that behavior of the parent may in turn be influenced by the child's behavior. =2. Anxious- avoidant, insecure (A)= A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment pattern will avoid or ignore the caregiver, showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart rate of avoidant infants.Ainsworth, M. D. & Bell, S. M. (1970), Attachment, exploration, and separation: Illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation. Child Development, 41:49-67Sroufe, A. & Waters, E. (1977) Attachment as an Organizational Construct. Child Development, 48: 1184-1199 Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as \\"a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection\\" by de-emphasising attachment needs.Main, M. (1990) The ‚Äúultimate‚Äù causation of some infant attachment phenomena. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2: 640-643 Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver - avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some daycare children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.33-78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins =3. Anxious-ambivalent/resistant, insecure (C)= Children classified as Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant (C) showed distress even before separation, and were clingy and difficult to comfort on the caregiver's return.Cassidy, Jude, and Lisa J. Berlin. \\"The insecure/ambivalent pattern of attachment: Theory and research.\\" Child development 65.4 (1994): 971-991 They showed either signs of resentment in response to the absence (C1 subtype), or signs of helpless passivity (C2 subtype). Hans et al. have expressed concern that \\"ambivalent attachment remains the most poorly understood of Ainsworth's attachment types\\".Hans, S.L., Berstein, V.J., Sims, B.E. (2000) 'Change and Continuity in Ambivalent Attachment Relationships from Infancy through Adolescence' in The Organization of Attachment Relationships, ed. Patricia M. Crittenden & Angelika H. Claussen, Cambridge: CUP, pp.279 In particular, the relationship between ambivalent/resistant (C) and disorganisation (D) is still to be clarified.Mayseless, Ofra. \\"Maternal caregiving strategy‚Äîa distinction between the ambivalent and the disorganized profile.\\" Infant Mental Health Journal 19.1 (1998): 20-33 However, researchers agree that the Anxious- Ambivalent/Resistant strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.Solomon, J., George, C. & De Jong, A. (1995) Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school. Development and Psychopathology 7: 447‚Äì447Crittenden, P.(1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra & Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 145‚Äì171 =4. Disorganized/disoriented (D)= Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behavior into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed \\"tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to precede crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through.\\"Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, & Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282 Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was \\"without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress.\\"Crittenden, P.M. (1983) \\"Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment\\" Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73 Drawing on records of behaviors discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's graduate student Mary Main. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered \\"disorganised\\" as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. However, despite initial symptoms of disorganized/disoriented behaviors, Lyons-Ruth widely \\"recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior.\\"Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M. Ann Easterbrooks, Ingrid Obsuth, Kate Hennighausen & Lauriane Vulliez-Coady (2013) Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment & Human Development, 15:5-6, 562-582 There is \\"rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment\\" from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.Kochanska, Grazyna, and Sanghag Kim. \\"Early Attachment Organization With Both Parents and Future Behavior Problems: From Infancy to Middle Childhood.\\" Child Development 84.1 (2013): 283-296 Yet the Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticised by some for being too encompassing.Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow & P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp. 100-114), London: Routledge. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new \\"D\\" classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as \\"open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished\\", as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might treat too many different forms of behaviour as if they were the same thing.Ainsworth, M. (1990). \\"Epilogue\\" in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti & E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488 Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a \\"strategy of desperation\\" and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).Solomon, J. & George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganisation in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon & Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganisation (pp3-32), p.27, NY: Guilford Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that 'even disorganised attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent'.Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. & Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245 However, 'the presumption that many indices of ‚Äúdisorganisation‚Äù are aspects of organised patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganisation, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response'.Crittenden, P. (1999) \\"Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies\\" in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra & Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 159-160 Main and Hesse found that most of the mothers of these children had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequently studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings.Madigan, Sheri, et al. \\"Unresolved states of mind, anomalous parental behavior, and disorganized attachment: A review and meta-analysis of a transmission gap.\\" Attachment & human development 8.2 (2006): 89-111 For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganised attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.Solomon, J., & George, C. (2006). Intergenerational transmission of dysregulated maternal caregiving: Mothers describe their upbringing and child rearing. In O. Mayseless (Ed). Parenting representations: Theory, research, and clinical implications (pp. 265-295) Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Critique of the strange situation protocol Michael Rutter describes the procedure in the following terms: > It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov > & Estes, 1984). To begin with, it is very dependent on brief separations and > reunions having the same meaning for all children. This may be a major > constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan > (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their > mothers in ordinary circumstances.

Other researchers as well have raised concerns about the strange situation's construct validity and questioned its terminology as a \\"gold standard\\" measure of attachment. =Ecological validity and universality= With respect to the ecological validity of the Strange Situation, a meta-analysis of 2,000 infant- parent dyads, including several from studies with non-Western language and/or cultural bases found the global distribution of attachment categorizations to be A (21%), B (65%), and C (14%) This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions. However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of \\"global\\" attachment classification distributions. In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above. One study was conducted in North Germany in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in Sapporo, Japan where more resistant (C) infants were found. Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behavior as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978). In a study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens, et al., 2007. found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of amae and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure-resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of amae. =Attachment measurement= Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports [see Richters et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn et al., 1990).] The original Richter‚Äôs et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult the paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.

Biography Gilles Caron was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France, of a Scottish mother and a French father, Edouard Caron, an insurance company manager. After the divorce of his parents in 1946, Caron spent 7 years in a boarding school in Argenti√®res, Haute-Savoie. A keen horserider, Gilles Caron briefly embraced a career in horse racing, before moving to Paris where he attended the lyc√©e Jeanson de Sailly. He then moved on to study journalism at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes Internationales, still in Paris. He served his National Service in Algeria from 1959 as a paratrooper in the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (3e RPIMa). After nearly 2 years fighting a war he opposed, Caron refused to fight after the Generals' putsch, an aborted coup d'√©tat attempted by 4 former French generals in April 1961. As a result, he spent 2 months in a military prison before finishing his military service in 1962. After returning to Paris Gilles Caron married Marianne, a long-time friend. They had 2 daughters, Marjolaine (born 9 March 1963) and Cl√©mentine (born 8 December 1967). In 1964 Gilles Caron started working with Patrice Molinard, a fashion and advertisement photographer. In 1965 he joined the APIS (Agence Parisienne d'Informations Sociales) where he met Raymond Depardon, then working for Dalmas agency. It was during this period that he had his first major success as a photojournalist, with one of his photos illustrating the leading article of France Soir (February 21, 1966 issue, on the Ben Barka affair). After leaving the APIS and briefly working for a celebrity photography agency, Caron joined Depardon and the founders of the recently created Gamma agency in 1967. For the next 3 years Caron covered most of the high-profile conflicts in the world in various countries. * Israel in June 1967 during the Six-Day War. * Vietnam in November and December 1967, where he was present during the infamous battle for Hill 875 in Dak To. * Biafra in April 1968 where he returned twice (in July and November the same year), and where he met Bernard Kouchner, future co-founder of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. * France in May 1968 to cover the student upheaval in Paris. * Mexico in September 1968, when the military and armed men shot student demonstrators in Mexico City days before the opening ceremony of the Olympics. * Northern Ireland in August 1969 to cover The Troubles. * Czechoslovakia in August 1969 for the anniversary of the end of the Prague Spring the year before. In 1970 Gilles Caron went to Cambodia after king Norodom Sihanouk was deposed by Lon Nol on March 18, 1970. On April 5 Gilles Caron disappeared on Route 1, a road between Cambodia and Vietnam controlled by Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge.

St George's Square is a very long garden square in Pimlico, London which has the buildings of a church in its central area. Just short of its northern acute angle, part pedestrianised, it intersects a minor road, Lupus Street. Pimlico tube station is a short distance east. Its north-east side is in effect Belgrave Road and southern side is arterial Grosvenor Road which is lined by a small public garden in front of the River Thames. History Pimlico's development was started in 1835 by the landowner, the Marquess of Westminster, and the building was supervised by Thomas Cubitt who also designed the gardens. St George's Square was originally laid out in 1839 as two parallel streets running north-south but by 1843 had been developed into a formal square lined on two long sides and two sides of an angle in the north. It was London's first residential \\"square\\" open to the River Thames. In 1854 the first residents moved in. From the 1840s until 1874 the square had a pier, St George's Wharf, in latter decades its service expanded from watermen whose numbers were already low to steamers. Its land was since 1722 in the parish of St George Hanover Square. It and the parish were named after the patron saint of England, Saint George. In the small riverside garden, Pimlico Gardens, stands a stone statue by John Gibson of William Huskisson MP ‚Äî the first person run over and killed by a railway engine. Huskisson wears a stone Roman senatorial toga. It was designed for the Royal Exchange and moved sites in 1915. The statue was described by Sir Osbert Sitwell as \\"boredom rising from the bath\\". The Church of St Saviour (1864) stands at the north end of the square;Nicholas Pevsner remarked the similar siting of Cundy's other Westminster churches: Warwick Square and Chester Square (Pevsner, London I: the Cities of London and Westminster (The Buildings of England), 2nd ed. 1962:p 459. it was designed by Thomas Cundy the Younger, surveyor for the Grosvenor estate. Residents The square has had many notable residents. The author Bram Stoker died at number 26 in April 1912, Dorothy L. Sayers lived in an unfurnished room for three months in 1920, the author and gamesman Stephen Potter lived at number 56 in 1924 while teaching at a crammer at number 68, and William Makepeace Thackeray's eldest daughter Anne Ritchie made her home at number 109 from 1901 to 1912. Today The overall shape and Cubitt's buildings remain: four and five storey white stucco townhouses whose number has been reduced. More buildings are today on the east than west side, where a school ground occupies part. The townhouses are almost completely divided into apartments.numbers 24-52 evens have been lost.Odds 35-123 line the east side; evens 54-108 the opposite; the square's northern angle is two sides of a triangle: 2-22 evens on the west side and 1-33 line the north-east side. Demographic replies to a survey of residents in 2007 have been published by the local authority: 34% of residents aged between 30 and 45 years and that the dominant ethnic group self-identifies as White British (75%).

They were promoted into the league on 18 April 2014 after a two-year absence. They play their home games at ≈†ko- Energo Ar√©na. History =2000-12: Extraliga= In 2000 and 2001, Mlad√° Boleslav won the 2nd national hockey league, and in 2008 they won the 1st national hockey league. In that year, they joined the Extraliga, after winning a promotion-relegation play-off against HC Slovan √östeƒçt√≠ Lvi. In each of its first three seasons in the Czech Extraliga, Mlad√° Boleslav had to win a best- of-seven promotion-relegation play-off to stay in the top league, beating Slovan √östeƒçt√≠ Lvi 4-3 in the last of them. During the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the team was docked 22 points for using players not correctly registered to the club, an affair which also involved HC Plze≈à and HC Kladno. An appeal against the penalty was turned down. The club was later fined 3 million Czech crowns in a separate matter in which its administration was ruled to have deliberately withheld information concerning club debt. In September 2011, locally born Radim Vrbata of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks, bought a 33% share in the club, which he held until 2015. In April 2012 the club finished in last place and lost the subsequent promotion-relegation play-off against HC Pir√°ti Chomutov in seven games. The club was therefore relegated from the Extraliga to the 1st League. =2012-14: 1st League and promotion battles= Coach Franti≈°ek V√Ωborn√Ω, father of the team's captain David, was hired as coach for the 2012‚Äì2013 season. The club finished the league phase of that season in first place with 117 points from 52 games. For the 2012/13 a new system for promotion and relegation between the Extraliga and the 1st League was implemented, involving the two lowest-placed teams from the Extraliga and the two highest teams from the 1st League. Each team would meet each other team twice at home and twice away, each playing 12 games in total. Points would be awarded in the same way as in the regular season (3 points for a win in regulation, 2 points for a win in overtime, 1 point for an overtime loss, and 0 points for a regulation loss). Since both semi-finalists would enter the promotion/relegation play-off, the 1st League championship final was omitted. However, BK Mlad√° Boleslav, as the winning semi-finalist with the better regular season record, secured the championship trophy ahead of the other semi-finalist HC Olomouc. The other teams in the play-offs were Pir√°ti Chomutov and B√≠l√≠ Tyg≈ôi Liberec. BK Mlad√° Boleslav began the play-off with two away losses, 1-2 in Chomutov and 0-3 in Olomouc. However, they won the next 3 matches, all at home, defeating Liberec 7-3, Chomutov 4-3 after a shoot-out, and finally Olomouc 4-2. Their poor form then returned, losing to Chomutov 1-2 and Liberec 1-4 before their only away victory of the play-offs, 3-1 in Olomouc. The team then won their next 3 home games, over Liberec (7-0), Chomutov (5-0), and Olomouc (2-1). At this point Mlad√° Boleslav, Chomutov and Liberec were equal on 20 points each with one game remaining. Mlad√° Boleslav lost 0-2 to Liberec in the final game. After this game BK Mlad√° Boleslav's management submitted an official protest to the league's governing body over a number of controversial umpiring decisions during the match, but the league commission rejected all three appeals, and Pir√°ti Chomutov and B√≠l√≠ Tig≈ôi Liberec therefore remained in the Extraliga for the 2013/14 season, and BK Mlad√° Boleslav and HC Olomouc remained in the Prvn√≠ Liga. Coach Franti≈°ek V√Ωborn√Ω confirmed that he would remain with the club for a second season. Mlad√° Bolelav began the 2013/14 season with a home game against Draci ≈†umperk on September 11. The club finished the 2013/2014 regular season in first place with 126 points. In the first round of the play-offs they defeated local rivals Ben√°tky nad Jizerou 4-2 in a best-of-seven series ending on March 3, 2014. They defeated their semi-final opponent HC Hor√°ck√° Slavia T≈ôeb√≠ƒç by 4-0, qualifying for the play-offs for a second year in a row. The two Extraliga participants were Ryt√≠≈ôi Kladno and Pir√°ti Chomutov, along with HC Olomouc, also for a second season in succession. On 18 April 2014, despite losing to Olomouc 5-4 in overtime, Mlad√° Boleslav won their return to the Extraliga for the 2014/15 season after a two-year absence. =2014-present: Back in the Extraliga= The 2014/2015 season saw the club reach the Extraliga play-offs for the first time. After finishing tenth in the league phase, they defeated Plze≈à in four games in the best-of-five preliminary round before losing to eventual runners-up HC Ocel√°≈ôi T≈ôinec in five games in the best-of-seven quarter-final. After this successful season for the team, coach Franti≈°ek V√Ωborn√Ω and assistant coach Marian Jel√≠nek both signed new two-year contracts with the club. In the 2015/16 season the team finished the regular season in sixth place, qualifying directly for the quarter-finals. Their opponent was HK Mountfield Hradec Kr√°lov√©. In the first game of the series captain David V√Ωborn√Ω suffered a career-ending knee injury.http://hokej.idnes.cz/david- vyborny-zraneni-konec-kariery-d7l-/hokej.aspx?c=A160315_160250_hokej_cig He has since become the sporting manager of the club.

Biography 265x265px Jean-Fran√ßois Niceron was a mathematical prodigy. He studied under Father Marin Mersenne, a famed mathematician and Minim friar, at the College de Nevers. In 1632, at the age of nineteen, he joined the Order of Minims. Niceron was also an artist, with a particular interest in the use of anamorphosis in religious art. He was acquainted with the leading scientists in France and Italy, such as Fermat, Descartes, Cavalieri, and Kircher, and was aware of the latest theoretical developments. Intent on finding a scientific solution to the problems presented by perspective, Niceron worked out the geometric algorithms for producing anamorphic art and in 1638, at the age of 25, published a treatise titled La perspective curieuse, ou magie artificielle des effets merveilleux (roughly translated as \\"The curious perspective or artificial magic of marvelous effects\\"). As a number of scientific societies formed in the early 1630s, Niceron became a member of the Circle of Mersenne, which was named after his mentor, Father Marin Mersenne. His connection with these societies led to associations with some of the top intellectuals from Paris and Rome. These relationships with the academic world helped him stay up to date with intellectual advancements. He closely followed optics and geometry, and used this knowledge to create the anamorphic paintings for which he is known. He died in 1646 in Aix-en-Provence, aged 33. His portrait was engraved by Lasne. The lexicographer Jean-Pierre Nic√©ron was a relative. Publications \\\\- La perspective curieuse, ou magie artificielle des effets merveilleux (Paris, 1638, in-fol., reissued together with l'Optique and Catoptrique by P. Mersenne, ibid., 1652, in-fol.) Niceron reworked La perspective curieuse, augmented it with new observations, and translated it into Latin under the title Thaumaturgus opticus, sive amiranda optices, etc. (Paris, 1646, in-fol.) This was to have been followed by two other editions, but Niceron died before he could complete them. The 1638 and 1663 editions are both available online. La perspective curieuse, a richly illustrated manual on perspective, revealed for the first time the secrets of anamorphosis and trompe l'oeil. It contained the first published reference to Descartes's derivation of the law of refraction. First published in 1638 with 25 plates, Niceron's work was enlarged by Roberval and republished in 1663, along with the first edition, posthumously published, of a scholarly work on optics and catoptrics by Mersenne (1588-1648). In the original work, Niceron concentrated primarily on the practical applications of perspective, catoptrics, and dioptrics, and on the illusory effects of optics, then traditionally associated with natural magic. The work's first book (out of four) presents briefly the fundamental geometrical theorems and then develops a general method of perspective, borrowing heavily from Alberti and D√ºrer. The second book addresses the problem of establishing perspective for paintings executed on curved or irregular surfaces, like vaults and niches, and presents the general technique of anamorphosis. Here Niceron shows, for example, how to construct on the interior surface of a cone a distorted image that, when viewed from the end through the base, appears in proper proportion. Book three discusses and explains the anamorphosis of figures that are viewed by reflection from plane, cylindrical, and conical mirrors. Book four deals with the distortions created by refraction. The added work on optics by Mersenne contained the author's final contributions to optics, including experimental studies of visual acuity and binocular vision and a critical discussion of contemporary hypotheses on the nature of light. \\\\- L'Interpr√©tation des chiffres, ou R√®gle pour bien entendre et expliquer facilement toutes sortes de chiffres simples, tir√©e de italien et augment√©e, particuli√®rement √† l'usage des langues fran√ßaise et espagnole (Paris, 1641, in-8¬∞).

The APF had affiliates from the unions, communities, students and the left: while most affiliates were township-based community movements, it also included small leftwing political groups, like Keep Left and the anarchist Bikisha Media Collective (later part of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front). For ten years the APF was a vibrant social movement in Gauteng townships, including areas on the East Rand and in Soweto and Orange Farm. It is now defunct.Lessons of Struggle: The Rise and Fall of the Anti-Privatisation Forum. Dale T. McKinley, SACSIS, 8 February 2012 The APF had fairly detailed positions on a wide range of issues, and was self- described as 'anti-capitalist.' However, its focus was on struggles, and in practice, affiliate organisations and individuals could take a wide range of positions. Many ordinary members were interested primarily in fighting against immediate problems, such as evictions and cut-offs, and did not take hard political positions. Others however were influenced by left-wing ideas, including Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in the Socialist Party of Azania tradition, Trotskyism in various forms, and anarchist communism. There was also a small autonomist current, based largely among university intellectuals. Trevor Ngwane, one of the founding members, and a former town councillor was the APF's best known figure: his politics were orthodox Trotskyism.Drew Forrest, 31 February 2003, ‚ÄúSocial Movements: 'Ultra-left' or 'Global Citizens'?,‚Äù Mail and Guardian, pp. 9-11  Repression  The movement suffered significant state repression, largely directed at protestors from APF community-based affiliates.Dissent Under Thabo Mbeki, Jane Duncan, May 2011  References  External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20180928043635/http://apf.org.za/ The Anti- Privatisation Forum webpage (still online) *http://www.saha.org.za/publications/anti_privatisation_forum.htm Dale McKinley, Transition's Child: The Anti-Privatisation Forum, a history produced for The South African History Archive (SAHA) *http://www.saha.org.za/apf/labour.htm The Anti-Privatisation Forum's engagements with the trade unions 2000 establishments in South Africa Defunct social movements in South Africa Political party alliances in South Africa ","title":"Anti-Privatisation Forum"},{"id":"20696058","text":"Bego√±a Fern√°ndez Molinos (born 22 March 1980 in Vigo) is a former Spanish team handball player.

Today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Thomas Taylour, 1st Marquess of Headfort (18 November 1757 ‚Äì 24 October 1829), styled Viscount Headford from 1766 to 1795, and known as The Earl of Bective from 1795 to 1800, was an Irish peer and politician. Early life Taylour was born on 18 November 1757. He was the eldest son of four daughters and six sons born to the former Hon. Jane Rowley and Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective, a Member of Parliament for Kells. His younger brothers Hercules and Robert both represented both the same constituency as their father. His younger brother, Clotworthy Taylour, inherited their maternal uncle's estates and was raised to the Irish peerage. His paternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet and the former Sarah Graham. His maternal grandparents were the Rt. Hon. Hercules Langford Rowley and Elizabeth Ormsby Upton, suo jure Viscountess Langford. His maternal uncle, Hercules Rowley, 2nd Viscount Langford represented County Antrim and Downpatrick in the Irish Parliament. After his death in 1796, the Rowley estates were inherited by his younger brother, Clotworthy (who assumed the surname of Rowley, by Royal licence, in 1796 and in 1800 the Langford title was revived when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Langford). Career Like his father and several of his brothers, Taylour represented Kells in the Irish House of Commons from 1776 to 1790. Subsequently he sat as Member of Parliament for Longford Borough until 1794 and then for Meath until 1795, when he succeeded his father as earl. He became Marquess of Headfort in 1800 and was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 15 May 1806. Taylour served as Sheriff of County Meath in 1786 and as a Governor of County Meath. He succeeded to his father's earldom on 14 Feb 1795 and was himself created the Marquess of Headfort in the Peerage of Ireland on 29 December 1800. From 1800 to 1829, he was a Representative Peer for Ireland. He was made a Knight of St Patrick in 1806 and served as a Lord of the Bedchamber from 1812 to 1829. Personal life On 5 December 1778, Taylour married to Mary Quin, the daughter of George Quin and Caroline Cavendish (a daughter of Sir Henry Cavendish, Bt and sister of Sir Henry Cavendish, Bt). Her maternal grandparents were Mary (n√©e Widenham) Quin and Valentine Quin (the son of the 1st Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, who was also 1st Viscount Mount-Earl).Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 1237. Together, they were the parents of two sons and two daughters, including: * Lady Mary Taylour (1782‚Äì1843), Lady of the Bedchamber to Princess Augusta. * Thomas Taylour, 2nd Marquess of Headfort (1787‚Äì1870), who eloped in 1803 with the wife of Reverend C.

His death was officially ruled a suicide three years after it occurred. Trentadue's family maintains that he was murdered by members of FBI who mistakenly believed he was involved in the Oklahoma bombing and that officials at the prison engaged in a cover-up. Oklahoma City's chief medical examiner said of Trentadue that it was \\"very likely he was murdered\\". Convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh stated that he believed Trentadue was mistaken for Richard Lee Guthrie Jr., a suspected co- conspirator in the bombing who also died in federal custody, allegedly from suicide by hanging. Early life Kenneth Trentadue was born to a family of coal miners and raised in Number 7, a coal camp located between Cucumber, West Virginia, and Horsepen, Virginia. In 1961, when the coal business was facing hard times, Kenneth moved with his family to Orange County, California. In high school, despite being an accomplished track and field athlete, Kenneth dropped out. He enlisted in the army and soon developed an addiction to heroin. He attempted employment doing factory work and carpentry, but eventually turned to robbing banks with a fake gun. He was subsequently caught, and served 6 years of a 20 year sentence before being released on parole in 1988. Subsequently, Trentadue married and became legitimately employed in construction. On June 19, 1995, his first child was born, a son named Vito. Arrest and death Kenneth was apprehended on June 10, 1995, nearly two months after the Oklahoma City bombing, while crossing the border from Mexico into California. Police officers ran his driver's license and discovered that he was wanted for violating his parole. On August 18, Trentadue was transferred to the Department of Justice's Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Trentadue called his brother, Jesse, from FTC Oklahoma on August 19. Jesse described Kenneth as sounding \\"chipper\\" in the call. District Judge Timothy D. Leonard would later write that during a check of Kenneth's cell at 2:38 a.m. on August 21, 1995, all was normal with no sign of blood or a suicide attempt; thus Trentadue's injuries and hanging occurred \\"in quite a short period of time\\" of 24 minutes or lessPartial copy of Leonard's court ruling from 2007, hosted on MotherJones.com According to prison records, at 3:02 a.m., the morning of August 21, 1995, Kenneth was found in his cell suspended from a noose made out of his bed sheets. Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy and federal officials determined that Trentadue had committed suicide by hanging himself. Investigative journalist James Ridgeway wrote that authorities \\"would later put forth an elaborate scenario in which Kenney tried to hang himself but fell, bruising his head and body, and then tried to slit his throat with a toothpaste tube before succeeding in his second hanging attempt.\\" Officials tried to obtain the permission of Trentadue's family to cremate the body at the government's expense, an unprecedented move, but the family declined, since they found the claims of suicide suspicious. The government then performed an autopsy on Trentadue, but did not notify the family. When the family received the body from the prison authorities, it was covered in wounds, cuts, and bruises, leading the family to believe Trentadue had been tortured and beaten before his death. Trentadue had sustained three heavy blows to the head, and his throat had been cut; prison authorities claimed the wounds were self- inflicted. The day after Trentadue's death, Kevin Rowland, the chief investigator of the Oklahoma state medical examiner filed a complaint with the FBI reporting irregularities in the investigation of Trentadue's death: the coroner was at first not permitted into the cell where Trentadue had died, and the cell itself was washed out by the afternoon of August 21, 1995, before the legally-required investigation could be performed. The complaint went on to state that, although the exact cause of death could not be determined, the claim that Trentadue had committed suicide was not consistent with the medical examiner's findings, and Trentadue appeared to have been tortured. The FBI paperwork from the agent who received the medical examiner's call reads \\"murder\\" and \\"believes that foul play is suspect[ed] in this matter.\\" A Board of Inquiry was convened by the Bureau of Prisons. Unusually, the attorney in charge of the investigation was ordered to treat his findings as \\"attorney work product\\", a legal distinction that would protect information uncovered in his investigation from any potential lawsuit or Freedom of Information Act inquiries. Connection to the Oklahoma City bombing Kenneth's brother Jesse began gathering information on his brother's death, still with no knowledge of a possible connection to the Oklahoma City bombing case. A telephone caller in 1996 told Jesse that his brother had been killed in a botched interrogation, vaguely mentioning bank robberies and alleging that Kenneth \\"fit a profile\\". But the anonymous caller gave so few details that Jesse did not give it much credence and soon forgot it. This assessment changed in 2003, after contact from JD Cash, an Oklahoma City reporter who was skeptical of the mainstream narrative of the Oklahoma bombing. Cash suspected that Kenneth Trentadue was mistaken for Richard Lee Guthrie a member of the Aryan Republican Army (ARA), a white supremacist group that robbed over 20 banks across the US Midwest during the early 1990s. Members of the ARA were thought to have associated with McVeigh, and were the subject of FBI investigation. Trentadue and Guthrie shared a strong physical resemblance ‚Äì they were the same height, weight, and muscular build, both had dark hair and thick mustaches, and both had dragon tattoos on their left arm. Both are thought to have resembled the description of \\"John Doe 2\\", the never-apprehended possible third conspirator in the bombing along with McVeigh and Terry Nichols. From his contact with Cash, Jesse Trentadue made the acquaintance of David Paul Hammer. A convicted murderer, Hammer had struck up a friendship with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh when both were imprisoned at Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute. Hammer would make sworn statements alleging that McVeigh told him information about other conspirators in the Oklahoma City Bombing, including Guthrie.Declaration of David Paul Hammer, Case No. 204 VC 00772 DAK, Filed Feb 16, 2001, United States Court for the District of Utah, Central Division On the basis of this information from Cash, Hammer and Jesse's other subsequent research, lawsuits and FOIA requests Jesse and others ultimately came to believe that Kenneth had been mistakenly identified by authorities as an accomplice in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing as the anonymous caller has claimed. It is supposed that Trentadue was tortured to make him talk, and died during the interrogation. After being shown a picture of Kenneth Trentadue, Timothy McVeigh is reported to have said, \\"Now I know why Trentadue was killed, because they thought he was Richard Guthrie.\\" Less than one year after Trentadue's death, Guthrie would also be found dead in his prison cell, the day before he was scheduled to give a television interview. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging. In 1999, Alden Gillis Baker, an inmate who had been imprisoned in Oklahoma City's Federal Transfer Center at the same time as Trentadue, stated he would testify that he had witnessed Trentadue's murder. According to FBI documentation, Baker was sharing a cell with Trentadue on the night of his death. However, the authenticity this documentation has been vigorously disputed by the Department of Justice, and a judge once ruled that Baker was not a credible witness. In December 1999, Baker reported to a lawyer that he feared for his life. In August 2000, he was found dead in his cell. His death was ruled a suicide by the coroner's office. Trentadue family attorneys argued that Baker's hanging was \\"... pretty incredible because he's the only witness who really came forward and said he saw the guards go in there and murder Kenneth.\\" Investigation Trentadue's death was investigated by the FBI, although the agent charged with the task did not view his cell. He did visit the prison itself, but talked with prison employees only ‚Äì not inmates ‚Äì and he collected no evidence for the case. For months, there was no movement on the case, but mounting complaints from the state medical examiner caught the ear of the Department of Justice, and in 1996 the DOJ's Civil Rights Division was given jurisdiction over the case. It determined that a federal grand jury ought to be convened, to decide if an indictment should be issued in Trentadue's case. The jury was convened on July 6, 1996. Medical examiner Fred Jordan remained firm in his refusal to classify the death a suicide. Jordan told the U.S. Attorney's Office that Trentadue had been \\"abused and tortured\\", and would even go so far as to say \\"the federal grand jury is part of a cover-up.\\" To review the case, the Department of Justice consulted forensic pathologist Bill Gormley, of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Gormley contacted Kevin Rowland, the original chief investigator assigned the case by the Oklahoma state medical examiner. In his memo of the conversation, Rowland wrote that Gormley \\"was troubled that the Department of Justice only seemed interested in him saying it might be possible these injuries were self-inflicted.\\" According to Rowland, Gormley was becoming increasingly sure that Trentadue was murdered. Senators Orrin Hatch (R, Utah) and Byron Dorgan (D, N.D.) spoke publicly about the case, both raising suspicion about the suicide ruling. Hatch stated to Attorney General Janet Reno in April 1997 hearing that \\"I fear the Department [of Justice] is not taking this investigation seriously.\\"Senate Judiciary Hearing, April 30, 1997 Nevertheless, in August 1997 the grand jury found no evidence of foul play in Trentadue's death. The FBI continued to exert pressure on Fred Jordan to rule the case a suicide. Oklahoma Assistant Attorney General Patrick Crawley contacted an attorney in the Department of Justice on Jordan's behalf, telling him that the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons had \\"prevented the medical examiner from conducting a thorough and complete investigation into the death, destroyed evidence, and otherwise harassed and harangued Dr. Jordan and his staff.\\" In July 1998, Jordan officially changed the listed cause of death from \\"unknown\\" to \\"suicide\\". His reversal, he said, had been based largely on the analysis of a handwriting expert of Trentadue's supposed suicide note, even though the expert had not been permitted to see the actual note. During a 2002 deposition Jordan would claim to have been \\"harassed by the Department of Justice from the very beginning\\". In November 1999, a further investigation ‚Äì this time by the U.S. Inspector General ‚Äì released a report on its findings, stating there was no evidence to support the theory that Trentadue had been murdered, or that there had been a cover-up. The report does however note that the FBI and Bureau of Prisons had poorly conducted the investigation, and that four employees of the federal government had \\"made false statements\\" under oath in connection to the Trentadue case. Civil suit and other legal action The Trentadue family filed a wrongful death suit against the federal government, and were awarded a judgment of $1.1 million for their emotional distress associated with the way the federal government handled the case. Judge Leonard castigated several prison guards and other witnesses for the defense, writing in his ruling: \\"From the time of Trentadue's death up to and including the trial, these witnesses seemed unable to comprehend the importance of a truthful answer.\\" The Federal government appealed the $1.1-million-dollar award, and in August 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit revoked the award and sent the case back to the judge who originally awarded the money. In 2008, after bouncing back and forth twice on appeal, the judge reinstated the award, although the Trentadue family claims Department of Justice attorneys have told them the federal government will never pay, no matter how many judgments the family wins. In November 2008, Kenneth Trentadue's family offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to a murder conviction in the case of Trentadue's death. According to one 2008 interview, the federal government did pay a civil settlement, which is the source of the money offered as a reward.AntiWarRadio.com interview with Jesse Trentadue at http://www.scotthortonshow.com/2008/12/06/antiwar-radio- jesse-trentadue/ In 2007, Jesse Trentadue requested to conduct videotaped depositions of Terry Nichols and death-row inmate David Paul Hammer on the subject of Kenneth Trentadue's death and on the FBI's possible withholding of documents relating to Kenneth Trentadue, documents that Jesse had requested in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball granted Trentadue's request. After the FBI urged him to reconsider in September 2008, Judge Kimball reaffirmed the decision. The FBI appealed the decision, claiming the two prisoners \\"clearly have no knowledge regarding FBI procedures in filing and searching for records.\\" In July 2009 the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit overturned Kimball's decision, barring Jesse Trentadue from conducting the interviews.

Somerset cricketer born at Winchester, Hampshire on 19 November 1937, Keith made his first-class debut for Somerset against Cambridge University in May 1959, scoring 40 in his first innings. He played only one further first-team match that year, but in 1960 was given a run of 10 matches in the first half of the season. But his highest score was only 48 in the match against Gloucestershire at Bath, and his bowling was not used at all. After three unsuccessful games in the early part of the 1961 season, he left Somerset at the end of the season and joined Hampshire for the 1962 season. Hampshire career In his first match for his new county, Keith scored 82 and 12 not out against Oxford University, but though it was a new highest score for him it was also his only first-class match of the 1962 season. He played only three matches in 1963, but the long- standing opening batsman Jimmy Gray was available for only the second half of the 1964 season, and Keith stood in for him for the first two months, opening with Roy Marshall, though he failed to retain his place for long once Gray was available again. In the most prolific season of his career, he scored 653 runs with a highest of 75 and an average of 21.76. There were more matches but a different batting position in 1965: Barry Reed and Mike Barnard became Marshall's more regular opening partners, while Keith resumed batting in the middle order. His aggregate for the season at 561 runs was lower than in 1964, but his average had improved to 26.75 and the season included the only century of his career, an unbeaten 101 in the match against the South African touring side. His little used off-spin also got its best reward in the 1965 season, with four wickets for 49 runs in Gloucestershire's first innings in the match at Bristol. In 1966, however, Keith went back to being a bit-part player in the Hampshire side, playing only seven matches and making only 86 runs in them. He had a further good run in the first team in the first months of the 1967 season, and made 53 against Sussex before losing his place. Regaining it with an innings of 85 against Oxford University, he lost it again only two games later, and, with younger players such as David Turner and Keith Wheatley seizing their chances, he was not picked again. He left Hampshire at the end of the season to move to South Africa. South Africa and after Keith played twice for Western Province in the B section of the Currie Cup, but made little impact. He returned to Hampshire to become the county's cricket coach in 1971, and played and captained the second eleven from 1971 to 1975. The levels of fitness and the high standard of fielding were cited as among the reasons why an unfancied Hampshire won its second County Championship title in 1973. Early death Keith died at Southampton on 26 December 1975 from a heart attack aged 38. His obituary in Wisden states: \\"His early death was particularly tragic as he was a man who took great pains to keep himself physically fit.\\" Keith's obituary appeared in an \\"Obituaries before 1976\\" addendum in the 1977 Wisden.

Early life Howe Browne was the son and heir of John Browne, 1st Marquess of Sligo. He was educated at Eton and Jesus College, Cambridge, receiving his MA as Lord Altamont in 1808. During his early years he is reputed to have befriended Thomas De Quincey and Lord Byron. He became Marquess of Sligo in 1809 on the death of his father and was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 11 November 1809. In 1812 Browne was charged with \\"enticing and persuading (a seaman) to desert (the navy)\\", a charge punishable with the death sentence at its most extreme. Browne was found guilty and sentenced to a ¬£5,000 fine and four months in Newgate prison. In an odd turn of events, during the course of the trial his mother, grew amorous for the Judge Sir William Scott. Following the trial, the two were introduced and later married, despite a 20-year age gap. However, the marriage did not prove to be a happy one and was apparently on the rocks after just one year. Previous to his marriage, he had a relationship with the French courtesan Pauline 'Cherie' Pacquot. The affair produced one son, whose paternity Howe questioned upon discovering he was not Pauline's only lover. Following his split from Pauline, On 4 March 1816, Browne married the sixteen-year-old Hester Catherine, daughter of John de Burgh, 13th Earl of Clanricarde. His mother is said to have remarked that \\"the most remarkable likeness to Pauline that I ever saw\\". The couple had fourteen children between 1817 and 1839. Lady Hester was a cultured woman who patronised the arts and renovated Westport House, the family seat in County Mayo, and its gardens. The family also had a London home in Mansfield Street, Marylebone. With her husband, she campaigned to abolish slavery, and later to relieve the Irish famine. She was a patron of the Sisters of Mercy. Governor of Jamaica The grave of the Marquis of Sligo, Kensal Green Cemetery In 1834-35 he was appointed Governor and Vice-Admiral of Jamaica and received with much pomp and circumstance. The local plantation owners assumed that Browne, as a plantation owner himself, would look after their interests. However Browne's ownership of two plantations on the island had come to him via an inheritance upon the death of his grandmother, and as Browne would reveal in short order, did not think much of the institution of slavery being practised on the island. Arriving shortly after the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, Browne attempted to oversee the transition from slavery into a free society. He reformed the legal system, appointing the mixed-race Richard Hill in charge of the stipendiary magistrates during \\"the Apprenticeship\\" (a four- year period in which the black population was to be \\"taugh\\" how to be \\"proper citizens\\").The Irish champion of slaves at independent.ie, accessed 9 March 2014: \\"The man who started his life at Westport House in Co Mayo would go down in Jamaican history as a champion of slaves.\\" He also set up schools for the black population, two of which he personally financed. These moves almost instantly made Browne a villain to the ruling class on Jamaica. They quickly mocked his past reputation in the local press; \\"We are fully aware of his Lordship's nautical excursions and frolics before he came to Jamaica.\\" By 1836 the Jamaican Assembly were blocking his attempts to fully emancipate the Black Jamaican population and were able to force him to resign from the Governorship. The first free village of Sligoville in Saint Catherine parish, Jamaica is named after him. Lord and Lady Sligo are buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Their grave lies in the centre of the overgrown north-west quadrant of the inner circle.

After a meltdown in Stage 16, where he had lost ten minutes, Landis came back in Stage 17, riding solo and passing his whole team. However, a urine sample taken from Landis immediately after his Stage 17 win has twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. The International Cycling Union stripped him of his 2006 Tour title. Second place finisher √ìscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner. The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin. Prelude Landis was wearing the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification prior to Stage 16, but then lost eight minutes and seemed finished. However, Landis spectacularly came back in Stage 17, winning the stage and cutting his deficit to leader √ìscar Pereiro to half a minute. Overtaking him after the Stage 19 time trial, Landis was celebrated as the winner of the 2006 Tour de France. Doping accusation On July 27, 2006, four days after the Tour had finished, the Phonak cycling team announced Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after his epic performance in Stage 17. Landis denied having doped and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician Arnie Baker later disclosed that his test had found a T/E ratio of first 12:1, later 11:1, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1. The test on Landis's Stage 17 A sample had been performed by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD), which was a division of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and accredited by the World Anti- Doping Agency (WADA). The B sample confirmed the A sample, and also tested positive for an unnatural source of testosterone. Following the reported positive drug test on his A sample, Landis suggested that the results had been improperly released by the UCI. On August 9, 2006, UCI president Pat McQuaid rejected the claim, saying, \\"We acted correctly. We informed the team, the rider, and the federation that there had been an irregularity. Then we issued a press release saying that an unnamed rider had been found positive in the Tour. Landis's team published his name, two days later... I have full faith in that laboratory, and there are stringent measures kept in place by the anti- doping agencies to ensure they proceed correctly.\\" Landis wrote a book titled Positively False, which contained his personal account of the case and in which he maintained his innocence. However, in May 2010 Landis confessed to doping and accused Lance Armstrong of doing the same, contradicting the entire premise of the book.New York Daily News: Floyd Landis outlines elaborate doping system in letters, details Lance Armstrong's alleged role USADA arbitration On May 14, 2007 an arbitration hearing began between the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and Landis regarding the doping allegations. On September 20, the arbitrators found Landis guilty of doping. =\\"Whisky defense\\"= On August 1, 2006, The New York Times reported that, according to a UCI source, Landis's urine test had revealed synthetic testosterone in his body. Despite this, Landis claimed his innocence, promising to \\"explain to the world why this is not a doping case, but a natural occurrence\\" and that the testosterone in his body was \\"natural and produced by my own organism.\\" The variety of explanations offered up by Landis provided fodder for many skeptical columns by sports journalists and inspiration for comedians such as David Letterman, who presented the \\"Top 10 Floyd Landis Excuses\\" on his show.\\"Top Ten Floyd Landis Excuses\\", Late Show with David Letterman, July 27, 2006. Several experts have refuted Landis's assertions. Landis at first blamed consumption of whisky for his unusual results, an approach that was widely ridiculed. Prof. Christiane Ayotte, director of Montreal's anti-doping laboratory, said that, \\"In 25 years of experience of testing testosterone ... such a huge increase in the level of testosterone cannot be expected to come from any natural factors.\\" David Black, a forensic toxicologist for Nashville- based Aegis Sciences, said, \\"There are not hundreds of plausible explanations. If the tests were so unreliable that there were hundreds of possible reasons, there would be no point in performing the tests.\\" Landis later backtracked from some of the assertions, saying, \\"The whisky idea was not mine and the dehydration was a theory from the lawyers I hired in Spain to represent me.\\" = Alternative Theory = There is evidence to suggest Landis' positive test was the result of one or several blood transfusions administered to him during the course of that year's Tour. This might explain why Landis was not flagged for testosterone in tests after earlier stages, and only came up positive after the infamous Stage 17 breakaway. After a collapse on Stage 16 that saw him lose considerable time to his rivals, it is possible Landis received a blood transfusion that was tainted with testosterone still in his body when the blood was initially drawn. This also might explain the variance in his T/E ratio results from tests during the tour, and the abnormal (and technically exculpatory) confirmatory findings from the CIR test. On September 8, 2006, Landis's attorney announced that he would formally request that the case be dropped on the grounds that LNDD's 370-page report revealed inconsistencies in the way the samples were handled. =Exogenous testosterone= Media reports said that synthetic testosterone had been detected in the A sample, using the carbon isotope ratio test, CIR, conducted at LNDD. The presence of synthetic testosterone means that some of the testosterone in Landis's body came from an external source and was not naturally produced by his own system. These results conflicted with Landis's public assertion that it was a natural occurrence. The CIR test is used to distinguish between testosterone produced naturally by the athlete's body and synthetic testosterone introduced from an outside source. The test is performed by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). According to Gary I. Wadler, M.D., a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the carbon isotope ratio test needs to be done only once, on either an A or on a B sample, particularly if the athlete's T/E ratio is high as in Landis's case. It has been suggested that Landis may have been using testosterone over the long term but was either masking it or diluting it to avoid detection. The positive test result would therefore have been from a mistake with the alleged doping program on one day. Landis gave a total of eight samples during the 2006 Tour. As part of its prosecution, USADA had remaining \\"B\\" portions of the other samples tested by the LNDD. Four of those samples also showed the presence of synthetic testosterone. =Appeals= On September 11, 2006, Landis asked an USADA review board to dismiss the doping charges against him. His request was made on the basis that the A and B urine samples from Stage 17 did not meet the established WADA criteria for a positive doping offense. Landis's lawyer said in a statement: \\"The single testosterone/epitestosterone analysis in this case is replete with fundamental, gross errors.\\" The lawyer also claimed that the positive finding on the B sample came from a sample number not assigned to Landis. The review board notified Landis on September 18 of its recommendation that USADA proceed with the disciplinary process. Howard Jacobs, attorney for Landis, requested an open hearing by the American Arbitration Association to contest potential sanctions against the athlete. =Arnie Baker= On April 14, 2009, the French newspaper L'Express reported information that had been obtained from hacking into the LNDD was sent to a Canadian counterpart lab from a computer registered to Arnie Baker, Landis' former coach.http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/greenpeace-revelations-sur-l- affaire-d-espionnage_754205.html The French police later invited Landis and Baker to attend a court hearing to answer questions regarding the issue.Landis case twist: hacking lab computer On July 31, 2009, The New York Times featured an article on corporate spying in France, stating that, \\"No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Dr. Baker to the hacking, and each has denied any involvement.\\" Verdict On September 20, 2007, Landis' doping accusation was upheld by an American Arbitration Association tribunal by a 2-1 vote. Landis was subsequently banned for two years. In response to this, the International Cycling Union formally stripped him of his 2006 Tour de France title and second-place finisher √ìscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner. The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner, Maurice Garin. Landis was also banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Even before the USADA's ruling on this matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team, Phonak. Landis agreed not to participate in any racing in France in 2007 to allow him to postpone a hearing of his case there for as long as possible. On December 19, 2007, the French Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of doping, and issued a two-year suspension, which barred him from racing in France until early 2009. After this verdict, Landis tried to reverse this decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On June 20, 2008, he lost this appeal. In September 2008 Landis moved in U.S. federal court to vacate the CAS arbitration award, contending that the procurement of the award was tainted by partiality and conflicts of interest. Additionally, Landis contested the $100,000 US \\"costs\\" award, characterizing it as a disguised punitive award.https://archive.org/details/Floyd_Landis_federal_case In December 2008 Landis and the USADA reached a settlement and agreed to withdraw the case with prejudice, leading some to believe that the USADA waived the $100,000 fine in return for the cessation of litigation.Trust But Verify, Federal Case Over blog post Regardless of the reasons for dismissing the case, litigation is now complete and final. Reaction among cyclists After Landis' A sample tested positive for testosterone, retired American cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond doubted whether additional doping tests would reverse Landis's earlier results. He stated, Fellow professional and 10 time Tour de France cyclist, Australian Stuart O'Grady, left no doubt as to his view in an interview for the Australian 60 Minutes program televised on 22 July 2007. The reporter Liz Hayes asked O'Grady: \\"Would anyone have picked that ‚Äî that the winner of last year's race was a drug cheat?\\" O'Grady replied, =Support from Lance Armstrong= On July 28, 2006, Landis appeared on Larry King Live to explain his situation and reiterate his innocence. Lance Armstrong, the seven-time and subsequently disgraced former Tour de France winner, phoned the show to express support for Landis, his former teammate. Armstrong expressed skepticism of the French laboratory that conducted Landis's drug test, noting it is the same laboratory involved in some of the doping allegations against him. Armstrong continuously expressed support for Landis and stated his conviction that the process is biased against athletes.

They had four children: *Arthur Hill, Viscount Kilwarlin (10 June 1841 ‚Äì 28 June 1841) *Lady Alice Maria Hill (7 November 1842 ‚Äì 25 February 1928), married Thomas Taylour, Earl of Bective and had issue *Arthur Hill, 5th Marquess of Downshire (1844‚Äì1874) *Col. Lord Arthur William Hill (1846‚Äì1931) He became Marquess of Downshire on 12 April 1845 on the death of his father, and was appointed to his father's Militia colonelcy on 30 July. His English residence was Easthampstead Park in Berkshire, and he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of that county in 1852, and a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 24 May 1859. He had Easthampstead Church rebuilt in 1867.

Dick Whittington and His Cat is the English folklore surrounding the real-life Richard Whittington (c. 1354‚Äì1423), wealthy merchant and later Lord Mayor of London. The legend describes his rise from poverty-stricken childhood with the fortune he made through the sale of his cat to a rat-infested country. However, the real Whittington did not come from a poor family of common stock, and there is no compelling evidence supporting the stories about the cat, or even whether he owned one. Another element in the legend is that Dick attempted to flee his service as a scullion one night, heading towards home (or reached Highgate Hill in later tradition), but was dissuaded by the sound of Bow bells, which promised he would be mayor of London one day. Since the pre-Victorian era, the story has been a favourite subject of British pantomime, especially during Christmas season. Overview Written forms date from the early 1600s, over 150 years after the death of the historical Whittington. A drama play (1604‚Äì5) and ballad (1605) are known only by name; Richard Johnson's ballad of 1612 is the earliest surviving piece that refers to Whittington making his fortune with his cat. This early ballad already contains the tradition that Whittington fled his 's service and travelled towards home, but was beckoned back by the London bells which predicted his future of becoming mayor. The earliest known prose rendition is The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington by \\"T. H.\\" (Thomas Heywood), published 1656 in chapbook form, which specified that the bells were those of Bow Church (St Mary-le-Bow), and that the boy heard them at Bunhill. Common chapbooks of a later period wrote that the boy reached as far as Holloway on the night he fled. Links to this village has not been corroborated in early folklore or literature, and is thought to be an 18th-century invention. But based on this tradition, the landmark Whittington Stone at the foot of Highgate Hill is commonly perceived to be the place where Dick Whittingon stopped and heard the famous bells. The story was adapted into puppet play by Martin Powell in the early 18th century. Later, it has been performed as stage pantomimes and children's plays. It has also been retold as a children's story by a number of printers and authors to this day. A number of foreign and medieval analogues exist that exhibit the motif (\\"Whittington's cat\\" motif, N411.2), where the hero obtains wealth by selling a cat, typically in a rodent-infested place direly in need of one. The tale is catalogued Aarne‚ÄìThompson (AT) tale type 1651, \\"Whittington's Cat\\". Synopsis The following summary gives a comparison of three textual sources. B = Johnson's ballad, H = prose by Heywood, signed T. H. (Wheatley ed.); C = Late chapbook (18th to 19th-century printing by J. Cheney): ;To London Dick Whittington was a poor orphan boy, languishing in Lancashire (B), or some unnamed place in the country (H, C). He set off to seek his fortune in London (B, H, C), enticed by the rumour that its streets were paved with gold (C). But he soon found himself cold and hungry,It is winter season according to H. and fell asleep at the gate of the home of a wealthy merchant named Fitzwarren (H, C).The ballad does not name the merchant, but the prose versions supply the name of Fitzwarren, the mercer with whom the historical Richard Whittingon apprenticed. Fitzwarren gave him lodging and hired him to be the scullion in the kitchen (B, H, C). ;Dick and his cat In the prose versions, an account of Dick Whittington's cat subsequently follows, but in the ballad, it is preceded by Dick's flight and church bells episode. In the prose legend, Dick is provided quarter at the Fitzwarrens' garret (room in the attic) (H, C), which was infested with rats and mice (H, C). But Dick owned a cat (B, H, C), that the prose versions say he had bought for a penny he earned by shining shoes (H, C).\\"for going of an errand, or for making clean boots or shooes [sic.] or the like\\" (H); \\"a gentleman... gave... a penny for brushing his shoes\\" (C) The cat controlled his rodent problem, which made her an indispensable companion. When Fitzwarren organized a trade expedition sending the merchant ship Unicorn (H), Dick's cat was \\"ventured\\" to this mission to be sold for profit abroad (B, H, C). The versions also differ regarding the circumstances: either Dick relinquished the cat of his own volition, hoping its sale in a foreign land might reap a \\"store of gold\\" towards the fulfillment of the omen of the bells (B), or, Dick was compelled to do so by Fitzwarren, who maintained a steadfast rule that everyone in his household should have some article of worth riding on the venture, with due dividends forthcoming from the proceeds (H, C). ;Flight, and the bells tolling Dick became disenchanted with the scullion's lot and attempted to flee, either because he received only room and board for his labours but was denied monetary wages (B), or because the kitchen maid (H) or female cook named Mrs. Cicely (C) abused and physically beat him beyond his tolerance. He ran as far away as Bunhill (H) or Holloway (C), where he heard \\"London Bells\\" (B), Bow bells (C), or the bells of \\"Bow Church\\" (H), that seemed to be telling him, > \\"Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London\\" (H). which persuaded him to retrace his steps. (The wording of the bells' message differ slightly according to the textual source). ;Rags to riches The ship was driven off course to the Barbary Coast, where the Moorish king purchased the entire cargo for a load of gold, and insisted on entertaining the English traders with a feast. But the banquet was swarmed with rats and mice, whereby the English \\"factor\\" (business agent) informed their hosts that they were in possession of a creature which could exterminate these vermin (H, C). Thus Dick Whittington's cat was immediately put to the test, chasing and destroying the rodents. The Moors, even more pleased to learn that the cat was pregnant, paid more (H) (or ten times more (C)) for the cat than the rest of the cargo combined. The ship returned to London and Fitzwarren who was apprised of the success of the venture (at his home on Leadenhall (H)), summoned the besmirched scullion Dick Whittington to the parlour (H) (or compting-room (C)) and sat him in a seat, addressing him in dignified fashion as Master (H) or Mr. Whittington. Dick was upset at first that this was being done in mockery, but Fitzwarren insisted it was all in earnest, explaining that the profits from the ship now made Dick a richer man than himself (C, H). Dick married his former master's daughter Alice Fitzwarren (C, H), and joined his father-in-law in his business (H). In time, Whittington became the Lord Mayor of London three times, just as the bells had predicted. Whittington's acts of charity included the building of a college, a church (B, H, C), and Newgate Prison (B, H, C). He also burnt the bonds he owned, which the Crown had issued to fund the war (B, H). Whittington Stone Today, on Highgate Hill in front of Whittington Hospital, there is a statue in honour of Whittington's legendary cat on the site where, according to late versions of the story, the distant Bow Bells beckoned young Dick back to London to claim his fortune. The cat statue was placed atop the Whittington Stone later, in 1964. The site of the Whittington Stone lies within confines of \\"Upper Holloway\\" according to 19th century writers, which corresponds with some chapbooks that say the boy ran away to as far away as \\"Holloway\\". It is not clear how far back this marker can be dated. Whittington biographer Lysons felt it stood there as a marker for \\"many centuries\\", even if it was actually just the debris of an old cross with only the plinth or base remaining, as some had suggested. Henry B. Wheatley argued that Whittington's association to \\"Holloway\\" must have been a later embellishment, as it is lacking in the early T. H. text (in which the boy only goes as far as Bunhill, just north of London). He thus does not think the stone could be dated anywhere near-contemporaneously to Whittington's lifespan, but he does allow that a purported stone was removed in 1795, so that the tradition at least predated the relocation of Whittington College to Highgate. Wheatley also observed that Holloway was at such a distance that it would have been difficult for a child to have reached there by foot and returned the next morning.: \\"before the cook had risen\\". and that it was only barely within earshot of the bells of \\"Bow Church\\".: \\"it would be less easy to hear Bow Bells\\". Publication history The earliest recorded instance of the folklore in written form is a registry notice dated 1604-5 for a theatrical play. The drama The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune was licensed for the stage 1604‚Äì1605. Based on the only remaining evidence, which comes from the record at the Stationers' Registers, there is no proof beyond doubt whether the play accounted for Dick's rise from \\"lowe birth\\" by means of a cat, but it is considered likely, since a play from the contemporary period entitled Eastward Hoe (1605) makes an explicit cat association with the line: \\"When the famous fable of Whittington and his puss shall be forgotten\\". This line also stands as the earliest surviving literary reference of Whittington and his cat. =Ballad= A lost ballad is also known to have existed from the Stationers' Register of 1605. It records \\"A ballad, called The vertuous Lyfe and memorable death of Sr Ri: Whittington mercer sometymes Lo. Maior of the honorable Citie of London\\" licensed on 16 July 1605 to be printed by John Wright.Recorded in the same Stationers' Registers as the drama, The earliest surviving complete text of the legend in any form is the ballad written by Richard Johnson on the subject. The 17-octave piece, included in Johnson's Crowne Garland of Goulden Roses (1612), begins with the following lines: > \\"Here must I tell the praise / Of worthie Whittington...\\" This ballad of 1612 already contains the tradition that the hero made an attempt to flee his service as a scullion and headed towards \\"his country\\", but was persuaded to abort his flight when the London bells beckoned him back, seeming to tell him \\"Whittington, back return\\" and pronouncing the omen that he would eventually become Lord Mayor. The ballad goes on to tell how Whittington had a very humble past working as a kitchen scullion, but that he \\"had a cat...And by it wealth he gat\\".Quoted from A Collection of Old Ballads 1823 (actually 1723), vol. i., p. 130 This ballad was sung to the tune of \\"Dainty come thou to me\\".Johnson's original work is catalogued STC (2nd ed.) 14672, and viewable from Early English Books Online. Chappell prints the musical notation to a tune that accompanied the ballad of Richard Whittington, which he suggests may be the same one as \\"Dainty\\". Of intermediate date is a version entitled \\"An Old Ballad of Whittington and his Cat,\\" printed and sold in Aldermary Church Yard, London, dated 1750(?). A copy is owned by the Bodleian library (bequest of the Francis Douce collection), (ESTC: N10713) and in the U.S., by the Huntington Library (ESTC N68225). and Yale University. (ESTC N068225) These copies show the same woodcut illustrations. A later edition dated to 1773 was part of the Roxburghe Collection of Broadside Ballads. Other broadside ballad printings have been made into the 19th century. A version entitled London's Glory and Whittington's Renown; or, A Looking-Glass for Citizens of London, printed for R. Burton at the Horse-Shoe, in West Smithfield, c. 1650, has been reprinted from the Roxburghe collection. Another is a broadside published in London by J. Pitts (between 1802 and 1819)., No. 1160 (broadside published London, J. Pitts) (ESTC: N10713) =Earliest chapbook version= From title page of The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington, Three Times Lord-Mayor of London (1770), Thomas and John Fleet, printers. The story was also set in prose, especially in the form of common chapbooks. The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington by \\"T. H.\\" (first edition, 1656) is the earliest extant chapbook version of the tale in the estimation of its editor Henry B. Wheatley. The author's identity is only given as \\"T. H.\\", but the work is ascribable to Thomas Heywood. Heywood certainly knew the cat story, for it is spoken of by the cast of characters in his play If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody (1606).The dialogue of \\"Dean Nowell\\" and \\"Hobson\\" are quoted in =Other chapbooks= A number of other chapbook editions appeared, such as the one datable to 1730. Perhaps the latest chapbook example is The Adventures of Sir Richard Whittingon, printed by J. Cheney, 1788‚Äì1808De Freitas (2004), The Banbury chapbooks, p. 34 which is quoted in full by Wheatley in his introduction. The later chapbooks contain embellishments such as London being a town with the reputation of being paved with gold, or the boy reaching Holloway, which is several times farther (than Bunhill). The localization in Holloway or Highgate Hill that appeared in common chapbooks is not found in any early versions, and Wheatley believed it to be an 18th-century invention.: \\"his change of mind at Highgate Hill.. an invention of the eighteenth century\\". \\"Bunhill\\" in T.H.'s History may also be an invention, but Wheatley dates that text to 1670. Holloway is situated in a historically inconsistent direction since it lies up north, which contradicts the tradition that the boy was fleeing towards home; the real Whittington's place of origin being Gloucester, lying westward. =Modern printings= The artist George Cruikshank published an illustrated version of the story in about 1820.Cruikshank, George. The history of Dick Whittington, Lord Mayor of London: with the adventures of his cat, Banbury, c. 1820 The American Joseph Jacobs printed a version that is a composite of three chapbook texts in his English Fairy Tales (1890). Cynthia Harnett's Ring Out Bow Bells! (1953) is a retelling of the legend, as is a 1958 adaptation titled Dick Whittington and His Cat, written by Oscar Weigle and published by Wonder Books. Origins Guildhall, London. The story is only loosely based on the life of Richard Whittington. Although Alice Fitzwarren, Dick's love interest in the play, is named after the historical Richard Whittington's wife, the cat story cannot be traced to any early historical source, and there is insufficient evidence that Whittington ever owned a cat. It is unknown how the cat story came to be attached to Whittington. Suggestions were made that the cat may be a corruption of the French achat meaning \\"purchase\\" (Henry Thomas Riley), or that it may come from the word \\"cat\\", another name for a coal-carrying boat which Whittington may have engaged in his business (Samuel Foote), but these explanations were downplayed as implausible by later commentators. The Elstracke portrait of Whittington and his cat probably dates to around 1605, and does not predate the times of the earliest literary adaptations. But commentators have strived to demonstrate that various pieces of art and architecture might be allusions to the legend of Dick Whittington and His Cat that predate the early 1600s (See ¬ßRelics). Parallels Antiquarians have noticed similarities to foreign tales of medieval origin, which tells of a character who makes his fortune selling his cat abroad. The motif was later catalogued \\"Whittington's cat\\" (N411.2) in Stith Thompson's motif-index scheme. Stith Thompson noted in his seminal book The Folktale that the tale harks back to a literary version written in the 12th century, around 1175, which was later attached to the character of Dick Whittington.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. pp. 145-146. Two Italian examples can be noted. One was told by Lorenzo Magalotti (d. 1732), regarding a 16th-century merchant Ansaldo degli Ormanni who made his fortune selling his cat to the king of the isle of Canary (Canaria).Published in: Parallel to Magalotti's tale stated, and synopsis given in: Another, the Novella delle Gatte (\\"Tale of the she-cats\\") told by Piovano Arlotto (d. 1484), was published in the collection of witticisms (Facetiae) attributed to him.Printed in: (cited in ). For other editions, see e.g. Arlotto as an analogue was mentioned the piece by A similar tale is \\"also found in a German chronicle of the thirteenth century\\", but the tale is localized in Venice, Italy. Albert von Stade in his Chronicon Alberti Abbati Stadensis, writing on the events in 1175, sidetracks into a legendary tale involving two early citizens of Venice. The rich man about to mount on a trade expedition offers to take a consignment of merchandise from the poor man (who could only afford 2 cats), and a great profit is realized to reward the poor friend. Keightley, who identified the tale as a parallel Whittington's, said the legend \\"was apparently an old one in Italy\\", although nothing was certain beyond it being known in the 13th century. A Persian story localized around Keish (Kish Island) tells of a certain widow's son who lived in the 10th century and made his fortune in India with his cat. This tale occurs in the Tarik al-Wasaf (TƒÅrƒ´k·∏£-i Wa·π£·π£ƒÅf), a 14th-century chronicle. The similarity was noted by James Morier, Second Journey (1818), and William Gore Ouseley, Travels (1819).Morier was staffed to Persian ambassador, Gore Ouseley, from whom he heard the tale. The younger Ouseley was stationed around the same period, 1810‚Äì, during his uncle's ambassadorship. A convenient source of the parallels is Keightley, who devoted Chapter VII of his Tales and Popular Fictions (1834) to the topic, boasting of the largest compilation of these parallels ever. though he was not the first to make note of the parallels in published form. \\"Whittington and his Cat\\" is listed as one of the analogues grouped under Grimms' tale KHM 70 ' (\\"The Three Sons of Fortune\\") in Bolte and Pol√≠vka's Anmerkungen. The list organizes parallel folktales by different language (including Dutch and German printings of \\"Whittington and his Cat\\"). Stith Thompson suggests the tale has migrated to Indonesia via oral transmission and seems popular in Finland.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. p. 179. Another parallel could be found in Puss in Boots. =Tale type= In modern folkloristics, tales with the same plot structure are classified under Aarne‚ÄìThompson (AT) tale type 1651 \\"Whittington's Cat\\".Uther, Hans-J√∂rg (2004), The Types of International Folktales, pp. 354‚Äì5 Examples of the tale type need not feature a cat, and the helper can be replaced by the angel St. Michael or St. Joseph. Stage productions The story has been adapted into puppet play, opera, dramatic play, and pantomime. =Puppet play= There is an early record of puppet performance of the legend, dating to Samuel Pepys's diary of 21 September 1668, which reads: \\"To Southwark Fair, very dirty, and there saw the puppet show of Whittington, which was pretty to see\\". At Covent Garden, performances of \\"Whittington and his Cat\\" were put on by the puppeteer Martin Powell (fl. 1710‚Äì1729). Powell was a successful showman, providing such a draw that the parish church of St. Paul would be drained of its congregation during hours of prayer when his plays were on.Steele, The Spectator No. 14, Friday, 16 March 1711; In Morley's annoted new edition, pp. 24‚Äì26 An advertisement bill of the puppet show has been copied out in Groans of Great Britain, once credited to Daniel Defoe but since reattributed to Charles Gildon (d. 1724), with a description of some of the many extraneously added characters and elements: > \\"At Punch's Theater in the Little Piazza, Covent-Garden, this present > Evening will be performed an Entertainment, called, The History of Sir > Richard Whittington, shewing his Rise from a Scullion to be Lord-Mayor of > London, with the Comical Humours of Old Madge, the jolly Chamber-maid, and > the Representation of the Sea, and the Court of Great Britain, concluding > with the Court of Aldermen, and Whittington Lord-Mayor, honoured with the > Presence of K. Hen. VIII. and his Queen Anna Bullen, with other diverting > Decorations proper to the Play, beginning at 6 o' clock\\".Groans of Great > Britain, published 1813, at the time considered the work of \\"De Foe\\", quoted > in Morley's footnote, p. 53n, in: Addison, Spectator No. 31, Friday, April > 5, 1711; In Morley's annoted new edition, pp. 51‚Äì53 The puppet play Whittington and his Cat was reviewed by an anonymous correspondent in The Spectator, No. 14, dated 16 March 1711, soon after it opened. It featured Punch (of the Punch and Judy shows) as did all of Powell's puppet plays. Punch danced a minuet with a trained pig in the opening scene. Punch also gave his \\"reflections on the French\\" that was a breach of \\"the Moral\\", as was King Harry (Henry VIII) resting his leg on his queen in an immodest manner. Little else on the performance can be gleaned, except that the hero's role (i.e., Punch's role) was performed in a squeaky high voice, just like the lead of the Italian opera Rinaldo and Armida, the rival draw at the time at Covent Garden which the anonymous reviewer was simultaneously critiquing. The reviewer concludes \\"as the Wit of both pieces are equal, I must prefer...Mr Powell, because it is in our own language\\". =Opera= An opera production that never came into realization was a topic in Joseph Addison's piece in The Spectator (1711). Addison states he was \\"credibly informed that there was once a Design of casting into an Opera the Story of Whittington and his Cat, and that in order to it, there had been got together a great Quantity of Mice,\\" but that Mr. Rich (Christopher Rich) who was proprietor of the playhouse (he managed several including Drury Lane theatreRich at one time also managed Haymarket Theatre, which was where sparrows were released for the opera Rinaldo and Armida, which prompted Addison to write about the release of mice for the possible production of Whittington's tale.) objected that the rodents once released will not be thoroughly collected.Addison, The Spectator No. 5, Tuesday, 6 March 1711; In Morley's annoted new edition, p. 13Quoted in Later Whittington and his Cat, an opera written by Samuel Davey, was performed at the Theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin, 1739.Baker et al. (1812), , p. 402, citing Hitchcock, Robert (1788), ', p. 104 regarding authorship. Whittington, with music by Jacques Offenbach and English text by H. B. Farnie was first produced at the Alhambra Theatre over Christmas 1874‚Äì75,G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Jacques Offenbach\\", Operetta Research Center, 1 January 2001Elsom, H. E. \\"And his cat\\", Concertonet.com (2005) and in 1895 the comic opera Dandy Dick Whittington written by George Robert Sims and composed by Ivan Caryll played at the Avenue Theatre.Adams, William Davenport. A Dictionary of the Drama: a Guide to the Plays, Playwrights, Vol. 1, Chatto & Windus, 1904, pp. 374‚Äì75 =Pantomime= The first recorded pantomime version of the story was in 1814, starring Joseph Grimaldi as Dame Cicely Suet, the Cook., spelt \\"Cecily Suet\\". Ella Shields (Camden Theatre, 1907), Sybil Arundale (Theatre Royal, Birmingham, 1908), Helen Gilliland (Lyceum, 1925) are among the actresses who have played the principal boy. Cast in other productions are listed below. Dick's cat has been given the names Thomas, Tommy, Tommy Tittlemouse (1890), or Mouser (1908). and so forth. The pantomime has introduced an arch villain, the Pantomime King Rat (or King of Rats), as well as the usual pantomime fairy, the Fairy of the Bells, personifying the London bells. An early record of King Rat and fairy occurs in an 1877 production at Surrey Theatre. This production pitches the archvillain King Rat against the Fairy Queen, for whom the fairy Beau Bell serves as messenger.; \\"Christmas Pantomimes\\", 22 December 1877, p. 591 \\"King Rataplan (Rat-a-plan)\\" occurs even earlier, alongside \\"Queen Olivebranch\\" who assigns Cupid to uplift Dick Whittington from poverty, in a Charles Millward script for the Theatre Royal, Birmingham production of 1870. In some versions, Dick and his cat Tommy travel to Morocco, where the cat rids the country of rats. The Sultan rewards Dick with half of his wealth. The pantomime version remains popular today.

J. Byron in 1861, Robert Reece in 1871. A number of television versions have been created, including a 2002 version written by Simon Nye and directed by Geoff Posner.2002 television version at IMDB database Relics There are various pieces of art and architecture which have been used to try to date the Whittington association to earlier than the 1600s. The Elstracke engraving providing Whittington's portrait with a cat had been ascribed a c. 1590 date by some 19th century authors. A Newgate statue claiming to be Whittington's cat was actually a Libertas goddess statue, and though there were suggestions it was made by the executors of Whittington's will when they rebuilt the prison, the existence of the statues prior to the Great Fire of 1666 cannot be firmly established. Other relics are a relief tablet of a boy and animal said to be found at a home that belonged to the family, a chariot with a cat carving that was the gift of the family. =Early painting with cat= Richard Whittington and his Cat, considered a \\"fictitious portrait\\". A Whittington portrait painting depicting the mayor with a cat, allegedly dating to 1532, was once kept at the Mercers' Hall. The original has been lost, prompting Wheatley to remark that the disappeared artwork \\"can scarcely be put in evidence\\". However, a facsimile of it has been reproduced in engraving in The New Wonderful Museum (1805) edited by William Granger and James Caulfield (see image at top). The portrait painting that did exist at Mercers' Hall, affixed with a 1536 date had been witnessed and described by James Peller Malcolm (d. 1815) in Londinium Redivivum, Vol. 4 (1807). The painting was in the apartment of the clerk of Mercers' Company at Mercers' Hall. According to Malcolm, this portrait of Whittington's had \\"on the left hand.. a black and white cat, whose right ear reaches up to the band or broad turning down to the shirt of the figure\\". Malcolm admits that the 1536 date had been repainted at a later date after the canvas was cropped, but commented that \\"it is hardly to be supposed\\" that this date \\"was then invented\\". This painting had disappeared by the time Rev. Samuel Lysons, who published the mayor's biography in 1860, requested a viewing of it at Mercer's Hall. Another portrait was available for him to see, but it was more modern and did not correspond to Malcolm's descriptions. At Mercer's hall also had on display an engraved portrait of Whittington and his cat by Guillaume Philippe Benoist. The Benoist was published 1766, and according to the caption represents the Whittington and cat portrait then still hanging at Mercer's Hall. (Shelfmark D33978) =Early engraving with cat= There was also an early engraving by Reginald Elstrack (1570 ‚Äì after 1625). This engraving, entitled the \\"True Portraicture\\" or Vera Effigies Preclarmi Domini Richardi Whittington Equi Aurat is reproduced in the inset of Lyson's work. The engraving cannot be definitely dated; Lysons noted that the printmaker flourished c. 1590, and this is the date assigned by Sir Walter Besant and James Rice, but other sources give a 1605 date. On the prints can be read \\"R. Elstrack Sculpsit\\" at bottom, which is truncated in Lysons's reproduction. It has also been noted that the engraving originally depicted Whittington with a skull under his hand, but had been replaced with a cat underneath, to cater to public taste, \\"as the common people did not care to buy the print without it\\".Granger vol. I, p. 63 is cited in =Newgate statue= The antiquarian Thomas Pennant believed that a statue of Whittington with his cat was installed in a niche in Newgate) in 1412, by the executors of Whittington's estate, but that it was damaged in The Great Fire of 1666 and replaced., citing Pennant. Lysons and others had lent some credance to this statement by Pennant. But much of Pennant's assumptions here have been subjected to corrections and refutations. This \\"assertion that a carved figure of a cat existed on Newgate gaol before the great fire is an unsupported assumption,\\" or so it was pronounced by historian Charles Lethbridge Kingsford. Work on Newgate at Whittington's bequest did not commence during his lifetime in 1412, but in 1442.Way, R. E., correspondence, in ' III, p. 266, 31 May 1873 (in reply to T. R., p. 200). A copy of Whittington's will kept at Guildhall that prescribes this fails to mention a statue, or him and his cat. This statue was actually the female Liberty (\\"Libertas\\" carved on the hat) with a cat at her feet, but it was \\"alluding to\\" Richard Whittington, as explained by Maitland., citing Maitland. The stone Liberty was one of a set of seven, the others being Peace, Plenty, Concord, and Justice, Mercy, and Truth. This Whittington statue (Liberty statue) was taken down when the old Newgate was being demolished, in 1766 or 1776, to be placed in the new Newgate Prison.Year given as 1776 and quote from \\"diurnal\\" entry (Tuesday, 9 July, [1776]) in: The Liberty statue could later be seen at the new Newgate Prison, but the cat was not with her. =Chariot with carved cat= Also a chariot with a carved cat, purportedly presented by Whittington's heirs to the merchant's guild in 1572, was available for the biographer Samuel Lysons to examine. =Boy and a cat from Gloucester= It was purported that in 1862 at the site of a former residence of Whittington (in Gloucester), there was unearthed a piece of stone, possibly chimney stone, bearing a basso relievo of a boy holding a cat. It was allegedly of 15th- century workmanship. The relic came into the possession of Samuel Lysons.Overall, W. H., correspondence, in ' III, p. 266, 31 May 1873 (in reply to T. R., p. 200). Besant and Rice called this \\"remarkable proof\\" that the cat story was in the family, but Wheatley thought \\"this find, however, appears rather suspicious\\". This artwork could have been acquired after the cat legend was established, as American folklorist Jennifer Westwood points out, and the supposed \\"cat\\" looked more like a lamb to others. The cat has been preserved at the Gloucester Folk Museum (now called Gloucester Life Museum), but taken off display. Sir William Craven Sir William Craven was Lord Mayor of London in 1610. It has been noted that the story of Dick Whittington and His Cat has some similarities to Craven's career, though the story was first published before Craven became Lord Mayor.

History Captain Bob Pardo (with Weapon System Officer 1st Lt Steve Wayne) and wingman Captain Earl Aman (with Weapon System Officer 1st Lt Robert Houghton) were assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, 433rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. In March 1967, they were trying to attack a steel mill in North Vietnam just north of Hanoi. F-4Ds of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing from Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. On March 10, 1967, the sky was clear for a bombing run, but both F-4 Phantom IIs were hit by anti-aircraft fire. Aman's plane took the worst damage; his fuel tank had been hit, and he quickly lost most of his fuel. Aman and Houghton then determined that they did not have enough fuel to make it to a KC-135 tanker aircraft over Laos. To avoid having Aman and Houghton bail out over hostile territory, Pardo decided to try pushing the airplane. Pardo first tried pushing the plane using Aman's drag chute compartment but turbulence interfered. Tailhook of an F-4C Phantom II on display at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Pardo then tried to use Aman's tailhook to push the plane. The Phantom, having been originally designed as a naval aircraft for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, was equipped with a heavy duty tailhook for landings aboard aircraft carriers and for emergency arrestments ashore. Aman lowered his tailhook and Pardo moved behind Aman until the tailhook was against Pardo's windscreen. Aman then shut down both of his J79 jet engines. The push worked, reducing the rate of descent considerably, but the tailhook slipped off the windscreen every 15 to 30 seconds and Pardo would have to reposition his plane. Pardo also struggled with a fire in one of his own engines and eventually had to shut it down. In the remaining 10 minutes of flight time, Pardo used the one last engine to slow the descent of both planes. With Pardo's plane running out of fuel after pushing Aman's plane almost 88 miles, the planes reached Laotian airspace at an altitude of . This left them about two minutes of flying time. The pilots ejected, evaded capture, and were picked up by rescue helicopters. Pardo was initially reprimanded for not saving his own aircraft. However, in 1989, the military re-examined the case and awarded both Pardo and Wayne the Silver Star for the maneuver, two decades after the incident. Postscript Pardo and Aman eventually completed their Air Force careers, both retiring in the rank of lieutenant colonel. In later years, Pardo, learning that Aman was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease and had lost his voice and mobility, created the Earl Aman Foundation that raised enough money to buy Aman a voice synthesizer, a motorized wheelchair, and a computer. The foundation and the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association later raised funds to pay for a van, which Aman used for transportation until his death. The flight maneuver was later the subject of an episode of JAG; True Callings,the episode's credits \\"saluted\\" Pardo for his courage and ingenuity.

He played in the Football League for Manchester United and Grimsby Town, and also spent a season with Manchester City without making an appearance. After the First World War, he played in Scotland for Clyde and Ayr United. Career Quin was born to Anna Maria (n√©e Burns) and John Quin in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, but lived in Manchester from the age of 12.Dykes (1994), p. 310. He played for Xaverian College, Higher Broughton and Cheetham Hill as a youth, before attracting the attention of Manchester City at the age of 17. He signed for the club in November 1907 after scoring against Liverpool in a trial match for the reserve team; however, he refused to sign a new contract at the end of the season and joined Manchester United. He made his Football League debut at centre-forward, standing in for Jimmy Turnbull in a 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 3 April 1909. His only other appearance for the club came on New Year's Day 1910, playing at outside right in a 2‚Äì0 win at Bradford City. During his time at Manchester United, Quin was also a teacher, which left little time for training. This resulted in him being let go by Manchester United, and he joined Nelson at the end of the 1909‚Äì10 season. His time there was short, and he moved to Chorley before the end of the year, followed by a move to Eccles Borough in October 1911. In May 1912, however, he was signed by Grimsby Town, giving up his teaching job to go full-time as a footballer. In the two years before the outbreak of the First World War, Quin played 61 times for the Second Division side, but scored just five times,Joyce (2004), p. 214. and at the end of the war, he moved to Scotland to play for Clyde. He spent two years there, followed by two years with Ayr United, during which time he scored a combined 36 goals in 52 appearances. After retiring from football, Quin became a linesman with the Scottish Football League. Quin married Mary Caughey MacGavin in Milton in 1921. Quin's father, John Sr., was also a footballer who played as an amateur for Edinburgh Hibernian and had international trials for Scotland. Quin died in Ayr in 1953 at the age of 62.

Family and education Thomas Spring Rice was the eldest son of Hon. Stephen Spring Rice (1814‚Äì1865) and his wife, Ellen Frere. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge.ThePeerage.com http://www.thepeerage.com/p23318.htm He became 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon in 1866 on the death of his grandfather, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, as his father predeceased him in 1865. Spring Rice became an active member of the House of Lords and spent much of his time at Mount Trenchard House in County Limerick, from where he managed his estates. He also owned property in London. In 1872 he attended a \\"General Meeting of the members and friends of the Irish Society for Women's Suffrage\\" in Blackrock, County Dublin. On 26 October 1875, Spring Rice married Elizabeth Butcher (d. 27 April 1908), the oldest daughter of the Most Rev. Rt. Hon. Samuel Butcher, Bishop of Meath, in County Meath.

Dunleavy, Douglas Hyde: A Maker of Modern Ireland (University of California Press, 20 February 1991), 248. *Thomas Spring Rice (1883‚Äì1934), died unmarried. His eldest son predeceased him, therefore he was succeeded in his peerage by his youngest son. After his son died without an heir in 1934, his peerage passed onto Thomas' brother, Francis Spring Rice (1852‚Äì1937). Their sister was the poet, Lucy Knox. Lord Monteagle was a cousin of Sir Cecil Spring Rice, British Ambassador to the United States from 1912 to 1918. Politics Like his grandfather, Lord Monteagle was a moderate unionist when he assumed his seat in the House of Lords. He was initially a member of the Liberal Party, and in 1885 wrote a pamphlet entitled Liberal Policy in Ireland.SSISI website, 'History' http://www.ssisi.ie/history.php (Accessed 30 September 2014) The following year he became a Liberal Unionist out of a fear that Gladstone's 1886 Home Rule bill would lead to full independence for Ireland, and the dissolution of the United Kingdom.National Library of Ireland, Monteagle Papers (Collection List No. 122), p6. As a consequence, Lord Monteagle sat with the peers of the Irish Unionist Alliance and he became a leading figure among moderate Southern Unionists. As a resident of Ireland he witnessed the deterioration of the political situation during the 1890s. He gradually became of the opinion that unionists had to recognise that in order to protect the Union, a compromising and workable agreement would need to be reached with Irish nationalists.Thomas Hennessey, Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition (Routledge, 20 June 2005), 186. In 1911, he was a founding member, and later president, of the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, believing that proportional representation would help to prevent conflict between unionists and nationalists in a self-governing Ireland. In 1917, he helped to arrange the Irish Convention, using his personal connections to ensure that the interests of Sinn F√©in were represented after the party leadership refused to attend.Donald Harman Akenson, Conor: A Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien, Volume I, 'Narrative' (McGill-Queen's Press ‚Äì MQUP, 7 September 1994), 58.

Monteagle argued that the foreign affairs and defence of Ireland should, however, remain the responsibility of the Westminster government. Opposed by both the Conservative Earl of Dunraven, who argued for a federal union through devolution, and Liberal peers supporting the government's own bill, Monteagle's bill was defeated at second reading on 1 July 1920, by 28 votes for to 41 votes against.Hansard (House of Lords, 1 July 1920, vol 40 cc1113-62) http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/jul/01/dominion-of- ireland-bill-hl He caused indignation in the unionist community in Ireland when, in a February 1920 letter to The Times, he called for an end to the deportation and internment without trial of recently elected Sinn F√©in politicians.The Spectator (14 February 1920), page 10 http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/14th-february-1920/10/the-arrest-of- sinn-feiners Honours and appointments Lord Monteagle was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 9 February 1885; his armorial banner hangs in St Patrick's Hall, Dublin Castle alongside those of other knights.

The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.World of Spectrum Gameplay Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries to steal these ingredients from him. After the opening level, the game becomes a BurgerTime clone where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom. Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies. The player can spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds. Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below. The platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle). As the player progresses in the game, the number of enemies increases. Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to trap them between the falling burger ingredients and to temporarily freeze them with pepper. Only a small supply of pepper (up to 4 bottles) can be carried at a time; when the player is low on pepper, more can be acquired by collecting a coffee cup or ice cream. Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.

The villa was cited by Franco Sacchetti in Trecentonovelle, and once belonged to the Salviati family. Villa di Rusciano. In the mid-15th century, Luca Pitti bought the estate and had it restructured by Filippo Brunelleschi. Unfortunately the original project was not fully completed.

The garden has a panoramic terrace with cypress trees. It was in these gardens that Francesco Franceschi Fenzi first discovered his passion for plants. In 1472 it was bought by the Florentine Republic and granted as residence to Federico III da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, Captain General of the armed forces. The villa had several other owners.

This highly unstable blue compound has not been isolated in pure form, but can be generated and observed as a short-lived component of gas, liquid, or solid systems. Like nitrogen dioxide , it is a radical (a molecule with an unpaired valence electron), which makes it paramagnetic. It is the uncharged counterpart of the nitrate anion and an isomer of the peroxynitrite radical . Nitrogen trioxide is an important intermediate in reactions between atmospheric components, including the destruction of ozone.R. P. Wayne, I. Barnes, P. Biggs, J. P. Burrows, C. E. Canosa-Mas, J.

History The existence of the radical was postulated in 1881-1882 by Hautefeuille and Chappuis to explain of the absorption spectrum of air subjected to a silent electrical discharge. Structure and properties The neutral molecule appears to be planar, with three-fold rotational symmetry (symmetry group D3h); or possibly a resonance between three Y-shaped molecules. The radical does not react directly with water, and is relatively unreactive towards closed-shell molecules, as opposed to isolated atoms and other radicals. It is decomposed by light of certain wavelenths into nitric oxide and oxygen . The absorption spectrum of has a broad band for light with wavelengths from about 500 to 680 nm, with three salient peaks in the visible at 590, 662, 623 nm. Absorption in the range 640 - 680 nm does not lead to dissociation but to fluorescence: specifically, from about 605 to 800 nm following excitation at 604.4 nm, and from about 662 to 800 nm following excitation at 661.8 nm. In water solution, another absorption band appears at about 330 nm (ultraviolet). An excited state can be achieved by photons of wavelength less than 595 nm. Preparation Nitrogen trioxide can be prepared in the gas phase by mixing nitrogen dioxide and ozone: : + ‚Üí + This reaction can be performed also in the solid phase or water solutions, by irradiating frozen gas mixtures, flash photolysis and radiolysis of nitrate salts and nitric acid, and several other methods.

Once finished, the stadium will be used mostly for football matches and will also be the new home ground of the local Cherno More Varna. The venue will have a capacity of 22,000 spectators. Due to financial crises in Bulgaria, the stadium‚Äôs construction has been put on hold multiple times. As of June 2020, the stadium is yet to be completed. History =Project= It was due to open in 2013 and would have a capacity of 30,000 spectators with a possible expansion to 40,000. The stadium, as part of Sport Complex Varna, will have an underground parking area, convertible roof covers, office lounges, two-tier stands and four towers, which will block the pressure of the terrain and bring the stadium in a shape of a ship. The convertible roof covers would be made of transparent panels, which would allow the light of the floodlights to stream inside the pitch during night matches. The venue would be awarded with an elite stadium rating by UEFA. The sport complex and its concept were designed by the German architectural company GMP International GmbH, which built several stadiums for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including the renovation of the Olympiastadion in Berlin and the construction of the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt respectively. The stadium was also proposed to support a possible bid as a venue for the Euro 2020, which Bulgaria and Romania were planning to host. The construction officially started on September 12, 2008, with the demolishing of the former Yuri Gagarin Stadium. In the follow-up years, the initial project by GMP International GmbH was partially redesigned due to the financial crisis in 2009 that affected the stadium's construction. As a result, the capacity of the stadium was reduced to 22,000 spectators, the transparent roof covers were replaced and the roof towers were removed from the original design. =Construction= The construction of the new stadium was on hold since 2009, as it was seriously affected from the global financial crisis of 2007-08 and the subsequent lack of funding.

Developed in 1958 specifically to capture the potentially lucrative US market, the last G12 was produced in 1966. Development =Matchless G12= The Matchless G12 was one of the last motorcycles under the Matchless name and was also produced as the AJS Model 31 by the same company. Designer by Phil Walker, AMC knew that it had to be a but wanted to use as many parts from the Model 11 as possible. The cylinders could not be bored out further so the stroke was lengthened from , resulting in a capacity of . This meant developing a new crankshaft and primary chaincase, which also provided the opportunity to add a Lucas alternator. Volume production began in September 1958. 1960 Matchless G12 in use =Matchless G12 De Luxe= In 1959 the G12 was redesigned and modernised as the De Luxe with a new full cradle tubular duplex frame and a new cylinder head. Vibration had always been a problem, so the crankshaft was upgraded to nodular iron. Capable of performance, the G12 became popular with the American market. =Matchless G12 CS= The Matchless G12 CS (sometimes referred to as the CS X) was an off-road version of the Matchless G12 with improved ground clearance and a slightly upswept exhaust and an 8.5:1 compression ratio. It was not a trials competition machine but instead aimed at the 'desert racer' market in the US. While never as popular as rivals Triumph and BSA 650's in Open Class desert competition, the Matchless was powered by a torquey and reliable motor and was suspended with the superior Teledraulic front fork. =Matchless G12 CSR= The Matchless G12 CSR designation officially stood for \\"Competition/Sprung/Roadster,\\" the same nomenclature used with the G80 and G50 models. It is mistakenly referenced as Competition/Sport/Road. It was dubbed the Coffee Shop Racer by its rivals. With its distinctive two-into-one 'siamese' exhaust system and upgraded camshafts the CSR was a high-performance motorcycle with what was, at the time, a high compression ratio of 8.5:1, distinguishing it and the G12 CS from the other G12 models, having a 7.5:1 compression ratio. The factory diverted Chief Engineer Jack Williams from AJS 7R development to address the problems with leaks and vibration and modify the bikes for racing ‚Äì with the result that Ron Langston and Don Chapman won the prestigious Thruxton 500 long-distance endurance race on the AJS Model 31 counterpart to the G12. Encouraged by this victory in 1963 the G12 CSR gained the name Monarch[\\"Apache\\" in the U.S] and twin carburettors (the AJS version was renamed the Hurricane). =Matchless G15/45= In 1964 the CSR gained Norton brakes and forks, and the following year a Norton Atlas engine replaced the trouble prone AMC unit. In 1962 and 1963, AMC had produced a limited run of 212 touring motorcycles of displacement using an enlarged version of the G12 AMC-designed engine, but these bikes‚Äîwhich were given the model designation \\"G15/45\\"‚Äîproved even less reliable than the version when ridden hard. So AMC's original plans to develop a 750 cc desert racer version were abandoned. It is interesting to note however that when examples of the rare G15/45 surface they often have achieved similar mileages to the G12 on which they are based. The styling and colour schemes may be equally to blame for the lack of commercial success. If successful, this could have saved the company as there was a huge un-met demand in the US for powerful desert racers to compete in endurance events. By this time the company were in financial trouble and production ended in 1966. Some success was achieved with the Norton 750[Atlas Hybrids] powered models[ G15CS/M,G15CS/N,G15Mk2,G15P,G15,33,G15CS,N15CS,G15CSR,33CSR,P11[Cheetah],P11A,Ranger 750].Around 10,000 being sold in total, more than the number of Norton Atlas'.The CS \\"street scramblers\\" were competitive and popular [4500 built], and the project 11[P11] models won a world championship[1969] before the European 2-strokes arrived, and sold 2500 units.

He spent nine years at Blackpool in the 1960s, making over 150 Football League appearances for the club. He played as a defender, specifically at full back. He also played briefly for York City. Club career Thompson signed for Ron Suart's Blackpool in August of the 1961‚Äì62 season, from Stockton, making his debut on 14 October in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road. He went on to make a further five league appearances for the club that season. He also made two appearances in their FA Cup campaign, as they reached the semi-finals stage. The following season, 1962‚Äì63, Thompson made three league starts, his only appearances of the campaign. In 1963‚Äì64, with his chances again limited, he made eight league appearances. It was in 1964‚Äì65, however, that he made his breakthrough as a first-team regular. He replaced the departed Barrie Martin at left-back, and went on to appear in 43 of Blackpool's 45 league and cup matches. Thompson scored his only goal for the club in 1965‚Äì66, in a 5‚Äì3 home League victory over Arsenal on 16 October, en route to making 36 appearances. He switched between the left- and right-back berths throughout 1966‚Äì67, deputising in the latter position when Jimmy Armfield was unavailable. He made 36 league, one FA Cup and four League Cup appearances. The 1967‚Äì68 season was Stan Mortensen's first full season in charge of Blackpool, after replacing Ron Suart two-thirds of the way through the previous term, and he gave twelve starts to Thompson, plus one appearance as substitute. Thompson did, however, appear in both of the club's FA Cup ties and one of their three League Cup fixtures. Thompson's final season at Blackpool, 1968‚Äì69, saw his make sixteen league appearances, the final one being in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at home to Charlton Athletic on 11 January. He spent the 1969‚Äì70 season playing in the reserves. He joined York City, who were then in the Fourth Division, in July 1970 and played four matches for the team, with these appearances coming after an injury to Chris Topping after the opening day of the 1970‚Äì71 season. International career Thompson made his debut for the England national amateur team on 26 September 1959, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Northern Ireland in the 1959‚Äì60 British Amateur Championship. He played in a 2‚Äì1 win over Scotland on 26 March 1960, which saw England win the 1959‚Äì60 British Amateur Championship. Between 1959 and 1960, Thompson played four matches for the England amateur team. He first played for the Great Britain Olympic team on 21 November 1959 in a 3‚Äì2 win over the Republic of Ireland in a qualifier for the 1960 Summer Olympics. He played in all four of Great Britain's qualifying matches, as the team qualified for the tournament after finishing top of their qualifying group. Thompson was part of the Great Britain squad for the 1960 Summer Olympics, and started in their first match against Brazil.

Distinguished from other Lebkuchen by their sometimes elaborate sugar decorations, they are not to be confused with the Berner Haselnusslebkuchen, another Bernese specialty which is made from ground hazelnuts. Composition and production Honiglebkuchen dough is made of honey, milk, margarine, flour and potassium carbonate (as leavening agent), as well as a mixture of spices. The spice mixture is specific to each bakery ‚Äì which is why it is said that no two Honiglebkuchen taste the same ‚Äì but coriander, anise, star anise, cloves, ginger and nutmeg are commonly used. After a leavening period of four days, the dough is softened by rolling it, rolled out to a thickness of , and cut into the desired shape. Most Honiglebkuchen are rectangular, but round or heart-shaped forms are also used. The Lebkuchen are baked as dryly as possible at around for about 14 to 20 minutes. Immediately afterwards, they are given a shiny coat with a solution of potato starch in water, called Fecul√©. The sugar decorations are traditionally applied manually by specialised confectioners using a triangular bag. The most popular motif is the bear, Berne's heraldic animal, which is shown in various scenes and poses, such as in the B√§rengraben. Cheaper Lebkuchen, such as the one pictured above, feature standardised decorations applied by template. History Lebkuchen with honey and exotic spices were already made in medieval Swiss monasteries. A 16th- century recipe from Lucerne is already very similar to the contemporary recipe, except that fewer spices were used. In Berne, the Lebkuchen is first recorded in early 19th century cookbooks. The sugar decorations are believed to have come into general use some time after sugar manufactured from mangelwurzel became widely affordable in the early 19th century, but around the turn of the 20th century at the latest. A baker's manual of 1946 records that \\"the embellishments ... are made according to a decades-old tradition\\" and that \\"the application of bears, edelweiss, doves and so forth ... is and has always been a specialty and a point of pride of the Bernese confectioner.\\" Together with their hazelnut counterpart, Honiglebkuchen are the signature product of Bernese bakers and are particularly popular in the December holiday season, as well as with tourists throughout the year. Recently, Honiglebkuchen whose decoration can be customised through Internet services have also become popular. Consumption Honiglebkuchen is best when taken with coffee. Bakers recommend taking the Lebkuchen together with caf√© au lait, in which the cake can also be dunked to improve its flavour. If eaten in this manner, even Lebkuchen hardened by months of exposure to air remain appetizing. References  Bibliography  * Spycher, Albert, Ostschweizer Lebkuchenbuch.

It lay in the regency (kabupaten) Timor Tengah Selatan. In the late colonial period, according to an estimate in 1930, Amanuban covered 2,075 square kilometers.H.G. Schulte Nordholt (1971), The Political System of the Atoni of Timor. The Hague: M. Nijhoff, p. 155. The centre of the princedom since the 19th century was Niki-Niki. The population belongs to the Atoni group. Today they are predominantly Protestants, with a significant Catholic minority and some Muslims. Early history The ancestor of the royal line is said to have come from Roti island, west of Timor. Amanuban is mentioned in Dutch sources as early as 1613, when the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) first approached Timor. Amanuban had resources of sandalwood, which was the main Western interest on the island. The Dutch concluded a contract with the King of Amanuban in 1616, but the princedom came under the influence of the Portuguese, political and commercial rivals of the Dutch. This influence lasted up to 1748. During this period there was intermittent warfare with the VOC enclave around Kupang in westernmost Timor. A political crisis in 1748 turned a number of Atoni princedoms, including Amanuban, against the Topasses or Portuguese Eurasians on Timor. After the Topass defeat at the hand of the VOC in the Battle of Penfui on November 1749, the territory of Amanuban was included in the Dutch political alliance network. Anti-Dutch resistance After 1770 dynastic disputes led to a split. The larger part of Amanuban joined the prince Tobani who ruled independently of the Dutch. His son Louis (c. 1807-c. 1824) led a violently anti-Dutch policy and trained a large mounted corps of warriors with firearms. The Dutch (and the British during the 1812-1816 interregnum) sent a number of armed expeditions against Louis, without much success. In later tradition Louis is pointed out as the founder of the royal seat Niki-Niki.Jacob Wadu et al. (2003), Sejarah Pemerintahan Kabupaten Timor Tengah Selatan. Penfui: Lembaga Penelitian Universitas Nusa Cendana,p. 95. After his death the coherence of Amanuban declined. The last independent king, Bil Nope alias Hau Sufa Leu (c. 1870-1910) befriended the encroaching Dutch colonial authorities in the early years of the 20th century. However, the arrogant stance of the local Dutch officer caused anti-colonial resistance. Finally Bil Nope died in the flames of his residence in Niki-Niki in October 1910.Steven Farram, From 'Timor Koepang' to 'Timor NTT': The Political History of West Timor 1901-1967. Ph.D. Thesis, Northern Territory University, pp. 91-98. In modern Indonesia he is regarded as an anti-colonial hero. Under colonial rule Another branch of the dynasty was enthroned, and Amanuban continued as a zelfbesturende landschap (self-ruling territory) under colonial surveillance until the departure of the Dutch (1942 and 1949). In 1952, a few years after the formation of a unitary Indonesian republic, the princedom was turned into a so-called swapraja, still with the old ruler as headman (kepala daerah swapraja). In 1959 a new administrative region (Daerah Tingkat II), Timor Tengah Selatan was formed, and included the old swaprajas Mollo, Amanuban and Amanatun. In 1962-63 the swapraja, and with it the last remnants of traditional governance, was abrogated by official decree.Jacob Wadu et al. (2003), pp. 103-106.

Several battles followed in quick succession, Englefield, a West Saxon victory, Reading, a Viking victory and Ashdown on about 8 January, a West Saxon victory. Two weeks later, King √Üthelred and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great, were defeated at Basing. There was then a lull of two months until the Battle of Meretun, when the Vikings again prevailed. Soon after Easter, which fell on 15 April in that year, √Üthelred died and was succeeded by Alfred.Abels, pp. 124-34 The Battle of Basing can be dated because Bishop Heahmund of Sherborne died in the Battle of Meretun, and it is known that he died on 22 March 871.

Billenium (or Billennium) is a short story by British author J. G. Ballard, first published in the January 1962 edition of Amazing Stories (Volume 36, Number 1) and in the Billennium collection. It later appeared in The Terminal Beach (1964), and The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard: Volume 1 (2006). With a dystopian ambience, \\"Billennium\\" explores themes similar to Ballard's earlier story \\"The Concentration City\\", of space shortages and over-crowding. Setting The story is set in the future (possibly c. 21st century - see billennium) where the world is becoming increasingly overpopulated, with a population of around 20 billion. Most of its inhabitants live in crowded central cities in order to preserve as much outside land as possible for farming, and as a result the world does not have a food problem, nor wars - since all governments devote themselves to addressing the problems caused by overpopulation. In the city inhabited by the two protagonists, John Ward and Henry Rossiter, there is a mass shortage of space and the people live in small cellular rooms where they are charged by ceiling space, the legal maximum decreasing to per person. The city streets are enormously crowded, resulting in occasional pedestrian congestions that last days at a time. Most old and historical buildings have been taken down to make way for new battery homes or divided into hundreds of small cubicles. Plot Ward lives in a future dystopian society with his close friend, Rossiter. After being kicked out of their homes, they decide to move in together so that they have space and split the payments. The story revolves around Ward and Rossiter's combined discovery of a secret, larger-than-average room adjacent to their rented cubicle.

As the two bask in the extra personal space that they have never known, things become complicated when they allow two other close friends to share the space, and the ensuing snowball effect of their invitees bringing family to live in the room.

Developed in 1958 specifically to capture the potentially lucrative US market, the last Model 31 was produced in 1966. Development =AJS Model 31= The AJS Model 31 was also produced as the Matchless G12 by the same company. Designed by Phil Walker, AMC knew that it had to be a 650cc but wanted to use as many cycle parts from the Model 11 as possible. The cylinders could not be bored out further so the stroke was lengthened from 72.8mm to 79.3mm, resulting in a capacity of 646cc. That meant developing a new crankshaft and primary chaincase, which also provided the opportunity to add a Lucas alternator. Volume production began in September 1958. =AJS Model 31 De Luxe= In 1959 the Model 31 was redesigned and modernised as the De Luxe with a new full cradle tubular duplex frame and a new cylinder head. Vibration had always been a problem, so the crankshaft was upgraded to nodular iron. Capable of 100 mph performance, the AJS Model 31 became popular with the American market. =AJS Model 31 CSR= The AJS Model 31 CSR designation officially stood for Competition / Springer / Road but it was dubbed the Coffee Shop Racer by its rivals. With its distinctive 2 into 1 'siamese' exhaust system and upgraded camshafts, the CSR was a high-performance motorcycle but still prone to leaks and vibration. The factory diverted Chief Engineer Jack Williams from AJS 7R development to address the problems and modify the bikes for racing - with the result that Ron Langston and Don Chapman won the prestigious Thruxton 500 long distance endurance race on the AJS Model 31. Encouraged by this victory in 1963 the AJS Model 31 gained the name Hurricane). By 1966 the company were in financial trouble and production ended.

It is administered by the Kira Town Council, an urban local government. Location Kira town council was elevated to Municipal level by an Act of Parliament and became operational in financial year 2016/2017 under vote 781, . Kira Municipality is bordered by Gayaza to the north, Mukono to the east, Lake Victoria to the south, Kampala to the west, and Kasangati to the north-west. The town is approximately north-east of the central business district of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. The coordinates of the town are 0¬∞23'50.0\\"N, 32¬∞38'26.0\\"E (Latitude:0.397237; Longitude:32.640557). The town is approximately in size.

Each division is politically led by the Chairperson and a Senior Assistant Town Clerk as the Technical head at that leavel The supreme policy-making organ is the Municipal Council, composed of 17 elected councillors. Population Kira Municipality is the largest town (municipality) in Uganda by population. The town is the second-largest urban center in the country, after Kampala. The population of Kira Town has grown at a relatively rapid rate compared to the national average over the last decade. Part of the rapid growth is attributable to the town's proximity to Kampala. Kira is a bedroom community for Kampala. The national census in 2002 estimated Kira's population to be 140,774 people, of whom 67,222 (47.8 percent) were males and 73,548 (52.2 percent) were females. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics estimated the mid-year 2010 population to be 172,300 and the mid-year 2011 population to be 179,800. The town planner, however, estimated the population to be 300,000 in 2010. In August 2014, the national population census put the population at 313,761. Economic activities A large number of young adults are engaged in boda boda (motorcycle and bicycle) for-hire transportation. Increasingly, residents of Kira Town are employed in salaried and non-salaried positions in the city of Kampala and return to Kira in the evenings to sleep. The Kampala Industrial and Business Park, an business development park developed by the Uganda Investment Authority at a cost of about US$180 million (about UGX:470.5 billion), is located at Namanve in Bweyogerere Ward in extreme southeastern Kira Town. Sites of interest =Basilica of the Uganda Martyrs at Namugongo= The Catholic Basilica of the Uganda Martyrs has been built at Namugongo in Kyaliwajjala Ward, where the majority of the 22 Catholic Uganda Martyrs (now Saints) were burned alive on the orders of Ssekabaka Mwanga II in the late 19th century. An Anglican shrine, administered by the Church of Uganda, is about east of the basilica, at the site where another group of martyrs were murdered for their beliefs. =Kabaka's Palace at Kireka= Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II and the Nnabagereka of Buganda, Sylvia Nagginda, maintain a palace on Kireka Hill, in Kireka Ward. =Mandela National Stadium= Mandela National Stadium is the largest stadium in Uganda, with a sitting capacity of 45,202 people.

It forms an incomplete circle around the north-east, north, and north-west of the city of Kampala. The northern and eastern portion of the highway traverses Bweyogerere and Kireka wards, in Kira Town. =Umeme electricity substation= In 2015, the electricity distribution company Umeme built a 40 megaVolt-ampere substation in the Nsasa neighborhood of Kira Town, at a cost of US$7 million (UGX:24 billion). This substation is expected to stabilize the electricity grid and reduce power losses in this fast-growing urban area. Constructing the substation cost US$5 million, while US$2 million was spent on the erection of feeder lines. =Other public health issues= The Public Health Department of Kira Municipality is determined to improve the living conditions of its citizens, through detailed attention to sanitation, provision of safe drinking water, safe disposal of human and other waste, and the maintenance of hygiene in schools, markets, and other public places. Plans are underway to formulate minimum acceptable hygiene standards for private and public buildings and open spaces. =Poverty eradication= Efforts are underway to assist citizens in starting income-producing activities, including growing mushrooms. =Education= A number of first class primary and secondary schools are in the town. In January 2011, the Shimoni Core Primary Teachers' College opened at Kitikifumba village in Kira Town.

Wiener Neustadt's Spinnerin am Kreuz (1382-84) is located at the Wiener Tor. The German name Spinnerin am Kreuz (\\"Spinner at the Cross\\") is the title given to two separate Austrian stone-tower sculptures (over 600 years old), one in Vienna and the other in the nearby city of Wiener Neustadt. They are related to the story of a wife spinning beside a cross. Both columns had been designed originally by Meister Michael Knab: \\"Spinnerin am Kreuz\\", AEIOU Encyclopedia, 2008, webpage: aeiou-4456. \\"Spinnerin am Kreuz - Gothic Shrine, Vienna\\", 2008, webpage URL: www.tourmycountry.com/austria/spinnerin-am- kreuz.htm. * in Vienna, the stone tower was built in 1375, rebuilt c.1452; * in Wiener Neustadt, the stone tower was built in 1382-84. Both stone-towers were rebuilt or renovated to survive into the 21st century. Stone tower in Vienna The first Spinnerin am Kreuz is located in Vienna's 10th district (Favoriten), as a legendary old landmark on Wienerberg hill. It was erected in 1375, according to plans by stonemason Meister Michael Knab, but was temporarily destroyed in 1446. Five years later, in 1451/52 (?), it was re- erected in a new design, still using the old foundations, by Hans Puchsbaum. (He also designed the short spire on Stephansdom cathedral.) The purpose of this limestone pillar was to mark the southern border of Vienna and also provide a navigational landmark for faring folk. Before the limestone bildstock was created, a wooden column had stood at this site, first mentioned in a document from 1296. The stone tower is a tall yet elaborately structured tabernacle pillar on an octagonal cross-shaped floor plan. The tower is decorated with pinnacles plus baldachins, with groups of figures in the baldachins (The Crucifixion, The Scourging Of Christ, Christ Crowned With Thorns, Ecce Homo). The general area of Wienerberg hill had been used as a place of execution (mostly by hanging) until the year 1747 and during 1804-1868. The Vienna tower has been restored or renovated several times. Stone tower in Wiener Neustadt The second Spinnerin am Kreuz is located in the city of Wiener Neustadt (Austria), some distance south of Vienna. The 2nd stone-tower was erected by Meister M. Knab (who designed the first tower), outside of the town (in front of the Wiener Tor gate), during 1382-1384. The tower is 21 m (69 ft) high, consisting of four tapering elements, and richly ornamented with figures. Among the figures are statues of saints, reliefs depicting scenes about the Passion of Christ, and coats of arms. Other figures are relief busts of the master builder and the founder, plus their wives. Story of the spinning wife There is a well-known legend that relates the tale of the Spinnerin am Kreuz: : A merchant's wife, after he had left for a Holy Land Crusade, had come to the site every day to sit by a cross and work with her spinning wheel, while waiting for her husband to return. As she sat at the cross and prayed for her husband's safety, she also promised to use the money she earned, by spinning wool, to donate a piety column (a Bildstock). : Long after the crusade had ended, her husband had not returned to Vienna. Everyone advised the woman to forget about the man and marry again; however, the faithful wife continued to spin at the cross, and waited until, finally, one day her husband actually did return. In gratitude, the couple endowed the building of the Spinnerin am Kreuz to thank God for the husband's safe return. In modern times, both towers bear the name Spinnerin am Kreuz and were built within 9 years of each other.

History The beach was formed through the erosion of volcanically- produced lava that originated during a series of eruptions that formed the Guilherme Moniz volcano in 1761. Lavas flowed to the sea by way of the hamlet of Serretinha in the civil parish of Feteira in the direction of Porto Judeu. The lava's path is still traceable: an area of scorched land characterized by black blocks of basalt mixed with large amounts of slag. When the lava flow neared the sea, it spread out and entered the salt water at several points, among them the Bay of On 28 August 1893, a hurricane, at the time the largest storm in human memory, caused tremendous tidal surges together with punishing winds that ruined homes, churches, and barns that surrounded the bay.

The game was invented in 2006 by the Dane Jesper B√ºlow. The name \\"Bezzerwizzer\\" comes from the originally German term \\"Besserwisser\\", meaning \\"know-it-all\\". Mattel has released versions for the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States. In Denmark there are three different editions of Bezzerwizzer, developed by the Danish company Bezzerwizzer ApS. Until now, Bezzerwizzer ApS has sold more than 100,000 Bezzerwizzer games in Denmark. Bezzerwizzer ApS has also launched the game in Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium. In Spain, the company Falomir Juegos released the Spanish version in 2016.  Gameplay  Bezzerwizzer Tiles = Question types = The questions are divided into 20 different categories, each built upon different topics (in alphabetical order): *Architecture (Buildings, Architects and Designers) *Art & Stage (Artists, Painters, Sculptors, Theatre and Opera) *Business World (Companies, Business People, Products, Trademarks and Advertisements) *Communities (Legislation, Education, Labour market, Institutions and Associations) *Design (Fashion, Furniture, Interiors, Household design, Logos and Symbols) *Film (Titles, Actors, Directors and Roles) *Food & Drink (Gastronomy, Wine, Beer, International Cuisine and Ingredients) *Geography (Countries, Cities, Oceans and Seas) *History (Historical persons, Places and Events) *Humans (Physiology, Anatomy, Psychology, Medicine and Lifestyles) *Language (Foreign languages, Foreign words, Idioms and Sayings) *Literature (Titles, Authors, Philosophers and Literary Characters) *Music (Artists, Composers, Titles and Concepts) *Nature (Animals, Plants, Nature and The Environment) *Politics (Politicians, Parties, Organisations and Forms of Government) *Science (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Astronomy) *Sports & Games (Athletes, Sports, Games and Records) *Technology (Technology, Space Travel, Computers, Crafts and Tools) *Tradition & Beliefs (Religion, Mythology, Traditions, Customs and Habits) *TV & Radio (Programmes, News, People and Media Stories) = Setup = Players are split up into teams, most of the time playing separately. Each team selects a playing piece and takes two Bezzerwizzer tiles (denoted by the letter b) and one Zwap (denoted by the letter z) tile of the same color. Each team then draws four category tiles (see picture above) at random from the bag, and places them on their tile board in order of preference. Each question has a point value determined by the number of dots above it. For example, a team may pick the tiles Music, Film, Food and Politics. If they are confident at getting a question in one subject right they would put it on the fourth square on the board (scoring four points for a correct answer). There is no obvious varying difficulty between questions. Tiles cannot swap positions after being put down. The team that plays first is chosen randomly by picking one playing piece from the bag ‚Äì the owner of the playing piece goes first, though going first has no real advantage. = Play = The Bezzerwizzer Game Board For every point scored a team moves forward one square. Play goes in a clockwise direction from the team who plays first. The team will be asked their one-point question first based on the topic they put on their board. The team answers the question and score the corresponding number of points if they answer correctly. An incorrect answer has no penalty. During their team's turn a team may use their Zwap tile. This allows this team to swap any two tiles (once those questions haven't been asked in that round). They may swap two tiles between any two teams or swap the two tiles of the same team (including their own) to produce a different order. Teams may play one tile during a round. After all questions have been asked once ‚Äì this will be 16 questions if four teams are playing ‚Äì the round ends. The game continues as normal after four category tiles are picked again. = Endgame = The first team to reach the finish is the winner, unless another team also reaches the finish in the same round. If two or more teams finish in the same round, then sudden death occurs. For each sudden-death round, each team draws one category tile from the bag and gets a single question on that. Teams remain in sudden death for every round that they answer correctly or when all teams answer that round of questions incorrectly. The last team remaining in sudden death is declared the winner. If a team is situated on the home stretch (within the last five squares of the board), another team may force them to go backwards. The attacking team does this by playing a Bezzerwizzer tile. If the attacking team answers the question correctly and the defending team does not, it may choose to move the defending team's piece backwards (the same number of points) instead of moving their own forward.

The long volcanic lava tube, is one of the main sources of fresh water on the island, due to the presence of several springs within the cave. Although known since 1838 (and perhaps earlier), Furna de √Ågua only began to be prospected and used in the mid-20th century. History Its name originated from the existence of an abundance of springs in its interior, many of which became known since 1838.SRAM (2013) At that time, the famed Terceirense historian Francisco Ferreira Drummond was local representative in Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o, and he investigated the stories about the Furna do Cabrito and Furna d'√Ågua in order to provide fresh potable water to the region.Jos√© Henrique Martins Machado (2012), p.41-42 At that time, it was decided that Furna do Cabrito would be a source of water, but not the Furna d'√Ågua, since it would be difficult to capture the waters of this spring. In 1867, Frank Fouqu√©, on a visit to Terceira to study the submarine eruptions on Serreta, wrote of a lava tunnel at the entrance to the Guilherme Moniz caldera, referring to it as one of the more beautiful that he had visited. From his description, it is likely that he was referring to Furna d'√Ågua. The municipal council of Angra do Hero√Æsmo, considered the possibility of tapping the waters of the Furna de √Ågua in 1945, but this project never advanced. It was only on 1 September 1953, under the initiative of the General Junta, that the first public works to capture the spring water of Furna d'√Ågua were initiated, along with improvements to the collection of waters from the spring at Furna do Cabrito. Waters from the site, not only supported public consumption, but were used to feed the hydroelectric generating points at Nasce √Ågua, S√£o Jo√£o de Deus and the Duke of Terceira Garden (and even today function when necessary). It is the municipal service department of Angra do Hero√≠smo which continues to maintain and explore both caves, and the water used primarily to support public consumption. These two caves represent the largest sources of freshwater on the island of Terceira. Geography Furna d'√Ågua is situada on the western edge of the Guilherme Moniz caldera, between Pico Espig√£o Barreiro and Pico da Cruz, and runs under the roadway that connects the regional Via R√°pida Angra-Cabo da Praia to Cabrito. Its access and entryways are located near the artificial lake situated near Cabrito, about from the intersection with the regional expressway. The cave is , including those tunnels expanded by human intervention; it is estimated that the original length of the cave system covered . There are three branches to the system. The main is , while the remaining were artificial extended to form the actual visitors entrance to the cave system. The two remaining branches are and respectively. The space within the cave extends from to , with the maximum height . The cave formed from lava that flowed from the Guilherme Moniz caldera in the direction of the area around Feteira. It is estimated that this occurred approximately 2000 years ago. The hollow tube developed from the receding of magma and the strangulation of lava flow, corresponding to an area at the beginning of the cave, which separated this cave from Gruta dos Ratos. Even following public works to make the site suitable for visitors, there are several observable signs of lava flows, estalacites debris, lava do tipo \\"p√£o de milho\\" (in the last chamber) and lava aa (in the central floor of the cave). During the course of preparing the site, parts of the cave were destroyed with explosives, resulting in the destruction of lateral walls, ceiling and original floor, to allow the transport of water from its interior.

The Charter School North Dulwich opened in September 2000 and occupies a site on Red Post Hill next to North Dulwich railway station and nearby Herne Hill, formerly inhabited by Dulwich High School for Boys and before that William Penn Secondary School. The old buildings underwent major renovation before opening, modernising them to construct a school for the new millennium. Additions, notably the sports hall and ball courts were also made. The Charter School East Dulwich opened in 2016 and moved to a new site in the old Dulwich Community Hospital in 2019.  Charter School North Dulwich The Charter School was born out of a need of the local community for the government to provide a good state secondary school in the Dulwich area, due in part to the high concentration of private schools in the area (James Allen's Girls' School, or JAGS; Alleyns; and Dulwich College).. The name of the school was taken from the \\"Parents Charter\\" introduced by the Government in 1991 to extend parental choice and raise standards. The school was then opened in September 2000 by the first headteacher of the school, Pam Bowmaker OBE, who welcomed the first 180 students to join the school in Year 7. Pam Bowmaker was asked to be the first headteacher due to her outstanding work in other schools. She retired as a headteacher in July 2005 when the school had received its first set of GCSE results, and was succeeded by Chris Bowler in September 2005 (who then led the school to an Outstanding grading in its 2007 Ofsted inspection), before being replaced by former Deputy Headteacher David Sheppard (who was well respected by parents and pupils) in September 2008. David Sheppard improved behaviour at the school and led it to an Outstanding Ofsted award in 2008. David Sheppard was replaced by the next headteacher from 2014, Christ Hicks. The school has just over 1,250 pupils on its roll from Year 7 to Year 13.

History The caves formation is unclear.SRAM (2013) Its genesis can be explained by the ancient lava fields that developed from fissural vents, that flowed through the valley between the larger volcanic peaks. Initially known as the Galeria Negra (Black Gallery), was baptised as the Gruta do Cavalo following the first exploratory investigation, when the explorers discovered the remains of a horse, which may have fallen at the entrance of the cave. Later, after 25 December 1969, with the assistance of the eastern patriarch, D. Jos√© Vieira Alvernaz, islanders began referring the cave as the Gruta do Natal. It was on this date that they opened the cave to the public, with a simple access-way and rudimentary lighting. Traditionally, a Christmas mass is held at the site, but there have also been baptisms and at least one marriage on the site. The sites was the destination of various acts of vandalism, and today its access has been conditional. The mountaineering group Os Montanheiros constructed a rustic house (typical of the hay-loft/barns) to support activities during the site's exploration. The simple structure was also the centre of vandal attacks and criminal activities over its history, resulting in its degradation. In 1989, the mountaineering group began a project to promote tourist activities at Gruta do Natal, with the construction of a new building, which was integrated into the surrounding landscape. This building was sued to shelter an electric generator, to provide permanent lighting within the cave; protect the site from vandalism; and provide an interpretative centre for visitors to the site. The building includes washrooms, a generator room, and an access-way and staircase to the cave. Inaugurated on 1 December 1998, the anniversary date of the mountaineering association, it was opened to the public on 1 June 1999. The interior circuit was developed so that visitors would not follow the same trajectory coming and going along the route, while providing information about the histo-cultural traditions of this cave, in addition to the scientific and geological history. It is a pedagogic meeting-point used by professors and teachers to present the history of the formative forces that occur in the archipelago of the Azores. The site is open to the public from June to September, every day, throughout the afternoons, with special openings coordinated through the Montanheiros organization by appointment. Geography The Gruta do Natal is located near the Picos Gordos, within the Reserva Florestal Natural da Serra de Santa B√°rbara e Mist√©rios Negros (Santa B√°rbara and Mist√©rios Negros Natural Forest Reserve), an humanized area encircled by pasture-lands and forest of Azorean juniper. With a privileged position, the site is located near a roadway and popular lake-front picnic area of Lagoa do Negro. The roadway is also an access-way for tourist routes; it is being one of the few caves in the Azores that is visibly identifiable, visible from major thoroughfares and publicly signalled. Of all the cave systems in the Azores, Gruta do Natal provides the best conditions for tourist exploration, along with the Algar do Carv√£o system. It is a lava tube of length, with easy access, high ceiling and floor with slight slope. The interior of the cave includes geological structures such as different examples of lava, estalcites and lateral protuberances.

It was released in 1999, and won the Award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 5th Kecskem√©t Animation Film Festival.5\\\\. Kecskem√©ti Anim√°ci√≥s Filmfesztiv√°l 2. Nemzetk√∂zi Anim√°ci√≥s J√°t√©kfilm Fesztiv√°l. Kecskem√©ti Anim√°ci√≥ Film Fesztiv√°l. 1999. It was released to theaters in the UK by Entertainment Rights in an English version in 2000, which features Rik Mayall, John Hurt, Michael York, Sally Ann Marsh, and Michael Gambon. It was initially going to be released straight-to- video in the US by Universal Pictures, but for unknown reasons, it never materialized. Plot A narrator relates that long ago, an earthquake separated a tribe of monkeys. One group escaped the flood brought on by the quake by climbing to the top of the trees while the other clung to the roots. In the flood's wake, the single tribe becomes two with mutual suspicion and fear of each other maintaining the divide. Kom is a member of the Woonkos, the tribe of monkeys residing in the tree canopy, who live in obsessive fear of falling into the world below which they believe to be inhabited by demons. Kom refuses to believe these superstitions and dismisses the warnings of both his older brother, Gavin, and the paranoid elder of the Woonkos. However, on the way home, he accidentally falls from the trees into the land below. He is saved by the King of the Lankoos who have developed into a medieval-like culture with advanced scientific knowledge, but equal levels of superstition and prejudice towards their Woonko cousins whom they believe to be savages. While at the King's castle, Kom befriends (and later begins a relationship with) Gina, a young maid and Master Martin, the librarian and they help teach him to behave like a Lankoo. The King is amused by Kom's attitude and impressed by the various cries his people use to communicate, although Gina doesn't like it when he tries too hard for popularity, and briefly forgets her. However, there is also evil afoot. The chancellor Sebastian, the governess and their dim-witted side-kick, Gerard the Gormless, are up to evil plans: they intend to find a way to kill the King and they are slowly poisoning his daughter, Princess Ida. During a cold spell, the lake which the Lankoos believed to be cursed, freezes over, and the King leads his army to cross it to reach the \\"promised land\\" on the other side of the lake. Unfortunately, the ice melts and the King and his army all drown, and only Kom and one other soldier named Lionel survive. Sebastian believes his plan has worked and moves to claim the throne, but the governess (who was giving the princess the poison) is given it herself by Gina and Lionel, however it is believed she is tough enough not to die. In the meantime, Ida recovers from the effects of the poison and claims the throne before Sebastian can. Sebastian attempts to escape, but is pursued by Kom who subdues him after a fight while Lionel does the same to Gerard. The film ends with Sebastian and Gerard in cages, Ida as the new queen, and Kom and Gina returning to the land of the Woonkos, with the implication that the two tribes will learn to know each other once more.

The watermill/house is a two-story structure, with only the residential floor visible from street-level, with an outdoor oven (constructed in a semi- circular shape) and rectangular chimney (on the left-side of the building). This simple structure was built from local volcanic rock and stone from other ruins, and painted lime white. The spans are composed of curved wicker, and the windows are guillotine-style single-pain double-hung sash. The roof is covered in traditional Azorean half-cane roof tiles with a simple awning. One of the exterior walls shows signs of the watermill's function, and site of the waterwheel.

It is primarily known as the Castle of Moinhos, owing to the popular name given to the site for the number of mills that dotted the hilltop, on which the castle was erected. History A Cidade de Angra na Ilha de Jesus... (Linschoten, 1595), a period map of Angra A commemorative azulejo tile on the hilltop, marking the existence of the old Fort of S√£o Lu√≠s The first fort to be built in the archipelago, the Castle of S√£o Lu√≠s was erected between the 1460 and 1470, by the founder of Angra, √Ålvaro Martins Homem. It was a fortification of modest proportions, established on a hilltop (the current Alto da Mem√≥ria) with a dominant position over the valley, river and harbour. Its design was in keeping with the late-medieval military design and constructed on a high platform, within the earth and away from the sea. Its elevation and slope resulted in an artificial ravine, whose waters were captured by √Ålvaro Martins (1461) to move his milling wheels along its course; the fortification became popularly known as the Castle of Moinhos or Castle of Mills. Writing in between 1644 and 1711, Father Manuel Lu√≠s Maldonado wrote of the many waterways of Angra, noted several of the mills that dotted the path of the main ravine: the mills of Janela, Cova, Pic√£o, Rego, Madeira, Cal√ßada, Cal√ßadinha, F√°brica, Muro, Duas Portas, S√£o Jo√£o de Deus and the Moinho Novo.Arquivo dos A√ßores, Volume IV, p.146‚Äì147 Similarly, Gaspar Frutuoso mentioned these mills and waterways, noting that: in the hillock that circles Angra, in one of the higher hilltops to the north, is a castle fort with munitions and artillery, newly renovated and provisioned, which had earlier been weak, erected solely for the shelter and defense of its residents.Saudades da Terra (1998), Livro VI, p.14 Although √Ålvaro Martins expected to receive the royal donation of lands in Angra in 1474, the King substituted he donation with the title of to the Captaincy of Praia. The first Captain-major of the Captaincy of Angra, Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real found no reason to continue the defensive fortification. Unfortunately, years later, the island was attacked by Castilian sailors that initially landed in Angra and then marched on Praia. For this reason, in 1482, the Infanta Beatrice, who governed the islands on behalf of her son (the Captain-Major D. Diogo), sent a letter to √Ålvaro Martins, warning him that Castilian vessels continued to haunt the seas of the Azores. In order to reinforce coastal defenses, she sent Pedro Anes Rebelo (as provider of fortifications), to guide Martins in the defense of his village. After completing his task of building the Castle of S√£o Lu√≠s (around 1493), Anes Rebelo wed a niece of Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real's spouse. In 1495, the Alcaidaria-mor (similar to the Spanish alcalde) of the castle was given to the Captain-major of Angra, who lived there for a while. Later, it would become the residence of his trusted lieutenant, who was paid a stipend and obliged to take-up residence. Eventually the castle's Alcaidaria- mor was integrated into Captaincy of Angra, when it began to be known as the Castle of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o (1582). It was during the reigns of King John III (1521‚Äì1557) and King Sebastian (1568‚Äì1578) that the first defensive plans were drawn-up by military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567). The Italian architect engineer concentrated on a global defense plan for the main islands of the Azores, concentrating the defenses at the ports and anchorages. Consequently, the old castle/fort served little use, and his successor, Cipri√£o de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos, doubled his efforts with fifty defensive works along the coast of the island. Its strategic role further degenerated, with many of its dependencies used to store gunpowder for Angra, transferred from the Pra√ßa Velha for security reasons. Father Ant√≥nio Cordeiro (1641-1722), wrote of the castle's ruins in his Hist√≥ria Insulana, identifying that only the walls remained of the structure,Hist√≥ria Insulana (1981), p.174 which was also identified by Father Maldonando.Fenix Angrense (1989), p.131-132 The small medieval fort, therefore, was slowly substituted by the coastal defenses of the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o and Fort of Santo Ant√≥nio, with the latter strategically located at the edge of Monte Brasil (and which created a crossfire zone with the first, to secure the bay). In 1839, the lands were donated to the City of Angra in order to building a municipal promenade. On 20 May 1844, work began to demolish the old walls, to construct a memorial in honour former-King Pedro IV of Portugal who was instrumental in the restoration of the Liberal regime of his daughter Queen Maria II, and whose regency was based in Terceira. The foundation-stone, which was believed to be the same rock that the former-monarch stepped-upon when he disembarked in Angra in 1832, was placed on the site on 3 March 1845. At the time of its inauguration (in 1856), the municipal council deliberated whether to name the newly built courtyard the Pra√ßa D. Pedro IV, but popular sentiment opted for the name Alto da Mem√≥ria (Heights of Memory). The monument was practically destroyed during the 1980 earthquake, and was reconstructed/re-inaugurated by the municipal council on 25 April 1985. Architecture The Castle of Moinhos is situated on the hilltop plateau that separates the eastern portion of the civil parish of S√© from Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o. The Alto da Mem√≥ria monument and former castle grounds can be reached from the Gardens of the Duke of Terceira (its primary entrance at Rua do Marques) or directly from Rua do Pis√£o, where the monument fronts the roadway. Little remains of the castle features except the waist-high battlements, that served little more than lookout to the city of Angra. A double staircase connects the main platform from the path leading to the Gardens. Gardened and manicured, the spaces below the old castle are lined by endemic and flowering plants. Apart from the monument to D. Pedro IV, the only remnant to the fortifications use is an azulejo tile dedicated to the Fort of S√£o Lu√≠s located in the staircase. Remnants of the ravine canalization and mills are evident in the roads that lead from the park grounds, including along the Rua do Pis√£o, Rua do Garoupinha and Rua de Santo Esp√≠rito.

Manihiki is in the top right corner. The Manihiki Plateau is an oceanic plateau in the south-west Pacific Ocean. The Manihiki Plateau was formed by volcanic activity 125 to 120 million years ago during the mid-Cretaceous period at a triple junction plate boundary called the Tongareva triple junction. 125 million years ago the Manihiki Plateau formed part of the giant Ontong Java-Manihiki- Hikurangi plateau. Geological setting The Manihiki Plateau extends from 3¬∞S to 6¬∞S and 159¬∞W to 169¬∞W covering and has an estimated volume of with a crustal thickness of . Several of the Cook Islands are located on the southern part: Danger, Nassau, Suvorov, Rakahanga, and Manihiki. The Tokelau Basin borders it to the west, the Samoan Basin to the south, the Penrhyn Basin to the east, and the Central Pacific Basin to the north. It reaches up to below sea level, several kilometres shallower than the surrounding basins. The plateau can be divided into three regions. The south-eastern High Plateau is the shallowest and flattest; its basement is covered by up to a kilometre of pelagic sedimentary rock. The Western Plateaus, north-west of the High Plateau, are a series of ridges and seamounts. The North Plateau is small and almost separated from the rest of the Manihiki Plateau. The High Plateau is the largest part of Manihiki covering above 4000 m. The second largest part is the Western Plateaus covering above 5000 m and reaching below sea level. The smallest part, the North Plateau, covers above 4500 m and reaches . These plateaus are separated by failed rifts. Tectonic evolution The Manihiki Plateau was originally described as a subsided microcontinent in 1966, but has been known to be made of oceanic crust since DSDP drillings were made in the 1970s. The formation of the plateau is related to the intense volcanism of the Early Cretaceous and mid-ocean ridge jumps. A hotspot and several mantle sources were involved in the formation of the Manihiki large igneous province (LIP). 121‚Äì119 Ma it was the largest oceanic plateau on Earth, twice its present size, when a triple junction originated in its north-western corner, splitting it into three parts. The modern Manihiki Plateau rifted from the Hikurangi Plateau, now located adjacent to New Zealand, in the Early Cretaceous. In the Early Cretaceous the Manihiki Plateau was much shallower, below sea level or less. Shortly after emplacement the initiation of the Tongareva triple junction resulted in extension, upwelling and rifting. Renewed rifting at about 116 Ma created the eastern margin, the Manihiki Scarp, and separated Manihiki and Hikurangi. The Osbourn Trough is an abandoned spreading centre between Manihiki and Hikurangi. Other Cretaceous LIPs in the Pacific, except Ontong Java and Hikurangi, include the Hess, Shatsky and Magellan rises.

Most commonly VRAs are used in the treatment of hyponatremia, especially in patients with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis or SIADH.  Types  = Vaptans = The \\"vaptan\\" drugs act by directly blocking the action of vasopressin at its receptors (V1A, V1B and V2). These receptors have a variety of functions, with the V1A and V2 receptors are expressed peripherally and involved in the modulation of blood pressure and kidney function respectively, while the V1A and V1B receptors are expressed in the central nervous system. V1A is expressed in many regions of the brain, and has been linked to a variety of social behaviors in humans and animals. The vaptan class of drugs contains a number of compounds with varying selectivity, several of which are either already in clinical use or in clinical trials as of 2009. ;Unselective (mixed V1A/V2) * Conivaptan ;V1A selective (V1RA) * Relcovaptan ;V1B selective (V3RA) * Nelivaptan ;V2 selective (V2RA) * Lixivaptan * Mozavaptan * Satavaptan * Tolvaptan = Demeclocycline and lithium = Demeclocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is sometimes used to block the action of vasopressin in the kidney in hyponatremia due to inappropriately high secretion of vasopressin (SIADH), when fluid restriction has failed. Demeclocycline is not a direct antagonist of the vasopressin receptors however, but rather inhibits activation of the intracellular second messenger cascade of this receptor in the kidney by an unknown mechanism. Lithium, as lithium carbonate, possesses similar properties to those of demeclocycline on the action of vasopressin in the kidney, and was used clinically before demeclocycline, which largely superseded it for this indication.  Medical use  = Hyponatremia = V2R antagonists have become a mainstay of treatment for euvolemic (i.e., SIADH, postoperative hyponatremia) and hypervolemic hyponatremia (i.e., CHF and cirrhosis). V2RAs predictably cause aquaresis leading to increased [Na+] in majority of patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH, CHF, and cirrhosis. The optimum use of VRAs has not yet been determined, but some predictions can be made with reasonable certainty. For hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, who are unable to take medication orally or for those in whom a more rapid correction of hyponatremia is desired, conivaptan (V1/V2R antagonist) will likely be the preferred agent. Selective V2R antagonists such as tolvaptan, lixivaptan etc. will likely be useful in patients for whom oral therapy is suitable and for more chronic forms of hyponatremia. = Congestive heart failure = Neurohormonal activation characteristic of CHF, including increased renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, and catecholamines, contributes to progression of CHF. It has been suggested that cardiovascular mortality may be reduced by selective V2RA such as tolvaptan in the higher risk group with kidney function impairment or severe congestive findings. But until FDA indication is granted for use in CHF with or without accompanying hyponatremia, VRAs are not recommended in patients with CHF. = Cirrhosis = V2RA may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and ascites. Blockade of V2R will induce an effective aquaresis and inhibition of V2-mediated vasodilation. This aquaresis, in combination with a diuresis, may provide a potential therapy for patients with resistant ascites. V2 receptor antagonism increases plasma vasopressin concentration, which may cause unopposed hyperstimulation of the vasoconstrictor V1 receptor. Given the potential hyperstimulation of V1R, V2RA may have additional secondary preventative benefits in patients with cirrhosis through a reduction in portal pressure and a decreased risk of variceal bleeding. = Polycystic kidney disease = Polycystin defects increase intracellular cAMP, secondary messenger for vasopressin acting at V2R, leading to cyst development. cAMP-dependent genes promote fluid secretion into developing renal cysts and increase cell proliferation. Studies in several animal models of polycystic kidney disease have shown a reduction in kidney size and cyst volume after treatment with specific V2 receptor antagonist. Full scale therapeutic trials of V2RAs in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are currently ongoing. = Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus = Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) may result from V2R or aquaporin-2 (AQP2) mutations. Exogenously administered V2R antagonists can bind to misfolded intracellular V2R, and improve transport of V2R to the cell membrane. Clinical studies in patients with X-linked NDI showed that the selective V1R antagonist relcovaptan (SR49059, Sanofi-Aventis) significantly increased urine osmolality and decreased 24-hour urine flow. Thus V1R and/or V2R antagonists may serve as molecular chaperones to mitigate misfolding defects in selected patients with type 2 NDI.

He abandoned a legal career in favour of engineering, becoming a Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1868 and taking up a position at the London, Chatham & Dover Railway's Longhedge Locomotive Works at Battersea. By the 1881 census he had moved to become headteacher at Grange School in Ewell before moving back into engineering by 1888. He also seems to have worked as a private tutor. Alexander married Helen Shuldham. The couple had at least five children, one of whom went up to Cambridge in 1896.

(PEGI) was a United States company which was a pioneer in on-frequency microwave and cellular repeaters. From its founding in 1983 until its demise in 2002, the company was a technological leader in the field of low-cost on-frequency repeaters, and was awarded numerous patents. Peninsula Engineering Solutions, Inc. is a successor company that continues to provide both new products and parts based on the PEGI designs. The company went through a few name changes; in 1992 it became \\"Peninsula Wireless Communications\\" and in 1995 again changed names to \\"Repeater Technologies.\\" PEGI's clients included telephone companies, mobile phone companies, utilities, governments, and other agencies around the world. The company was based in the San Francisco Bay Area and had an office in Beijing, China. History Peninsula Engineering Group started in 1983. The GTE Lenkurt facility in San Carlos, California, was going to be closed. Product Planner (soon to be PEGI President) Barry Leff met with Microwave Engineering Manager (soon to be PEGI VP Engineering) Ed Johnson and discussed starting a company based on keeping the GTE Lenkurt microwave engineering team together in a new company. The company was incorporated in 1983, located in San Carlos, California. On the first day of business the company had no money, an order for $50,000 (from GTE), fifteen engineers, one business person and a secretary. In addition to getting employees to work for stock for some months, they figured out a way to buy the complex test equipment needed to build sophisticated communications equipment. GTE held an auction, and some employees took second mortgages on their homes to buy equipment at auction, which they then leased to the company. When the company got on firmer financial footing, it bought the equipment from the employees. The experiences they went through in financing the company served as inspiration for Barry Leff to explore the subject in greater detail; his doctoral dissertation at Golden Gate University was titled \\"Financing the Start-up of Silicon Valley High-Tech Companies\\". The company's initial product was a version of the GTE Lenkurt 2 GHz RF Repeater, invented some years earlier by John Oades. The repeater offered a low cost, efficient way to get around obstacles with a microwave link. The company completed their first year of business with sales of over $700,000 and a small profit. In April 1985 Barry and Ed met with New Vector Communications (later part of AirTouch. New Vector agreed to fund the development of an 800 MHz on-frequency RF repeater, which led to PEGI getting into the cellular telephone business, their major focus.

In 1796 William Roscoe mentions Haughton as a 'young engraver' of note. From 1803, Haughton was the resident engraver to Henry Fuseli, and it was largely through Haughton's prints that Fuseli's work became widely known; He painted a well known Miniature of Fuseli and his wife Sophia Rawlins. He became a close friend of Henry Fuseli, and resided with Fuseli's family in the Keeper's Apartments at Somerset House. After Fuseli's death, Mrs. Fuseli lived with the Haughton family until her own death. Haughton exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1808 to 1848. Two of his miniatures, \\"The Love Dream\\", and \\"The Captive\\" were engraved by R. W. Sievier; other portraits were also engraved. Amongst his notable portrait subjects were Erasmus Darwin and Sir Joshua Reynolds.http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp54905/moses- haughton-the-younger References ;Attribution External links *Moses Haughton the younger on Artnet *Engraved portrait of Henry Fuseli (Grosvenor prints) 1773 births 1849 deaths 18th-century English painters English male painters 19th-century English painters English engravers English portrait painters Portrait miniaturists People from Wednesbury ","title":"Moses Haughton the Younger"},{"id":"20698143","text":"Forum of Azerbaijani Students in Europe or FASE () is a government sponsored organization for Azerbaijani students and young professionals in Europe.

Life and work Haughton was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire, and baptised on 27 March 1735. He trained as an enamel painter and was employed at the workshop of Hyla Holden in Wednesbury, before moving to Birmingham to work for John Baskerville and Henry Clay in 1761, where he worked on enamelled, japanned and papier-m√¢ch√© products. He was married to Elizabeth Haughton (1741 - 13 January 1816). In 1809, together with Samuel Lines, he established a Life Academy in Peck Lane, a street leading out of New Street, close to what was the Free Grammar School (on a site now occupied by New Street station). This life school was so successful that in 1814 it was moved to a larger space in Union Passage. In this year it held its first public exhibition. In 1821 the (Royal) Birmingham Society of Artists grew from this venture. Haughton was noted for his portraits, such as that of Lady Louisa Tollemache, Countess of Dysart, and still-life paintings of dead game, exhibiting at the Royal Academy between 1788 and 1804. He also illustrated a notable edition of the Bible in the late eighteenth century. Haughton was said to be of a \\"quiet and retiring disposition\\" and was not much known outside Birmingham during his lifetime. He lived for many years at Ashted, outside the city. He died there on 24 December 1804 and was buried in Wednesbury; a marble monument with his portrait, sculpted by Peter Rouw was erected in his memory at St Philip's Church, Birmingham. His son, Matthew Haughton, was an artist and engraver, and his nephew, Moses Haughton the Younger (1773‚Äì1849), a painter and engraver.

The mountain's name was officially adopted on August 27, 1965, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, The Spearhead is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing The Spearhead.

The band was formed when Mark Strong moved back to Richmond from LA and found Benvolio Willson's solo work online. The lineup solidified with Daniel Medley joining in Summer of 2007 and Todd Baker joining in early 2008, during the recording of their second EP, \\"Turn On the Outside Lights\\", which never came to fruition. We Know, Plato! had a song featured in the hit show Gossip Girl on November 10, 2008. They have also been featured in numerous blogs, newspapers, and websites. History In 2005, Mark Strong, former bassist and then keyboardist of The Waking Hours and multi-instrumentalist/co-songwriter for Edison Gower, had come back to Richmond from a brief stint in California and browsed the internet where he found Richmond musician Benvolio Willson and contacted him with a means to collaborate. Willson was still finishing up college, recording solo songs in dorm room, and playing with Harrisonburg, Va band \\"Roy Rogers\\". Being away at college initially made it hard for the two to efficiently collaborate but, by late 2006, they had shared a show together as separate musicians, and in early 2007 We Know, Plato! was formed. In the fall of 2007 the duo enlisted Richmond-newcomer Daniel Medley fresh out of high school. We Know, Plato! played two shows as a trio. Shortly after New Zealand keyboardist/vocalist Julia Manhire, now Julia Marquardt, was recruited. In the end of April 2008, bassist Steve Chiles, having formerly played for the band Brian Bachman and the New Romancers, entered the band as the final member of WK,P!. In the wake of both Steve departing the band to dedicate his time to family/work, and Julia's departure due to time constraints, the band acquired a new bassist- Daniel Medley's brother-in-law, Todd Baker. We Know, Plato! disbanded in June 2009 due to both Willson's and Strong's preference to concentrate on a more focused, truer sound, as was soon to be found in their side-project \\"Carlyle Petes' Chessmen of Doom\\", which became Make Phantoms. A few years later, Medley and Baker would re-team with Willson for experimental, indie post-rock band Those Manic Seas, and Willson and Strong would morph into indie pop-rock band Witherwolf.

Most species are black or brown, a few are more colorful. Many species are morphologically similar enough to be considered cryptic species. Species within this subfamily have a worldwide distribution. 135 species of Microgastrinae have been confirmed from Canada, though the number may be as high as 275. At least 28 species have been identified from Turkey in G√∂k√ßeada and Bozcaada. Biology Microgastrinae are koinobiont, primary endoparasitoids of larval Lepidoptera. While most species are solitary, many are gregarious, meaning multiple wasp eggs develop within the same caterpillar. When the eggs hatch the wasp larvae feed on the hemolymph and organs of their host. Once fully developed, the larvae exit the dying caterpillar and immediately spin silken cocoons where they pupate. Microgastrinae is one of six subfamilies of Braconidae which carry polydnaviruses. More than 100 species of Microgastrinae have been used in biological control programs. = Coevolution with polydnaviruses = Microgastrinae need the virus to be able to reproduce. How it is exactly done is by injecting eggs with the proviral genome plus virions into the host's cavity. The virions then infect and discharge their DNA into the host's cells, stopping it from killing the wasp's offspring and instead promoting its growth inside the host's body.

This penitentiary was closed in 1979 by Rodrigo Carazo's administration leaving the building empty and abandoned and haunted for several years. In 1991, the then First Lady Gloria Bejarano Almada, wife of President Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n, created (\\"Help Us to Help Foundation\\" in English), to promote the Center's creation, which was inaugurated on April 27, 1994. Some sections of the building such as the fa√ßade and the walls of the west wing were proclaimed historical and architectural heritage of Costa Rica in 1988. The Center's stated mission is to strengthen education and promote the national scientific and technological development.  Museo de los Ni√±os  (literally \\"Children's Museum\\" in Spanish) is an interactive museum that focuses on the education and entertainment of kids of all ages. It was inaugurated in 1994 as part of the Center, and forms the best-known part of it.  National Auditorium  The National Auditorium was conceived as a stage for all art forms. It has a lighting system, an acoustic shell, an orchestra pit, satellite communications, possibility for simultaneous translations in up to four languages and 526 seats. The auditorium has hosted several concerts of classical music, literary contests, beauty contests, audiovisuals, conferences, seminars, scientific and cultural congresses, and theater productions.  National Gallery  The National Gallery, whose stated mission is to \\"bring democracy to art\\", was also inaugurated in 1994. It has fourteen galleries in two levels. These contain several artistic (photography, ceramics, craftsmanship, hand drawing, and graphic design), scientific, technological, and technical exhibits of both Costa Rican and international origin.  Complejo Juvenil  Complejo Juvenil (\\"Youth Complex\\" in Spanish) was inaugurated in 1999 as the fourth addition to the Center. Aimed to young people between 10 and 20 years of age, it has a library, news archive, map room, A/V room and other educational elements, as well as a computer lab. In the future it will also house a museum about the Central Penitentiary, where the former prison's history will be reconstructed in a dynamic way.

After graduation, he became the business manager for his father's newspaper. He also played first baseman for the Eagle Juniors, an amateur baseball team in Louisville.Cook, p. 157 1877 baseball season On July 3, 1877, while Haldeman was reporting on the Louisville Grays baseball team, he made his only appearance in a Major League game. Louisville shortstop Bill Craver was unable to play in the game, and Grays manager Jack Chapman decided to move second baseman Joe Gerhardt to shortstop and ask Haldeman to play second base. Haldeman did not manage a hit in four at bats against Cincinnati Red Stockings pitcher Candy Cummings, but he did sacrifice teammate Orator Shafer to third base in the sixth inning; Shafer scored later in the inning. Haldeman also committed three errors in the field. The game marked the only time in baseball history that a reporter covering a team played in the game they were covering.Cook, p. 98 The Grays were having an excellent season until a seven-game losing streak in late August, prompting Haldeman to write a column in the Courier-Journal questioning the reason for the team's slide.Cook, p. 118 The poor play continued on a road trip later in the season, causing the team to fall out of first place in the league and lose the pennant race. This prompted Haldeman to question the performance of players such as pitcher Jim Devlin, who he claimed had not used his best pitch during the entire road trip. He also openly questioned whether the team had deliberately thrown the pennant race. Haldeman's accusations eventually gained traction, and four players - Devlin, Craver, Al Nichols, and George Hall - were found to have thrown games.Cook, p. 135 Later life and death On September 7, 1887, Haldeman married Anna Buchanan, who was the great-great-granddaughter of Kentucky pioneer William Whitley. The couple had three daughters: Jean Bruce (Haldeman) Wendling, Bessie Avery Haldeman, and Isabel Brown Haldeman.

The storm was deemed the worst ice storm in a decade for New England and the most severe ice storm in 21 years for Upstate New York. Damage was primarily a result of fallen trees and fallen utility wires and poles, which were coated in a heavy layer of ice. The storm raised heavy controversy over the slow return of power, as at the storm's peak as many as 1.7 million customers were without power. Days after the storm more than 800,000 customers were still without power. Almost a week after the storm still more than 100,000 customers were without power, affecting the holiday shopping season and crippling the business and transportation of many northeast cities for days. Response The storm resulted in a state of emergency being declared by Governor David Paterson in sixteen counties in New York. Up to 300,000 utility customers lost service in New York's Capital District. By Sunday evening, 14 December, 126,000 were still estimated to be without power. Fire departments in Albany and Rensselaer County ran non-stop all weekend answering calls ranging from fires to wires down. It is estimated that both counties received tens of thousands of calls by the Saturday after the storm. In Massachusetts up to one million residents and businesses lost power due to the storm, causing Governor Deval Patrick to declare a state of emergency and mobilize at least 500 National Guardsmen to help the clean-up efforts. Governors John Lynch of New Hampshire and John Baldacci of Maine also declared a state of emergency, and as of 13 December at least 400,000 customers were without power in New Hampshire, and at least 172,000 were without power in Maine. This total in New Hampshire was more than five times larger than those who lost power in the ice storm of 1998, previously the most devastating storm on record. It has also been reported that over 30,000 customers were without power in Vermont and up to 3,700 were without power in Connecticut. The American Red Cross of Northeastern New York opened multiple shelters around the Capital District to give residents a warm place to stay and eat. Fatalities At least four deaths were attributed to the storm. Three of them were due to carbon monoxide poisoning, the source of which were gas- powered generators that were used indoors. One carbon-monoxide-related death was in New Hampshire, and the other two were in New York. The fourth fatality occurred in Massachusetts. A public works employee was found in a reservoir after having gone missing when investigating damage to trees. Aftermath Hotels, hardware stores, malls, and restaurants that either had power or a generator saw a boom in business during the entire weekend as many residents went out to finish up holiday shopping, eat, and stay warm. Most schools closed on Friday 12 December, and some colleges ended the semester early due to the severity of the storm. Fourteen days after the storm hit, several thousand homes throughout New Hampshire were still without power, which in some cases resulted in threats being made against workers of Public Service Company of New Hampshire (a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities), the principal electricity supplier of New Hampshire. Similarly, there were many people in Massachusetts without power for up to two weeks, raising many questions about the slow response of some utility companies. Several weeks after the New England storm, a similar ice storm struck the Midwestern United States, knocking out power to a million people and leading to at least 38 deaths. Media and coverage The storm and its aftermath were covered extensively by local newspapers such as The Keene Sentinel and the Monadnock Ledger- Transcript in New Hampshire. Books detailing the storm's toll include The Weight of the Ice by David Eisenstadter, Black Ice compiled from various New Hampshire authors, and Ice by the staff of The Keene Sentinel.

The Escuela de Arquitectura de la Universidad de Costa Rica is the principal school of architecture in Costa Rica. It is part of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Costa Rica. History The School of Architecture of the University of Costa Rica was founded in 1971. Prior to that year, the few architects that were in the country, had studied mainly in M√©xico, Chile, and the United States, which means that construction was primarily regulated by civil engineers, who left their mark and perspective around the entire country, but with the insertion of many new architects, it is being reoriented toward a vision that is architectural in character. The first director of the School was the plastic artist Rafael √Ångel ‚ÄúFelo‚Äù Garc√≠a and the first architect graduated in Costa Rica is Ibo Bonilla Oconitrillo who has distinguished himself internationally in bioclimatic architecture and as a sculptor of the highest sculptures in the country.  Teaching methodology  The new school started with controversy given its innovative curriculum, different from the traditional, basing its focus of the architectonic object as a part of an urban process and creating results based on its consideration of the physical and cultural environment. Architects Jorge Bertheau, Rafael √Ångel Garc√≠a, and √âdgar Brenes implemented the teaching methodology based on integrated multidisciplinary studies, with emphasis on teamwork and real projects applied to specific communities. They obtained a scholarship to study the architecture in England.  Academic program  The career includes an academic program to obtain a degree in 5 years. Nevertheless, it is uncommon for a student to complete the degree within the 5 years along with the required thesis. The system is academically open, in that the student decides how many and what specific courses he wants to carry each semester. The primary axis of the career program is in the area of design. Thus, 10 workshops on design are imparted, within which the student is challenged with various kinds of design problems: that can go from designing a cafeteria to a high rise. Complementary to the area of design, there are theoretical courses (which deal with, but not limited to theory on architecture), supplementary subjects, which are required by the University of Costa Rica, such as courses in art, sports, humanities, history, etc.  Masters  ‚Ä¢ Urban Design: with a concentration on developing proposals consistent with urban design, focusing on the Latin American reality and the behaviors of its inhabitants. ‚Ä¢ Tropical Architecture: its intent is to address architecture from the reality of Costa Rica‚Äôs climate, which encompasses tropical zones, with huge contrasts temperatures and humidity. Also, part of the emphasis of this masters program, is the intent to guide the designer towards the bioclimatic trends of design. ‚Ä¢ Technology and Construction: its purpose is to guide the professionals towards an adequate use of technological tools applied to construction. It exposes the participants to the most recent innovations in the field, while simultaneously complementing the students formation with talks and additional materials. ‚Ä¢ Landscaping: it deals with the relationships among architecture, the human being, and the environment with a scope controlled and defined by man. It studies more deeply the diversity of plants and construction materials from a naturalistic orientation, and how these relate to a human environment.  Admission  There are various requirements: ‚Ä¢ Have completed secondary education, including the exams of the Ministry of Education of Costa Rica. ‚Ä¢ Have completed the admission exam of the University of Costa Rica, and have obtained on the exam, the required score needed to make it into the field of study (the score varies from year to year). ‚Ä¢ Pass the aptitude test from the School. Each year, about 1000 students who obtained the minimum score on the admission exam of the university, can enroll to take the aptitude test. Approximately 70 pass it and are admitted to study architecture.

NIST Enterprise Architecture Model (NIST EA Model) is a late-1980s reference model for enterprise architecture. It defines an enterprise architectureChief Information Officer Council (2001) A Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture Version 1.0 Preface. February 2001. by the interrelationship between an enterprise's business, information, and technology environments.The Chief Information Officers Council (1999). Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework Version 1.1. September 1999. Developed late-1980s by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and others, the federal government of the United States promoted this reference model in the 1990s as the foundation for enterprise architectures of individual U.S. government agencies and in the overall federal enterprise architecture.  Intro  The NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is a five-layered model for enterprise architecture, designed for organizing, planning, and building an integrated set of information and information technology architectures. The five layers are defined separately but are interrelated and interwoven. The model defined the interrelation as follows: * Business Architecture drives the information architecture * Information architecture prescribes the information systems architecture * Information systems architecture identifies the data architecture * Data Architecture suggests specific data delivery systems, and * Data Delivery Systems (Software, Hardware, Communications) support the data architecture. The hierarchy in the model is based on the notion that an organization operates a number of business functions, each function requires information from a number of source, and each of these sources may operate one or more operation systems, which in turn contain data organized and stored in any number of data systems.John O'Looney (2002). Wiring Governments: Challenges and Possibilities for Public Managers. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.67.  History  The NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is initiated in 1988 in the fifth workshop on Information Management Directions sponsored by the NIST in cooperation with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the IEEE Computer Society, and the Federal Data Management Users Group (FEDMUG). The results of this research project were published as the NIST Special Publication 500-167, Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge.Elizabeth N. Fong and Alan H. Goldfine (1989) Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 500-167, September 1989. = The emerging field of information management = With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management had taken a new light, and also began to include the field of data maintenance. No longer was information management a simple job that could be performed by almost anyone. An understanding of the technology involved, and the theory behind it became necessary. As information storage shifted to electronic means, this became more and more difficult. ANSI/X3/SPARC three level architecture, which determined three levels to model data.Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). High Quality Data Models. The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE). One of the first overall approaches to building information systems and systems information management from the 1970s was the three-schema approach. It proposes to use three different views in systems development, in which conceptual modelling is considered to be the key to achieving data integration:STRAP SECTION 2 APPROACH. Retrieved 30 September 2008. * External schema for user views * Conceptual schema integrates external schemata * Internal schema that defines physical storage structures At the center, the conceptual schema defines the ontology of the concepts as the users think of them and talk about them. The physical schema according to Sowa (2004) \\"describes the internal formats of the data stored in the database, and the external schema defines the view of the data presented to the application programs\\".John F. Sowa (2004). \\"The Challenge of Knowledge Soup,\\" in: Research Trends in Science, Technology and Mathematics Education. Edited by J. Ramadas & S. Chunawala, Homi Bhabha Centre, Mumbai, 2006. Since the 1970s the NIST had held a series of four workshops on Database and Information Management Directions. Each of the workshops addresses a specific theme:Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 5) * \\"What information about database technology does the manager need to make prudent decisions about using new technology\\", in 1975. * \\"What information can help a manager assess the impact on a database system?\\" in 1977. * \\"Information management tools from the standpoint of: uses; policies and controls; logical and physical database design\\" in 1980; and * \\"The nature of information resource management practice and problems\\" in 1985. The fifth workshop in 1989 was held by the National Computer Systems Laboratory (NCSL) of the NIST. By then this was one of the four institutes, that performed the technical work of the NIST. The specific goal of the NCSL was to conduct research and provide scientific and technical services to aid Federal agencies in the selection, acquisition, application, and use of computer technology.Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. i) = NIST workshop on Information Management Directions = The fifth Information Management Directions workshop in 1989 focused on integration and productivity in information management. Five working groups considered specific aspects of the integration of knowledge, data management, systems planning, development and maintenance, computing environments, architectures and standards. Participants came from academia, industry, government and consulting firms. Among the 72 participants were Tom DeMarco, Ahmed K. Elmagarmid, Elizabeth N. Fong, Andrew U. Frank,Frank, Andrew U. Research Group Geoinformation, Vienna. Accessed July 15, 2013. Robert E. Fulton,David Terraso (2004) \\"Robert Fulton, 72, dies: Engineering professor and county commissioner\\". at whistle.gatech.edu Alan H. Goldfine,Alan H. Goldfine at DBLP. Dale L. Goodhue,Dale Goodhue at DBLP. Richard J. Mayer, Shamkant Navathe, T. William Olle, W. Bradford Rigdon, Judith A. Quillard, Stanley Y. W. Su,Stanley Y. W. Su at DBLP. and John Zachman. Tom DeMarco delivered the keynote speech, claiming that standards do more harm than good when they work against the prevailing culture, and that the essence of standardization is discovery, not innovation.Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. ix) The five working groups met to discuss different aspects of integration: * the integration of knowledge and data management * the integration of technical and business data management * the integration of systems planning, development, and maintenance tools and methods * the integration of distributed, heterogeneous computing environments, and * architectures and standards. In the third working group on systems planning was chaired by John Zachman, and adopted the Zachman Framework as a basis for discussion. Model of Enterprise Architecture, 1989 The fifth working group on architectures and standards was chaired W. Bradford Rigdon of the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Company (MDISC), a division of McDonnell Douglas. Rigdon et al. (1989) W. Bradford Rigdon (1989) \\"Architectures and Standards\\". In: Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge. E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds.). NIST Sept 1989. p. 135-150 explained that discussions about architecture in that time mostly focus on technology concerns. Their aim was to \\"takes a broader view, and describes the need for an enterprise architecture that includes an emphasis on business and information requirements. These higher level issues impact data and technology architectures and decisions.\\"Rigdon (1989), p. 136 In order to do so, the working group addressed three issues:Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 136) * The levels of architecture in an enterprise * Problems addressed by architecture * Benefits and risks of having architecture To illustrate the levels of architecture, what has become known as the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model, was presented (see image). In this concept the three layers of the three- schema approach are divided into five layers. = Application in the 1990s = In a way the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model was ahead of his time. According to Zachman (1993) in the 1980s the \\"architecture\\" was acknowledged as a topic of interest, but there was still little consolidated theory concerning this concept.J.A Zachman (1993) Concepts for Framework for EA - Enterprise Architecture Resources. Zachman International, Inc. paper. p. 1 Software architecture, for example. become an important topic not until the second half of the nineties.Leonor Barroca, Jon Hall and Patrick Hall (200) \\"An Introduction and History of Software Architectures, Components, and Reuse\\" in: Software Architectures, 2000 p. 1 To support the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model in the 1990s, it was widely promoted within the U.S. federal government as Enterprise Architecture management tool. The NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is applied as foundation in multiple Enterprise Architecture frameworks of U.S. Federal government agencies and in the overall Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework. In coordinating this effort the NIST model was further explained and extended in the 1997 \\"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\\" issued by the US Office of Management and Budget.,Franklin D. Raines, US OBM (1997) Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures) M-97-16, issued June 18, 1997. see further Information Technology Architecture.  NIST Enterprise Architecture Model topics  = Foundations = According to Rigdon et al. (1989) an architecture is \\"a clear representation of a conceptual framework of components and their relationship at a point in time\\".Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 136) It may for example represent \\"a view of a current situation with islands of automation, redundant processes and data inconsistencies\\"Rigdon (1989), p. 137 or a \\"future integrated automation information structure towards which the enterprise will move in a prescribed number on years.\\"Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 137-38) The role of standards in architecture is to \\"enable or constrain the architecture and serve as its foundation\\". In order to develop an enterprise architecture Rigdon acknowledge: * There are multiple ways to develop an architecture * There are multiple ways to implement standards * Development and implementation should be customized to the environment * Yet, every architecture itself can be divided into different levels. The different levels of an enterprise architecture can be visualized as a pyramid: On top the business unit of an enterprise, and at the bottom the delivery system within the enterprise. The enterprise can consist of one or more business units, working in specific business area. The five levels of architecture are defined as: Business Unit, Information, Information System, Data and Delivery System. The separate levels of an enterprise architecture are interrelated in a special way. On every level the architectures assumes or dictates the architectures at the higher level. The illustration on the right gives an example of which elements can constitute an Enterprise Architecture. Sample elements of an Enterprise Architecture (1989). = Levels of architecture = Each layer of architecture in the model has a specific intention:Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 139-140) * Business Architecture level: This level can picture the total or a subunit of any corporation, which are in contact with external organizations. * Information architecture level: This level specifies types of content, presentation forms, and format of the information required. * Information systems architecture level: Specifications for automated and procedure-oriented information systems. * Data Architecture level: Framework for maintenance, access and use of data, with data dictionary and other naming conventions. * Data Delivery Systems level: Technical implementation level of software, hardware, and communications that support the data architecture. Some sample elements of how the Enterprise Architecture can be described in more detail is shown in the illustration. = Information Technology Architecture = The \\"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\\" gave the following definition of enterprise architecture: :The Enterprise Architecture is the explicit description of the current and desired relationships among business and management process and information technology. It describes the \\"target\\" situation which the agency wishes to create and maintain by managing its IT portfolio. :The documentation of the Enterprise Architecture should include a discussion of principles and goals.Examples of published architectural \\"frameworks\\" include the Treasury Information System Architecture Framework (TISAF), the US Department of Defense Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), and the Department of Energy's Information Architecture Volume 1. For example, the agency's overall management environment, including the balance between centralization and decentralization and the pace of change within the agency, should be clearly understood when developing the Enterprise Architecture. Within that environment, principles and goals set direction on such issues as the promotion of interoperability, open systems, public access, end-user satisfaction, and security. In this guidance the five component model of the NIST was adopted and further explained. Agencies were permitted to identify different components as appropriate and to specify the organizational level at which specific aspects of the components will be implemented. Although the substance of these components, sometimes called \\"architectures\\" or \\"sub- architectures,\\" must be addressed in every agency's complete Enterprise Architecture, agencies have great flexibility in describing, combining, and renaming the components, which consist of: * Business Processes: This component of the Enterprise Architecture describes the core business processes which support the organization's missions. The Business Processes component is a high-level analysis of the work the agency performs to support the organizations's mission, vision, and goals, and is the foundation of the ITA. Analysis of the business processes determine the information needed and processed by the agency. This aspect of the ITA must be developed by senior program managers in conjunction with IT managers. Without a thorough understanding of its business processes and their relation to the agency missions, the agency will not be able to use its ITA effectively. Business processes can be described by decomposing the processes into derivative business activities. There are a number of methodologies and related tools available to help agencies decompose processes. Irrespective of the tool used, the model should remain at a high enough level to allow a broad agency focus, yet sufficiently detailed to be useful in decision-making as the agency identifies its information needs. Agencies should avoid excessive emphasis on modeling business processes, which can result in a waste of agency resources.The US Department of Defense includes aspects of the Business Processes element in its Operational Architecture; the US Department of Treasury incorporates it into its business view. * Information Flows and Relationships: This component analyzes the information utilized by the organization in its business processes, identifying the information used and the movement of the information within the agency. The relationships among the various flows of information are described in this component. These information flows indicate where the information is needed and how the information is shared to support mission functions.The US Department of Agriculture has incorporated this component into its Business Architecture, while the US Department of Defense and Treasury have built it into their Operational Architectures. * Applications : The Applications component identifies, defines, and organizes the activities that capture, manipulate, and manage the business information to support mission operations. It also describes the logical dependencies and relationships among business activities.The US Department of Energy incorporates Business Applications into its Applications Subarchitecture, while the US Department of Treasury includes them in its Functional Architecture. * Data Descriptions: This component of the Enterprise Architecture identifies how data is maintained, accessed, and used. At a high level, agencies define the data and describe the relationships among data elements used in the agency's information systems. The Data Descriptions and Relationships component can include data models that describe the data underlying the business and information needs of the agency. Clearly representing the data and data relationships is important for identifying data that can be shared corporately, for minimizing redundancy, and for supporting new applicationsThe US Department of Agriculture has included in this element in its Business/Data Architecture, while the US Department of Treasury incorporates it in its Information Architecture. * Technology Infrastructure : The Technology Infrastructure component describes and identifies the physical layer including, the functional characteristics, capabilities, and interconnections of the hardware, software, and communications, including networks, protocols, and nodes. It is the \\"wiring diagram\\" of the physical IT infrastructure.The US Department of Agriculture had incorporated this architecture into its Technical Standard and Telecommunications Architectures. US DoD uses its System Architecture, and US Treasury its Infrastrucsture to describe the physical layer. With the exception of the Business Processes component, the interrelationships among and priorities of these components are not prescribed by this guidance; there is no hierarchy of relationships implied. Furthermore, agencies should document not only their current environment for each of these components, but also the target environment that is desired.  Applications  FDIC EA Framework.OIG (2005).

No relation (or a distant relation) to the empresario Stephen Austin, John was born to John Punderson Austin and Susan Rogers Austin in New Haven, Connecticut. He initially also bore the middle name Punderson but apparently ceased using it, as it appears on none of his Texan records. John found work as a sailor and joined the Long expedition in New Orleans in 1819. Captured and imprisoned in Mexico, John later returned to Texas and joined Stephen Austin's colony, befriending him and becoming constable of his settlement at San Felipe de Austin. He was joined in Texas by his brother William. Stephen provided the capital for John's cotton gin on Buffalo Bayou, and his brother James opened a store with John in Brazoria, Texas. Involved through his business with the coasting trade, John became the port officer in 1831 and alcalde for Brazoria the next year. He was also the delegate for Victoria at the Convention of 1832, signed the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, and following his command at Velasco was elected brigadier general of the Texian militia. John Austin died with his two children in a cholera epidemic at Gulf Prairie. His wife Elizabeth married Thomas Parrott in 1834, returning the upper half of John's Buffalo Bayou grant to his father.

(BEDCO) was a venture capital firm which focused on investments in information technology, communications, and healthcare/biotechnology companies. BEDCO was one of the first venture capital firm to set up a bi-coastal operation with a presence in both Boston, Massachusetts and Silicon Valley in California. The firm was founded in 1979 and dissolved in 1996, with Alta Partners and Alta Communications assuming management responsibility for certain existing investments. Other successor firms include Polaris Venture Partners and Alta Berkeley. History The firm was founded in 1979 by Craig Burr, William P. Egan, and Dr. Jean Deleage, Ph.D. Burr and Egan had worked together at the pioneering private equity firm TA Associates. Deleage had come from Sofinnova Partners, a venture capital firm in France that he had co-founded in 1971. In 1976, Deleage had founded Sofinnova‚Äôs US affiliate, based in San Francisco. At its zenith the company managed over $700 million in assets and today is the direct predecessor of four venture capital firms with aggregate capital in excess of $5.7 billion: * Polaris Venture Partners based in Waltham, Massachusetts * Alta Partners based in California * Alta Communications based in Boston * Alta Berkeley Capital based in London. Among BEDCO‚Äôs most notable investments were Continental Cablevision with H. Irving Grousbeck, Qwest with Philip Anschutz, Cephalon, American Superconductor and SyQuest Technology.

One of the contributing factors in the dissolution was the departure of three of BEDCO‚Äôs junior partners, Jon Flint, Terry McGuire, Steve Arnold (Venture Capitalist). The three founders, left BEDCO in 1995 and began raising their first independent venture capital fund. Today, Polaris Venture Partners is a venture capital firm specializing in seed and early stage investments particularly in companies engaged in the information technology and life sciences sectors. Polaris is based in Waltham, Massachusetts with an additional office in Seattle, Washington. Since 1995, Polaris has raised five venture capital funds with over $2.6 billion of investor commitments. To date, all of the Polaris funds have been above average performers for their respective vintage years. Polaris Venture Partners V, which was closed in 2006, raised $1 billion of investor commitments. =Alta Partners= Alta Partners was founded by BEDCO co-founder Dr. Jean Deleage, Ph.D., along with Garrett Gruener, a former partner at BEDCO. Today, the firm, which is based in San Francisco, invests in biotechnology and life science companies and has made over 130 investments since its separation from BEDCO. Since 1996, Alta has raised eight venture capital funds including four funds in its Alta California Funds series, three funds in its Alta Biopharma Partners series and most recently in 2006, Alta raised Alta Partners VIII with $500 million of investor commitments =Alta Communications= Alta Communications was founded by BEDCO co-founders Craig Burr and William P. Egan. Today the firm, which is based in Waltham, Massachusetts (just outside Boston), invests primarily in later-stage opportunities in the traditional media and telecommunications sectors. Since 1996, Alta Communications has raised four venture capital funds with over $1.4 billion of investor commitments. =Alta Berkeley= Alta Berkeley was formed from BEDCO‚Äôs European operations. In 1982, Bryan Wood, who had been working in corporate finance in Britain, partnered with BEDCO to establish a presence in Europe. Today, Alta Berkeley makes early stage investments in technology companies based in Europe and Israel. Alta Berkeley's sixth and most recent fund raised approximately $145 million of investor commitments. References *A Generation Gap in Venture Capital *Gupta, Udayan.

Rushbury was an official war artist during World War I, and took up etching and drypoint under the influence of Francis Dodd before studying briefly under Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Art in 1921. He was elected a member of the New English Art Club in 1917, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers in 1921, the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1922, and the Royal Academy in 1936. Shipbuilding, Glasgow (1944) In 1940 he was again appointed an official war artist until 1945. Around 1943 the owner of a Port Glasgow shipyard, James Lithgow, complained to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, about Stanley Spencer's portrayal of his shipyard. WAAC duly commissioned Rushbury to go to Port Glasgow and produce some rather more conventional views of shipbuilding for Lithgow. In 1949, he was elected Keeper of the Royal Academy and Head of the Royal Academy Schools, a post he held until 1964. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1964 New Year Honours. There is a memorial to Rushbury in St James's Church, Piccadilly, London.

The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio) is the national institute for biodiversity and conservation in Costa Rica. Created at the end of the 1980s, and despite having national status, it is a privately run institution that works closely with various government agencies, universities, business sector and other public and private entities inside and outside of the country.What is INBio? Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad. 13 Apr. 2007. The goals of the institute are to complete an inventory of the natural heritage of Costa Rica, promote conservation and identify chemical compounds and genetic material present in living organisms that could be used by industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics or others. The institute has a collection of over three million insects representing tens of thousands of species all recorded in Atta, a computer database that contains all of the data such as exact location (including GPS coordinates), date of collection, name of the collector and method of collection. Due to impending insolvency, in March 2015, the INBio's biodiversity collection and database will be taken over by the state Soto M., Michelle (2015).

INBioparque mantendr√° sus puertas abiertas in La Nacion (San Jose). 27 February. INBio will move forward as a \\"think tank\\" type institute with money raised from transfer of most of its assets to the government.  History  Costa Rica decided in 1989 that some sort of organization was necessary to study the biodiversity of Costa Rica. The government did not have the ability at the time to fund a new organization so a handful of scientists and entrepreneurs took the initiative and created the non-profit organization now known as INBio. Among the founders of the institution was Rodrigo G√°mez, a remarkable and well known Costa Rican scientist who has a strong desire for teaching people about the importance of biodiversity and its conservation. He received the MAG√ìN award (Premio Nacional de Cultura Mag√≥n) in 2012, which is an award of great importance that is given every year to someone who has contributed to Costa Rica, in this case related to science. In that same year he received an international award known as the MIDORI prize, given to him in Japan, by a Japanese institution; he has also received a great number of other awards in the past. Rodrigo G√°mez is still president at the institution. In 1995 INBio was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research.  Structure  There are many different components to INBio such as Bio-prospecting, INBioparque, INBio editorial, and the many different research areas such as arthropods, fungi, and plants. Bio- prospecting is the division dealing with finding useful products from the specimens collected. INBio has worked with organizations such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.G√°mez, Rodrigo. \\"Algunos Resultados Del Trabajo Conjuto\\". Alianza INBio-SINAC. August 2000. INBioparque is a natural park in Santo Domingo, Heredia, just north/east of downtown San Jose in Costa Rica. The research programs vary from studying the spider family Oonopidae to compiling a book with all of the genera of known and described flies in Central America. Such a project has never been done in a tropical place with such a large biodiversity.  Areas of activity  The Institute's work has chiefly developed in the following areas: =Inventory and monitoring= Generating information on the diversity of the country's species and ecosystems. It currently owns a collection of more than 3 million specimens, each identified and cataloged, including arthropods, plants, fungi and mollusks. Furthermore, information on the country's different ecosystems is generated. =Conservation= Integrating the information generated by INBio into decision-making processes for the protection and sustainable use of its biodiversity, for both the public and private sectors. INBio works closely with SINAC (Sistema de √Åreas de Conservaci√≥n; Conservation Areas System), being considered a strategic partner in the protection of the country's protected areas. =Communication and education= Sharing information and understanding of biodiversity with different sectors of the public, seeking to create a wider knowledge of its value. Most of this effort is centered in the INBiopark, a theme-park opened in 2000 which aims to bring families and visitors closer to the rich Costa Rican nature. Furthermore, through other methods INBio looks to strengthen the environmental component of the Costa Rican population's actions and decisions. =Bioinformatics= Developing and applying technological tools to support the process of generation, administration, analysis and dissemination of information on biodiversity. The information on each specimen in the biodiversity inventory can be found in a database named Atta, accessible to the public through INBio's webpage. =Bioprospecting= Searching for sustainable, commercially applicable uses of the resources of biodiversity. INBio has been a pioneering institution in establishing research agreements for the search for chemical substances, genes, etc., present in plants, insects, marine organisms and microorganisms, which could be used by the pharmaceutical, medical, biotechnology, cosmetics, nutritional and agricultural industries. INBio, although it is a national initiative given its scope, has become an international force for trying to integrate conservation and development. The application of scientific knowledge of biodiversity to economic activities such as ecotourism, medicine, agriculture or the development of mechanisms of collection and payment for environmental services exemplify this force for integration, and are part of the activities which attract the attention of the international community.

The TEAF represents the second-generation framework for Treasury. TISAF was the first-generation framework.US Department of the Treasury Chief Information Officer Council (2000). Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework . Version 1, July 2000.  Overview  The Treasury Information System Architecture Framework (TISAF) consists of a list of goals and objectives for planning Treasury information technology a set of architectural principles for developing information systems, an EISA model for describing distinct views of enterprise information systems, and a set of standards for guiding specific product selection. The EISA model provides four architectural views to organize, plan, and build enterprise information systems, consisting of the Information, Functional, and Work architectures and the Infrastructure.  History  TISAF incorporated elements from the C4ISR Architecture Framework, which was developed by the Mitre Corporation from 1994 on.Janis Putman (2001) Architecting With Rm-Odp. p. 719 In January 1997, US Department of the Treasury issued TISAF Version 1, consisting of three volumes: * the Treasury Information Systems Architecture Framework, * Treasury Architecture Development Guidance, and * the Treasury Architecture Development Process. In July 1997, the Treasury issued additional guidance to complement Treasury Information System Architecture Framework (TISAF). This guidance, which was finalized in September 1997, provides \\"how to\\" processes for developing an information systems architecture in accordance with TISAF.United States General Accounting Office (US GOA) (1998).

The TEAF represents a revision to TISAF and incorporated elements of FEAF.Mark G. Mykityshyn (2007) Assessing the Maturity of Information Architectures for Complex Dynamic Enterprise Systems. p. 77 It was the result of an evaluation of Department and bureau experiences in applying and using the TISAF, and emerging best practices from other government organizations and industry. TEAF is intended to emphasize the broader scope of the architecture framework, which includes both business and technical vantage points within an enterprise-wide perspective. The TEAF includes descriptions of a common suite of work products for documenting and modeling EAs. These work products align with FEAF models and with Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) products.  TISAF building blocks  = Departmentwide architecture framework = According to TISAF, a complete architecture has the following four components, each representing a different perspective or view of the agency: * Functional: A representation of what the organization does (i.e., its mission and business processes) and how the organization can use information systems to support its business operations. * Work: A description of where and by whom information systems are to be used throughout the agency. * Information: A description of what information is needed to support business operations. * Infrastructure: A description of the hardware and \\"services\\" (e.g., software and telecommunications) needed to implement information systems across the agency. TISAF's functional, work, and information components together form the logical view of the architecture, while its infrastructure represents the technical view of the architecture. = Top-down approach = To develop and evolve systems that effectively support business functions, a top-down process must be followed. The logical architecture (e.g., business functions and information flows) is defined first and then used to specify supporting systems (e.g., interfaces, standards, and protocols). Treasury endorses this top-down approach. Treasury officials responsible for developing and implementing TISAF stated that development of the architecture begins with defining and describing the agency's major business functions. Once this is accomplished, the agency can identify the relationships among the functions, the information needed to perform the functions, the users and locations of the functions, and the existing and needed applications and related information technology required to execute and support the business functions. According to Treasury guidance, the architecture's infrastructure component (i.e., its systems specifications and standards) should be derived from the other three components. In addition, the guidance states that each element of the architecture must be integrated and traceable, and the relationships between them must be explicit. = TISAF Architecture = The Information Architecture is the \\"what\\" of information systems which defines and organizes all information needed to perform business operations and describes the relationships among this information. The Functional Architecture is the \\"how\\" of information systems which defines and organizes the business functions, processes, or activities that capture, manipulate, and manage the business information to support business operations. The Work Architecture is the \\"where\\" of information systems which depicts the decentralization of the business, the description of the work organizations to business locations, and the communications and coordination between these locations. The Infrastructure is the \\"enabler\\" of information systems which describes the supporting services, computing platforms, and internal and external interfaces needed to provide technology environments within which information systems run. To provide a context for discussing technical standards, a Technical Reference Model (TRM) is developed to organize and depict building blocks of an information system as a set of services categorized by functional areas.  TISAF 1997 to TEAF 2000  Key changes from TISAF 1997 to Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) 2000 are summarized below: * The Principles have been revamped * The Work Architecture is renamed to Organizational View * The order of the TEAF Matrix columns has been changed to: Functional, Information, Organizational, and Infrastructure * The TISAF Matrix rows have been renamed in the TEAF Matrix to: Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder * Work products have been revamped * The concept of essential vs. supporting work products has been introduced * The TISAF Technical Reference Model has been removed.

The degree conferred at this institution was L.I.M. 1947 In accordance to the recommendations of the Usman Committee, Chopra Committee and the Pundit Committee of Government of Madras and Government of India, the character of the institute was changed, upgraded and named as College of Indian Medicine. The college gave the degree as G.C.I.M. 1948 The college was again renamed as College of Indigenous Medicine and one of the three systems of Indigenous Medicine, Ayurvedha- Siddha-Unani, should be chosen by each candidate who joins GCIM and Allopathic Medicine was common to all. 1953 The college was renamed as the College of Integrated Medicine. The course was shortened to 4.5 years and one year of compulsory house-surgeoncy on par with MBBS course. Government ensured that the GCIM graduates could practice both the systems of medicine. In 1959 the first batch of GCIM students were admitted and in 1960 the College of Indigenous Medicine was closed. 1960 The Integrated Medicine Course (MBBS degree) was started. The first and second year GCIM students were given the option of joining the MBBS course, while the senior students were offered the D.M&S; on completion of the course and bringing them into the allopathic fold. 1965 The college was recognised as Women Medical College and named as Government Kilpauk Medical College, admitting only women candidates for MBBS degree. Meanwhile, those who had completed GCIM, D.M&S; were given the option to undertake condensed MBBS course at the Chengalpattu Medical College to obtain the MBBS degree and come into the fold of modern medicine. 1967 The women students agitated to have a co-educational institution and the erstwhile Government of Madras granted permission. Both men and women were admitted to the MBBS degree from 1967. 1972 Development of the Medical College was set into pace with the Surgical Block coming into being. Later all the different super-specialities came into being between 1972 and 2001. 1981 Intensive Care Unit was sanctioned with 10 beds and was commissioned in June 1981 by Hon. Dr. H.V. Hande, the Minister for Health, Government of Tamil Nadu. A 50 bedded comprehensive burn unit was sanctioned on the I floor of the out-Patient Block and was commissioned in March 1985 by Hon.

It was authorized in 1742 by the then Province of Maryland to provide a Chapel of Ease for early inhabitants of the Garrison Forest. History It was authorized in 1742 by the Province of Maryland to provide a \\"Chapel of Ease\\" for early inhabitants of the Garrison Forest. Rev. Thomas Craddock was appointed first minister on January 14, 1745. On April 13, 1782, The Rev. John Andrews returned to Maryland from York, Pennsylvania to become rector of the church, known at the time as St. Thomas Church in Garrison Forest, a position he held until 1784. Early members included, Christopher Gist, John Eager Howard (for whom the nearby Howard County is named), Sequoyah, and his mother, Wut-teh. Architecture The original building, built in 1743 of salmon red brick, was a 56 x 36 foot (17 x 11m) rectangle. Eight windows with round arch tops lighted the building, four on each of the long walls. These retain much of their original 1743 glass. There were also three similar windows on the short liturgical west wall and a small window near the peak of the roof. (The building sits on an angle, so that liturgical west is actually southwest.) The entrance was in the liturgical south wall. It had a wide, brick paved, center aisle and white box pews, both of which remain.Photo on In the late 19th century, the door in the south wall was removed and an entrance created by removing the center window from the west wall. In 1891 transepts and a small, barrel shaped, chancel were added, changing the simple rectangle into a cruciform. There are lancet windows in the east end, one created by John LaFarge depicting the Ascension. A Tiffany window was added later. The transepts have rose windows in yellow, brown, green and colourless glass.available here. In 1970, a major restoration of the church was accomplished. This included the addition of a narthex to the liturgical west, providing access both to the church and to a new basement.

He is the founding figure in the contemporary school of cultural sociology referred to as the \\"strong program\\". Career He was born May 30, 1947, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Alexander gained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1969 and his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978. Alexander was one of the few students not to have received any financial assistance upon admission to Berkeley. He was originally interested in Marxist sociology and worked with Fred Block, but evolved to a democratic socialist, then left liberal position. Later he worked with Neil Smelser, Robert N. Bellah, and Leo Lowenthal. Each of whom were on his dissertation committee, with the chair being Bellah, a former student of Talcott Parsons. Alexander's dissertation, Theoretical Logic in Sociology, was published as a four-volume set. Volume 1 was subtitled Positivism, Presuppositions, and Current Controversies, Volume 2 was The Antimonies of Classical Thought: Marx and Durkheim, Volume 3 was The Classical Attempt at Theoretical Synthesis: Max Weber, and Volume 4 was subtitled The Modern Reconstruction of Classical Thought: Talcott Parsons. At the time, many theorists were attempting to revive Parsons after a decade of criticisms, and Alexander's Theoretical Logic in Sociology was part of this revival. He worked at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1974 until joining Yale University in 2001, where (as of 2008) he is the Lillian Chavenson Saden Professor of Sociology and co-Director of the Center for Cultural Sociology. Alexander has authored or co-authored ten books. He was one of the editors of the journal Sociological Theory,Wiley-Blackwell: Sociological Theory index page (accessed 20 December 2008) and he is currently co-editor of the American Journal of Cultural Sociology. He received honorary doctorates from La Trobe University, Melbourne and the University College Dublin, Ireland. In 2004, he won the Clifford Geertz Award for Best Article in Cultural Sociology and in 2008, he won the Mary Douglas Prize for Best Book in Cultural Sociology. He also received the 2007 Theory Prize from the Theory Section of the American Sociological Association for best theoretical article. In 2009, he received The Foundation Mattei Dogan Prize in Sociology by the International Sociological Association, awarded every four years in recognition of lifetime accomplishments to \\"a scholar of very high standing in the profession and of outstanding international reputation.\\" Notable students of Jeffrey Alexander include Ronald Jacobs, Philip Smith, Isaac Reed, Matthew Norton, and Elizabeth Breese. Neofunctionalism In sociology, neofunctionalism represents a revival of the thought of Talcott Parsons by Jeffrey C. Alexander, who sees neofunctionalism as having five central tendencies: *to create a form of functionalism that is multidimensional and includes micro as well as macro levels of analysis *to push functionalism to the left and reject Parsons's optimism about modernity *to argue for an implicit democratic thrust in functional analysis *to incorporate a conflict orientation, and *to emphasize uncertainty and interactional creativity. While Parsons consistently viewed actors as analytical concepts, Alexander defines action as the movement of concrete, living, breathing persons as they make their way through time and space. In addition he argues that every action contains a dimension of free will, by which he is expanding functionalism to include some of the concerns of symbolic interactionism. The cultural turn and the strong program Starting in the late 1980s, Alexander's work turned toward cultural sociology. Key to this cultural turn was a shift in emphasis from an engagement with Parsonian structural functionalism toward a rereading of Emile Durkheim's later works, which featured a strong interest in cultural systems. Durkheim's Elementary Forms of Religious Life was key to Alexander's thought, as in this work Durkheim analyzes the ways by which collective representations emerge and function, as well as the role of rituals in maintaining solidarity and reiterating society's norms and values to the congregation. Alexander picks up specifically on Durkheim's suggestion that the religious processes observed in tribal societies are as pertinent in modern societies. Regardless of whether modern societies believe themselves to be rational and secular, their civil life and processes, claims Alexander, are underpinned by collective representations, by strong emotional ties and by various narratives that‚Äîmuch like tribal societies‚Äîtell society what it believes it is and what values it holds sacred. Alexander distinguishes between the sociology of culture and cultural sociology. The sociology of culture sees culture as a dependent variable‚Äîthat is, a product of extra-cultural factors such as the economy or interest-laden politics‚Äîwhereas cultural sociology sees culture as having more autonomy and gives more weight to inner meanings. In other words, in Alexander's conception of cultural sociology assumes that ideas and symbolic processes may have an independent effect on social institutions, on politics, and on culture itself. Alexander strongly distinguishes this sociological perspective from the then-dominant Bourdieusian sociological framework, which tends to see cultural processes as embedded in power struggles, and ultimately in material inequality. =Cultural trauma= Two of his earlier articles can be seen as precursors to his more direct engagement with the topic of trauma. In one, he demonstrates that the Holocaust was not immediately perceived as universally signifying universal evil for Western societies. Rather than that, it was constructed as such by way of a long process of narration and signification. In the second, he shows that the Watergate Crisis was originally not perceived by American society as much more than a minor incident. Here, too, the incident had to be culturally narrated and constructed as compromising the core values of American society, turning what was first thought to be a mundane faux-pas into a full-fledged scandal. A key claim of both studies is that even events that are currently thought of as deeply traumatic for civil society are not inherently devastating but are rather constructed as such through cultural processes. More generally, Alexander differentiates \\"cultural trauma\\" from what he calls \\"lay trauma\\" in social thought. \\"Lay trauma\\" refers to the idea that certain events are inherently traumatic to the individuals who experience them‚Äîfor example, the idea of trauma in psychology. However, \\"cultural trauma\\" approach cannot assume that any event‚Äîas horrendous as it may be‚Äîwill turn into a trauma for the collective who encounters it. As Alexander explains, \\"[C]ultural trauma occurs when members of a collectivity feel they have been subjected to a horrendous event that leaves indelible marks upon their group consciousness, marking their memories forever and changing their future identity in fundamental and irrevocable ways\\". =Social performance= In the mid-2000s Alexander turned attention toward the ways actors create social or cultural performances, which are \\"the social process[es] by which actors, individually or in concert, display for others the meaning of their social situation\\". Actors, claims Alexander, care deeply about having others believe the meanings they attempt to convey, and to this end they seek to create a performance as authentic-looking as possible. To do so, they engage in what Alexander calls \\"cultural pragmatics\\" and draw upon the various elements of social performance: the systems of collective representation, means of symbolic production, mise-en-sc√®ne arrangements (much like a theater production would). Alexander claims that in tribal societies the various elements of cultural performance were tightly fused, and were employed in collective rituals in which the entire tribe partook and its members experienced first-hand. In modern societies, these various elements became de-fused (as per Weber's sphere differentiation) and for this reason actors who wish to appear authentic must draw upon various repertoires. \\"Fusion\\", in Alexander's terms, is the moment in a performance when the various elements click together, generate an effective performance, and ultimately move the audience to psychological identification with the actors. A failed performance will be one that the audience will perceive as inauthentic, and will not develop the sense of identification the actors desired.See also . =Iconic consciousness= In recent years, Alexander has turned attention towards the material aspects of culture, extending his specific strand of cultural sociology towards aesthetics and particularly icons. As he defines it, iconic consciousness occurs \\"when an aesthetically shaped materiality signifies social value. Contact with this aesthetic surface, whether by sight, smell, taste, touch provides a sensual experience that transmits meaning ...\\". In contradistinction with various sociologies of culture that have tended to see the visual or the material as a form of falsity or degradation, Alexander draws on the Durkheimian notion of the symbolic collective representation to argue that the ways in which culture operates‚Äîboth in instilling and in recreating values‚Äîis intrinsically tied to symbolic material forms. Studies following Alexander's approach have looked, for example, into the ways in which architecture is embedded in a deep meaning structure and have deep emotional resonance with the society that frequents them. Others have extended the idea of iconic consciousness into the realm of celebrities, and have explored the ways in which celebrities on one hand present an appealing aesthetic \\"surface\\" and on the other hand condense and convey a locus of \\"deep\\" meanings that resonate with the audience. =Performative revolutions= Following the Egyptian Revolution, Alexander conducted a study of the revolutionary months from a cultural sociological point of view, applying some of his previous theories in order to understand the ways in which the various protests voiced by demonstrators, journalists, bloggers, and public actors ultimately persuaded the Egyptian army to turn against the regime. The key to understanding the revolution, claims Alexander, is in the binary structure these various actors applied to the Moubarak regime, persuasively depicting it as corrupt and outdated and thereby convincing the wider public that it was a menace to Egyptian society.

It was first distributed through a limited release by IFC Films on 12 December 2008. The title of the film is an old Italian saying that Stabile's father used to say about good places.  Plot  Frank Diaz (John Leguizamo), an unemployed boxer, and his family have been living in a homeless shelter for months when, finally, on Christmas Eve, comes word that an apartment may be available. However seeing that he doesn't hold a job \\"on the books\\" the social worker tells him it's not possible for him to get the apartment. Frank, at his wit's end, tells a story about his time in the army during the first Gulf War. This story causes the social worker to give Frank a chance to get the apartment, but must do so before the end of the day. Frank hits the cold streets of New York, his resentful stepson (David Castro) in tow, to somehow find a job so that his family can have a real home for Christmas morning. They search all over town in hopes of a job. In their search they grow closer together while also learning secrets about each other. On his first stop in search for a job he goes to a construction contractor he's worked for 'off the books' but is denied a booked job. Throughout the movie you see the old man (construction contractor's father) looking for Frank Diaz to give him a letter. Frank's efforts to find a job by six o'clock prove impossible. At one point he is offered a job painting a school, but the offer is withdrawn after a background check reveals a past felony. Further efforts to find a job prove futile and Frank, after being forced to shoplift to get new clothes, accidentally leaves the money he needs for the apartment in the discarded clothes and can't go back to get it or risk being arrested. Ultimately he runs out of time and takes his family out for dinner instead. His wife tries to get him to leave so she can sneak out without paying like she usually does, but he doesn't let her do it. Outside their homeless shelter, Frank spots the man who stole his jacket earlier in the film and in a fit of anger and frustration, beats the man up and retrieves his jacket. While no charges are filed, Frank's actions get the family kicked out of the shelter and desperate, his wife calls her abusive ex for a place to stay, but the son, Justin, refuses to go with him, choosing to stay with Frank. This causes his wife to change her mind as well. After checking another shelter and finding it full, the family heads for Brooklyn on a subway train to try a shelter there and play a game that they played before they became homeless. Music plays out as the fate of Frank and his family remain unknown to us. Yet his loss of the apartment stills gives a glib outcome for a family hit hard by poverty.  Reception  Lisa Schwartzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \\"Italian neorealism meets A Christmas Carol.\\" Nick Pinkerton of the Village Voice writes that Stabile \\"gets interesting scenes [...] though the movie's v√©rit√© is diluted by a cozy, adult-contemporary empathy with those less fortunate.\\"  References   External links  *Official site 2007 films 2007 drama films American films English-language films American drama films ","title":"Where God Left His Shoes"},{"id":"20699252","text":"Newcastle is a 2008 Australian drama film set in the city of Newcastle, in New South Wales.

History In 1713, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, gave 10,000 acres to his (fourth) wife Margaret, which ultimately became the My Lady's Manor historic district (in 1978). Settlement intensified later in the 18th century, with the development of the Monkton grist mill along the Gunpowder River. A chapel of ease was constructed, and, clergy from St. John's Parish in Joppatown visited periodically. 200px Maryland's legislature recognized St. James as a separate parish from St. John's (also called Copley Parish) in 1770. In 1773, Baltimore and Harford Counties split, with the Gunpowder River becoming the dividing line. Thus, both counties received parts of My Lady's Manor, with the port of Joppatowne securely in Harford County and thriving until silting of the Gunpowder River and development of larger ocean-going vessels made Baltimore the region's major port. The My Lady's Manor land was owned by descendants of scandal-plagued Thomas Brerewood, whose son had married (secretly) the daughter of the fourth Lord Baltimore, who had inherited it in 1731 and soon after emigrated to Maryland with her husband, who developed the land grant. Maryland's legislature confiscated the My Lady's Manor property during the American Revolutionary War and stored gunpowder in the church building (which remained standing). In 1782 the new state of Maryland sold the adjoining lands to tenant farmers, many of whose families still remain in the area.historical marker on site By 1795, the parish had approximately 1600 baptized members.http://www.saintjames.org/HistoryArchive/AnglicanHistory.html Monkton Road had been a major north-south route for Native Americans, as well as through the Revolutionary War. However, construction of a road between Baltimore and York, Pennsylvania in 1803, and westward migration inhibited development in this specific area, which remained rural. Still, the nearby town of Monkton became a station on the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad, which later merged into the Northern Central Railway and became a division of the Pennsylvania Railroad until the line was abandoned and ultimately converted into a bicycle and walking path, the Northern Central Railroad Trail. Architecture Construction of a 60x30 foot brick chapel, a Maryland vernacular interpretation of Georgian ecclesiastical architecture, was initially finished in 1755. Extensions were added in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, with the most recent renovation (of the interior, including box pews) completed in 2005. The bell tower dates from 1884. A cemetery surrounds the church, enclosed by a stone wall. A school was constructed adjacent to the church in 1821, but its buildings physically dismantled in 1884 and the bricks reused in the new bell tower. The parish hall was built in 1904 and expanded in 1950, and the St. James Academy refounded in 1957, with a major refurbishment in 1994-1999. That 89 acre property includes playing fields and a parking lot on the side furthest from Monkton Road. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

A revised version was published in 1978.  Plot summary  Dick Corvey is suffering from advanced tuberculosis in a provincial sanitarium. While confined to bed 24 hours a day, he meditates on various events from his earlier life, his friendship with Tom, his relationships with women, especially his brief engagement with Lois who abandoned him when his virtually hopeless condition had become apparent. A recurring theme is that of the Vodi, a malevolent race of small creatures invented by Tom when at school. The chief concern of the Vodi is to persecute and destroy the unlucky: the good and harmless people who invite the wrath of the Vodi by these very qualities (while the undeserving minority can enjoy good fortune and all life's comforts unhampered). Among others, Dick is tended by Nurse Evelyn Mallaton, whose sympathy and strong sexual attraction eventually give him the energy to rally against the disease and recover. However, while attracted to Dick, Evelyn understands his lack of prospects in the world and becomes engaged to a local businessman. Here emerges the main theme of the book: what Dick perceived as the distinction between the undeserved good and bad luck may in fact be the difference between a strong will and the lack of it. The novel ends with Dick bravely leaving the sanitarium where he has been offered a safe nursing job, to try to establish himself in the world on his own and perhaps get Evelyn back.  Literary significance and criticism  The novel appears to have been unsuccessful on publication and rarely reprinted. Nevertheless, the book was Braine's own favourite, and the critic Martin Seymour-Smith described it as a \\"more interesting and imaginative work\\" than Room at the Top.Martin Seymour-Smith ed.

O'Brien was born in Chicago, Illinois to a medical doctor and a nurse. His father was also a medical examiner and the young O'Brien accompanied him to autopsies he performed at local funeral homes. He attended St. Philip Neri grammar school and Leo Catholic High School. O'Brien earned a B.A. in English at Yale University in 1952 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1961. While in graduate school, he took an instructorship at Princeton University, where he became assistant professor after graduating. He began his career as administrator when he took on the role of Assistant Dean of the College at Princeton and then moved to Middlebury College where he took on successively more responsibilities. In 1976, Bucknell University tapped O'Brien to become its twelfth president. In 1984, he assumed the presidency of the University of Rochester. At UR, he introduced several innovations, including the \\"Take Five\\" program, the Rochester Conference, which brought high-profile speakers to the River Campus from 1987 to 1990, and a weekly University Day to bring faculty and undergraduates together for interchange of ideas. He also kicked off a major fund-raising campaign to fund more competitive compensation for faculty. O'Brien also dealt with several controversies, notably the ill-fated idea to raise the possibility of renaming UR to \\"Rochester University\\" or \\"Eastman Rochester University\\". In 1987, he had to deal with the fallout from William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration's rescinding the admission of a Fujifilm employee to its MBA program after senior Eastman Kodak officials voiced their concern that they would have to pull their executives out of the same program to prevent the possibility of industrial espionage. O'Brien also divested the University from South Africa after student protests. After retiring from UR in 1994, he served as chair of the Commonweal Foundation and on the board of La Salle University. He also served as an accreditation reviewer and chair for several institutions of higher learning in the United States.

The church was built in the Mud√©jar style in the 13th century. On this site there was an old Visigothic structure and probably an ancient Roman building. The building is protected by a heritage listing. It currently houses a Visigothic museum, the \\"Museum of the Councils and Visigothic Culture\\" (the councils in question are the Councils of Toledo, the earliest of which assembled in 400).  History and description  It is located in one of the highest places of the city, on the second of the twelve hills that form it. There is already news of the parish in the 12th century and the church would be consecrated in 1221 by the archbishop Rodrigo Xim√©nez de Rada. Tradition indicates that in it Alfonso VIII was crowned king of Castile on 26 August 1166. The church presents a floor plan with three naves separated by horseshoe arches with alfiz that are supported on pillars. Visigoth and Roman columns attached to capitals are reused from Visigothic origins in some cases, distinguishing themselves by its Corinthian leaves. Throughout the 13th century a new apse was constructed and the robust tower was built (of Toledan Mud√©jar style, with its two upper storeys forming a double belfry and with window openings in groups of two and three, and that would serve as a model for other Toledan towers); In addition to being realized the murals to the fresco in Romanesque painting figurative combined with typically Mud√©jar decorations. Of great beauty, these are considered the most southern of Spain. The frescoes are divided into two areas separated by inscriptions. They emphasize the four winged evangelists and the representations of archbishops, the saints Stephen and Lawrence, angels or the Final Judgment. In the 16th century, Alonso de Covarrubias designed the apse with Plateresque dome of coffers in the main chapel and later covered the paintings, which lost its traces until the first third of the 20th century in which these were rediscovered. It was not until the 1940s that these were recovered where possible. File:Iglesia de San Rom√°n (Toledo). Capilla Mayor.jpgInterior, main chapel. File:Iglesia de San Rom√°n (Toledo).

Even so, Johanna grows up to be an articulate girl, who intensively studies the Bible, unbeknownst to her father. After her eldest brother's sudden death, their father wants to send his second son Johannes to the cathedral school in Dorestad, but when the teacher Aesculapius (Edward Petherbridge) visits them in Ingelheim, Johanna proves to be far more capable of dealing with the Scriptures than Johannes. Against her father's wishes, Johanna is taught by Aesculapius, who introduces her to literary works such as Homer's Odyssey. When a messenger comes from the bishop to collect Johanna to take her to the cathedral school, her father claims there has been a mistake and allows him to ride away with his other son. Johanna flees her home at night and finds her brother, next to the body of the slain messenger. They reach Dorestad together, where the bishop reacts to Johanna's strong words with great surprise, and the teacher Odo (Marc Bischoff) unwillingly takes her into his class. Count Gerold (David Wenham), however, supports the now-adolescent Johanna by taking her into his home. Later Gerold falls in love with her. Soon afterwards, Gerold has to go to war in the army of Lothair I and his wife Richilde (Claudia Michelsen) takes advantage of his absence to try to arrange a marriage for Johanna and thus get rid of her rival for Gerold's affections. However, the vikings break into the city during the wedding ceremony and carry out a bloody massacre, which Johanna barely manages to survive, but her brother Johannes is killed in the attack. Johanna flees the town in a male disguise, entering the Fulda monastery of Benedictines as \\"Brother Johannes Anglicus\\". Her father visits her in the monastery believing her to be Johannes, but when he discovers who she is and attempts to expose her, he dies of a stroke. When a fever spreads around the monastery and Johanna becomes ill, she manages to avoid a physical examination, thanks to an elderly monk, who had realized she was a woman long before the fever hit. She flees the monastery and is sheltered, as a woman, by Arn (Marian Meder), the son of a woman she had helped years earlier. Arn makes her a tutor to his daughter Arnalda. Johanna decides to re-assume her male disguise and goes on a pilgrimage to Rome to use her medical knowledge to become a Medicus there. In Rome she wins a great reputation by curing Pope Sergius II of gout with her herbal remedies. Sergius makes her his personal physician and eventually Nomenclator. When the pope threatens Lothair I for not confirming his election, Lothair marches to Rome to subdue Sergius. Using a hydraulic device, the great door of the papal palace closes all by itself, seen as an Act of God. Pope Sergius threatens Lothair and his soldiers with God's wrath if they do not pay their respect. Lothair's soldiers all kneel, with Lothair reluctantly following. Fascinated by what he has seen, Gerold‚Äîwho came with Lothair‚Äîrecognizes Johanna and reveals his desire for her. She is torn between her male and female identities. Meanwhile, Lothair's ally Anastasius successfully plots to murder Sergius in order to become pope himself, but the people elect Johanna as his successor by acclamation. During her pontificate she presents herself as a charitable pope, helping women and children and appointing Gerold as head of the papal army. However, she becomes pregnant and her reign is then in grave danger. She tries to hold off giving birth until after Easter, but Gerold is killed during the Easter procession by conspirators led by Anastasius, and that day Johanna collapses and then dies in childbirth. Anastasius succeeds her but soon afterwards he is deposed by the Roman people and exiled to a monastery. There he writes the Liber Pontificalis, a list of the popes, from which he omits Johanna, as a final act of revenge. Many years later the story of the female pope is made known by Bishop Arnaldo, who is revealed to be, in fact, Arnalda, the daughter of Arn.

The Oscar-winner Volker Schl√∂ndorff's attempt to film the novel began in 1999, at first with the production companies UFA and Senator, until the latter was declared bankrupt in 2004, when he moved to Bernd Eichinger and Constantin Film. The planned principal photography was finally shelved in 2007 by a cancellation by John Goodman. The following summer Schl√∂ndorff wrote a review in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung criticising the production for film and television, leading to his dismissal. S√∂nke Wortmann replaced him as director and shortly afterwards, in May 2008, Franka Potente was replaced by Johanna Wokalek in the title role. Shooting began in early August 2008 at Burg Querfurt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Other locations were the cloister of the Landesschule Pforta and the church of St. Cyriakus in Gernrode, with the Rome scenes filmed in Ouarzazate, Morocco. Principal shooting was completed in 2008 in Germany and Morocco. Reception The Guardian noted the film's appearance in the Italian box office top 10 and noted Vatican criticism of the film and L'Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian Bishops' Conference, described it as being of \\"extremely limited vision\\".

By 1850 New York newspapers were heralding the upcoming marriage of the daughter of the prosperous Connecticut-born merchant to the scion of a French-family-owned silk-manufacturing firm.Jean-Adolphe Beaux was from a family of French Huguenots long engaged in the silk business. In that year John Wheeler Leavitt's daughter Cecilia Kent Leavitt was married to \\"Mr Adolph Beaux of the house of J. P.

In 1855 John W. Leavitt's daughter Cecilia died 12 days after giving birth to her daughter Cecilia Beaux, who was then sent with a sister to grandparents John Wheeler and Cecilia (Kent) Leavitt's New York home. By the time of Cecilia Beaux's mother's death, Leavitt and his wife were living in austere circumstances, following the collapse of his once-thriving business. The origins of the collapse of Leavitt's business interests are not recorded, but the aftermath was stunning. Countless suits were filed against John Wheeler Leavitt and his brother Rufus by creditors anxious to reclaim what was left of their funds. Some of the suits, recorded in The New-York Legal Observer, even hinted at fraud as the once-highflying partnership of the two Leavitt brothers collapsed.The New-York Legal Observer Containing Reports of Cases, Vol. IX, Samuel Owen (ed.), Printed by Angell, Engel and Hewitt, New York, 1851 On top of the business reversals of the Leavitt family firm, Jean Adolph Beaux's business interests collapsed in the years following the birth of his daughter. The French businessman returned to his native country, with only one visit back to Philadelphia in 16 years to see the family he left behind. But in spite of the collapse of the family firm, grandparents John Wheeler and Cecilia Kent Leavitt took in the two children,Jean Adolph Beaux and his wife Cecilia Leavitt had three daughters, one of whom died in infancy. and proved instrumental in raising them through the years.

Beaux recalled later that her grandmother stressed a pragmatic approach to life, in which \\"everything undertaken must be completed, conquered\\". The unsettled years during the American Civil War were particularly difficult, as Beaux's absent father provided little emotional or financial support, and her Leavitt grandparents had lost much of their wealth and prominence.

Edmund and other men returned to Morley's Settlement to harvest their crops on November 15, 1845. They lodged with Solomon Hancock in his unburned home about one-half mile northeast of Lima, Illinois. Late that evening, nightriders set fire to hay in the Hancock barnyard. Awakened, the Mormon men rushed outside to fight the fire. Edmund Durfee, who was age 57 at the time, was shot in the back and killed. Durfee's attackers were identified and arrested, but never brought to trial, even though \\"their guilt was sufficiently apparent,\\" according to Illinois Governor Thomas Ford. Edmund was buried near his brother, James Durfee, in Nauvoo's Parley Street Cemetery. Durfee has since been described as \\"one of the most inoffensive men in the country.\\" \\"Some of the mob engaged in the tragic affair afterwards boasted that they had shot Durfee in order to win a wager of a gallon of whisky, that the stack had been set on fire to cause an alarm and draw the men out, and that by killing him they had won the whisky.\\" Following his murder, Edmund's family participated in the Latter-day Saints' forced exodus from Nauvoo in 1846. Edmund's widow, Magdalena, died during the hard journey near present-day Council Bluffs. His daughter, Tamma Durfee Miner, buried both her baby, Melissa, at Montrose, and her husband Albert Miner, in Iowaville, along the Mormon Trail. Eight Durfee children ‚Äì Martha Durfee Stevens, Tamma Durfee Miner Curtis, Dolly Durfee Garner, Delana Durfee Dudley, Abraham Durfee, Jabez Durfee, Mary Durfee Carter, and Nephi Durfee ‚Äì went west with the Latter-day Saints and settled in Utah Territory.

It was founded by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus in 2008. Grameen America is run by former Avon Chairman and CEO Andrea Jung. The organization provides loans, savings programs, financial education, and credit establishment to women who live in poverty in the United States. All loans must be used to build small businesses. Services Grameen America offers four key products. #Microloans. The maximum first-time loan is $1,500, though borrowers can return for larger loans once they have repaid their initial loan. #Savings program. Grameen America provides no-fee, no minimum balance savings accounts through commercial partner banks. #Credit Establishment. Grameen America helps members build credit by reporting loan repayments directly to Experian. #Financial Education. Grameen encourages group mentoring during a five-day initial training and weekly meetings with members. Lending process The requirements to receive a loan: The individual must be living below the poverty line, located in a community with a Grameen America branch and willing to create or join a five-member group of like-minded individuals who want to start or expand their own businesses. No credit score, collateral, guarantors, or bank account is required. Grameen America uses a peer-group lending model\\"Model\\" . Grameen America. Retrieved September 20, 2013. pioneered by Professor Yunus and the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Once a peer group of five lendees is formed, they go through a financial training program and each open savings accounts. Upon completion of the training program, each member receives their loan. Grameen America staff holds mandatory weekly group meetings during which members repay loans, deposit savings and receive peer support and mentoring. Upon successful repayment, members may apply for another loan. The success of the Grameen Bank microfinance model in Bangladesh demonstrates that a high-touch model based on small weekly payments can yield exceptional repayment rates. Purpose of loans Grameen America requires all loans to be used to start or expand income-generating businesses. Common businesses include food carts, flower stands, tailoring, jewelry and crafts and salon services. Locations Grameen America's first branch, located in Jackson Heights, Queens, opened in January 2008. As of 2017, Grameen America operates in Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx and Manhattan, New York, as well as in Omaha, Nebraska, Indianapolis, Indiana, Charlotte, North Carolina, San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and San Jose, California, Austin, Texas, Union City, New Jersey, Boston, Massachusetts, and Miami, Florida.\\"Impact\\".

History Grameen America presentation Grameen America was founded upon the belief that Grameen Bank's microfinance lending system could work in urban America as well as it had in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus believed that for the world to acknowledge the power of microfinance, it must work in the capital of international finance, New York City, where there exists a huge population of people who do not have access to banks and mainstream financial institutions. Grameen America opened its doors in January 2008 during the largest financial crisis of the modern era. In September 2018, Grameen America hit a notable milestone, having dispersed $1 billion in microloans to over 100,000 of its members in the ten years since its founding.https://www.grameenamerica.org/blog/2018/9/25/grameen-america- hits-1-billion-milestone-in-microloans-to-low-income-women Statistics As of the end of 2017, Grameen America had disbursed over $760 million in micro- loans to more than 95,000 low-income women in the United States.

The two major weaknesses of the energy policy of Morocco are the lack of coordination between these two agencies and the lack of development of domestic energy sources. The country has some hydrocarbon reserves, mostly in natural gas reserves that have been exploited. However, its main policy highlight is in adaptation to climate change: the climate change adaptation index ranked. Currently, most energy is produced through hydrocarbon thermal plants. However, government policy is on track to convert to a high renewable mix of 42% installed renewables by 2020, and 52% by 2030. Renewables include hydroelectric, wind, and solar. Oil and natural gas The United States Energy Information Administration (USEIA) reports that Morocco produces only \\"marginal amounts of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum,\\" and it has never exceeded 5,000 barrels per day. While past production in the late 1990s and early 2000s was as high as 4,700 barrels per day, as of June 2020, the USEIA reported proven oil reserves in Morocco at 160 barrels a day. This same report shows that natural gas reserves are below consumption levels, and thus, Morocco imports much of its natural gas. Morocco produces small volumes of oil and natural gas from the Essaouira Basin and small amounts of natural gas from the Gharb Basin. Consequently, Morocco is the largest energy importer in northern Africa. Costs have been rising rapidly. High oil prices in 2005 increased import costs to approximately $2 billion for the year. In 2008, total costs related to energy imports reached $8 billion. In 2003, the Moroccan government announced that foreign companies could import oil without paying import tariffs. This followed a 2000 decision in which Morocco modified its hydrocarbons law in order to offer a 10-year tax break to offshore oil production firms and to reduce the government's stake in future oil concessions to a maximum of 25 percent. The entire energy sector was due to be liberalized by 2007. The Moroccan Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) has become optimistic about finding additional reserves ‚Äì particularly offshore ‚Äì following discoveries in neighboring Mauritania. At the end of 2005, 19 foreign companies were operating in Morocco, with an estimated total investment of $56 million per year. In May 2004, China Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) received a license to drill near Agadir. In April 2004, Norway's Norsk Hydro signed a 12-month exploration contract for the Safi Offshore Northwest zone, while Denmark's Maersk signed an eight-year agreement for eight blocks near Tarfaya. In March 2004, Calgary-based Stratic Energy committed to a three-year exploration program in two onshore blocks in northwest Morocco. The two concessions cover approximately . Other foreign firms engaged in exploration include Petronas, Cooper Energy NL, Shell, Total, and Tullow Oil. Morocco's exploration of offshore and onshore oil drilling in Western Sahara, which is believed to contain viable hydrocarbon reserves, has been controversial. Foreign companies operating under Moroccan concession in Western Sahara - companies such as Total, Svitzer, Nopec, and Kerr-McGee - were targets of international protest campaigns over the disputed territory. All eventually ended their operations in Western Sahara amidst protests from the exiled Sahrawi government and pro-Sahrawi groups. The Kerr-McGee company had been granted exploration contracts by the Moroccan government in 2001, but it withdrew in 2006, reasoning that the possible oil and gas stores were not as promising as earlier data had suggested. Kerr-McGee's divestiture was followed by an agreement between the US oil company Kosmos Energy and Morocco's Ministry for Natural Resources and Mines along with the Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM). Since then, the Kronos company decided to withdraw, also citing the insufficient hydrocarbon resources, but adding the reason that the decision was influenced by \\"the sensitivity of the area and the requirements of international law\\" as indicated in the 2002 United Nations legal opinion on resource exploration and development in non-self-governing territories. Morocco is a transit center for Algerian gas exports to Spain and Portugal. These are transported across the Strait of Gibraltar via the 300‚Äì350 Bcf/year Maghreb-Europe Gas (MEG) pipeline. Natural gas from the MEG pipeline will be used to power Morocco's power project in Al Wahda. =Refining= Morocco has two refineries that are owned by Saudi-based Corral Holdings Societe Marocaine d‚ÄôIndustrie de Raffinage (Samir). The refineries are located at Mohammedia and Sidi Kacem and have a combined capacity of . In 2004, the Mohammedia plant returned to near full-capacity output levels, following the completion of repairs needed after a severe flood and massive fire in November 2002. Because of the completed repairs, refinery output surged 49 percent in 2004. The Mohammedia plant currently produces 80 ‚Äì 90 percent of the country's refined petroleum products. In June 2005, Samir awarded a $628 million contract to modernize the Mohammedia refinery to a consortium led by Italy's Snamprogetti SpA and Turkey's Tekefen Company. Morocco hopes the refinery upgrade will prepare the refinery for competing with foreign producers when the market is liberalized in 2009. The upgrade is expected to be complete in 2008. Oil shale Ten known oil shale deposits in Morocco account more than of shale oil. Although Moroccan oil shale has been studied since the 1930s, and there have been several pilot facilities for shale oil production, there is no commercial shale oil production yet. The most important deposits are in Timahdit (Middle Atlas Mountains) and Tarfaya (south-westernmost part of Morocco). Electricity Morocco's electrical sector traditionally has been controlled by the state-owned Office National de l'Electricit√© (ONE), which the government reorganized in 1995 in order to regain profitability. Due to a growing population and economic development, Morocco's electricity demand is increasing rapidly. The country's annual electricity consumption reached 33.5 terawatt-hours in 2014. Power shortages and a desire to control public spending have led the Moroccan government to make more use of the private sector to meet the country's power needs. The state's share of electricity generation likely will decline to 40 percent by 2020. However, ONE will continue to be solely responsible for distribution and transmission of electricity in Morocco. In 2003, Morocco had an installed generating capacity of 4.8 GW. The country's two largest electricity power stations at Mohammedia and Jorf Lasfar are both coal fired. Most of the coal is imported from South Africa, although Morocco purchased Polish coal for the Jorf Lasfar power plant in April 2005. Morocco stopped coal production in 2000, when Jerada coal mine was closed. Jorf Lasfar became Morocco's first privately operated power station in 1997, when it was taken over by a U.S.-Swiss consortium. The consortium expanded the plant‚Äôs capacity to 1,400 MW in 2001. The expansion at Jorf Lasfar is consistent with a wider campaign to increase generating capacity in Morocco. In 2005, as part of the Moroccan government's plan, a $500 million, 350‚Äì400-MW combined-cycle power plant began operation in Tahaddart. The plant is owned by ONE (48%), Endesa (32%) and Siemens (20%). In addition to the Tahaddart plant, ONE awarded Endesa the development rights of a two-unit, 800-MW gas-fired power station in the Sidi Kacem Province, with a completion date set for 2008 [still not completed in 2010]. ONE is also considering another pumped storage plant in the Azilal region south of Rabat. =Renewable energy= Renewable energy plays a key role in ONEE's $3.4 billion energy development plan, announced in January 2004. The goal was to provide 80 percent of rural areas with electricity by 2008, while increasing the share of renewable energy from 0.24 percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2011. A new national plan for renewable energy was introduced in 2009 in an effort to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports. The framework of regulation in Morocco generally supports the use of renewable energy in the electricity sector, as law 13-09 (\\"renewable energy law\\") was announced in 2010. While Morocco lacks significant fossil fuel deposits, it does have plenty of resources for solar, wind, and hydropower. The plan is to be at 52% renewable energies by 2030. As a result, the kingdom is \\"in the forefront of developing the independent power producer (IPP) model for large-scale utilities plants in North Africa.\\" Amogdoul Wind Farm, Morocco  Wind power  Morocco has set a goal to have 2-GW production capacity from wind power; it is part of the Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project that began in 2010. As of 2016, Morocco has eight wind farms (Torres, Amogdoul, Lafarge, Akhfennir, Laayue, Tangier I, Cimar, and Haouma) with the total operational capacity of 487 MW; another six wind farms are anticipated to be installed by 2020 with a total capacity of 1,000 MW.  Solar power  In November 2009, Morocco announced a solar energy project worth $9 billion that officials said would account for 38 percent of the North African country's installed power generation by 2020.Morocco unveils $9 bln solar power scheme  Reuters. Af.reuters.com (2009-11-03). Retrieved on 2010-11-21. Funding would be from a mix of private and state capital. The project involved five solar-power- generation sites across Morocco and was intended to produce 2,000 MW of electricity by 2020. It would add the equivalent generation output of the current electricity consumption of the country's commercial capital, Casablanca. In 2018, it was reported that the country‚Äôs solar projects are being driven by the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), formerly the Moroccan Solar Agency, which was set up in 2010 to lead the country‚Äôs solar program. At that time, Germany also expressed its willingness to participate in the development of Morocco's solar energy project and also take part in the development of a water-desalination plant.Germany to participate in Morocco's solar energy project. Moroccobusinessnews.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-21. MASEN has managed Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and Photovoltaic (PV) facilities for the solar power project since 2015. The nation has pioneered solar energy technology by investing in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) program in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The biggest CSP project in Morocco is Noor Solar, situated in the city of Ouarzazate, on the edge of the Sahara desert. The project comprises 3 phases: Noor I, Noor II and Noor III. This Noor project is supported by a BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer) basis of ACWA Power Ouarzazate, MASEN, Aries, and TSK. The first phase of the program - Noor I - was inaugurated in February 2016. Noor I employs 500,000 parabolic mirrors to eventually generate up to 160 MW of electricity, which makes it one of the largest solar power plants in the world. The program has two following phases - Noor II and Noor III - which were scheduled to operate by 2018. Besides the CSP project, Morocco is also developing the Noor PV 1 program and Noor Midelt phase 1, which essentially use photovoltaics to further increase the electricity generation from solar. The whole complex of the Noor Plant was scheduled to come online in 2018. The complex is supposed to have 582 MW of capacity, that could be utilized to provide electricity for 1.1 million houses. From 2010 until 2015, electricity generated by solar and wind has increased almost four times.  Hydropower  Morocco has additional renewable resources that could be developed, including the country's four perennial rivers and many dams with hydroelectric potential. Morocco‚Äôs installed hydropower capacity is 1,770 MW. In May 2005, ONE selected Temsol for a $27.6 million project to supply solar power to 37,000 rural homes by 2007. Similar contracts were awarded in May 2002 to a consortium led by Total Energie and in January 2004 to Apex-BP. Currently, only 55 percent of outlying villages have access to electricity.  Biomass energy  Biomass is also one of the renewable sources that the country possesses in abundance, with 12,568 GWh/year and 13,055 GWh/year potential in solid bioenergy and combination of biogas and biofuels. However, the country has only utilized less than 1% of this potential, due to the high cost of investment and insufficient production process knowledge. = Nuclear energy = Morocco has expressed interest in nuclear power for desalination and other purposes. In September 2001, the government signed an agreement with the United States establishing the legal basis for constructing a 2-MW research reactor. Morocco signed an agreement with the U.S. company General Atomics to construct the research reactor east of Rabat. Regional integration Morocco is gradually integrating its electrical grid with those of its neighbors in Africa and Europe. Maghreb integration has been spearheaded by the Maghreb Electricity Committee, with physical integration initiatives that began in the 1990s. In May 2003, Moroccan representatives met with the energy ministers from other European and Mediterranean countries to discuss the feasibility of electricity market integration. In December 2005, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and the European Union signed a funding agreement that will pay for costs related to studying the electricity market within the three countries and how they might integrate into the European electricity market.Google image map Tunisia, Algeria, and Moroccan networks are already connected to the European network managed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, which allowed these three countries to link their electricity systems to the E.U.‚Äôs single energy market and be at the heart of the dialogue within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Partnership.

Many bowling alleys that use wood for their lanes will either have signs that tell the bowlers not to loft, or an employee will tell the bowlers not to do so. Lofting the ball before the arrows in some bowling alleys is not against the rules. Some professional bowlers do loft a considerable amount under certain lane conditions. Crankers and other high-rev players may be forced to loft under dry conditions in order to delay the ball's reaction and prevent it from overhooking.

The Zane Grey Museum in Lackawaxen Township, Pennsylvania, United States, is a former residence of the author Zane Grey and is now maintained as a museum and operated by the National Park Service (NPS). It is located on the upper Delaware River and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It contains many photographs, artworks, books, furnishings, and other objects of interest associated with Grey and his family. The house was built in two sections, both from designs by Grey. The first was in 1905 by Zane Grey's brother, Romer Carl \\"Reddy\\" Grey; the second seven years later by a neighbor, to serve as a writing studio and library after the success of Riders of the Purple Sage. Grey and his wife moved to California so he could work on screenplays in 1918, but Lackawaxen and the house remained one of his favorite places for the rest of his life. It was added to the Register in 1983. Building The house is along Scenic Drive, a short road along the Delaware River north of Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, an early suspension bridge which still carries vehicle and foot traffic across the river between Pennsylvania and New York. Along the riverfront to the north, it is to the Delaware's confluence with the Lackawaxen River, the largest tributary of the Upper Delaware in Pennsylvania, resulting in slightly choppier water in front of the house. The grassy, maintained ground slopes gently from Pennsylvania Route 590 to the west toward the river, giving the house's east (front) a view across to undeveloped woods on the New York side in Minisink Ford. In front of the house, the slope exposes the northern corner more than the southern one. There is a small unpaved parking lot, sign for the museum and state historical marker as well. The house is to the north of a cluster of other buildings in the neighborhood, most notably the former D&H; Canal Co. Office, now a bed and breakfast. The two-story clapboard-sided frame structure rises from an exposed bluestone foundation. It is three bays long by six wide, in an L-shaped plan. The older, east-west‚Äìoriented block of the house has a square hipped roof with two large pedimented dormer windows with dentilled lintels on the east and south sides, with a smaller jerkin-roofed dormer complementing the eastern one. The newer wing designed by Grey and built by his brother has a rectangular hipped roof of gentler pitch with three small jerkined dormers. Both roofs are surfaced with diamond-shaped shingles of white asbestos cement and pierced by a single brick chimney per wing. A single wraparound porch with flat roof, balustrade and bracketed columns runs the length of the south and east elevations, combining two previously separate porches, one of which had lost its original roof in the floods of 1955. White wooden posts mark the house's corners, and the second-story windows have awnings. Inside, the floor plans reflect the two sections' separate construction. The earlier one has a square plan, the later one a rectangular. Many original finishes and decorations remain. Opposite the original front door at the southeast corner is a brick fireplace trimmed with unglazed terra cotta, including egg-and-dart molding. A T-plan staircase has its original decorative balustrade and newel posts. The northeast door is the main entrance to the newer wing. It opens onto a living space that runs the length and half the width of the addition. Opposite the door is its fireplace, likewise of brick and topped with a beveled mirror to a height of . Behind it the library includes many original trim, particularly a deep painted frieze depicting kachina dolls, reflecting Grey's interests in the Southwest. These rooms, and Grey's upstairs studio, house most of the museum exhibits and visitor interest today. History A native of Zanesville, Ohio, Grey had established a dental practice in New York City in 1896 but soon grew dissatisfied with the field. He dabbled in semi- professional baseball and wrote his first stories and novels. They were not successful, but by 1905 he had decided to leave dentistry for writing. They had begun the process of building the first part of the house, the southern wing, after seeing the site on a fishing trip that year, and later they moved their families into it. Grey continued to write westerns, and took two extended research trips to the Southwest over the next several years. He worked, at the time, in a bungalow near the house that is no longer extant. These resulted in Heritage of the Desert in 1911 and Riders of the Purple Sage the following year, his bestselling novel. With the proceeds from the latter work, he designed the study wing. It was built by a neighbor, Gottlieb Kuhn, in 1912. He continued writing novels there for six more years until the nascent film industry beckoned. He and his wife moved to Altadena, California, where they eventually purchased an estate as he became even more commercially successful as a film producer as well. He remained in California until his 1939 death, but retained the Lackawaxen house for visits east. Both he and his wife are buried in Union Cemetery, not far from the house. In 1945, Grey's widow sold the house to a friend, who operated it as an inn for 25 years. During that time, in 1955, the building suffered some serious flood damage, tearing off the roof of the first front porch. In 1973, they converted it into the museum, which they sold to the Park Service in 1989. Floods in the summer of 2006 left of water in the basement. The Park Service was able to get the collection to safety, but it was necessary to thoroughly dehumidify the space before reopening the museum.

Based on the famous 1936 attempt to climb the Eiger north face, the film is about two German climbers involved in a competition to climb the most dangerous rock face in the Alps. Plot The movie portrays an attempt in 1936 to summit the Eiger via the north face, the last major unclimbed Alpine face, by two competing teams. The more prominently featured pair are German climbers Toni Kurz (F√ºrmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Lukas). The ascent is covered by the fictional novice journalist Louise (Wokalek) and her cynical editor from a Berlin newspaper. Toni, Andi and Louise are childhood friends from Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. The boys have joined the German army and are successful amateur climbers and, hearing other teams are making an attempt on the Eiger north face, decide to compete to make the ascent. After being refused leave from the German army (falsely claiming one of them is getting married and the other is to be Best Man), they quit their service in order to make the attempt. They are portrayed as being more interested in mountaineering than politics. The competing team of Austrians are portrayed as hoping for a Nazi-led incorporation of Austria into Germany. Louise's superiors see a media opportunity and send her editor along with her as a photographer to cover the ascent by the German pair. Having no money, Kurz and Hinterstoisser travel to the Bernese Alps on bicycles and share a tent, while the reporting pair lodge in the luxurious hotel at Kleine Scheidegg. Competing French and Italian climbers assess the conditions and decide to abort their attempt, leaving the German and Austrian teams. Once both pairs start their climb, the observers below watch as the climbers risk their lives in a series of catastrophic incidents. The teams are forced to join together to survive and descent to safety. The story of the climb follows the historical narrative of the actual 1936 Eiger North Face climbing disaster. A rescue team reaches within metres to save the last climber alive but a knot tying two short ropes together cannot pass through his carabiner and Kurz dies within earshot of Louise. Distraught at losing her best friends, particularly Toni, to whom she is romantically attached, and repelled by the editor's cynicism, Lousie resigns her job and the film ends with her working as a professional photographer in postwar New York.

A remake of Droopy's first cartoon Dumb-Hounded (also adopting elements from Avery's 1941 Bugs Bunny cartoon Tortoise Beats Hare), the short revolves around the wolf (an escaped convict) on the run from Droopy, who is trailing the wolf in order to capture him. The title is a play on words on the film North West Mounted Police (1940). Plot The film opens with a view of \\"Alka-Fizz Prison\\", clearly based on the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. A prison sign informs viewers that \\"No Noose is Good Noose\\", a pun involving the phrase \\"no news is good news\\" and the use of the noose in executions by hanging.Curtis (2011), p. 224-227 The Wolf is depicted as a prisoner in his prison cell. He uses a pencil to draw a \\"crude door on the wall outside his cell\\", then opens that door and escapes, making his way from the United States to Canada. The scene shifts to the police headquarters of Mounty County, where a sign explains that \\"We Aim to Police\\". The chief of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police addresses a gathering of Mounties, seeking a volunteer who is willing to hunt the escaped convict. Sgt. McPoodle (Droopy) is effectively volunteered when all the other Mounties step back. Later, somewhere in the Yukon, the Wolf is running through the snow. He stops to read a series of Burma-Shave-style signs which contain a warning message for him: \\"Don't Look Now/ Use Your Noodle/ You're Being Followed/ by Sgt. McPoodle\\". He turns around, and the camera shifts left to reveal that McPoodle is indeed approaching his target. This sets the pace for most of the short, where the shifting perspective of the camera exposes the presence of Droopy in yet another location. He remains unnoticed and effectively invisible until that reveal. The Wolf attempts to hide in a seemingly vacant cabin in the woods. He shuts the front door and seven more on top of it. He feels secure behind these eight doors, but then the camera shifts to reveal the presence of McPoodle within the cabin. The Mountie occupies a chair by the fireplace, calmly reading a comic strip. The Wolf reacts by re-opening all eight doors, only to find McPoodle waiting behind them. The Wolf manages to flee through the back door, though he finds McPoodle also standing behind that door. The Wolf climbs the highest mountain of the area and finds refuge in its summit, within a bird nest. Only a single egg shares the nest with him. After declaring that McPoodle will never find him at that altitude, the egg then cracks and McPoodle emerges from inside. The Wolf immediately dives towards a lake in the vicinity of the mountain. He feels momentarily safe underwater, until he notices McPoodle among the schooling fish. Following several failed attempts to escape the pursuit, the Wolf ends up in a tiny atoll of the Pacific Ocean. There are only two rocks on its surface. The Wolf breaks the fourth wall to speak to the movie audience, explaining that he has caught on to the pattern of McPoodle's appearances and fully expects the Mountie to emerge from under the larger rock. At this point, McPoodle surprises him by appearing from under the smaller rock instead. The Wolf proceeds to swim his way towards New York City. He runs in the streets of the City, and an accidental turn causes him to nearly run off the edge of the film. He saves himself and then seeks refuge in a movie theater, hiding among the audience. The film screened is a product of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, and McPoodle greets him from the screen. causing the Wolf to again flee. The Wolf next seeks the services of a plastic surgeon and requests a new face. First he finds his new face to be a replica of McPoodle's and asks the surgeon to restore his original face. Then he thanks the surgeon for doing so, only to notice that the man's face has also changed to now look like McPoodle. An increasingly desperate Wolf next attempts to commit suicide by feeding himself to a lion in the local zoo. Alive in the \\"belly of the beast\\", he finds himself sharing the space with McPoodle. His next attempt to escape is his final one, as he ends up back in a prison cell. He then speaks to the audience again: he realizes that McPoodle got him, but now that he has some time to recall the events of the pursuit he wonders whether \\"there coulda been more than one of them little guys\\". At this point, the camera shifts to the corridor outside his cell where hundreds of McPoodle look-alikes have gathered. They answer his question with one of their own, \\"What do you think, brother?\\" Voice cast *Tex Avery as Droopy McPoodle, Dr. Putty-Puss *Frank Graham, William Hanna, King Kong as Wolf Production Jeff Lenburg comments that one of the animators of the film was Preston Blair, who produced some of his best work while working under Tex Avery, including this film. He cites as other examples Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), Screwball Squirrel (1944), Batty Baseball (1944), The Shooting of Dan McGoo (1945), Lonesome Lenny (1946), and Red Hot Rangers (1947).Lenburg (2006), p. 28-29 His work under Avery ended in 1948, when Fred Quimby promoted Blair to a director in his own right. He and co-director Michael Lah worked on three films for the Barney Bear series, before Quimby decided to discontinue their production unit. In reaction, Blair left the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio and started working for Terrytoons.Lenburg (2006), p. 28-29 Bill Thompson, the regular voice of Droopy, did not do the character's voice in this cartoon; Tex Avery provided the voice, instead. Analysis The main humor of the film derives from Droopy inexplicably appearing wherever the Wolf goes, granting the character omnipresence. This was only the fourth film to feature Droopy, but it is essentially a remake of the first of them, Dumb- Hounded (1943).Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 140 Both films actually recycle the gag of the seemingly omnipresent character from an even earlier film, Tortoise Beats Hare (1941). In that film, Cecil Turtle enlists his look-alike relatives in a plot against Bugs Bunny. The warning signs hint at two of the main themes of the film. One is the thin line between visibility and invisibility, the other is the sense that the pursuit of the officer is both relentless and inescapable. Scott Curtis argues that the film can be seen as a very sad comment on the lives of the animators themselves. The Wolf finds a way to escape through the power of his drawing pencil, suggesting emancipation through an artist's talent and creativity. But that promise of freedom is soon revealed as an illusion. In Curtis' view Avery and his crew had found themselves in a similar trap, having to draw hundreds of drawings of Droopy for every one of his films, to the point the character became a dominating presence in their lives. Derek Hayes and Chris Webster cite Northwest Hounded Police as an example of an animated film where the empathy of the audience is reserved for the nominal villain, the Wolf. Because the audience can relate to his human-like frustrations, while Droopy here serves the role of a \\"boring hero\\". They define this type of hero as one seemingly flawless and invulnerable, effectively having nothing in common with the audience. Making it unlikely for them to identify with the hero, or feel empathy for him/her.Hayes (2013), p. 89-92 They also argue that Droopy himself was never given a developed personality in his films, leaving the role of the real protagonist to whatever character shares the screen with him.Hayes (2013), p. 89-92 Jean-Marc Limoges cites the scene set in the movie theater as an example of Avery using metalepsis in his films. The Wolf among the film audience is greeted by Droopy (McPoodle) from the movie screen. Not only allowing the presence of a film within a film, but allowing the two films to interact.Limoges (2011), p. 209 Reception In 1994, animation historian Jerry Beck published The 50 Greatest Cartoons, selecting and ranking animated short films according to a poll of 1,000 people working in the animation industry. Northwest Hounded Police was ranked 28th in the list.

He studied journalism at Columbia University before working in a ballroom and joining the US Army in 1943.Dave Laing, \\"Sid Bernstein obituary - New York concert promoter who took the Beatles to the US\\", The Guardian, 22 August 2013. Retrieved 5 June 2014 During World War II, he was stationed in Britain and also served in France with the 602nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Gun Battalion of the United States Army. After the end of the war he returned to New York and became the manager of mambo musician Esy Morales, as well as acting as a booking agent. He started work for the General Artists Corporation (GAC), and by the early 1960s was working as a booking agent for pop stars such as Dion and Chubby Checker. Bernstein helped jump start the British Invasion as the first concert promoter to bring The Beatles over to the United States from Britain. An Anglophile, he contacted Beatles manager Brian Epstein in early 1963 after reading about the group in several British newspapers. Persuading Epstein that they could be successful in the US, he booked Carnegie Hall for their first appearance without informing the venue of their style of music and never hearing a note of their music. In late December 1963, the unknown Beatles were introduced to the Tidewater area of Virginia. Almost every other song played by the area‚Äôs DJs were Beatle records, accompanied by giveaways of shirts and other promotional items. By the first week of January 1964, as the Beatles were introduced to the New York City area, the same phenomenon occurred complemented by all sorts of contests and gifts. On February 12, 1964 the Beatles played two concerts at Carnegie Hall, three days following an historic appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. On August 15, 1965, Bernstein also booked them at Shea Stadium, a show that Bernstein described as \\"inaudible.\\" After a final world tour, including another Bernstein produced Shea Stadium performance, the group retired from touring in 1966 and split up in April 1970. Bernstein made many attempts to persuade them to re-form, at one point taking out full-page newspaper articles asking them to perform together for charity. During the Beatles Shea concert, Bernstein had the phrase \\"The Rascals are coming!\\" displayed on the Shea Stadium scoreboard. \\"I had met the Rascals in the summer of '65 though Billy Smith (Amato) who actually discovered this group in Westhampton Long Island playing at a nightclub called the Barge. I put their name up on the scoreboard (at Shea) - 'The Rascals are coming! The Rascals are coming!' A lot of people who hadn't seen pictures of them thought they were a black group. I sensed something big about them.\\" Brian Epstein demanded the Shea scoreboard plug be cut off before The Beatles hit the stage but that didn't stop Sid from working with the Rascals over the next five years. He helped the New Jersey based quartet in their rise from obscurity, changing their name from \\"The Rascals\\" to \\"The Young Rascals\\" in an attempt to avoid controversy because of a similar named group. Bernstein also brought British bands including the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, the Moody Blues, and the Kinks to America. He also organized concerts for Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Jimi Hendrix, Laura Nyro, Laura Branigan, Melanie and Sly & the Family Stone.BBC News, \\"Beatles promoter Sid Bernstein dies at 95\\", 21 August 2013.

The Big Hollow is younger than the alluvial valley floors which now form its boundaries and is therefore of Late Pleistocene age (less than 250,000 years). During most of the Pleistocene the Big Hollow was actually a hill composed of soft sedimentary bedrock. The material making up this former hill was much more easily eroded than the alluvial valley floors which bounded it to both the north and south. Eventually, the hill was washed and blown away and then the wind continued to erode a deflation basin into the soft bedrock. Eventually the former hill became lower than the river channels which once flowed around it. The geologists call this \\"topographic reversal\\".

You can no longer lodge a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) was a member-funded Australian ombudsman service that provided external dispute resolution for consumers who were unable to resolve complaints with member financial services organisations. The Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) (until 2014 known as the Credit Ombudsman Service) is an Australian alternative dispute resolution or ombudsman that helps settle disputes between consumers and financial credit providers. The Credit and Investments Ombudsman is one of the largest External Dispute Resolution (EDR) schemes in Australia by number of members, totaling over 22,000 in 2016. History It was established in 2003 as a result of the Mortgage & Finance Association of Australia ('MFAA') self-regulation, originally called the Mortgage Industry Ombudsman Scheme (MIOS). It later expanded its remit to include non-bank lending and other credit services, changing its name to the Credit Ombudsman Service Limited (COSL) to reflect this broader jurisdiction. Since November 2014 the scheme has been known as Credit and Investments Ombudsman. On 1 November 2018, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority launched as the one ombudsman service for all financial complaints, replacing three predecessor schemes, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Coverage The CIO covers the following institutions: * Credit providers * Credit representatives * Fund managers * Credit unions * Building societies * Leasing companies * Small Amount-lenders * Mortgage Brokers * non-bank lenders * mortgage managers * mortgage originators * aggregators * wholesale funders * securitisation trustees * housing co- operatives * mortgage insurers * Fund Managers * Planners & Advisors * Collections * Hire & Rental History The Credit and Investments Ombudsman was first established as the Mortgage Industry Ombudsman Service Limited (MIOS) on 18 June 2003 as an EDR (External Dispute Resolution, known in other regions as ADR) scheme, and commenced operations on 1 July 2003 . They adopted the name Credit Ombudsman Service Limited (COSL) on 17 February 2004 before becoming the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) on 19 November 2014. CIO is an approved EDR scheme under scheme approved by ASIC's Regulatory Guide RG 139 and its services are free for consumers. Funding is sourced from a combination of its membership fees and complaint fees paid by its participating Members. CIO can award compensation up to a maximum of $309,000 and other remedies, such as an apology, can be asked for. Complaints process CIO considers complaints or disputes about its participating Members' concerning their products and services, such as mortgages, credit products, financial planning, managed investment, insurance and deposit taking (savings). CIO resolves disputes in a non-adjudicative means through conciliation, although the actual Ombudsman can make a decision which is binding on the member (a Determination). Like all ASIC RG 139 approved schemes, Determinations made by the Ombudsman bind Members but not complainants. CIO's conciliation process is both inquisitorial and consensus- based and focuses on producing a mutually satisfactory outcome. Both Members and consumers are afforded an equal opportunity to put forward their cases. This is intended to ensure procedural fairness and promote effective dispute resolution. =Coverage= The Credit and Investments Ombudsman covers complaints for consumers if they have dealt with a participating Member of CIO as: * a borrower or prospective borrower * a loan guarantor or prospective guarantor * or have in any way sought the services of a Member in the ordinary course of their business in the credit marketplace. =Prior steps= Before CIO can consider a complaint, the complainant's must first have tried to resolve their complaint with the Member concerned by expressing their dissatisfaction either in writing or via telephone. Every CIO Member has to have a dedicated Complaints Contact Person as part of their membership and must also have in place procedures called Internal Dispute Resolution Procedures or 'IDR Procedures'. The IDR Procedures require that a Member must: * give you the name and contact details of their Complaints Contact Person before undertaking any services for you. * give you a copy of their Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) Procedures if you ask for them. * give you a substantive response within 45 days of lodging your complaint with them (if there is a delay they must inform you of the reason). =Complaints covered= The types of complaints covered by the CIO are set out in the CIO Rules. In general, a consumer can make a complaint to CIO if they believe that the Member they have dealt with has: * breached relevant laws. * breached the MFAA Code of Practice or other recognised Codes of Practice. * not met standards of good practice in the Credit Industry. * acted unfairly. There are some types of disputes that CIO are unable to consider which are specified in the CIO Rules and Guidelines. * if the complaint is about someone who is not a Member of CIO at the time the complaint is made. * if the complainant is not the person to whom the credit services in question were directly provided by the Member. * if a claim where the loss caused by the FSP's conduct is, or appears to be, more than $500,000. * if the complaint is being, or has previously been, dealt with by a court, tribunal, arbitrator or other dispute resolution scheme. * if the complaint is more appropriately dealt with by the courts or other procedure. =Cost= There is no fee for individuals or small businesses when making a complaint to the Credit and Investments Ombudsman all costs are covered by the scheme members.

It is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed. The device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields, such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected. It is named for Wilhelm Wien who developed it in 1898 for the study of anode rays. It can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer, monochromator, or mass spectrometer. Theory Any charged particle in an electric field will feel a force proportional to the charge and field strength such that \\\\vec{F} = q \\\\vec{E} , where F is force, q is charge, and E is electric field strength. Similarly, any particle moving in a magnetic field will feel a force proportional to the velocity and charge of the particle. The force felt by any particle is then equal to \\\\vec{F} = q \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}, where F is force, q is the charge on the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and \\\\times is the cross product. In the case of a velocity selector, the magnetic field is always at 90 degrees to the velocity and the force is simplified to F = qvB in the direction described by the cross product. Setting the two forces to equal magnitude in opposite directions it can be shown that \\\\frac{E}{B} = v. Which means that any combination of electric (\\\\vec{E}) and magnetic (\\\\vec{B}) fields will allow charged particles with only velocity \\\\vec{v} through.

Holley (later Hofman, May 17, 1910 - December 15, 1995) was a US track and field athlete who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics and went on to many years of service in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Holley was the first child born to Harry and Grace Holley living in Visalia, California. Harry was a successful water resources civil engineer during the otherwise challenging Great Depression in the United States. While being raised by college graduates the family encountered the Bah√° º√≠ Faith circa 1917 and were part of the organized community when they elected their first local Spiritual Assembly in 1925. Holley attended her mother's alma mater, Leland Stanford Junior University starting in the fall of 1926 when she was 16 years old. Her freshman year she was noted in the school newspaper active in the debate club as well as performing piano and was accepted into the Delta Delta Delta sorority. That year she also made the newspaper being named to the all-star women's basketball team. With the advent of women participating in track and field in the 1928 Summer Olympics, women's sports was covered in the newspapers much more, and records were being set and beaten often - and Holley was among the Stanford leaders and received significant coverage including beyond the college newspaper. She also served in management arenas of college and then inter-college organization of women's sports. This pattern of success included advancing into those 1928 Olympics where she specializing in the high jump, (in the era before the Fosbury Flop.) Though she only placed 9th ultimately, her success back in Stanford reached the point of the leading scorer of overall achievement the following year and winning the presidency of the regional women's athletics association her junior year in college. She was also listed in a Bah√° º√≠ directory of contacts though she had not been named active in the college club of Bah√° º√≠s or their meetings. Things changed significantly her senior year of 1929-1930. Holley took a year's advanced studies at University of California at Berkeley but from the standpoint of newspaper coverage, the biggest change is she did not appear in any sports coverage other than to advocate for women participating in the Olympics. She was not noted in any sports activity whatsoever. She returned to Stanford the fall of 1930 for her final semester, joined Phi Beta Kappa and graduated with honors. She returned to Visalia and was elected to the Spiritual Assembly of Visalia however she felt agnostic about God and alienated from the community. She has not written about this time in any available record though in a couple years she would address the challenges youth faced in American society, as well as matters of faith. What is known is that two significant women of the religion stayed at the Holley home, did not discuss religion or her situation with her, but she was in a position to see and hear them. Particularly Holley was impressed by Keith Ransom-Kehler, soon to leave on a trip among many countries in which she would soon lay down her life. As a result, in early 1932, Holley made a formal declaration of faith at a meeting of the Pasadena Local Spiritual Assembly. By June it was announced Holley was part of the committee to put together volume 5 of the Bah√° º√≠ World series covering worldwide developments in the religion for 1932-1935. From 1932 Holley would be visible in newspapers and magazines inside and outside the religion in various circumstances. She was a leader in a multifaith World Youth Council held in Los Angeles, was appointed to the first Bah√° º√≠ National Youth Committee, contributed articles to all major Bah√° º√≠ periodicals of Star of the West, World Order, and multiple volumes of Bah√° º√≠ World while also being covered in Bah√° º√≠ News while in America. She was a leading figure performing the first survey of Bah√° º√≠ youth circa 1935‚Äì6 and aided the development of support programming at all three major Bah√° º√≠ schools in America as a member of their faculty and suggesting reforms - Geyserville (the precursor of Bosch), Louhelen where the largest concentration of youth was to be found and the most developments occurred at, and Green Acre. She also coordinated communications among youth and awareness of youth in other countries. She and Bah√° º√≠ institutions received direct support for this wave of development from Shoghi Effendi, then leader of the religion. Then, as part of a nationwide implementation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° applied by Shoghi Effendi and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States, Holley began to coordinate a regional project of outreach for the religion in southern California based on youth engagement and bringing in people from larger Bah√° º√≠ communities to places there wasn't any Bah√° º√≠ presence or where only a small community existed. For herself, this was the small Bah√° º√≠ community in San Bernardino, California though her affect was greater in coordinating work across many cities of California as part of the regional teaching committee. Holley was also particularly impressed with May Maxwell during this period and would later call her her spiritual mother arriving at a unity of intellectual and heartfelt life as a Bah√° º√≠. From there Holley moved to San Francisco and began some years mostly speaking at a local Bah√° º√≠ Center or on early AM radio or the not very distant Geyserville Bah√° º√≠ School. She would be employed at the time in city budgeting but also be visible associated with a philanthropic non-profit. She had also begun correspondence with her future husband, David Hofman, another youth she had encountered through Maxwell and been in-coordination on youth activity who had returned to England after being in Canada and the US for a period of time. They married in 1945. She moved to the UK, was elected to their National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles the next year, and would serve on their National Teaching Committee. Later she would be appointed as an Auxiliary Board Member assisting former Anglican minister George Townshend now identified as a Hand of the Cause of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The Hofmans would pioneer or move to various cities in the UK for the establishment or growth of the religion and Marion was noted herself giving various presentations and classes in the UK and as part of European-continental meetings, visible in the Journal of the Bah√° º√≠ community of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the American Bah√° º√≠ News, as well as individual community histories. In 1963 the Bah√° º√≠s world wide reached the point of electing their leading institution for the first time, the Universal House of Justice, to which her husband was elected. Management of the UK publishing company George Ronald was shifted to be run by her even as the family moved to Haifa, Israel, where the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre had been established. After about 12 years management of George Ronald by her, it was shifted to a son of theirs. The Hofmans would make trips to Bah√° º√≠ communities around the world and then David retired, after being re-elected consistently, in 1988. The couple returned to Oxford, UK, and they would make appearances at various conferences and Bah√° º√≠ schools until her health ebbed. She died in 1995 in London, UK. David Hofman died in May 2003. Early days Born May 17, 1910, Marion Elizabeth Holley Hofman was the first child of Grace Bruckman and Harry Holley. Bruckman was a Leland Stanford Junior University graduate and while there was a social organizer, and violinist some years previous. In 1905 Bruckman was employed as an assistant in the Physics Department. Harry was a waterworks civil engineer.They married by 1910 and lived in Visalia, CA and was employed from 1917 with the Kaweah and St. John's River associations during some court battles over river management. There is very little about the family or Marion before her college years. Mother Grace and daughter learned of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith from about 1917 from Disciple of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° Isabella D. Brittingham. Brittingham was in Portland Oregon in 1917, had been there before,and had a residence in Santa Barbara in 1918. Grace was secretary of the Visalia Bah√° º√≠ Spiritual Assembly in 1925, the year of its first election. Youth Marion had experiences in college such that she lost her faith in God and encountered some kind of crisis as commented on by Bah√° º√≠ sources. The details are not clear but after this she wrote of the challenge youth face after her college career. Certainly, she was popular and her academic success was not just in sports though the public commentary about her college career was remarkable because of her sports achievements. She followed her mother attending Stanford University. =Stanford= 1926-7 freshmen year In 1926, at the age of 16, Holley was a member of the Stanford women's debate team. Her team's position, already in the lead among the audience before the debate, increased its lead after. She studied social sciences at Stanford but it was not commented on by the public coverage of her career. Though there is a lack of coverage on her sports activities up to this point, in the spring freshman semester at Stanford Holley was a named member of the women's all-star basketball team. This is the first sign of her athletic career that could characterize most of her college career as documented in the newspapers. That year she was also accepted by the Delta Delta Delta sorority. She was also in the Women's Glee Club concert broadcast on KFRC as part of an instrumental trio playing the piano to Drigo's \\"Serenade\\". In May Holley broke records in the running broad jump as it was called then called, and high jump. 1927-8 sophomore year With the announcement of women's participation in the 1928 OlympicsIt was also the first Olympics where women wore shorts in any event. See coverage of women sports activities at Stanford increased and Holley was one of those whose achievements were taken more and more note of. At 17 at her first meet of the sophomore year she won 50-yard dash, high jump and the team relay race for the Northern California Athletic Club. Soon after, she tied in the high jump, set a campus record in the hop step and jump, and in an event in October came behind another in the high jump because she set a new world record. Holley was also the sophomore field hockey captain. In February Holley was named to a committee that managed a three-college meet that year held at Stanford. For the event Holley was a sports official for the basketball events. It was also announced she would train for the Olympics. Richard Templeton was her coach. She also played as the forward of the sophomore women's basketball team, and was the basketball manager for the teams. She was noted representing Stanford in a track meet in March, and in April was recognized as one of five women to try-out to join the Stanford Daily student newspaper. Holley also attended exhibition fundraising for the Olympics. In May Holley set a new record for throwing a basketball on campus and then went on to a weekend meet. Holley was nominated for the Women's Athletics Association (WAA) Board vice-presidency in the spring semester and won. Holley set a new Stanford high-jump record that summer, and made the 1928-9 all-star track team for Stanford but was not a point leader in overall sports achievement. That summer Holley was also elected to the campus \\"Women's 'S' Society\\". Holley took third place in the regional trials for the Olympics in the high jump though she had improved her height 2\\" at the meet. The list of contenders for the final Olympic trials was trimmed among fundraising limits to 20 in June and the Pacific teams headed to Newark, NJ for the American finals. She tied for second place in the high jump there, passing the trials, to join the American Olympic team in July.  Ultimately she placed 9th in the high jump at the Olympics held in Amsterdam, Holland. She was photographed with Doris Metcalf, and Rose Mallor. See also Women at the Olympics. She returned aboard the S S President Roosevelt, Aug 22, 1928.institutional link; individual link, New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 for Marion Holley, 1928; Ancestry.com. 2010. 1928-9 Junior year At the junior year at Stanford in November Holley was the field hockey junior team center forward. She also joined the 3rd annual student session of the Institute of Pacific Relations among the 25 delegates. The group discussed racism towards far-eastern Orientals. She was also listed in the Baha ºi World directory as attending Stanford her junior year. In January Holley was elected captain of the juniors basketball team, one of four block 'S' lettered women, and was on the All-Star basketball team, as well as the Junior Class team. Holley was elected president of WAA and was a delegate to the nation conference of the organization. While there she presented a paper on how the Olympics connect with women's athletics in college, and co-lead a discussion as part of the Sixth Annual Athletic Conference of American College Women (ACACW) when it had opposed women further participating in the Olympics with a result of the ACACW changing the position. Holley was again on the tri-college meet committee a week later. In the meet of juniors and freshmen Holly won the 50 and 100 yard dash, the high jump, and the running broad jump, (out of 11 events total.) Holley was then named to the New Gymnasium Committee, (later named \\"Roble Gymnasium Building\\".) The plans for the new gymnasium for women had been submitted for approval and the 1929-30 committee would advance the work for a new women's gym. In the May, inter-class meet Holley was the overall high-point winner while breaking the campus record in the broad jump she had set herself, winning three first places on her own and being on the winning team of the relay. She won the 100 yard dash, 100 yard low hurdles, and running broad jump. Though the seniors won the overall standing the news lead that Holley broke three campus records in the final inter-class meet of the year, in running broad jump, basketball throw, and 100 yard dash. She was the individual point champion making the highest points possible. Over the same period Holley also addressed a discussion of the women's gymnasium in the campus newspaper co-writing a letter-to-the-editor defending the progress made in getting a new gym for women. She continued to serve advocating for the new gym into May. And as president of the WAA, Holley and her appointed team of people updated the WAA handbook following the revision of the election procedures for the organization, (so now the looser for president automatically becomes vice-president.) That summer the Holley's had a guest summer of 1929 - Holley's roommate Joyce Lyon (later Dahl) was invited to Visalia and their high Sierra cabin, after both Lyon and the Holley's went to the 3rd Geyserville Bah√° º√≠ School, a precursor of Bosch Bah√° º√≠ School, and the family exchanged Christmas gifts for the end of 1929 (or 1930.) Though Bah√° º√≠s were visible in the campus newspaper, and the club existed across several of her years there, she never appeared associated with the Bah√° º√≠s on campus. She was listed in the Baha ºi World directory as attending Stanford for 1928-9. Senior year However, instead of continuing her career at Stanford there is a sign of disruption. Suddenly in fall of 1929 Holley was not at Stanford but had arranged to do a year of advanced work at the University of California at Berkeley in anthropology with Professor Edward Winslow Gifford. And she was not mentioned in any 1930 sports coverage or thereafter, save for contributing to a report recommending the Olympic games for women; the committee suggested better health conditions and opportunities for meeting socially with other athletes be allowed. But she was back at Stanford in the fall of 1930 - she was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society in November 1930, and finished as part of the Stanford class of 1930. Sources say she finished her Stanford degree summa or magna cum laude. =After College= Crisis Though home from college, and serving on the Bah√° º√≠ assembly in Visalia, she felt agnostic and alienation from the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. During this time her family was visited by leading Bah√° º√≠ women Martha Root and Keith Ransom-Kehler. Root was in the San Francisco area in the Fall/Winter of 1930-1 before going to the Geyserville Bah√° º√≠ School in January 1931and then in Feb a guest of the Bosches - * She was brought down from the San Francisco area by Ella Cooper - while Ransom-Kehler left for a world- wide trip from San Francisco in the early winter of 1931-2. Though Ransom- Kehler did not specifically discuss the religion with her, Ransom-Kehler gave many talks per week and Holley gained an intellectual appreciation for the religion and re-declared to the Pasadena Bah√° º√≠ Spiritual Assembly in early 1932. In another year Holley would begin writing in part about the difficulties youth faced. Activity In June 1932 it was announced Holley was a committee member for producing the Bah√° º√≠ World volume 5. To it she contributed an article ‚ÄúA new cycle of human power‚Äú saying in part ‚Äú‚Ä¶whether the evidence is small or great, local or universal, it indicates an attitude which has pervaded our society - an attitude minimizing the possibilities of the spiritual, or, if you prefer, disregarding those non- material values which contribute so profoundly to character\\" and ends underscoring the ‚Äúchallenge which demands investigation‚Ä¶ For what right does any man walk abroad, and call himself a citizen of the world, if be not cognizant of its condition and enamored of its promise?‚Äù In August Holley was chair of the multi-religious commission of the World Council of Youth as a representative of the US Bah√° º√≠ National Assembly. It met at the California Institute of Technology organized by the Youth Division of the Olympic Games and the Junior Council of International Relations of Southern California with the intention of making it a regular part of the Olympics. Four sud-divisions formed - history, international understanding, future activity, and the place of religion in the world. Bah√° º√≠s were themselves explicitly mentioned. Marion herself wrote an article about the meeting for the Bah√° º√≠ periodical Star of the West printed October, and referred to it as ‚Äúa mental counterpart of the Olympic Games‚Äù, and that it included 3 Bah√° º√≠s. She summarized the conclusions of the group saying they arrived at an understanding of a shared core teachings of religions but a diverse and obstructive secondary aspect dividing religions - its social laws and the problem of confusing form with fundamentals. They also arrived a five point list of the needs of modern religion: religion must satisfy the intellect, religion must aid the development of culture, religion must strive to abolish prejudices and rivalries, religion must increase humanitarian activities while developing spiritual life to avoid being too-absorbed in alleviating suffering, and religion must cultivate recreation and a balanced life between body and spirit. Another article on the event was done by Nellie French, who noted the age limit of 30 year-old for participants. In the December issue of World Unity Magazine, another article by Holley reviewing the meeting appeared saying in part ‚ÄúUnorthodox youth, international and organized, has for the first time in unremembered years rallied to religion.‚ÄùIn answer to a letter by French about the Council meeting Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, wrote in part ‚ÄúThe activities, hopes and ideals (of youth) are close and dear to my heart. Upon them rests the supreme and challenging responsibility‚Ä¶. Theirs is a mighty task, at once holy, stupendous and enthralling.‚Äù In November Holley's article of her experience later at Geyserville Bah√° º√≠ School was published. In early 1933 it was published in Bah√° º√≠ News Holley was a member of the new national youth group-cum-committee formed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States in consultation with Shoghi Effendi - in fact mother Grace and daughter Marion were both on the committee and Marion was the secretary. Holley presented the report of the Youth Committee to the national Bah√° º√≠ convention in April. She reported the agreed on goals of the committee on youth activities was to 1) educate themselves and 2) educate their contacts. For local youth groups the committee also underscored the need for elasticity of organization and suggested a method of focus - an informal gathering for discussion of youth under a chair and gradually draw the group towards a systematic study of the Bah√° º√≠ teachings - and that a course be taught to train individuals in this approach. After her and Mary Maxwell's presentations (some four years before Maxwell's marriage to Shoghi Effendi,) the youth separated to their own meeting and later returned to the general convention with a contribution towards the building of the Bah√° º√≠ Temple. The summer of 1933 Holley was a faculty at the Pacific Coast Bah√° º√≠ School held in Geyserville and was still living in Visalia, CA. and an article she contributed to Star of the West was published in which she spoke of the chaos youth are facing: ‚ÄúThey cannot cement a defunct family tie, outline a normal ethics, or steer bizarre night life into the channels of sane recreation‚Äù and refers to the recent dinner held at the national convention with youth speaking with a depth of heart and attachment to Shoghi Effendi. An August 1933 letter of Shoghi Effendi directed that the youth committee seek a broad international body of active youth to help \\"spread the Holy Word‚Äù. In later 1933 Holley became a contributing editor to Star of the West. In January 1934 Holley contributed an article of an interview with Norman Thomas to Star of the West. Thomas was a socialist candidate for president in 1932. In March Holley attended the 7th annual conference of the Los Angeles Girls' Council about coping with the changing world - her talk was entitled 'Religion'. In May the report of the youth committee including Holley was published in Bah√° º√≠ News. It included a recommendation modeled on the World Youth Council of ‚Äúinformal discussion groups for strangers, organized about some inquiry such as ‚ÄúThe place of religion in society.‚Äù It also suggested a census be taken of youth to see about filling requests for presenters on the religion and a national campaign be based on national issues, as well as attention to the progress of youth into roles of active mature responsibility. The youth committee had asked assemblies to appoint local youth to committees \\"not over 25 years of age\\" and initiated contacts with some 15 Bah√° º√≠ youth groups in other countries and 17 groups in America in preparation for a survey the results of which would be for inclusion in Bah√° º√≠ World volume 5 and also was promised 3 articles by youth in it. In January letters were sent to the local groups outlining the plan for a campaign of 6 weeks to publicize the religion. In February, a letter asking for names of people 15 to 21 who might be subject to being drafted and to be a means for Assemblies to approve their status as public speakers of the religion. The committee submitted an outline of a class as a suggestion for assemblies for their youth. The committee was also working on a youth newsletter, a specific program at Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School while members supported all three schools, and coordination with youth newsletters in Australia and Hawaii. That summer Holley was also faculty at the Louhelen Bah√° º√≠ School teaching a course in effective leadership in the 4 day youth conference. It was also published that Holley continued to work on the Bah√° º√≠ World committee. Holley also kept up a column in the weekly Pasadena Star by Nellie S. French when she was away in Europe during the summer, as well as being among the public speakers for the religion in Los Angeles during the year. That Fall an update pointed out Holley was the committee's secretary and now living in Glendale, CA. Holley published part 1 of an article in Star of the West in October reviewing the dark social context into which the B√°b appeared. (succeeding parts, if published, have not been identified.) Communities of youth working for the promulgation of the religion were excited but struggled with the age limit. The committee highlighted the example of success as the Montreal Youth Group. The endeavors of the youth committee were again encouraged on behalf of Shoghi Effendi saying in part to ‚Äúcreate a new spirit of service, and of common devotion to the Cause among young and intelligent Bah√° º√≠s‚Ä¶.\\" During the year Holley also listed Holley among the speakers at the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in the year. During 1934 Marion's mother grew ill and would not be visible in Bah√° º√≠ activities though she would live another 30 years. And Holley worked with May Maxwell and was much affected by her - seeing a unity of spiritual and intellectual contributions to life in action - resulting in Holley speaking of May Maxwell as her spiritual mother. It was also through Maxwell that Holley met her future husband and they began to correspond long distance. In the summer of 1935 new pamphlet by Holley was listed available in Bah√° º√≠ News - The Most Great Peace \\\\- and Holley chaired a meeting of Bah√° º√≠s at the California Pacific International Exposition. In later 1935 the overall sized of the youth committee was increased and its basis also regionalized - with Holley secretary of the Pacific coast group. This regionalization was so that members could more directly support local youth groups and address their problems as well as foster regional youth conferences and was felt more in line with the guidance of Shoghi Effendi. The youth committee report for 1935 noted Holley as its overall secretary and that there were 43 localities in America that could be reached where youth lived, with 30 organized groups with them, and 49 other localities around the world. Among the regional groups mentioned in the report was one for northern and southern California that succeeded best with inter-group cooperation and a Naw-R√∫z celebration marked by youth from sixteen countries participating, a youth group was forming to assist the Geyserville school, and assemblies were being asked to sponsor youth delegates for each region for its school's youth program. The newsletter Bah√° º√≠ Youth had begun in December 1935 to be published quarterly. And there was news of teams of youth to promulgate the religion in Los Angeles and San Francisco and that some committee members had now moved abroad. Overall some 200 youth between 15 and 21 years of age had been identified though only six had actually registered with assemblies in order to serve on local committees. The expanded committee included Holley's future husband David Hofman. Holley received a letter from Shoghi Effendi in Feb 1936 commending the new publication Gleanings from the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h hoping it ‚Äúwill enable (youth) to gain a fuller consciousness of their functions and responsibilities, and to arise and set the example‚Ä¶‚Äù The Bah√° º√≠ World volume 6 committee reported in the Spring of 1936 that it felt the need to address the idea that communities didn't need keep materials in preparation for volume 7 already started and communities were bound to preserve records of activities that could be included in the reports, as well as a request contributors add transliteration marks on their own so committee members didn't have to, that two copies of printed matter be presented, to the committee and that the work of getting submissions has to be timely for the volume to be finished on time. Volume 6 was published in 1937 and included an article by Holley, ‚ÄúThe 'Most Great Peace; a new phase of human thought‚Äù. It also included the details of the survey of Bah√° º√≠ youth: ‚ÄúYouth activities through the Bah√°'√≠ World; an estimate and survey of international events 1934-1936‚Äù, written by her. Youth survey She noted that the survey was of necessity incomplete because of barriers of language and space. She named the first standard Bah√°'√≠ youth had to live up to as character in order to fulfill the work asked and that it had been previously neglected or overlooked or a feeling of shyness of being visible distinct had to be set aside. She named the qualities of character sought for as giving up intoxicants, presenting virtues in general and chastity in particular and of love. She then named the second standard for youth to strive for - the universality of oneness - and that achieving it in practice for the committee was a challenge and not usually obvious in other youth movements and groups because they do not aim at unity. She noted distinctions of age as a source of division at first occupying the committee to define and then to later abolish while continuing to suggest to communities that they advance the young into service and responsibility. It was her observation that youth had to originate ‚Äúa fresh imagination, a profound and mature originality‚Äù identifying and integrating people into one cohesive work. She identified that youth had been attracted to the B√°b√≠ Faith before and that waves of the young continued in each stage of leadership of the religion yielding \\"‚Ä¶a sense of greatness of the Cause, teaching by their example that devotion and reverence, that patient service.‚Äù She then highlighted then present examples of youth community in action. Her first was that of the youth of Flint MI who formed an assembly all of young people, (that even the few more elderly fit in naturally,) in September 1935. Their community was active with discussion, recreation, and traveling speakers stopping in. Aside from that singular community, she outlined a breadth of youth among existing communities. The fall 1935 survey found 28 organized groups of youth in America and a total of 61 localities with Bah√° º√≠ youth, 16 to 25 years old. She highlighted the London youth group as fielding a dynamic program of activities with a total of 25 Bah√° º√≠s there. Then she pointed out the success of teams presenting the religion specifically in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, where non-Bah√° º√≠s played central roles of bringing events together followed by a brief discussion and then the floor was opened up. Such work brought unity, she claimed. Inter-community conferencing was successful at raising levels of activity. A national youth conference held during the 1934 national convention had attracted 73 youth and a lively round-table discussion. A need she identified is that of a closer geography - that centers of activity around New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles existed as well but the densest and largest area was the Midwest from Urbana-Peoria to Milwaukee- Kenosha who met at Louhelen Bah√° º√≠ School in 1935 and other regional meetings. Indeed across America by far the largest gathering of youth to 1936 was at Louhelen. She noted a group of Iranian youth in Paris succeeding as a community at conferences, a group in Baghdad, Sydney, Maui (with a large Japanese group being a uniquely diverse group,) Beirut and Qazvin, Iran, Belgrade, and Tokyo. With the burgeoning work accelerating, the report outlined that the US was divided into three regions to better assist and understand local action came about as a follow-up of the national assembly doing this to expedite its own business following the natural concentration around the three Summer Schools. She noted the first regional youth conference in 1934 at Louhelen (aka the Central State Summer School) and the group of almost 50 there elected a Youth Council - an event that was responded to by Shoghi Effendi. Sixty attended the next year and their Youth Council sent a letter to Shoghi Effendi summarizing the spirit and classes offered and to which he replied August 3. Though Geyserville and Green Acre had not achieved independent youth conferences they were both taking steps of specialized offerings for youth. The 1935 Geyserville youth were summarized as: 15 youth, 15 to 25 years old, plus 17 for 10 to 14 years old, and 13 for 7‚Äì9 years old. The Geyserville school was looking at establishing a small youth newsletter among the Western states. Green Acre had three classes for youth held one weekend in 1934, but not enough had committed to attend a 1935 follow-up noting the expense and remoteness of the school relative to the youth population centers and resources. The 1936 religious census conducted by the United States government reported 2,584 adult Bah√° º√≠s. Summer schools were also noticed in Germany back to 1932 though now youth could only participate in general meetings because of a legal proscription of youth participating in any coordinated youth activities other than the Nazi youth brigades. Communications was referenced next in the report. Australia already had an ongoing youth section of its national Bah√° º√≠ newspaper. The American Bah√° º√≠ News had published many articles and news from the committee and the committee had itself sent an occasional newsletter out hoping it will grow into an international Bah√° º√≠ Youth quarterly newsletter. Youth were also encouraged to attend the 19 day Feasts from 1934. A separate article reviewed youth in Iran. Holley managed to encourage a youth meeting in Japan. In America Holley advanced a practice of coordinated round-robin letters for isolated individuals and inter-community meetings for others. Adding regional efforts In May 1936 Holley also published ‚ÄúSources of community life‚Äù in World Order Bah√° º√≠ magazine. That month also saw the beginning of the implementation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan promulgating the religion across America and Latin America. In the summer Holley was published as a member of the Bah√° º√≠ World volume 7 and Contacts committees and not on the youth committee, and served a session at Geyserville school. The task of the Contacts committee was to engage receptive individuals in correspondence about the religion. In December 1936 Holley's article on  ªAbdu'l-Baha's seven candles of unity part on political unity was published in World Order. Holley was mentioned working with the San Bernardino community following some public presentations resulting in the interest of setting up a Bah√° º√≠ study class. Before spring 1937 Holley's efforts in San Bernardino had others cooperating and reaching out to Yucaipa and Big Bear, CA. By spring 1937 a new regional committee for California, Arizona and Nevada had Holley as a member.2 Their report mentioned the extension of work promoting the religion started out of Los Angeles and reached out to cities Riverside, Covina, La Jolla, San Diego, Long Beach, San Bernardino, Pine Knot, Chula Vista, Santa Paula, Santa Barbara, Glendale, Pasadena, and Van Nuys with some cities setting up regular classes and symposia or visiting isolated Bah√° º√≠s who can host a social gathering. In March Holley gave a talk in San Diego on the religion. Before the summer 1937 a picture of Holley was circulated among the youth as a seed effort to youth sending their own pictures and groups and contact information. Holley taught classes at the Geyserville and then at the summer youth session at Louhelen where Holley lead informal youth sessions in the evening for a half hour followed by programs as planned by the youth overseen by Garreta Busey as well as being of the faculty for the 1st general session on the ‚ÄúScience of the love of God‚Äù class. Attendees were attracted from Buffalo, NY. During her service in 1937 Holley made the suggestion of a practicum, a \\"laboratory\\" session, for students which became standard practice. Then Holley went on to the Green Acre season helping out with Sunday devotional services and Friday evening discussions. Holley also visited the Philadelphia, West Hempstead, and New Haven communities for Bah√° º√≠ events. In August she spoke to a study class on the religion in San Luis Obispo, CA. For the 1937-8 commitment to national committees, Holley was part of Bah√° º√≠ World volume 7 and Contacts committees again, and not youth or the regional committee for California/Arizona/Nevada. In the summer Holley was at Louhelen again and also aided the Montreal community celebrate the 25th anniversary of the visit of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° with several speaking engagements and a short radio address. A review of the progress establishing the religion before the end of the year mentions Holley moving to Huntington, WV. In February Holley was part of a symposium on World Youth Day Baha ºi Center in the Beaux Arts Building in Los Angeles. Holley also contributed a radio talk \\"What future for youth\\" Dorothy Baker called \\"a vigorous viewpoint on world affairs.\\" She was also among the speakers at the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship again 1937. San Francisco 1939 was another low point in the visibility of her activity but there was some news - in March Holley spoke to a meeting in San Francisco for Bah√° º√≠ Naw-R√∫z, was in Geyserville in July, and returned to San Francisco where she gave another talk in September. In Feb 1940 Holley gave a talk at a Baha ºi meeting held at Sutter St., just down the street from their new Center opened in July. A session in how the religion was spreading in Latin-America held in Colorado Springs in June had Holley as part of a symposium on the topic of progressive revelation. She then took part in the memorial service for May Maxwell and wrote her \\"in memoriam\\" article for Baha ºi World volume 8. Bill and Marguerite Sears marriage was arranged in San Francisco by Holley during their visit out there for a radio broadcast Bill did in September 1940. In April 1941 Holley was one of the two official observers representing the national assembly to international peace meetings associated with the League of Nations. Holley was a faculty in the Geyserville school in the July giving talks on the \\"essentials of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith\\", public speaking, open discussion, and in comparison of the Bible, Qur ºan, and Bah√° º√≠ scriptures for youth. Following Holley spoke at the San Francisco Baha ºi Center, and at a meeting in Berkeley. Holley was also among the speakers for a series of talks across the country in the fall of 1941. In 1942-4 Holley embarked on a series of talks more or less monthly in San Francisco and was employed as a budget analyst for the city of San Francisco. In March 1942 Holley spoke twice, after a series she held in Reno, NV.In April Holley was among the delegates to the national convention for the San Francisco area. In May she was back giving talks in San Francisco. The preliminary program for Geyserville for 1942 had Holley on a class reviewing the Babi-Bah√° º√≠ era and Bah√° º√≠ views of prophecies. In 1942-3 Holley was named to the national teaching committee. In October she presented a talk in San Francisco, and in November Holley was named the advisor to the national youth committee she had originally helped form and gave a talk at the local library in San Francisco. September 1943 Holley gave a talk and again in October, twice in December, and was also on radio KYA. Holley continued her twice-a-month talks into January 1944and returned to giving a talk in April and as part of a symposium panel in Maybefore joining in the Centenary Convention program giving a talk ‚ÄúGrowth of the American Baha ºi Community to 1944‚Äù which was later published as an article in World Order in September and was also included in volume 10 of Bah√° º√≠ World. In June she was back in San Francisco giving a talk, co-presented a talk September, and returned to the radio as well. Another talk in October was followed in December with the co-written ‚ÄúThe call to unity‚Äù published in World Order. Holley co-presented at the 1945 San Francisco community Naw Ruz festival and was back on radio KYA a few days later. Another talk followed in mid-May and she appeared at a birthday event saying she was affiliated with the San Francisco Community Chest. That July she was in Geyserville and Isobel Sabri was moved by her talk in one class.‚ÄúPortraits of Some Baha ºi Women‚Äù pp. 158-9 In October 1945 a book review of World Order of Bah√° ºu'll√°h was published and one day she received a telegram asking for her to marry David Hofman. Soon it was announced she would leave for England about to marry David Hofman. In August 1946 Arthur Dahl credited the work of Marion Holley as key to his article on the UN meeting in 1945 in San Francisco and wanted to give her co- writing credit though she never saw his piece herself. The United Kingdom After her move to Britain records are less available. In October 1945 Marion came to the UK to marry David Hofman and was seen as of benefit to the growth of the religion there. In December a letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi recommend the national assembly ask Hofman to serve on the national teaching committee because of her recent experience. She soon served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles 1945/6-1962, and its national teaching committee 1945/6-1950. In October 1946 Hofman's (n√©e Holley) article ‚ÄúThe way of fulfillment‚Äù was published in World Order. In September the Hofmans were noted pioneering and generally the Hofmans were noted active in the growing UK Bah√° º√≠ community. In later 1946 or 47 Hofman gave a course on Bah√° º√≠ administration recalled by a pioneer to HollandEuropean Survey; Holland, Bah√° º√≠ News, Apr 1947, no 194, p. 8 and she attended a January 1947 conference of Bah√° º√≠s in Manchester during the severe Winter of 1946‚Äì47 in the United Kingdom with a booklet by Ruhiyyih Khanum. In October, Hofman was noted secretary of the national teaching committee. Hofman attended a meeting at held by Bah√° º√≠s before Ridv√°n 1948 in Cardiff and in August was noted back in the Berkeley, CA, area giving a talk. In November 1949 a spiritual assembly was elected in Oxford, UK with David Hofman chair and Marion vice-chair. At the 1951 summer school held in Holland Hofman was noted chairing the discussion meeting of the whole attendance following the reading of the latest message from Shoghi Effendi - and they were able share news the Hofmans had heard of events in Africa. The Hofman's were visited by friends from Geyserville in 1952. July 1953 the Hofmans co-chaired the international conference hosted in Sweden. 377 Bah√° º√≠s attended from 30 countries. Hofman noted that in anticipation of specific plans of buying sites for Bah√° º√≠ Temples money had already been donated, a substantial percentage of attendants has pledged to pioneer at the conference, and that atmosphere of success raised the spirits of all Bah√° º√≠s. Hofman wrote ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of God on Earth; idea and reality‚Äù included in Bah√° º√≠ World volume 12. In June 1954 Hofman was appointed to be an Auxiliary Board member to assist Hand of the Cause George Townshend.In later 1954 Hofman again came to Cardiff and in Feb 1955 the couple moved to Cardiff to preserve its assembly. In the spring of 1955 Hofman ‚Äúencouraged and assisted‚Äù a pioneer to Malta. Roushan Aftabi Knox recalled being told by Hofman that she was the youngest Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In 1956 Hofman wrote an account of her trip to the northern Isles of the UK as a member of the UK national assembly. She remarked on the people of Lerwick, the first public meeting in Shetland, and the earnest questions asked there and the Orkney Islands and recognized from time to time a native speaker as well as visitors from still further islands. Hoffman spoke at the national convention in 1958 about pioneering and then again at an international conference in Germany. The Benelux Bah√° º√≠ Summer School was held in July 1960 in Holland and Hofman contributed a presentation on the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Hofman's talk was recorded and shared subsequently. Following the sudden growth of the Cardiff community in 1959-1960, the Hofman's announced they were moving in September to London briefly before moving to Watford. In 1961 Spiritual Assembly of Pontypridd organized and held its first weekend school with Hofman among the speakers invited. Hofman reported nearly fifty people had attended. Hofman was scheduled to come to a Cardiff in August 1962. Since David Hofman's election to the Universal House of Justice in 1963 Marion was in charge of George Ronald Publishers by herself which she ran for some 12 years from Israel and she retired from the Auxiliary Board and service on the National Assembly. Meanwhile a weekend school for the Bah√° º√≠s in 1964 was held in Porthcawl at which Hofman was a presenter. Hofman's mother Grace died August 1964 and her father in 1965. In 1966 Rosey E. Pool learned from Hofman that Robert Hayden's poem \\"A Ballad of Remembrance\\", had not entered a competition and pursued its entry. Hofman began to serve on the research staff at the World Center. And Hofman was the first speaker at a public event in 1966 in Kendal, England. About 1975 or so the management of George Ronald Publishers was shifted to their son Mark and David and Marion went on travels around the world. Hofman was present for the election of the national assembly of Cyprus in 1977. In 1986 Hofman's biographical article for Hand of the Cause Hasan Balyuzi was published in Baha ºi World volume 18. Having been re-elected regularly since 1963, in 1988 David Hofman retired from the Universal House of Justice and the couple retired to Oxford, UK, and Hofman would become active again in Norway, Sweden, Holland, Czechoslovakia and Ireland. She died on December 5, 1995. The Hofmans had two children.  See also * Marion Carpenter Yazdi, another Bah√° º√≠ student of Stanford and Berkeley.

Each scheme envisaged building some form of rail tunnel along the Edgware Road in north-west London towards Victoria railway station. These proposals were made at a time of intensive railway construction, following projects such as City and South London Railway. Like several other proposals at the time, such as the City and Brixton Railway, none of the Edgware Road schemes came to fruition. Edgware Road and Victoria Railway The Edgware Road (pictured here at Shoot Up Hill, Kilburn) was traversed by the Metropolitan Railway and the LNWR, but plans were drawn up to drive a tube under the length of the road The Edgware Road and Victoria Railway (ER&VR;) was an early scheme for an underground railway under the Edgware Road. The promoters sought to raise capital of ¬£1.2 million (¬£ today) to cover the estimated railway construction costs of ¬£920,000 and the cost of constructing a dedicated power station for the railway at the Paddington Basin. The ER&VR; was planned to run on a north- west-to-south-east axis, more or less following the route of the Edgware Road. Beginning in the north, a surface-level depot was planned near the location of the present-day Brondesbury Park. Trains were to run into a tunnel to the first station. Passing south-east, the stations planned were:Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 62-63. *Brondesbury *Kilburn (close to Kilburn High Road) *Hall Road (close to Maida Vale) *Praed Street (close to Edgware Road) *Marble Arch *Hyde Park Corner *London Victoria A bill to allow the project to go ahead was considered by the House of Commons Select committee in March 1893. A number of petitions were made to the committee by property owners along the proposed route of the ER&VR;, concerned by the construction of a tube railway under their properties. The construction of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, part of today's Northern line) had given rise to a number of problems, such as building subsidence on top of brick-built station tunnels. As the C&SLR; was the first deep-level tube railway to be built, there were still concerns about construction and ventilation issues with this type of tunnel. To address these concerns, the route of the railway tunnel was moved slightly west between Marble Arch and Victoria so it would run under Hyde Park and avoid the affluent properties of Park Lane. Despite this, the committee was still not confident about the proposal to build another tube tunnel under London, and the bill was rejected. Cricklewood, Kilburn and Victoria Railway In 1898, the Cricklewood, Kilburn and Victoria Railway Construction Syndicate was incorporated to promote a similar project to the failed ER&VR.; Like the NWLR, the railway would have followed the Edgware Road route beginning further north at Cricklewood. The company was defeated by the passing of the NWLR's bill and the syndicate was dissolved in 1901. North West London Railway The proposal to build a railway under the Edgware Road was revived in 1899 when a group of engineers began to promote the North West London Railway (NWLR). The railway would have followed a similar route to the ill-fated ER&VR;, but was to begin further north at Cricklewood and would only run as far as Marble Arch. Its promoters included Sir Benjamin Baker, Sir Douglas Fox and Sir Francis Fox, and they had ¬£1.5 million capital and sought to borrow a further ¬£500,000. Although the bill to grant construction powers passed successfully through Parliament in 1899, there were difficulties raising the necessary funds. The only proven tube railway at the time, the C&SLR;, was not delivering a great return on investment, and investors were hesitant. The outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 destabilised the money markets and construction on the NWLR project never commenced.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 79-83. In 1902, the scheme was allowed an extension of time to begin construction, and an increase in tunnel size from 12' 6\\" to 13' 0\\". The next year a bill was presented proposing an extension to Victoria Station, under Hyde Park and Grosvenor Place. However the bill was withdrawn following its postponement due to the Royal Commission on London Traffic. It was to transpire that the Commissions' only recommended new 'tube' would be an extension of the North West London from Marble Arch to Victoria. In 1906, the NWLR reintroduced its Victoria extension along with a reduction in tunnel size to 11' 8¬º\\", receiving Royal Assent in August. However the financial conditions imposed on the Bill made the extension unattractive. Baker Street and Waterloo Railway alt=Route diagram showing line running from Paddington at left to Elephant & Castle at bottom right as before. A long branch extends diagonally from Edgware Road towards the top left ending at Cricklewood. The Edgware Road station on the Bakerloo Tube (now the Bakerloo line) When the NWLR's tube project became financially unviable, the company's plans were adopted in 1908 by a more successful underground railway company, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR;). The BS&WR; had already opened an underground line in 1906 from Baker Street to Waterloo and Elephant and Castle (the \\"Bakerloo\\" Tube), and had already extended its line to Edgware Road. The company was keen to extend further into north-west London and hoped to make use of the powers acquired by the (NWLR) to build the Edgware Road tube line.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 264-267. Abandoning the Marble Arch-Victoria section of the NWLR route, the BS&WR; instead proposed building the Edgware Road tube line only as far south as its Edgware Road station, which was close to the NWLR's planned route. The NWLR announced a bill in November 1908 seeking to construct a connection between its unbuilt route beneath the Edgware Road and the Bakerloo Tube's Edgware Road station. The Bakerloo Tube was to construct the extension and operate the service over the combined route, which was to have stations at St John's Wood Road, Abercorn Place, Belsize Road, (close to the LNWR station), Brondesbury (to interchange with the North London Railway's station and close to the MR's Kilburn station), Minster Road and Cricklewood.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 80-81. The Bakerloo Tube announced its own bill to make the necessary changes to its existing plans. At the same time, the BS&WR; also had aspirations to extend its services to . The company planned to make the Edgware Road route it main service, with a shuttle line running from Edgware Road to Paddington. Two additional platforms were planned at Edgware Road tube station for shuttle use. The BS&WR;/NWLR joint scheme faced opposition from other railway companies; the Great Western Railway (GWR) objected to the reduction of the Bakerloo Tube's Paddington connection to a shuttle; and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) objected to the connection of the two lines which would be in competition with its line through Kilburn. Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route, and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn. This was to be the first bill promoted by the NWLR that did not receive Royal Assent. Kearney High-Speed Tubes Sketches published in 1915 of Kearney's underground monorail system In 1905-08, the Australian-born engineer Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney put forward a plan to build two tube lines from Crystal Palace to Strand and Cricklewood. The scheme was promoted by the Kearney High- Speed Tube Railway Company Ltd. and proposed the construction of an underground railway operated on an unusual monorail system patented by Kearney. Trains would run on a single rail with four double-flanged wheels under each carriage; wheels mounted on the roof would run along an upper guide rail above the train. The trains, which were to be designed in a streamlined style similar to the London Underground 1935 Stock, would have a low centre of gravity, which, along with the gyroscopic effect of motion, would stabilise the train on the lower rail and reduce the side-to-side hunting oscillation. The stations were to be located just below the surface, connected by deep- level tube tunnels which would drop down steeply from each station; it was intended that the 1 in 7 track incline would enhance acceleration and deceleration between stations with the effects of gravity, with trains reaching before decelerating. This \\"roller coaster\\" system was promoted for its low power consumption.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 257-263. Kearney promoted his system by publishing leaflets, writing a book, giving lectures and he displayed a model of a Kearney train in 1905 for the press. The proposed route comprised two lines across London: one aligned along the Edgware Road route from Cricklewood via Victoria to Oval; and another from Strand to Crystal Palace, connecting with the Cricklewood line at Oval: Main route *Crystal Palace *Herne Hill *East Brixton *North Brixton *Oval *Vauxhall *Pimlico (not to be confused with the current station) *Victoria *Hyde Park Corner *Marble Arch *Edgware Road *Lord's (separate; not to be confused with the Metropolitan station) *Carlton Hill *Quex Road *Brondesbury *Cricklewood Branch from Oval *Kennington *Waterloo *Strand (later Aldwych) The Kearney Tube system was promoted in other unsuccessful schemes around the world, including New York City, Boston and Toronto. Metropolitan Railway alt=A line is shown at the bottom, from right to left, with stations at Baker Street, Edgware Road and junction before two Paddington stations. From Baker Street a line is shown going north through several stations before turning left. From Edgware Road a line in a contrasting colour is shown, going north bypassing these stations before joining the line from Baker Street just north of Kilburn & Brondesbury. The Metropolitan Railway's Edgware Road station By the 1920s the Metropolitan Railway (MR) had expanded its lines deep into the countryside of Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, successfully promoting its commuter services with the Metro-land advertising campaign. A high volume of traffic was running through its lines into central London via and a bottleneck had developed at where the fast and slow tracks converged into one pair. In 1925, the MR drew up plans to construct a relief line by digging new twin-bore tube tunnels under the Edgware Road, large enough to accommodate Met rolling stock. At a proposed junction north of Kilburn & Brondesbury station, Metropolitan trains would run down a tunnel into the extension line and run beneath Kilburn High Street, Maida Vale and Edgware Road; the line would then rise up to join the Inner Circle just to the west of Edgware Road Met station, and trains would continue to Baker Street. The plan included three new stations, at Quex Road, Kilburn Park Road and Clifton Road. In preparation for this new line, Edgware Road Met station was rebuilt with four platforms and was equipped with platform indicators which could display 'Aylesbury Line' and destinations such as and . However, the scheme was halted after new safety requirements were issued by the Ministry of Transport ‚Äî deep-level tube trains were now required to have an emergency exit at each end and the compartment stock used by the MR north of Harrow did not comply with this requirement. The capacity problem was later addressed after the MR had been taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). In 1936 the LPTB constructed a new tunnel to link the Metropolitan line to the Bakerloo line, enabling local Met services to be taken over by the Bakerloo line (later becoming the Jubilee line) and relieving congestion on the Inner Circle line.

It stars Richard Attenborough, Mara Wilson, Elizabeth Perkins, and Dylan McDermott, and is the first theatrical remake of the original 1947 film. Like the original, this film was released by 20th Century Fox. The New York City based Macy's department store declined any involvement with this remake, so the fictitious \\"Cole's\\" became its replacement. Gimbels had gone out of business in 1987; hence it was replaced by the fictional \\"Shopper's Express\\". Plot Cole's Department Store's special events director Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins) fires Tony Falacchi (Jack McGee) from being the Cole's Department Store's Santa Claus after he gets drunk before taking part in the Thanksgiving parade. Immediately trying to find a replacement, she spots an elderly man (Richard Attenborough) who was berating the inebriated Santa before the parade. When Dorey begs him to take over, he introduces himself as Kris Kringle. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be Cole's main Santa for the holiday period. All the children in New York begin to believe that he is the real Santa, with the exception of Dorey's six-year-old daughter Susan (Mara Wilson). Dorey's boyfriend, Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott), does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat one night by Kris, Susan shares with him her Christmas wish, she would like a dad, a house (used every year for the Cole's catalogue photoshoot) and a baby brother. Kris asks if she would begin to believe in Santa if she got all those things. Susan agrees that she would. Kris is credited with bringing in increasingly more sales to Cole's than previous years. One night, he is arrested for assaulting a man on the street, later revealed to be the original drunk Santa, Tony Falacchi. Falacchi had taken revenge by means of setting up Kris to be arrested, with the help of members of staff from a rival department store of Cole's, Shopper's Express. With the help of Bryan, Dorey takes Kris's case to court, and drums up support for him from the public. It soon becomes clear that to get Kris acquitted and freed, Bryan must somehow prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until Bryan comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan. Just as the judge (Robert Prosky) is about to make his decision ‚Äì and it seems he was going to rule against Kris ‚Äì Susan walks up to the judge with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill. On the back, the words In God We Trust are circled. The judge realizes that, since the US Department of Treasury can put its official faith in God on US currency with no hard evidence, then the people of New York can believe in Santa Claus in the same way. Left with no choice, the elated judge dismisses the case and declares that Santa is real, existing in the person of Kris Kringle. Following the court case, Dorey and Bryan are maneuvered by Kris into realizing their true feelings for each other, and are married in a very small ceremony right after the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning, Susan wakes to the news of the marriage (via the bright reflections of Dorey's engagement ring on the Christmas tree) and is elated to see that she has part one of her Christmas wish, Bryan as her new step-dad. Together, Susan, Dorey and Bryan drive out to the catalogue house and upon arrival, find that Kris has arranged for them to purchase the house, which they can now afford due to the size of the Christmas bonus Dorey has received as a result of Kris's work at Cole's. Susan, now having got two out of three of her wishes, excitedly runs upstairs in the house to look at her bedroom. Dorey and Bryan are about to kiss when Dorey ask her what the last part of her Christmas wish was, and she triumphantly announces that it was a baby brother. Dorey and Bryan both look at each other, shocked, before glancing down at Dorey's stomach and sharing a kiss. The film ends with the belief that Susan has now received all she asked for in her wish. It is mentioned that Kris has gone overseas. Cast * Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, said to be the real Santa Claus.

History The demise of Tuam Town F.C. in 1973, led a group of players who played at the old racecourse in Parkmore, to convene a meeting with the idea of forming a new club. A meeting was held in Tuam C.B.S (now St. Patrick's College) on Monday 18 February 1974 to found a new club. Initially a fee of 25 pence was set for membership cards to be sold to players and supporters. Registered players had to pay ¬£1 with a fee of 10 pence per week. During a meeting held on 1 October 1975, it was proposed that a Board of Trustees would be formed and each would invest ¬£1000 over two years in the Tuam Celtic Development Fund. Grounds were eventually purchased at Cloonthue Road, Tuam which is now the club's permanent home. In 1996, the club added floodlights and built dressing rooms at Cloonthue. The grounds, training pitches and facilities are wholly owned by the club, a testament to many years of voluntary fund raising by club members.http://homepage.eircom.net/~jimmymack/history.htm In 2010 Tuam Celtic seniors won the Jack Lillis Cup with a 3 - 1 win over OLBC.

They were discovered in 1896 by M. J. M. Hill, a professor of mathematics at the University College London, who showed that they are scissor-congruent to a cube.  Construction  For every \\\\alpha \\\\in (0,2\\\\pi/3), let v_1,v_2,v_3 \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^3 be three unit vectors with angle \\\\alpha between every two of them. Define the Hill tetrahedron Q(\\\\alpha) as follows: : Q(\\\\alpha) \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\\\\\{c_1 v_1+c_2 v_2+c_3 v_3 \\\\mid 0 \\\\le c_1 \\\\le c_2 \\\\le c_3 \\\\le 1\\\\\\\\}. A special case Q=Q(\\\\pi/2) is the tetrahedron having all sides right triangles, two with sides (1,1,\\\\sqrt{2}) and two with sides (1,\\\\sqrt{2},\\\\sqrt{3}). Ludwig Schl√§fli studied Q as a special case of the orthoscheme, and H. S. M. Coxeter called it the characteristic tetrahedron of the cubic spacefilling.  Properties  * A cube can be tiled with six copies of Q. * Every Q(\\\\alpha) can be dissected into three polytopes which can be reassembled into a prism.  Generalizations  In 1951 Hugo Hadwiger found the following n-dimensional generalization of Hill tetrahedra: : Q(w) \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\\\\\{c_1 v_1+\\\\cdots +c_n v_n \\\\mid 0 \\\\le c_1 \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le c_n \\\\le 1\\\\\\\\}, where vectors v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n satisfy (v_i,v_j) = w for all 1\\\\le i< j\\\\le n, and where -1/(n-1)< w < 1.

One such temple is the Vishnupad Mandir in Gaya, India. Similarly, Buddha footprints are worshipped under the Bodhi Tree in Bodh Gaya. Paduka are the royal symbol in Malaysia. Seri Paduka denotes \\"His Majesty\\", which is a title bestowed as an honour of recognition to dignitaries of the Malaysian court.Detail of paduka on sculpture, Orissa State Museum, Bhubaneswar  Etymology  Painted Indian pƒÅduka collected by Hans Sloane (1660‚Äì1753). Now in the collection of the British Museum The Sanskrit word pƒÅduka is derivative of pƒÅda meaning 'foot'. This terminology was coined to define India's ancient archetypal footwear. Legends The word pada ('foot') is cited in the ancient Hindu scripture Rigveda as representing the universe, namely the Prithvi (earth), Vayu (air), Akash (sky) and the element of the realm beyond the sky. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, the cursed King Dasaratha sent his son Rama (an incarnation of god Vishnu) into exile for 14 years at the behest of his wife Kaikeyi (stepmother of Rama), who wanted her son Bharata to be crowned in Rama's place. However, Bharata did not wish to have the kingdom, and visited Rama in exile, beseeching him to return to Ayodhya. When Rama replied that he would return only after completing his exile, Bharata requested Rama's paduka to serve as his proxy, to be crowned and to serve as an object of veneration for Rama's followers. Bharata carried Rama's golden padukas with great reverence by placing them on his head as a mark of his obedience to his elder brother. Bharata ruled Kosala as Rama's proxy in the name of \\"Ram's Padukas\\". Construction Pandit woman wearing paduka . The footwear is typically a sandal, which has generally a wooden sole with a post and a stub to provide grip to the foot between the big and second toes. It is also known as Khadau, karrow, kharawan and karom, and used in the Indian subcontinent mostly by mendicants, saints and commoners. Made in the shape of the footprints, with two narrow and curved stilts, the design is specific to ensure that the principle of non-violence ‚Äì practised by the saintly followers of Hindu and Jain religions ‚Äì is not violated by accidental trampling of insects and vegetation. The Brahmins wearing such a paduka may be heard praying: \\"Forgive me Mother Earth the sin of injury, the violence I do, by placing my feet upon you this morning.\\" Padukas made of ivory were in popular use among royalty and saints. Hindu religious ethos requires that the ivory be taken from elephants which died naturally or harvested from domesticated elephants, in a manner which avoids cruelty. People of high societal status wear padukas made of fine teak, ebony and sandalwood and inlaid with ivory or wire. They are also made in the shape of fish as a symbol of fertility. Other forms of padukas worn on special occasions may be incised with silver or of wood covered with silver plates and sometimes adorned with bells to sound upon walking. Bronze and brass padukas may be worn for ritual and ceremonial use. A unique pair of wooden padukas have their toe knobs inlaid with ivory lotus flowers and are minutely painted. At each step, a trigger mechanism in the sole signals the lotus to open from bud to blossom. They are also made in the shape of an hourglass or with carved toes. Eighteenth-century footwear used as ritual wear made of \\"wood with bed of sharp iron spikes\\" has been found. It is inferred that it was meant to be used to inflict pain to the wearer to demonstrate his conviction in religious forbearance of pain. Veneration Paduka of saint Dnyaneshwar is carried in a palanquin in a silver bullock cart in procession from Alandi to Pandharpur Paduka is often gifted as part of a bride's dowry. They are worshipped and given as votive offerings by faithful believers. In a festival associated with the Hindu god Vithoba, pilgrims travel to his Pandharpur temple from Alandi and Dehu towns that are closely associated with poet-saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram (respectively), carrying the padukas of the saints in a silver palkhi (palanquin). A popular religious belief is of the contact (sparsh) with the salabhanjika sculpture yakshini's foot. It is said that when the yakshini encircles a dormant tree with her leg around it, it starts to blossom and bear fruit. Shalabhanjika yakshi is also an embellishment in the form of an architectural bracket in many Hindu temples. Another notable feature of veneration is of the goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. On Deepavali festival day, Lakshmi is devotionally ushered into the house through symbolic representation with a series of her footprints (paduka) drawn in paint or kolam and lit with oil lamps, from the main door to the private sanctum. This is done with the wish that good fortune shall be bestowed by her upon the householders. Below the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya where Buddha received enlightenment, there is a vacant throne that is adorned with the foot prints on a foot rest of the Buddha. This place is deeply venerated. =Vishnupad temple= These simple Padukas are worn by saints and mendicants. Vishnupada Mandir is said to enshrine the footprints of Vishnu. This footprint denotes the act of Vishnu subduing Gayasur by placing his foot on Gayasur's chest. Inside the temple, the footprint is imprinted in solid rock and surrounded by a silver-plated octagonal enclosure. The temple is in height and has 8 rows of elegantly carved pillars that support the pavilion. Within the temple precincts, the banyan tree called the 'Akshayabat' is located where the final rituals for the dead takes place. =Paduka Sahasram= Paduka Sahasram (literally meaning \\"1,000 verses on the padukas of the Lord\\") is devotional poetry extolling the virtues of worshipping the paduka (feet) of Vishnu, enshrined in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, Tamil Nadu. It is considered a sacred script of the Sri Sampradaya or Sri Vaishnavism. The Sahasram was composed in 1,008 verses in 32 chapters by Swami Vedantha Desika, a follower of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy. It is also said that Desika composed this as a challenge to his rival group of Tengalai Iyengars (who belonged to the southern school of the Srivaishnava philosophy) in one-quarter of a night. The eulogy of the Lord's Paduka centres around Rama's paduka, which ruled the kingdom of Ayodhya for 14 years. Desika propounds that it was due to the special relationship that people of Ayodhya had with Rama's paduka that they attained salvation in life. Paduka Poojan done during Satchidanand Utsav =Guru Paduka Sthothram= Adi Shankaracharya has also written nine devotional verses under the title \\"Guru Paduka Sthothram\\" as salutations to his guru (the Lord). An English translation of the first verse is: > Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru, Which is a boat, > which helps me, cross the endless ocean of life, Which endows me, with the > sense of devotion to my Guru, And by worship of which, I attain the dominion > of renunciation. = Satchidananda Utsav = Satchidananda Utsav (celebration of truth, consciousness and bliss) is organised by Sadguru Shree Aniruddha Upasana Trust (Mumbai, India) and celebrated every year on the second Saturday of Margashirsha (the ninth month of the Hindu calendar). It is usually performed for two to five consecutive days. The holy padukas worshipped during the celebration are prepared from the paper pulp of Ram Naam books issued by Aniruddha's Universal Bank of Ram Naam and written by thousands of devotees across the world.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shree-satchidanand-utsav- given-sadguru-aniruddha-bapu-mihir- nagarkarhttp://aniruddhafoundation.com/sacchidanand- utsav/https://www.ancient.eu/The_Ramayana/http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/rama/index.htm Gallery File:Indian paduka in fish shape, South Bengal - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00168.JPGPaduka at exhibit in the Bata Shoe Museum File:Indian paduka that sprays lotus water from its toe-knobs, undated - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00171.JPGExhibit in the Bata Shoe Museum File:Indian paduka, Jaipur, 18th century AD - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00046.JPGSilver paduka, Bata Shoe Museum File:Paduka - India.jpgSilver paduka, Bata Shoe Museum References External links *All about shoes: Padukas Clogs (shoes) Indian footwear Hindu symbols ","title":"Paduka"},{"id":"20700634","text":"Song of Summer is a 1968 black-and-white television film co-written, produced, and directed by Ken Russell for the BBC's Omnibus series which was first broadcast on 15 September 1968.Music web international It portrays the final six years of the life of Frederick Delius, when he was blind and paralysed, and when Eric Fenby lived with the composer and his wife Jelka as Delius's amanuensis. The title is borrowed from the Delius tone poem A Song of Summer, which is heard along with other Delius works in the film. It stars Max Adrian as Delius, Christopher Gable as Fenby, and Maureen Pryor as Jelka, with director Russell in a cameo role as a philandering priest. The cinematography was by Dick Bush, and the editing was by Roger Crittenden. It was shot on black-and-white 35mm film.VideoVista It has received wide praise since its first screening, and Ken Russell himself said it was the best film he ever made and he would not have done a single shot differently.Film Music on the Web Book Song of Summer was based on Eric Fenby's memoir Delius As I Knew Him (1936, republished in 1966), which recounts his experience of offering his services in transcribing Frederick Delius's music from the composer's dictation. The 66-year-old Delius, who lived with his wife Jelka and their servants at Grez-sur-Loing, 70 kilometres south of Paris, had never even heard of Fenby, a struggling 22-year-old composer and theatre organist living with his parents in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, but he accepted Fenby's unsolicited offer. Fenby stayed with the Deliuses at Grez, on and off for six years, until Delius's death in 1934. He had immense difficulties in dealing with the cantankerous, irascible and impatient composer (perhaps partly excused by his constant pain). Neither party had ever worked this way before, but Fenby was immediately expected to keep up with Delius's fast pace when dictating, and to make sense of his out-of-tune singing. He was also required to read for long stretches to Delius, the composer's favourite books being Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. Fenby was a devout Catholic and Delius hated Christianity, even going so far as to say that Fenby should not go to the local chapel but visit one further away. On his first visit home, Fenby had a nervous breakdown and lost the use of his own legs for two weeks. Later, Jelka needed to go for treatment for stomach cancer, and Fenby virtually became Delius's nurse for a month. Delius died only two days after Jelka returned. Eric Fenby coached actors Max Adrian (Delius) and Christopher Gable (Fenby) in their roles and regarded their portrayals as \\"absolutely true to character\\" and the film as \\"disturbingly lifelike\\".Some images from DVD Beaver However, he did not attend the actual filming, in order not to distract the director, and also on request from Christopher Gable, who was making his first film (he had previously been a dancer with the Royal Ballet). Max Adrian was a favourite actor of Ken Russell's. Adrian told Fenby that he had more difficulty in ridding himself of involvement in the role of Delius than he had ever experienced with other roles. Reception The film has often been described as the best of the biographical films Ken Russell made for the BBC in the 1960s.IMDb (He had previously made films about Bart√≥k, Elgar and Debussy, and would later make films about Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Liszt and others.) Words like \\"subtle\\", \\"sensitive\\", \\"exquisite\\", \\"moving\\", \\"beautiful\\", \\"poignant\\", \\"magical\\", \\"exceptional\\" and \\"tour de force\\" recur in critiques of Song of Summer. The acting by the principals was universally praised. When he saw the finished film, Eric Fenby was traumatised, for it brought to the surface feelings he had been suppressing for decades, and he suffered a severe nervous breakdown which took him a full year to recover from. In 2001, a slightly shortened version was released on DVD, as Delius: Song of Summer. Kate Bush's song \\"Delius (Song of Summer)\\", the B-side of her 1980 \\"Army Dreamers\\", is an appreciation of the composer as portrayed in Russell's film. Music Song of Summer uses the music of Delius throughout, except for a passage where Percy Grainger calls at Grez, and Country Gardens and Handel in the Strand are heard, and another in which Delius has a record of Jerome Kern's \\"Ol' Man River\\" played. The original film starts with an excerpt from a Laurel and Hardy film, and then shows Fenby improvising music on an organ for the theatre patrons. In the DVD release, copyright permission for the Laurel and Hardy film could not be obtained, so the introduction was cut from the release; however, the music credits still include Eric Fenby.Amazon Details A theme that is quite overtly explored is the dichotomy between a composer who is an egotistical and tyrannical monster and womaniser (his blindness and paralysis were the result of tertiary syphilis contracted at Paris brothels and with other women), but who writes ravishingly beautiful, lyrical, sensitive music. Fenby himself comments \\"I can't reconcile such hardness with such lovely music\\". Russell explored the possibility of making the film at the Delius home at Grez, but that proved impractical. Budgetary considerations meant it could not be made in France at all, so it was filmed mainly in Surrey, with extra scenes in Scarborough and the Lake District. The gramophone used in the film was Delius's own, and Jelka's scattering of rose petals over Frederick's dead body from her wheelchair was exactly what she did in real life. One scene shows Fenby attending a church and discovering the parish priest (played by Ken Russell himself) making love to a girl in a pew. This episode apparently occurred, but it was not mentioned in Delius As I Knew Him. Fenby told it to Russell for his ears alone and was shocked when he saw it in the film. Inaccuracies * The Laurel and Hardy film shown was Way Out West (1937), which was a sound film, was made after the events of 'Song of Summer\\", and would not have required additional music from a theatre organ.Rouge * Although he had various paintings by Edvard Munch, Delius did not own any version of The Scream, which is shown on the wall of Fenby's room. * Jelka puts on a recording of The Walk to the Paradise Garden from his opera A Village Romeo and Juliet, accidentally starting on side 2. When Delius rudely corrects her, she apologises and puts on side 1, but what we hear is music that actually starts six bars later than the music she put on first. * Eric Fenby is shown playing chess with his father, who is wearing an open-neck shirt. In fact, Fenby's father could not play chess and Eric never saw him without a collar and tie. * The chessboard is oriented incorrectly. In chess, the top left square, or a8, is always white, whereas it is shown as black.

Riley Bartholomew married Fanny A. Watkins in 1829. He became a merchant in Geneva, Ohio, selling clocks and later operating a hotel before the family moved to Jefferson, Ohio, the Ashtabula County seat. In 1848 he was elected sheriff. During his Ohio years Riley joined the state militia, rising through the ranks to the status of general. The Bartholomew family were among the first settlers in 1852 to establish a land claim in Richfield, Minnesota. The Bartholomews, in their mid-forties, determined to move their family and begin a new life in the Northwest. Bartholomew came from stock that did not fear a challenge. His grandfather fought Native Americans and Tories on the New York frontier during the Revolutionary War, and his father was a veteran of the War of 1812. Bartholomew's parents, Benjamin and Susannah, settled in Ohio's northeast corner in 1807, the year of Riley's birth. Upon arrival in Minnesota Territory, Bartholomew claimed a piece of land on the east side of Wood Lake straddling the western boundary line of the original Fort Snelling reservation. He constructed a two-story wooden house which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1978 and is now run as the Riley Lucas Bartholomew House Museum by the Richfield Historical Society. After establishing their claim, Bartholomew quickly became involved in the work of building a new community. He helped construct the first school and church in 1854. He became a justice of the peace for Hennepin County, a position he held from 1854 to 1863. His neighbors chose him as a territorial delegate to the state's 1857 constitutional convention, and Bartholomew later became a District Four representative in the state senate from 1859 to 1860. During the Dakota War of 1862 Bartholomew joined a volunteer company that came to the relief of soldiers at Fort Ridgely. The four Bartholomew children ranged from eleven to twenty years of age when the family reached Richfield. The two eldest daughters, America and Virginia, married in 1855 and moved out to establish their own households. Youngest son, Rollin, married and left home in 1863.

It is similar in most aspects to Uno, Mau Mau or Crazy Eights but several rules differentiate it, for instance the function of a particular card.  Objective  The first player to play their last card wins the game.  Starting rules  Deal seven cards to each player. When the cards have been dealt to each player, the top card on the deck is flipped over to commence play. This card only dictates the starting suit and nothing else. If the first player is unable to follow suit they must pick up one card as normal. Jokers are not used.  Pick up rules  When a 5 has been played, the following player must draw five cards or play another 5 (stacking), forcing the next player to do the same or be forced to pick up ten (the original 5 plus the following 5) cards.http://www.aatravel.co.nz/gokh/games-8 (With there only being four 5 cards in a standard deck, the maximum draw is 20 cards.) This rule is still present if a player has used their last card, but still needs to pick up. Making someone pick up does not skip their turn. When a 2 has been played, the following player must draw two cards or play another 2 (stacking); the subsequent player is then required to play another 2 card or draw four (the original 2 plus the following 2) from the deck. (With there being four 2 cards in a standard pack the maximum draw required is 8 cards.) This rule is still present if a player has used their last card, but still needs to pick up. When a 10 card has been played, the following player misses a turn. An Ace can be played regardless of the suit or value of the topmost card on the playing deck‚Äîthat is, the Ace may be played at any time in the game. When playing an Ace, the player can decide freely the suit that has to be played next; from then on, play continues as normal, but on the suit selected by the player of the Ace. When a player has only one card remaining in their hand they must say 'Last Card'. Failure to do so before playing requires them to draw two cards from the deck and continue playing.  Variations  There are a number of common variations of the game played in New Zealand. = Blocking = If a player has been made to pick up by a 2 or a 5 card being played (or a stack of these), then they may avoid having to pick up any cards by playing either a 3 or a Jack of the same suit (whether a 3 or a Jack is the card to play should be decided before the games starts). Play resumes at the person following the person who put down the first 2 or 5 card as per normal round. = Nomination = When a 2 or a 5 card is played the player may choose who has to pick up the cards. That player may in turn put down a 2 or a 5 and then choose another person to pick up instead (stacking applies). If they do stack then they can choose the person who put down the original 2 or 5. They may also block the pick up with a 3 or Jack. When a 10 card is played the player may choose who will miss a turn. The 10 card does not stack, the player nominated to miss a turn can not play a 10 card and redirect the turn miss, however they may play a blocking card (3 or Jack) to block the missed turn. Play resumes after the person who played the 10. = Matching face values = A player may play a card of the same face value as the one on top of the playing deck to change the current suit. For example the Queen of Clubs may be played on the Queen of Diamonds and the suit will change to Clubs. Multiple cards of the same face value may be played at once as a stack and the top played suit becomes the current suit. This also means that multiple pick up cards (2 or 5) of the same value can be played, and the player who has to pick up will have to pick up the sum of the stack. For example playing three 2's means the person picking up has to pick up 6 cards. That player may immediately play a card of the same value (stacking) and the stacked pick up is passed to either the following player or any other nominated player if nomination rules are in force. The person who needs to pick up can block as above if that rule is in play. Multiple 10 cards can be played at once by the same player and a single person chosen to miss as many turns as there are cards in the stack. As above the person who will miss the turn(s) can not play a 10 in response, however they may play a 3 of the top-most suit to block the turn misses.

Currently there are more than 380,000 WA Seniors Card members.  History  Western Australia was the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce the Seniors Card. The Hon. Kay Hallahan MLA, Minister for the Aged, stated that the Seniors Card was introduced due to requests from seniors who needed a form of identification so they could take advantage of a number of concessions offered by the private sector. Premier Peter Dowding officially launched the Seniors Card program on 19 April 1988 at the Maylands Autumn Centre as part of the Government's Family Package. The WA Seniors Card provides a form of identification that enables eligible seniors to take advantage of a wide range of discounts and concessions. The first State Government concession available on the WA Seniors Card was Transperth and Westrail Transport Concessions in 1988. For 17 years after its introduction the eligible age to apply for a WA Seniors Card was 60, but this was increased in the 2015-16 State Budget by then Premier Colin Barnett. Effective on 1 July 2015 the Barnett Government raised the WA Seniors Card age limit from 60 to 61, with plans to increase the age cap progressively every second year until the age limit reached 65 in 2023. The government led by Premier Mark McGowan did not stop or reverse this progressive increase in the age of eligibility . This is despite McGowan, while in Opposition, opposing reduced eligibility for the Seniors Card and stating that these concessions were more important In Western Australia than in other states as it had the highest cost of living. Eligibility The WA Seniors Card website shows the eligibility requirements for a Seniors Card. The age of eligibility was to increase until it reaches 65 in 2023. Applicants must be permanent residents of Western Australia and work less than 25 hours per week, averaged out over a year. Concessions A range of State Government concessions, rebates and benefits are available with the WA Seniors Card. The State Government provides concessions on local government rates, water service charges, spectacles, driver's licence renewal fees and fishing licences. The card is combined with a Seniors SmartRider, which offers free off-peak public transport and concession fares at all other times.

Larger entry angles (shown in diagram) are achievable when hooking (curving) the ball. Larger entry angles have been shown to be generally more favorable for achieving strikes. thumb350px ‚Ä¢ Top: Simplified representation of the skid, hook, and roll phases of bowling ball motion. ‚Ä¢ Middle: Hook is enabled by side rotation as the ball frictionally engages dry lane surface as it nears the pins. ‚Ä¢ Bottom: Though the ball's translational speed down the lane decreases (brown arrows), its rotational speed increases (yellow arrowheads). Technological advances since the early 1990s in ball design have allowed dramatically increased hook potential and strike frequency, without requiring additional skill on the part of bowlers. A hook in ten-pin bowling is a ball that rolls in a curving pattern (as opposed to straight). The purpose of the hook is to give the ball a better angle at the 1-3 pocket (right-handers) or 1-2 pocket (left-handers.) to achieve a strike. When a ball is rolled straight, hitting the pocket must be precise. By hooking the ball, the ball will hit the pins with more force, producing better carry - especially on the 5-pin during a strike ball. Straight roll - even when it hits the pocket, will tend to leave a tap such as the 5-pin on a light hit, or the 10-pin if the ball was just slightly right of center pocket or with inadequate entry angle. A hook ball can achieve strikes with less precise hits. A hook ball can also help the bowler shape the shot on challenging oil patterns. In duckpin bowling, candlepin bowling, and nine-pin bowling, hook potential is greatly reduced since the balls are generally rolled much faster and thus have less time for a hook to develop.  Techniques  There are two ways to produce a hook. The first method involves bowling technique. At the moment of throwing the bowling ball, the hand should be behind the ball and where the thumb (for a right-hander) is anywhere between 10-o'clock and 12-o'clock, and the two fingers are between 4-o'clock and 6-o'clock. Just before releasing the ball, the entire hand starts rotating in a counter-clockwise motion. The thumb must fall out of the ball first. And then, the middle and ring finger release almost simultaneously, again in a counter-clockwise direction. The two fingers releasing while rotating is called \\"lift,\\" where this type of a release gives the roll more torque and therefore more power. This release technique gives the bowling ball its spin needed for the hook. When the two fingers lift the ball correctly, it will cause the thumb to naturally fall out of the ball first, so one does not have to make a conscious effort to remove the thumb before the fingers. Of course there are innumerable variations in style and technique and the position of the thumb can vary from person to person. Some bowlers, including professionals, will actually roll the bowling ball with just the two fingers, allowing the hand to give the ball even more torque without having to worry about the thumb restricting the spin. The second way to produce a hook is by modifying the bowling ball. Illegally, one can play with the weighting of the bowling ball, such as drilling the ball so that there is more side weight on the right side of the ball (for a right-hander,) which would cause the ball to pull from right to left, causing a hook. Bowling balls ship with the weighting specifications on the container. A bowling shop professional can drill a bowling ball by first knowing the type of roll the bowler wants, and then can pick out the bowling ball with the weighting specifications in mind that match the bowler's needs. For a beginning bowler, the professional will usually drill the ball with the label directly in the middle, and between the fingers and thumb holes, causing the weighting to be balanced on both sides, causing the ball to roll straight. Under USBC regulations, one can drill up to five holes on the bowling ball. Most bowlers use three holes (thumb and two fingers,). On past, one could drill additional holes on other parts of the bowling ball, to take additional weight off of a portion of the bowling ball, such as an axis hole that allows the bowling ball's hook to stabilize during its roll to the pins. Doctoring the bowling ball by adding additional holes was recommended for experienced bowlers enough to know where to place these holes, such as studying the track area of the ball and knowing where to place the axis hole. Starting August 1, 2020, there is elimination of balance holes. With the elimination of balance holes, bowlers may have up to five holes for gripping purposes and all gripping holes must be used on every delivery.  Backup ball  A backup ball produces the opposite result of a hook. When a ball is rolled by a right-hander, the ball will hook from left to right. The bowling ball can be drilled for a left- handed bowler. The exact same principles of hooking a ball are applied on a backup ball, except the hand rotates clockwise.

Actually, another Chet Allen was born in Chickasha, but in 1928, not 1932. was an American child actor of the 1950s known for his role as Amahl in Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors, the first opera written for television, which he made with the NBC Opera Theatre.TVparty.com, \\"An Opera for Television\\": http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-amahl.html Allen was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, and later moved to Columbus, Ohio. At the time he was selected as Amahl, Allen was a soprano member of Columbus Boychoir, founded in Columbus, Ohio. The music boarding school relocated in 1950 to Princeton, New Jersey, and in 1980 was renamed the American Boychoir School. Allen also reprised his role as Amahl in theatre in April 1952 with the New York City Opera, conducted by young Thomas Schippers. In 1953, Allen starred with Dan Dailey in the film Meet Me at the Fair in the role of 14-year-old Tad Bayliss.Dan Dailey, Meet Me at the Fair (film): https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046059/ That same year, he played the young teenager Jerry Bonino in the short-lived NBC series Bonino, a mostly forgotten situation comedy starring Ezio Pinza as a recently widowed Italian-American opera singer, Babbo Bonino, undertaking the rearing of his eight children. Mary Wickes costarred as Martha the housekeeper.Alex McNeil, Total Television, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, p. 111 One of Allen's young Bonino costars was Van Dyke Parks, a future composer and musician with whom he had roomed at Columbus Boyschoir. Allen failed to make the transition into adult acting and was frequently admitted to psychiatric hospitals because of recurring depression. He procured his Social Security number in New Jersey, presumably when he joined the Columbus Boychoir. Death In 1984, at the age of forty-five, Allen committed suicide by taking five times the fatal dosage of a prescription anti-depressant.

On 16 November 2007, al-Zaidi was kidnapped by unknown assailants in Baghdad. He was also previously twice arrested by the United States Armed Forces. On 14 December 2008, al-Zaidi threw his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush during a Baghdad press conference while shouting, \\"This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, you dog.\\" Al-Zaidi suffered injuries as he was taken into custody and some sources said he was tortured during his initial detention. There were calls throughout the Middle East to place the shoes in an Iraqi museum, but the shoes were later destroyed by US and Iraqi security forces. Al-Zaidi's shoeing inspired many similar incidents of political protest around the world. Following the incident, Al-Zaidi was represented by the head of the Iraqi Bar Association at trial. On 20 February 2009, al-Zaidi received a 90-minute trial by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. On 12 March 2009, he was sentenced to three years in prison for assaulting a foreign head of state during an official visit. On 7 April, the sentence was reduced from three years to one year. He was released on 15 September 2009 for good behavior after spending nine months in jail. After his release, Al-Zaidi was treated for injuries and later said he planned to \\"build orphanages, a children's hospital, and medical and orthopaedic centres offering free treatment and manned by Iraqi doctors and medical staff.\\" Biography Muntadhar al-Zaidi was raised in Sadr City, a suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. He began working as a correspondent for Al-Baghdadia TV in 2005. He first became known as a victim of a kidnapping by unknown assailants in November 2007. Al- Zaidi has also been arrested twice by United States armed forces. He lives in a two-room apartment within central Baghdad. He is of the Shi'a-Muslim faith and also is of Sayyid descent. Ahmed Alaa, a close friend and colleague of al- Zaidi at al-Baghdadia television (barred in Iraq 2014), in a talk on Islam Online, refers to \\"One of [al-Zaidi's] best reports\\" \\"on Zahra, a young Iraqi school girl killed by the occupation forces while en route to school.\\" Alaa said al-Zaidi documented the tragedy in his reportage, complete with interviews with her family, neighbors and friends. \\"This report earned him the respect of many Iraqis and won him many hearts in Iraq,\\" he said. Al-Zaidi once also turned down an offer to work for what he termed \\"a pro-occupation channel\\". Friends said al-Zaidi had been \\"emotionally influenced\\" by the destruction he'd seen in his coverage of the US bombing of Sadr City. On politics, al-Zaidi said \\"I‚Äôm Iraqi and I‚Äôm proud of my country.\\" Friends of al-Zaidi said he utterly rejected the occupation and the civil clashes. They said he believed the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was a \\"legalization of the occupation.\\" Sami Ramadani, a political exile from Saddam's regime and a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University, wrote in an op-ed for The Guardian that al-Zaidi \\"reported for al-Baghdadia on the poor and downtrodden victims of the US war. He was first on the scene in Sadr City and wherever people suffered violence or severe deprivation. He not only followed US Apache helicopters' trails of death and destruction, but he was also among the first to report every 'sectarian' atrocity and the bombing of popular market places. He let the victims talk first\\". =Kidnapping and detention= On Friday morning, 16 November 2007, al-Zaidi was kidnapped on his way to work in central Baghdad. Unknown armed men forced him into a car, where he was beaten until he lost consciousness. The assailants used al-Zaidi's necktie to blindfold him and bound his hands with shoelaces. He was held captive with little food and drink and questioned about his work as a journalist. During his disappearance, al-Zaidi was reported missing by Iraq's Journalistic Freedoms Observatory. On 18 November, Reporters Without Borders \\"voiced deep concern\\" in a statement about al-Zaidi's detention. No ransom demand was made, and al-Zaidi's kidnappers released him still blindfolded, on to a street three days later around 3 a.m. on Monday, 19 November 2007, after which al-Zaidi's brother picked him up. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees mentioned al-Zaidi's kidnapping in a December 2007 report that listed violent incidents in the media, in particular, incidents targeting journalists in Baghdad. According to the report, \\"journalists and media workers and other professionals continue to be targets for kidnapping and assassination.\\" After his kidnapping, al-Zaidi told Reuters; \\"My release is a miracle. I couldn't believe I was still alive.\\" The editor of Al-Baghdadia TV described the kidnapping as an \\"act of gangs, because all of Muntadhar's reports are moderate and unbiased.\\" Al-Zaidi has also been arrested twice by the United States armed forces in Iraq. In January 2008, al-Zaidi was detained overnight by US troops as they searched his residence. The soldiers later offered him an apology. Shoe incident Al-Zaidi's shoe flying over George W. Bush's head During a 14 December 2008, press conference at the prime minister's palace in Baghdad, Iraq, al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at then-United States President George W. Bush. \\"This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, you dog,\\" yelled al-Zaidi in Arabic as he threw his first shoe towards Bush. \\"This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq,\\" he shouted as he threw his second shoe. Bush ducked twice to avoid being hit by the shoes. Prime Minister Maliki also attempted to catch one of the shoes to protect Bush. Al-Zaidi was pulled to the floor before being grabbed by Prime Minister Maliki's guards, kicked, and rushed out of the room. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino was hit in the face by a microphone boom knocked over by a presidential bodyguard resulting in a black eye. Bush said some Iraqi reporters had apologized to him. \\"Thanks for apologizing on behalf of the Iraqi people. It doesn't bother me.\\" Bush said, \\"If you want the facts, it's a size 10 shoe that he threw.\\" When asked about the incident by another reporter, Bush said, \\"It's a way for people to draw attention. I don't know what the guy's cause was. I didn't feel the least bit threatened by it.\\" When later asked to reflect on the incident, Bush said, \\"I didn't have much time to reflect on anything, I was ducking and dodging. I'm not angry with the system. I believe that a free society is emerging, and a free society is necessary for our own security and peace,\\" he added. \\"I don't think that you can take one guy throwing his shoe as representative of the people of Iraq,\\" said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. A fictional depiction of the shoe thrown at President Bush during a press conference in Iraq in 2008. Photograph taken at the Museum in TriBeCa, New York City. Al-Zaidi was initially held by the prime minister's guards and was later turned over to the Iraqi army's Baghdad command. The command handed him over to the Iraqi judiciary. Hundreds took to the streets to demand his release. Al-Zaidi could have faced charges of insulting a foreign leader and the Iraqi prime minister. A conviction of these charges could have carried a sentence of up to two years in prison or a small fine, although it would have been unlikely to face the maximum penalty given his newfound \\"cult status\\" in the Arab world, according to a Middle-East observer. An Iraqi lawyer stated that al-Zaidi was likely to get at least two years in prison if he was prosecuted. Al-Zaidi went before a judge on 17 December 2008. He declined to be represented by Khalil al-Duleimi, who defended the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein before his execution, and also said he wanted to be represented by an Iraqi lawyer. \\"I will introduce myself as his lawyer and demand the case be closed and Muntader be released because he did not commit a crime,\\" said Dheyaa al-Saadi, al-Zaidi's lawyer and head of the Iraqi Bar Association. \\"He only freely expressed himself to the occupier, and he has such a right according to international law.\\" On 17 December 2008, al-Zaidi appeared privately before a judge from within the Green Zone. He was released from jail on September 15th, 2009 after serving nine months in prison. Al-Zaidi humanitarian foundation Following his release, al-Zaidi went to Geneva and announced that he had started creating a humanitarian agency/foundation. The aim of the agency would be to \\"build orphanages, a children's hospital, and medical and orthopaedic centres offering free treatment and manned by Iraqi doctors and medical staff.\\" His lawyer said that al-Zaidi \\"hopes to surf on the wave of support he has gained to do some good.\\" Theatre, film and art \\"Bush-Maliki News Conference.

Originally a successful corporation lawyer, he entered the Studebaker corporation through marriage and became the corporation's president in 1909 and chairman of the board from 1915 to 1935. He is credited with introducing the manufacture of Studebaker cars, first electric, then gasoline-powered. Early life His parents were the Rev. Henry Clay and Clarissa (Jones) Fish. He attended Newark Academy and entered the University of Rochester, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1873. He then studied law, was admitted to the New Jersey Bar in 1876, and practised in Newark and in New York City from 1876 to 1890.from genealogical notes at Conway's of Ireland family tree. (NB: Some of the dates in this record have been proved erroneous.) Political career He was city attorney of Newark (1880‚Äì1884), a member of the New Jersey General Assembly (1884‚Äì85) and a member of the New Jersey Senate from Essex County (1885‚Äì1887), serving as president of that body during his last term. Career with Studebaker Corporation In 1891, Fred Fish married Grace, the daughter of John Studebaker and entered the Studebakers' wagon-making firm as a director and general counsel.\\"Ex-State Senator Frederick S. Fish will leave Newark to become the general counsel of the Studebaker Brothers' Manufacturing Company at South Bend, Ind.\\" NYT City & Suburban News, 26 Mar 1891 (PDF) In 1897, he became chairman of the executive committee. However, he was more than a lawyer --he was an aviation enthusiast, even before the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. In 1895, he was talking about his ideas for a practical horseless carriage and, in 1897, the firm had an engineer working on a motor vehicle. He can therefore be identified as the first person to initiate production of motor vehicles at the world's largest maker of wagons and carriages at the end of the nineteenth century.

He was educated at Monkton Combe School where he was a contemporary of fellow Olympic rower Alfred Mellows. He gained a position as a reader of geography at Selwyn College of the University of Cambridge but did not manage to make the university's rowing team as World War II intervened. Lapage saw service as a Fleet Air Arm pilot in the Pacific during the war. Coming close to being shot down had a lasting impact on him. After the war Lapage was back at the University of Cambridge and was a member of the winning university's boat in the 1948 Boat Race. Most of that crew then won the silver medal rowing at the 1948 Summer Olympics in the men's eight at the 1948 London Olympics. The English athletes were still on rations at the time and Lapage believed that the winning Americans, who had ready access to meat, were at an advantage. At the 1950 British Empire Games he won the bronze medal as part of the English boat in the men's eight competition.

Co-stars include Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jacqueline Kennedy (Little Edie's cousin) and Ken Howard as Phelan Beale (Little Edie's father). The film, directed by Michael Sucsy and co-written by Sucsy and Patricia Rozema, flashes back and forth between various events and dates ranging from Little Edie as a young d√©butante in 1936 moving with her mother to their Grey Gardens estate through the filming and premiere of the actual 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. Filming for the HBO film began on October 22, 2007 in The Hamptons. It first aired on HBO on April 18, 2009. The film won the 2009 Television Critics Association award for Outstanding Achievement Movies, Miniseries, and Specials. It was also nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Made for Television Movie, Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie (Lange) and Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Howard). It was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Made for Television Movie and Best Actress in a Made for Television Movie (Barrymore). Lange was also nominated in this category.  Plot  The film is based on the life stories of the eccentric paternal aunt and first cousin of Jackie Kennedy, both named Edith Bouvier Beale. The elder Edith Bouvier Beale was the sister of Jackie Kennedy's father John Vernou Bouvier III and was referred to as \\"Big Edie\\", her daughter was referred to as \\"Little Edie\\". The Beale women were members of NYC high society, but in their later years, withdrew from the New York City life, taking shelter at their Long Island summer home/estate Grey Gardens. The house eventually fell into a state of disrepair that gave the Beale women notoriety. Phelan Beale (husband of \\"Big Edie\\" and father of \\"Little Edie\\"), eventually divorced \\"Big Edie.\\" In the movie, \\"Little Edie\\" decides to move to New York to pursue a career in acting (as well as an ill- fated romance with high-profile married man, Julius 'Cap' Krug). Her father frankly tells her that she has to find a husband to support her lifestyle. \\"Little Edie\\" sadly and slowly realizes her fate is to remain her mother's companion at Grey Gardens. The two women become reclusive and known around town as the highly eccentric proprietors of Grey Gardens, which has become decrepit and full of stray animals taken in by the Beale women. The plot includes the filming of the documentary Grey Gardens by Albert and David Maysles as well as flashback events in the Beales' past, including their arrival at the estate, the disintegration of Big Edie's marriage, and Little Edie's failed attempts to have her own life and find independence. After Phelan Beale dies, the two sons tell their mother, Big Edie, that there is little money and she should sell the estate and move to Florida. The house was in her name and this was her home. She was going nowhere. Grey Gardens became a health hazard, overrun with cats and also infested with raccoons. Health officials condemned the home and newspaper articles ran blaming Jackie Kennedy. Jackie goes to the home in a chauffeur-driven limousine for a visit. Jackie and her sister, Lee, pay for the cleanup and restoration of the Hamptons home. Mom and daughter grow old together. The documentary is finished and Little Edie attends the premiere, wearing a surprise gift from her mother. The movie ends with Little Edie singing \\"Tea for Two\\" at the Reno Sweeney cabaret in Greenwich Village, and the quote, \\"My mother gave me a truly priceless life.\\"  Cast  * Drew Barrymore as 'Little' Edith Bouvier Beale * Jessica Lange as 'Big' Edith Bouvier Beale * Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis * Ken Howard as Phelan Beale * Kenneth Welsh as Max Gordon * Arye Gross as Albert Maysles * Justin Louis as David Maysles * Daniel Baldwin as Julius Krug * Malcolm Gets as George 'Gould' Strong * Louis Grise as Young Martin John ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù * Joshua Peace as Adult Martin John ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù * Neil Babcock as Young Phelan Jr. * Ben Carlson as Adult Phelan Jr. * Olivia Waldriff as Young Jackie * Neil Girvan as Concierge  Production  Michael Sucsy said that he used primary sources to flesh out the story including letters and journals kept by Little Edie. He also interviewed family members and friends including Lois Wright who lived in the house and wrote her own book about the events.Lois Wright, My Life at Grey Gardens Albert Maysles is credited as a source in the movie. Sucsy said that the house facade as well as the interior were created from blueprints.

Since the two men could not end their quarrels, a Military Directorate was established with de Souza as its chairman,. Kouandete a member, and Col. Benoit Sinzogan of the Gendarmie occupying the third seat.. An election was held on March 28, 1970 to determine the true president. It was marked by a series of violent outbursts; unvalidated reports state that six people were killed were wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections.. Former presidents Hubert Maga, Sourou-Migan Apithy, and Justin Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin received a majority of the vote in the north, southeast, and southwest/central, respectively. de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes.

The three former Presidents agreed to a hasty compromise to prevent a civil war. A presidential council, comprising Maga, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, and Apithy, with a presidency that changed every two years, was set up on May 7.

Leading the Ouidah garrison, he also attempted to take over government buildings and murder de Souza. Over the course of the operation, assailant Major Moumouni was mortally wounded by de Souza's bullets. de Souza, meanwhile, escaped with only a slight injury. The plot was foiled, although Maga cancelled a visit to France to attend the matter at hand.. Kouand√©t√© received the death penalty for his role in the attack.

There were later twentieth-century additions to the house, of a -story wing and connecting hyphen. The creek side has a long screened porch. The property is also significant for its associations with Richard Bennett, Puritan governor of the Virginia colony from 1652-1655, during the reign of Oliver Cromwell. He had a plantation in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, as well as other properties. Also involved in the colony of Maryland, in 1665 Bennett patented 2500 acres on the north side of Wicomico Creek. His grant was large enough to be classified under the Maryland system as a manor. The property was bought in 1721 by George Dashiell (1690-1748) from one of Bennett's grandchildren; he patented 1740 acres after a re-survey. A wealthy planter, Dashiell is believed to have built the house that currently stands on the property. He served in the Lower House of the Assembly in 1724, 1745, and 1746.

Lixivaptan is, as of May 2010, in Phase III clinical trials involving patients with hyponatremia, including those with concomitant heart failure. Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disturbance in which the sodium concentration in the serum is lower than normal. Lixivaptan may help some patients eliminate excess fluids while retaining electrolytes. Chemistry Lixivaptan is synthesized as follows: 500px Mechanism of action Lixivaptan is a potent, non-peptide, selective vasopressin 2 receptor antagonist. The oral capsule works by reducing the action of the hormone vasopressin that blocks fluid excretion. Lixivaptan acts by blocking vasopressin, an anti-diuretic hormone that causes the kidneys to retain water. When the body needs to remain hydrated under certain conditions, vasopressin can have protective effects. But an excess of vasopressin is counterproductive in a body retaining too much fluid. The drug shows promise in treating heart failure in patients with hyponatremia. THE BALANCE study In February 2008, Cardiokine and its worldwide partner, Biogen Idec, initiated THE BALANCE (Treatment of HyponatrEmia BAsed on LixivAptan in N Yha class III/IV Cardiac patient Evaluation) study. THE BALANCE study is a 650-patient Phase III, global, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, study of lixivaptan for hyponatremia in patients with heart failure. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lixivaptan, when compared to the placebo, in increasing serum sodium from baseline in heart failure patients with hyponatremia. Previous studies In previous studies, lixivaptan improved blood sodium levels, lowered body weight and increased urine volume. Those studies suggest that lixivaptan may play an important role in treating hyponatremia and the signs and symptoms of water retention associated with heart failure, Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone(SIADH), and Liver Cirrhosis with Ascites (LCWA). In clinical trials involving patients with water volume overload, lixivaptan resulted in correction of hyponatremia together with marked aquaresis. Vaptans The vasopressin receptor antagonists, dubbed vaptans, target the vasopressin hormonal feedback system. Vasopressin, also called the anti-diuretic hormone or ADH, is an important part of regulation in the circulatory system and is integral to the balance of water in the body. As a fundamental part of hormonal control in the body, it is implicated in many different conditions. Vaptans can be administered orally or intravenously. They work by competing for the active sites on cells meant for vasopressin binding‚Äîin this way, the vasopressin is blocked from acting, which earns the title of vasopressin antagonists.

R. Martin. It is a heavily rewritten and expanded version of an earlier novella called Shadow Twin. The novel was originally published by Harper Voyager in the UK in September 2007, with a cover photo by Tony Sweet.https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-137329-9http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/title.cgi?714233 In January 2008, Eos/HarperCollins published it in the US, with cover art by Stephan Martini√®re.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/pl.cgi?222745 Subterranean Press published a limited edition with cover art by Bob Eggleton.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?252517 Plot summary On the colony planet of S√£o Paulo, a man named Ram√≥n Espejo kills a man in a fight outside a bar over a woman. It transpires the man was a diplomat, and Espejo decides to lie low in the wilderness in the north of the planet's major continent. While in hiding, he accidentally discovers an alien installation. The suspicious aliens capture him and render him unconscious. When Ram√≥n wakes up, he learns that another man had followed him into the alien hideout, but has since escaped, presumably to reveal the existence of the aliens to the rest of the colony. The aliens do not want this and thereby enslave Ram√≥n using highly advanced technology, deciding that since he is human, he can be used to track down and find the other intruder. Ram√≥n at first tries to stall and help his \\"prey\\", but his plans are ruined by his captor Maneck, whom he eventually gets to know a little better, during their travels together. Ram√≥n realizes that the aliens are not evil or fundamentally incomprehensible, only culturally different. He then learns a few things about the race and accordingly, begins to question some aspects of his own life. Eventually though, it is revealed to him that the man they are chasing after is actually the \\"real\\" Ram√≥n and that he (the man who is kept prisoner by Maneck) is actually an artificial clone made by the aliens. There never was any other man who broke into the installation, it was Ram√≥n who has escaped. Now disheartened, the clone-Ram√≥n manages to escape by tricking his alien keeper and eventually meets up with his original. The original Ram√≥n does not recognize him, since the clone is considerably younger and in better shape. After traveling together for some time, the clone realizes with a start that he does not actually like the person that he is (or was) very much; the original has never met Maneck or gotten to know the aliens and thus has never had time to ponder some of the questions the clone has started to struggle with. After the real Ram√≥n finally sees that he is traveling with a man who bears uncanny resemblance to him, the clone kills his original in an act of desperation and then, assuming his (former?) identity, takes up a new life as his old self in the capital. The novel ends with him deciding to go back, make peace and reach out to the aliens in an attempt to use their knowledge of the planet's mineral wealth to enrich him. The story ends before we learn their response to this offer. Writing process The text of the novel is followed by a section explaining how the book was written and re-written over a period of 30 years, including an interview with all three authors and how they conceived the ideas for the book. In 1976, science fiction author and editor Dozois conceived of a story beginning with a man floating in darkness. Dozois conceived of Ram√≥n's name, ethnicity (feeling that Hispanic protagonists were underrepresented in science fiction) and his basic situation, but the story did not proceed far. The following year, while working as a guest instructor at a Catholic women's college at the invitation of Martin, his friend and colleague, Dozois read the story out loud. Martin thought the story was interesting and waited for Dozois to finish it, but Dozois found himself unable to do so. In 1981, Dozois suggested that Martin continue the story instead, which he did, bringing the story to the beginning of the chase sequence. Martin hit on the idea of expanding the story to a 500-page novel exploring the ecosystem of S√£o Paulo, and drew thematic similarities between Ram√≥n and his alien keeper Maneck to Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer journeying down the Mississippi. After his writing on the story stalled in 1982, Martin handed it back to Dozois, suggesting they alternate working on it until it was done. However, Dozois was unable to come up with any ideas on how to proceed and the book remained in his desk drawer until 2002, when he and Martin decided to bring the story to the attention of a third author, Daniel Abraham. Abraham completed the story, and titled Shadow Twin, it was published by Subterranean as a novella in 2004. Dozois then went back and reworked the manuscript into a 380-page novel, renamed Hunter's Run, for publication in 2007.

A point guard during his career, he played for the Denver Rockets and Utah Stars and once led the ABA in assists in a season. Early life Smith was born in Peoria, Illinois. He also attended Manual High School in Peoria. Smith played basketball, football, and baseball at Manual, earning All-State honors in all three sports. His baseball skill was such that the Chicago White Sox drafted him in the 7th round of the inaugural Major League Baseball draft in 1965. Note: Name spelled as Allan Smith in reference. Instead of signing with the White Sox, he opted to attend college. He was given offers to attend USC and Notre Dame, but he chose to attend Bradley University as a basketball and baseball player. Smith spent four years at Bradley, though his time in college was interrupted by a two-year stint in the United States Army. As a college basketball player, he scored over 1,000 points for Bradley and was named first team All-Missouri Valley Conference in 1971 during his senior season. His college success was honored in 2004 when he was selected to Bradley's All- Century team. Denver Rockets In 1971, Smith was drafted by the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls in the 11th round of the NBA Draft; previously, he was also drafted by the Bulls in the 10th round of the 1969 draft. He was also a 4th round draft pick of the American Basketball Association's Denver Rockets (now the NBA's Nuggets) in a separate draft. Smith chose to sign with the Rockets, and he would go on to play for the club for three seasons. In his first season, he served as the backup to point guard Larry Brown while averaging nine points and three assists per game. Smith became the Rockets' regular point guard during the 1972‚Äì1973 season after Brown took a job as head coach. He scored a career-best eleven-plus points per game in his second season, while averaging five-and-a-half assists per game. His scoring decreased slightly in the 1973‚Äì1974 season but he went on to average eight assists per game, and would lead the ABA in assists. Utah Stars Before the 1974‚Äì1975 season, Smith was traded to the Utah Stars in exchange for a draft pick and cash. In his first season with the Stars, he averaged a career-low eight points per game, while also averaging four-and-a- half assists per contest. His second season with the Stars lasted only fifteen games before the Stars folded in December. A persistent knee injury eventually ended his career after five seasons. He retired having scored over 3,200 points and having dished out over 1,700 assists. Post-basketball life Smith went on to become a social worker in Denver, also working at a cable television supply company. For a year-and-a-half, he served as an assistant head coach at Manual High School, helping lead the school to two state championships.

The son of a wealthy merchant, as a young man Schuver travelled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa. At the age of 21 he worked as a private correspondent for the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad, covering events that took place in the Third Carlist War in Spain. Afterwards he travelled to the Balkans and reported for the Handelsblad involving action from the Russo- Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. In 1879 his father died and Schuver inherited a fortune. At this time he made plans to pursue a lifelong dream, to undertake a scientific expedition to the interior of Africa. He joined the Royal Geographical Society of London and took classes on various subjects in order to prepare for his upcoming journey. In March 1881, he reached Khartoum with a small entourage, and subsequently spent the better part of the next two-plus years performing explorations of southeastern Sudan, particularly the eastern watershed of the White Nile and the hill regions surrounding the upper Blue Nile. In southern Sudan, he had a keen interest in the political and social aspects of the area, and made important historical and ethnographic observations concerning the various tribes he encountered. His detailed descriptions of the Sudanese-Ethiopian border region in the early 1880s constitute an extremely valuable and exciting new contribution to the travel literature of late nineteenth-century Africa.

It forms a subduction zone along the border with the Bird's Head Plate and the Woodlark Plate to the south. A transform boundary forms the northern border with the Pacific Plate. Along the border with the Philippine Sea Plate is a convergent boundary that transitions into a rift. The Caroline Plate was first proposed as a distinct plate by . Geological setting A separate terrane with its own tectonic history, the Caroline Plate has been considered part of the Pacific Plate because of sparse seismicity and low velocities along its boundaries. It includes the West and East Caroline basins and the inactive Eauripik Rise separating them, but neither the Caroline Islands nor the Caroline Ridge. It is subducting under the Bird's Head and Woodlark plates along the New Guinea Trench to the south. The boundary with the Philippine Sea to the west has two segments: the southern segment, the Ayu Trough was spreading at a rate of 8 mm/yr 25‚Äì2 Ma but has been slowing down since. The northern segment, the Palau and southern Yap trenches, is not an active subduction zone as indicated by the lack of active volcanoes. The Caroline-Pacific boundary is a complex, evolving system partly and potentially developing into a subduction zone. The south-east boundary, along the Manus Trench, is a convergent boundary, but in the absence of active volcanoes and earthquakes, is not a subduction zone at present. Tectonic history The Caroline Plate moves at velocities very close to those of the Pacific Plate and its age of formation and current status as an independent plate are uncertain. There is a very slow rate of spreading between the Caroline and Philippine plates but the Caroline Plate apparently moved together with both the Philippine and New Guinea plates during the Neogene. The Caroline Ridge, to the north, meets the Caroline Plate at the Sorol Trough at which there some evidence of oblique extension; the Caroline Ridge, however, is, although of uncertain origin, made of oceanic crust and probably the product of a hotspot. The presence of a trench and indications of subduction beneath the Pacific Plate is suggestive but the absence of island arcs, which could be expected from substantial subduction in the past, makes the development along this boundary unclear. The Caroline Plate was, under all circumstances, a separate plate in the past. The boundary along its eastern side, the Mussau Trench, must have been an important boundary since magnetic anomalies on the Caroline Plate are Oligocene but those on the Pacific Plate Cretaceous. There are indications of spreading in the Caroline Sea 34‚Äì27 Ma. If the Caroline Plate moved with the Pacific Plate there should be clear evidences of a corresponding subduction beneath New Guinea, of which there is virtually none. The Auy Trough is a slow spreading zone that opened 15 Ma. References =Notes= =Sources=  * Tectonic plates Geology of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Caroline Plate"},{"id":"20701318","text":"Sen.

The Georgia Straight, April 18, 2012.  Biography  After fronting several rock bands in his native Idaho, singer/songwriter Justin Ringle moved to Portland, Oregon in 2004 and began focusing on acoustic music, playing open mics regularly under the moniker Horse Feathers. In 2005, multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick heard a couple of Ringle's demos and offered to help flesh them out. In February 2006 the duo went into Skyler Norwood's Miracle Lake studios and recorded their debut album, Words Are Dead, which was released that September on Portland label, Lucky Madison. Later that year, Peter's sister Heather Broderick joined the group on cello and by 2007, Horse Feathers began featuring a rotating cast of instrumentalists backing Ringle's guitar and vocals. Horse Feathers live in 2010. Ringle and the Brodericks returned to Miracle Lake studios in the fall and winter of 2007 and recorded House With No Home, which was released on Kill Rock Stars in the spring of 2008. Around that time, Peter Broderick left the country to pursue music in Europe, and Nathan Crockett was enlisted to cover violin duties. Several months later, Heather Broderick also left the group to pursue other musical projects and cellist Catherine Odell came on board. The current line-up was rounded out at the beginning of 2009 when Sam Cooper joined as a multi-instrumentalist. As a four piece, the group has been touring extensively and released Thistled Spring on Kill Rock Stars, on April 20, 2010. The band's fourth album, Cynic's New Year, was released in 2012. The album charted on the Billboard charts even though it sold fewer copies than their previous record. On October 12, 2014, NPR debuted Horse Feathers' fifth album entitled So It Is with Us which was released on October 21, 2014 on Kill Rock Stars on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The album was recorded in a rural Oregon barn following a hiatus from Ringle, and is unique in that it features both drums and bass. On March 2, 2018, NPR debuted Horse Feathers' new single \\"Without Applause\\", taken from the band's upcoming sixth album, 'Appreciation', which was released on May 4, 2018 via Kill Rock Stars.https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/03/02/590198700/horse- feathers-music-gets-a-folk-rock-makeover Discography =Albums= * Words Are Dead (LP, Lucky Madison, 09/26/2006) * House with No Home (CD/LP, Kill Rock Stars, 09/8/2008) * Thistled Spring (CD/LP, Kill Rock Stars, 04/20/2010) * Cynic's New Year (CD/LP, Kill Rock Stars, 04/17/2012) * So It Is with Us (CD, Kill Rock Stars, 10/21/2014) * Appreciation (CD, Kill Rock Stars, 05/4/2018) =Singles= * \\"Road to Ruin\\" (7\\", Regional Hits, 2008) * \\"Cascades\\" (7\\", Kill Rock Stars, 2009) * \\"Drain You/Bonnet of Briars\\" (7\\", Kill Rock Stars, 2010) * \\"Fit Against the Country\\" (Kill Rock Stars, 2012) * \\"Violently Wild\\" (Kill Rock Stars, 2014) * \\"Without Applause\\" (Kill Rock Stars, 2018) =Other appearances= * You Be My Heart (LP, Devon Reed, 2013) References External links * Official website * 2004 establishments in Oregon American folk rock groups Musical groups established in 2004 Musical groups from Portland, Oregon Indie rock musical groups from Oregon American indie folk groups ","title":"Horse Feathers (band)"},{"id":"20701322","text":"is a Japanese folk singer.

The Toa Payoh ritual murders took place in Singapore in 1981. On 25 January, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a bag next to the lift of a block of flats in the town of Toa Payoh, and two weeks later, a ten-year-old boy was found dead nearby. The children had been killed, purportedly as blood sacrifices to the Hindu goddess Kali. The murders were masterminded by Adrian Lim, a self-styled medium, who had tricked scores of women into believing he had supernatural powers. His victims offered money and sexual services in exchange for cures, beauty, and good fortune. Two of the women became his loyal assistants; Tan Mui Choo married him, and Hoe Kah Hong became one of his \\"holy wives\\". When the police investigated a rape charge filed by one of Lim's targets, he became furious and decided to kill children to derail the investigations. On each occasion, Hoe lured a child to Lim's flat where he or she was drugged and killed by the trio. Lim also sexually assaulted the girl before her death. The trio were arrested after the police found a trail of blood that led to their flat. Although the case name suggested ritualistic murders,Sit (1989), I Confess, xiii.Sit (1989), Was Adrian Lim Mad?, xiii. the defendants said they did not conduct prayers, burning of joss sticks, ringing of bells, or any other rituals during the killings.John (1989), 187, 202. The 41-day trial was the second longest to have been held in the courts of Singapore at the time. None of the defendants denied their guilt. Their appointed counsels tried to spare their clients the death sentence by pleading diminished responsibility, arguing that the accused were mentally ill and could not be held entirely responsible for the killings. To support their case they brought in doctors and psychologists, who analysed the defendants and concluded that they had exhibited schizophrenia, and depressions of the psychotic and manic order. The prosecution's expert, however, refuted these testimonies and argued that they were in full control of their mental faculties when they planned and carried out the murders. The judges agreed with the prosecution's case and sentenced the trio to death. While on death row, the women appealed to the Privy Council in London and pleaded for clemency from the President of Singapore to no avail. Lim did not seek any pardons; instead, he accepted his fate and went smiling to the gallows. The three were hanged on 25 November 1988. The Toa Payoh ritual murders shocked the public in Singapore, who were surprised by such an act taking place in their society. Reports of the trio's deeds and the court proceedings were closely followed and remained prominent in the Singaporean consciousness for several years. Twice, movie companies tried to capitalise on the sensation generated by the murders by producing motion pictures based on the killings; however, critics panned both films for indulging in gratuitous sex and violence, and the movies performed poorly at the box office. The actions and behaviour of the three killers were studied by academics in the criminal psychology field, and the rulings set by the courts became local case studies for diminished responsibility.  Singaporean society in the 1980s  Early in the nineteenth century, immigrants flooded into Peninsular Malaysia, colonising the Straits Settlements including the island city of Singapore. Migrants and natives held differing beliefs, but over time the boundaries between those belief systems blurred. Most of the population believed in spirits that inhabit the jungles, and in gods and devils that hover around, capable of benevolence and mischief. Certain people claimed that they could communicate with these supernatural beings. Through rituals in which they danced and chanted, these spirit mediums--tang-kees and bomohs--invited the beings to possess their bodies and dole out wisdoms, blessings, and curses to their believers. As time passed and the cities grew, the jungles gave way to concrete structures and the mediums' practices moved deeper into the heartland of communities.DeBernadi (2006), 1-14. By 1980, 75% of the residents in Singapore were living in public housing.Thung (1977), 229. Government-built high-rise blocks of flats clustered in the population centres, of which Toa Payoh was typical. Although a high density of people lived in each block, the residents mostly kept to themselves, valuing their privacy and tending to ignore what was happening around their homes.Trocki (2006), 146.Thung (1977), 231-232. During this time, Singapore was a relatively peaceful society--a stark contrast to the prevalence of secret societies, triads and gang warfare during the pre-independence days. The low crime rate, brought on by strict laws and tough enforcement,Rowen (1998), 116-117. gave citizens a sense of security.Quah (1987), 49. Nonetheless, the government warned against complacency and lectured in its local campaigns, \\"Low crime doesn't mean no crime\\".Naren (2000), 24.  The murders  Lim's flat (highlighted in red) was in Block 12 (right), Toa Payoh Lorong 7. By 2008, the neighbouring Blocks 10 and 11 (centre and left) had been replaced with taller structures. For several years, a medium in Block 12, Toa Payoh Lorong 7, had been performing noisy rituals in the middle of the night. The residents complained several times to the authorities, but the rituals would always resume after a short time.John (1989), 9. On the afternoon of 24 January 1981, nine-year-old Agnes Ng Siew Heok () disappeared after attending religious classes at her church in Toa Payoh. Hours later, her naked body was found stuffed in a bag outside a lift in Block 11, less than a kilometre (five-eighths of a mile) from the church. The girl had been smothered to death; the investigation revealed injuries to her genitals and semen in her rectum. Although the police launched an intensive investigation, questioning more than 250 people around the crime scene, they failed to obtain any leads. On 7 February ten-year-old Ghazali bin Marzuki was found dead under a tree between Blocks 10 and 11, naked. He had been missing since the previous day, after being seen boarding a taxi with an unknown woman. Forensic pathologists on the scene deemed the cause of death as drowning, and found on the boy suffocation marks similar to those on Ng. There were no signs of sexual assault, but burns were on the boy's back and a puncture on his arm. Traces of a sedative were later detected in his blood.John (1989), 2-3. The police found a scattered trail of blood that led to the seventh floor of Block 12. Stepping into the common corridor from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira noticed an eclectic mix of religious symbols (a cross, a mirror, and a knife-blade) on the entrance of the first flat (unit number 467F). The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong. Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood.Narayanan (1989), 166-167. After the police found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose.John (1989), 7-8. He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's.Narayanan (1989), 9. Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers. Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders. The police collected the evidence, sealed the flat as a crime scene, and took Lim and the two women in for questioning.John (1989), 8.  Perpetrators  = Adrian Lim = Born on 6 January 1942, Adrian Lim () was the eldest son of a low-income family.John (1989), 10. Described at the trial by his sister as a hot-tempered boy,John (1989), 162. he dropped out of secondary school and worked a short stint as an informant for the Internal Security Department, joining the cable radio company Rediffusion Singapore in 1962. For three years, he installed and serviced Rediffusion sets as an electrician before being promoted to bill collector. In April 1967, Lim married his childhood sweetheart with whom he had two children. He converted to Catholicism for his marriage.Narayanan (1989), 80. Lim and his family lived in rented rooms until his 1970 purchase of a three-room flat--a seventh floor unit (unit number 467F) of Block 12, Toa Payoh. Lim started part-time practice as a spirit medium in 1973. He rented a room where he attended to the women-- most of whom were bargirls, dance hostesses, and prostitutes--introduced to him by his landlord.John (1989), 17-19. Lim's customers also included superstitious men and elderly females, whom he cheated only of cash.John (1989), 18, 34. He had learned the trade from a bomoh called \\"Uncle Willie\\" and prayed to gods of various religions despite his Catholic baptism. The Hindu goddess Kali and \\"Phragann\\", which Lim described as a Siamese sex god,John, p.12-13. were among the spiritual entities he called on in his rituals.Narayanan (1989), 86, 89. Lim deceived his clients with several confidence tricks; his most effective gimmick, known as the \\"needles and egg\\" trick, duped many to believe that he had supernatural abilities. After blackening needles with soot from a burning candle, Lim carefully inserted them into a raw egg and sealed the hole with powder. In his rituals, he passed the egg several times over his client while chanting and asked her to crack open the egg. Unaware that the egg had been tampered with, the client would be convinced by the sight of the black needles that evil spirits were harassing her.Narayanan (1989), 30-31. Lim particularly preyed on gullible girls who had deep personal problems. He promised them that he could solve their woes and increase their beauty through a ritual massage. After Lim and his client had stripped, he would knead her body--including her genitals--with Phragann's idol and have sex with her.John (1989), 19-20. Lim's treatments also included an electro-shock therapy based on that used on mental patients. After placing his client's feet in a tub of water and attaching wires to her temples, Lim passed electricity through her.Narayanan (1989), 46-47. The shocks, he assured her, would cure headaches and drive away evil spirits.Kok (1990), 70. = Tan Mui Choo = Tan Mui Choo assisted Lim in his medium practice, reaping the benefits. Catherine Tan Mui Choo () was referred to Lim by a fellow bargirl, who claimed the spirit medium could cure ailments and depression.John (1989), 28. Tan, at that time, was grieving the death of her grandmother to whom she had been devoted. Furthermore, her estrangement from her parents weighed on her mind; having been sent away at the age of 13 to a vocational centre (a home mostly for juvenile delinquents), she felt unwanted by them.John (1989), 26-27. Tan's visits to Lim became regular, and their relationship grew intimate.John (1989), 29-31. In 1975 she moved into his flat on his insistence. To allay his wife's suspicions that he was having an affair with Tan, Lim swore an oath of denial before a picture of Jesus Christ. However, she discovered the truth and moved out with their children a few days later, divorcing Lim in 1976.Narayanan (1989), 113-114. Lim quit his Rediffusion job and became a full-time medium. He enjoyed brisk business,John (1989), 33-35. at one point receiving S$6,000-7,000 (US$2,838-3,311) a month from a single client.John (1989), 37. In June 1977, Lim and Tan registered their marriage.John (1989), 36. Lim dominated Tan through beatings, threats, and lies.John (1989), 34. He persuaded her to prostitute herself to supplement their income.John (1989), 32. He also convinced her that he needed to fornicate with young women to stay healthy; thus, Tan assisted him in his business, preparing their clients for his pleasure.John (1989), 170-171. Lim's influence over Tan was strong; on his encouragement and promise that sex with a younger man would preserve her youth, Tan copulated with a Malay teenager and even with her younger brother. The boy was not her only sibling to be influenced by Lim; the medium had earlier seduced Tan's younger sister and tricked her into selling her body and having sex with the two youths.John (1989), 171. Despite the abuses, Tan lived with Lim, enjoying the dresses, beauty products and slimming courses bought with their income.John (1989), 186. = Hoe Kah Hong = Hoe Kah Hong steadfastly believed in Lim, conscientiously executing his orders. Born on 10 September 1955, Hoe Kah Hong () was eight years old when her father died; she was sent to live with her grandmother until she was fifteen. When she returned to her mother and siblings she was constantly required to give way to her elder sister Lai Ho. Under the perception that her mother favoured her sister, Hoe became disgruntled, showing her temper easily.John (1989), 40-41. In 1979 her mother brought Lai to Lim for treatment, and became convinced of Lim's powers by his \\"needles and egg\\" trick. Believing that Hoe's volatile temper could also be cured by Lim, the old woman brought her younger daughter to the medium.John (1989), 37-38. After witnessing the same trick, Hoe became Lim's loyal follower.John (1989), 40-42. Lim desired to make Hoe one of his \\"holy wives\\", even though she was already married to Benson Loh Ngak Hua. To achieve his goal, Lim sought to isolate Hoe from her family by feeding her lies. He claimed that her family were immoral people who practiced infidelity, and that Loh was an unfaithful man who would force her into prostitution. Hoe believed Lim's words, and after going through a rite with him she was declared by the medium as his \\"holy wife\\". She no longer trusted her husband and family, and became violent towards her mother. Three months after she had first met Lim, Hoe moved from her house and went to live with him.John (1989), 43-45. Loh sought his wife at Lim's flat and ended up staying to observe her treatment. He was persuaded by her to participate in the electro-shock therapies. In the early hours of 7 January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water. Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness. When she woke, Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death. Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried to switch on a faulty electric fan in the dark.John (1989), 46-48. The coroner recorded an open verdict,Narayanan (1989), 111. and the police made no further investigations.John (1989), 48. Despite her antipathy towards Loh, Hoe was affected by his death. Her sanity broke; she started hearing voices and hallucinating, seeing her dead husband. At the end of May she was admitted to the Woodbridge Hospital. There, psychologists diagnosed her condition as schizophrenia and started appropriate treatments. Hoe made a remarkably quick recovery; by the first week of July, she was discharged. She continued her treatment with the hospital; follow-up checks showed that she was in a state of remission. Hoe's attitude towards her mother and other family members began to improve after her stay in the hospital, although she continued to live with Lim and Tan.Kok (1990), 44.  Rape and revenge  With Hoe and Tan as his assistants, Lim continued his trade, tricking more women into giving him money and sex. By the time of his arrest, he had 40 \\"holy wives\\".Narayanan (1989), 6. In late 1980 he was arrested and charged with rape. His accuser was Lucy Lau, a door-to-door cosmetic salesgirl, who had met Lim when she was promoting beauty products to Tan. On 19 October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals. She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted. He secretly mixed two capsules of Dalmadorm, a sedative, into a glass of milk and offered it to her, claiming it had holy properties. Lau became groggy after drinking it, which allowed Lim to take advantage of her. For the next few weeks, he continued to abuse her by using drugs or threats. In November, after Lim had given her parents a loan smaller than the amount they had requested, Lau made a police report about his treatment of her. Lim was arrested on charges of rape, and Tan for abetting him. Out on bail, Lim persuaded Hoe to lie that she was present at the alleged rape but saw no crime committed. This failed to stop the police enquiries; Lim and Tan had to extend their bail, in person, at the police station every fortnight.John (1989), 49. Lim prayed [at this altar] to the Buddha, Phragann, Kali, and a variety of gods. Frustrated, Lim plotted to distract the police with a series of child murders.John (1989), 61. Moreover, he believed that sacrifices of children to Kali would persuade her supernaturally to draw the attention of the police away from him. Lim pretended to be possessed by Kali, and convinced Tan and Hoe that the goddess wanted them to kill children to wreak vengeance on Lau.John (1989), 84. He also told them Phragann demanded that he have sex with their female victims.Narayanan (1989), 45. On 24 January 1981, Hoe spotted Agnes at a nearby church and lured her to the flat. The trio plied her with food and drink that was laced with Dalmadorm. After Agnes became groggy and fell asleep, Lim sexually abused her. Near midnight, the trio smothered Agnes with a pillow and drew her blood, drinking and smearing it on a portrait of Kali. Following that, they drowned the girl by holding down her head in a pail of water.John (1989), 92-94. Finally, Lim used his electro-shock therapy device to \\"make doubly sure that she was dead\\".John (1989), 94. They stuffed her body in a bag and dumped it near the lift at Block 11. Ghazali suffered a similar fate when he was brought by Hoe to the flat on 6 February. He, however, proved resistant to the sedatives, taking a long time to fall asleep. Lim decided to tie up the boy as a precaution; however, the boy awoke and struggled. Panicking, the trio delivered karate chops to Ghazali's neck and stunned him. After drawing his blood, they proceeded to drown their victim. Ghazali struggled, vomiting and losing control of his bowels as he died. Blood kept streaming from his nose after his death. While Tan stayed behind to clean the flat, Lim and Hoe disposed of the body. Lim noticed that a trail of blood led to their flat, so he and his accomplices cleaned as much as they could of these stains before sunrise.John (1989), 95-97. When the trail of blood led the police to their flat, this resulted in their arrest.  Trial  Two days after their arrest, Lim, Tan and Hoe were charged in the Subordinate Court for the murders of the two children. The trio were subjected to further interrogations by the police, and to medical examinations by prison doctors. On 16-17 September, their case was brought to the court for a committal procedure. To prove that there was a case against the accused, Deputy Public Prosecutor Glenn Knight called on 58 witnesses and arrayed 184 pieces of evidence before the magistrate. While Tan and Hoe denied the charges of murder, Lim pleaded guilty and claimed sole responsibility for the acts. The magistrate decided that the case against the accused was sufficiently strong to be heard at the High Court. Lim, Tan, and Hoe remained in custody while investigations continued.John (1989), 51-52. = Judiciary, prosecution, and defence = The murder case was heard in Courtroom No. 4 of the old Supreme Court Building. The High Court was convened in the Supreme Court Building on 25 March 1983.John (1989), 52. Presiding over the case were two judges: Justice Thirugnana Sampanthar Sinnathuray, who would deliver judgment on serial murderer John Martin Scripps 13 years later,Tan (October 1997). and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua, who was at the time the longest serving judge in Singapore.John (1989), x. Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work. Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidence--the blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's names--conclusively proved the defendants' involvement. Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, but he told the court in his opening statement, \\"What matters is that [the accused] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two innocent children, causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder. And this we will prove beyond all reasonable doubt.\\"John (1989), 55. Tan, with Lim's and the police's permission, used $10,000 of the $159,340John (1989), 56. (US$4,730 of US$75,370) seized from the trio's flat to engage J. B. Jeyaretnam for her defence.Narayanan (1989), 28.John (1989), 67. Hoe had to accept the court's offer of counsel, receiving Nathan Isaac as her defender. Since his arrest, Lim had refused legal representation. He defended himself at the Subordinate Court hearings,John (1989), 51. but could not continue to do so when the case was moved to the High Court; Singapore law requires that for capital crimes the accused must be defended by a legal professional. Thus Howard Cashin was appointed as Lim's lawyer,John (1989), 117. although his job was complicated by his client's refusal to cooperate.John (1989), 127. The three lawyers decided not to dispute that their clients had killed the children. Acting on a defence of diminished responsibility, they attempted to show that their clients were not sound of mind and could not be held responsible for the killings.Narayanan (1989), 155. Had this defence been successful, the defendants would have escaped the death penalty but be sentenced to either life imprisonment, or up to 10 years in jail.Tan (April 1997). = Proceedings = After Knight had presented the prosecution evidence the court heard testimonies on the personalities and character flaws of the accused, from their relatives and acquaintances. Details of their lives were revealed by one of Lim's \\"holy wives\\". Private medical practitioners Dr. Yeo Peng Ngee and Dr. Ang Yiau Hua admitted that they were Lim's sources for drugs, and had provided the trio sleeping pills and sedatives without question on each consultation.John (1989), 107-116. The police and forensics teams gave their accounts of their investigations; Inspector Suppiah, the investigating officer-in-charge, read out the statements the defendants had made during their remand. In these statements Lim stated that he had killed for revenge, and that he had sodomised Ng. The accused had also confirmed in their statements that each was an active participant in the murders.John (1989), 61-70. There were many contradictions among these statements and the confessions made in court by the accused, but Judge Sinnathuray declared that despite the conflicting evidence, \\"the essential facts of this case are not in dispute\\".John (1989), 198. Lim's involvement in the crimes was further evidenced by a witness who vouched that just after midnight on 7 February 1981, at the ground floor of Block 12, he saw Lim and a woman walk past him carrying a dark-skinned boy.John (1989), 56-60. On 13 April, Lim took the stand. He maintained that he was the sole perpetrator of the crimes.John (1989), 121. He denied that he raped Lucy Lau or Ng, claiming that he made the earlier statements only to satisfy his interrogators.John (1989), 132-133.John (1989), 154-156. Lim was selective in answering the questions the court threw at him; he verbosely answered those that agreed with his stance, and refused to comment on the others. When challenged on the veracity of his latest confession, he claimed that he was bound by religious and moral duty to tell the truth.John (1989), 155. Knight, however, countered that Lim was inherently a dishonest man who had no respect for oaths. Lim had lied to his wife, his clients, the police, and psychiatrists. Knight claimed Lim's stance in court was an open admission that he willingly lied in his earlier statements.John (1989), 157-158. Tan and Hoe were more cooperative, answering the questions posed by the court. They denied Lim's story, and vouched for the veracity of the statements they had given to the police.John (1989), 168, 198. They told how they had lived in constant fear and awe of Lim; believing he had supernatural powers, they followed his every order and had no free will of their own.John (1998), 164-165, 203. Under Knight's questioning, however, Tan admitted that Lim had been defrauding his customers, and that she had knowingly helped him to do so.John (1989), 180-181. Knight then got Hoe to agree that she was conscious of her actions at the time of the murders.John (1989), 202-203. = Battle of the psychiatrists = Of the fact that Lim, Tan, and Hoe had killed the children there was no doubt. Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of themselves during the crimes. The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides. Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill at the time of the crimes. Claiming to be \\"judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions\\",John (1989), 208. he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a mild manic depression. The doctor also proclaimed that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police.Kok (1990), 71. Countering this, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital,John (1989), 204. said that Lim was \\"purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure\\".Kok (1990), 72. In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to go to bed with him. Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control. Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.John (1989), 209. Dr R. Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by reactive psychotic depression. According to him she was depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes.Kok (1990), 73. Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery. However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse during the time of the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16 July 1980 - 31 January 1981).Kok (1990), 45.John (1989), 202. Were Hoe as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.John (1989), 217. = Closing statements = In their closing speeches, the defence tried to reinforce the portrayal of their clients as mentally unsound individuals. Cashin declared that Lim was a normal man until his initiation into the occult, and that he was clearly divorced from reality when he entered the \\"unreasonable world of atrociousness\\", acting on his delusions to kill children in Kali's name.John (1989), 218. Jeyaretnam relied on the fact that due to her depression and Lim's abuse, Tan was just \\"a robot\\", carrying out orders without thought. Isaac simply concluded, \\"[Hoe's] schizophrenic mind accepted that if the children were killed, they would go to heaven and not grow up evil like her mother and others.\\"John (1989), 219. The defence criticised Dr Chee for failing to recognise their clients' symptoms. The prosecution started its closing speech by drawing attention to the \\"cool and calculating\\" manner in which the children were killed.John (1989), 220. Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only brought it up during the trial. The \\"cunning and deliberation\\" displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person. Tan helped Lim because \\"she loved [him]\\", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes.John (1989), 221. Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: \\"My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder. It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has conjured up his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts.\\" = Judgment = On 25 May 1983, crowds massed outside the building, waiting for the outcome of the trial. Due to limited seating, only a few were allowed inside to hear Justice Sinnathuray's delivery of the verdict, which took 15 minutes. The two judges were not convinced that the accused were mentally volatile during the crimes. They found Lim to be \\"abominable and depraved\\" in carrying out his schemes.John (1989), 224-225. Viewing her interviews with the expert witnesses as admissions of guilt,Kok (1994), 53. Sinnathuray and Chua found Tan to be an \\"artful and wicked person\\", and a \\"willing [party] to [Lim's] loathsome and nefarious acts\\".John (1989), 225. The judges found Hoe to be \\"simple\\" and \\"easily influenced\\". Although she suffered from schizophrenia, they noted that she was in a state of remission during the murders; hence she should bear full responsibility for her actions.Kok (1994), 94. All three defendants were found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged. The two women did not react to their sentences. On the other hand, Lim beamed and cried, \\"Thank you, my Lords!\\", as he was led out.John (1989), 226. Lim accepted his fate; the women did not, and appealed against their sentences. Tan hired Francis Seow to appeal for her, and the court again assigned Isaac to Hoe.John (1989), 227. The lawyers asked the appeal court to reconsider the mental states of their clients during the murders, charging that the trial judges in their deliberations had failed to consider this point. The Court of Criminal Appeal reached their decision in August 1986.John (1989), 228. The appeal judges which consist of Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin, Justice Lai Kew Chai and Justice L P Thean reaffirmed the decision of their trial counterparts, noting that as finders of facts, judges have the right to discount medical evidence in the light of evidence from other sources.Kok (1990), 73-74. Tan and Hoe's further appeals to London's Privy Council and Singapore President Wee Kim Wee met with similar failures. Having exhausted all their avenues for pardon, Tan and Hoe calmly faced their fates. While waiting on death row the trio were counselled by Catholic priests and nuns. In spite of the reputation that surrounded Lim, Father Brian Doro recalled the murderer as a \\"rather friendly person\\".Davie (1989). When the day of execution loomed, Lim asked Father Doro for absolution and Holy Communion. Likewise, Tan and Hoe had Sister Gerard Fernandez as their spiritual counsellor. The nun converted the two female convicts to Catholicism, and they received forgiveness and Holy Communion during their final days.Naryanan (1989), 14-15. On 25 November 1988 the trio were given their last meal and led to the hangman's noose. Lim smiled throughout his last walk. After the sentences were carried out, the three murderers were given a short Catholic funeral mass by Father Doro,Naryanan (1989), 14. and cremated on the same day.John (1989), 229.  Legacy  Singaporeans crowded the grounds of the Subordinate Court (pictured) and other courts to catch a glimpse of the killers. The trial on the Toa Payoh ritual murders was closely followed by the populace of Singapore. Throngs of people constantly packed the grounds of the courts, hoping to catch a glimpse of Adrian Lim and to hear the revelations first- hand. Reported by regional newspapers in detail, the gory and sexually explicit recounting of Lim's acts offended the sensibilities of some; Canon Frank Lomax, Vicar of St. Andrew's Anglican Church, complained to The Straits Times that the reports could have a corrupting effect on the young. His words received support from a few readers. Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates.John (1989), 116-118 Books, which covered the murders and the trial, were quickly bought by the public on their release.Khor (September 1989).Khor (October 1989). The revelations from the trial cast Lim as evil incarnate in the minds of Singaporeans.Yap (1995). Some citizens could not believe that anyone would willingly defend such a man. They called Cashin to voice their anger; a few even issued death threats against him. On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career. He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the Commercial Affairs Department in 1984. He would maintain his good reputation until his conviction for corruption seven years later.Tan (1998). Even in prison, Lim was hated; his fellow prisoners abused and treated him as an outcast.Yaw (1991). In the years that followed the crime, memories remained fresh among those who followed the case. Journalists deemed it the most sensational trial of the 80s, being \\"the talk of a horrified city as gruesome accounts of sexual perversion, the drinking of human blood, spirit possession, exorcism and indiscriminate cruelty unfolded during the 41-day hearing\\".Davidson (1990). Fifteen years from the trial's conclusion, a poll conducted by The New Paper reported that 30 per cent of its respondents had picked the Toa Payoh ritual murders as the most horrible crime, despite the paper's request to vote only for crimes committed in 1998.Low (1998). Lim had become a benchmark for local criminals; in 2002 Subhas Anandan described his client, wife-killer Anthony Ler, as a \\"cooler, more handsome version of [the] notorious Toa Payoh medium- murderer\\".Vijayan (2002). During the 1990s, the local film industry made two movies based on the murder case, the first of which was Medium Rare. The 1991 production had substantial foreign involvement; most of the cast and crew were American or British. The script was locally written and intended to explore the \\"psyche of the three main characters\\".Uhde (2000), 109-110. The director, however, focused on sex and violence, and the resulting film was jeered by the audience at its midnight screening. Its 16-day run brought in $130,000 (US$75,145),Uhde (2000), 110. and a reporter called it \\"more bizarre than the tales of unnatural sex and occult practices associated with the Adrian Lim story\\".Guneratne (2003), 172. The second film, 1997's God or Dog, also had a dismal box-office performanceMillet (2006), 96. despite a more positive critical reception.Uhde (2000), 115. Both shows had difficulty in finding local actors for the lead role; Zhu Houren declined on the basis that Adrian Lim was too unique a personality for an actor to portray accurately,Lee (June 1996). and Xie Shaoguang rejected the role for the lack of \\"redeeming factors\\" in the murderer.Lee (May 1996). On the television, the murder case would have been the opening episode for True Files, a crime awareness programme in 2002. The public, however, complained that the trailers were too gruesome with the re-enactments of the rituals and murders, forcing the media company MediaCorp to reshuffle the schedule. The Toa Payoh ritual murders episode was replaced by a less sensational episode as the opener and pushed back into a later timeslot for more mature viewers, marking the horrific nature of the crimes committed by Lim, Tan, and Hoe.Tan (2002).

On 6 January 2014, Wiser.org's Executive Director, Peggy Duvette wrote an open letter to all members (which she updated on 24 January 2014) explaining the need for changes and the possibility of archiving the Wiser.org website to the Wayback Machine; and on 17 March 2014 she officially announced that the closure and archiving of the Wiser.org website would occur on 10 April 2014. History Wiser.org was launched as WiserEarth.org on Earth Day (April 22) 2007 as an online directory of the 100,000+ organizations touched upon in Paul Hawken's book, Blessed Unrest.Hawken, P. (2007). Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming. Viking Press. Hawken had amassed a collection of business cards from thousands of organizations over the years, but had not found a comprehensive directory listing all non-profit organizations involved in the social justice and environmental sector. Estimating the total number of non-profit organizations around the world to be well over a million, Hawken launched Wiser.org, which stands for the World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility, as an online directory to help map out the work done by these organizations. Wiser.org incorporated additional social networking features, such as status updates, likes, walls, groups, Beth's Blog - How Nonprofits Can Use Social Media and email messaging to provide greater possibilities for collaboration. Wiser.org expanded its organization directory to include listings of for-profit businesses and government agencies. On 17 March 2014, it was announced on the Wiser.org website that it would be archived and shutdown on 10 April 2014. In 2017, the domain WISER.org became the website for the Workie Institute for Social and Educational Research, a non-profit focusing on social exclusion, including bullying and systematic barriers to society, based on the work of the late Dr. Abaineh Workie. Facts and figures As of September 15, 2012, Wiser.org provided a directory of more than 114,000 organizations worldwide,\\"Paul Hawken Speaks about Social Change:The New Global Movement\\" by Felicia M.

It featured resources and information on various social issues ranging from women's rights to climate change. These resources and information are organized into 47 distinct issue areas and 381 sub-issue areas. Wiser.org was available in English, Chinese (simplified), French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Wiser.org Directory The Wiser.org Directory was organized around a master list of issues which are \\"networked\\" in such a way that registered users could edit the \\"connections\\" of each issue to organizations, resources, jobs, events, and groups. The website featured groupware and social networking components including graphical \\"Network Maps\\". A unique \\"Solution form\\" allowed any logged in user to state a serious social or environmental problem and propose a way to solve it. The Solution then becomes a named entity that can be shared, modified, and acted upon as the proposed solution is implemented in the real world. The solution form included a place to record results and observations. Each Solution was provided with a publishing and networking page and a discussion forum. Wiser.org also incorporates embedded Google Maps integrated with the geographical data. The website was a non- profit venture and was free to the public. The data is published under a Creative Commons 3.0 license. Wiser.org API As of June 2009, Wiser.org offered a RESTful API developed under a Creative Commons 3.0 license.

He is a regular performer at The Magic Castle and is known as \\"The Gentleman of Magic\\". He has been the long-time director and owner (since 1978) of the Chavez School of Magicwhich was established by Ben and Marian Chavez in 1941 under the G.I. Bill. He has been featured in cover stories on numerous magic-related publications. He has also taught English literature at Citrus College in Glendora, California since 1973 and has also published 25 books.  Biography  Salwak was born and raised in Amherst, Massachusetts. His father worked at University of Massachusetts and his mother was a teacher and concert pianist. He first became interested in magic at the age of five when he went to a birthday party and watched a magician perform. He was so enthralled that after the performance he stayed and asked the magician to show him how to do some of the magic tricks. When he was 10, his parents paid him $2.00 to perform at his own birthday party. It was his first magic show and he performed all the tricks that he had been practicing from his father‚Äôs Ripley‚Äôs Magic for Boys book. When he was in high school, from 1963 to 1965, he took the Chavez School of Magic‚Äôs two-year correspondence course. He credits Neil Foster as his key mentor. After high school, Salwak attended Purdue University, paying his own way by performing magic at clubs, churches and ‚Äúwherever I could get the work.‚Äù He moved to Los Angeles when he was 21 to pursue an English Literature degree (M.A., Ph.D.) at the University of Southern California. Salwak has been teaching English literature at Citrus College for over 40 years. Some of his courses include Shakespeare, Literature of the Bible, English Literature and Critical Thinking. In addition to teaching at college, he performs as an illusionist and magician at Hollywood's Magic Castle. Salwak says The Magic Castle was an important part of his career as he was able to practice his tricks in front of an audience. He has said, ‚ÄúJust as in vaudeville, the comics and dancers and singers had a place to be bad and learn their craft, that‚Äôs what the castle afforded the magicians ‚Äì a place to learn their craft and try out things.‚Äù He often travels to perform at magicians' conventions, clubs and casinos around the world during spring breaks and summer vacations. In 1978, Salwak and Neil Foster became the co- owners of the Chavez School of Magic after Marian Chavez died. After Foster died in 1988, Salwak has continued to maintain the West Coast branch. Salwak is the author of over 25 books on religion and literature. They include, Kingsley Amis: Modern Novelist and Carl Sandburg: A Reference Guide, and the editor of The Wonders of Solitude, Anne Tyler as Novelist (Iowa, 1994), Philip Larkin: The Man and His Work (Iowa, 1989), and The Life and Work of Barbara Pym (Iowa, 1987). His book, Teaching Life: Letters from a Life in Literature, is based on his experience and memories as a teacher and was inspired by the death of one of his students, who died in a car accident on her way to his office. In reference to this memoir, Kenneth Silverman said, \\"Teaching Life is a fascinating blend of practical advice on teaching, moral inquiry, and personal experience. Its focus moves from the obligation to return exams promptly, to Christianity and Judaism, to Kingsley Amis, to experiencing a parent's death. The unusual range of subjects makes Salwak's book by turns instructive, inspiring, and poignant.\\" His newest book, Writers and Their Mothers, will be published in early 2018 by Palgrave Macmillan to coincident with the U.K.'s celebration of Mother's Day. He is also a regular contributor to the (London) Times Education Magazine as well as the (London) Times Educational Supplement. In 2009, Salwak was invited by the North Korean government and former leader Kim Jong-il, to perform at the country‚Äôs 26th Spring Friendship Festival. He was the first and only American who was asked among 680 worldwide performers, musicians, and entertainers. Since then, he has been three times, in 2011 and 2012, and has performed at the Pyongyang Circus Theater. He has also traveled to Europe, Australia, South America, Latin America and China 11 times. He currently resides in La Verne, California. His son, Ryan Salwak, is also training to be a magician.  Awards and honors  Salwak has received numerous honors including Purdue University‚Äôs Distinguished Alumni Award, a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, and a National Defense Education Act fellowship from the University of Southern California.
