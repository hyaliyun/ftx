The default position is typically intended to cause muscle fatigue, such as standing on tiptoe, which forces the subject to choose a more physically painful position, for example letting themselves lower their weight and stand regularly while forcing a rope attached to their genitals to pull taut and cause pain.CRC Press, Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crime, p. 148 Predicament bondage can also involve the use of a single position in which remaining still will not cause any discomfort for the subject, but moving their body will pull on ropes, weights or other devices meant to cause them pain.

Life He was born at Kitzingen in Franconia, and was educated at Nuremberg then Wittenberg, where he became the close friend of Philipp Melanchthon. In 1541 he was appointed professor of Latin grammar at Wittenberg, and in 1557 professor of the Old Testament at Wittenberg University. His range of learning was wide, and he published a handbook of Jewish history, a historical calendar intended to supersede the Roman Saints' Calendar, and a revision of the Latin Old Testament. In the theological conflict of the time he played a large part, doing what he could to mediate between the extremists. From 1559 to the close of his life he was superintendent general of the electorate of Saxony. He attained some fame as a hymn writer, his best-known composition being Wenn wir in h√∂chsten N√∂ten sein.

Aref al-Aref served as mayor of East Jerusalem in the 1950s, during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank. Biography Aref al-Aref was born as Aref Shehadeh in Jerusalem in 1892. His father was a vegetable vendor. Excelling at his studies in primary school, he was sent to high school in Turkey. He attended the Marjan Preparatory School and Mulkiyya College in Istanbul. During his college studies, he wrote for a Turkish newspaper. Later, he worked as a translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as an officer in the Ottoman Army in World War I. He was captured on the Caucasus front and spent three years in a prisoner of war camp in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. In Krasnoyarsk, he edited a newspaper in handwritten Arabic called Nakatullah [Camel of God] and translated Ernst Haeckel‚Äôs Die Weltraethsel (\\"The Riddles of the Universe\\") into Turkish. After the Russian Revolution he escaped and returned to Palestine. Aref al-Aref died on July 30, 1973, in al-Bireh. Political activism Aref al-Aref (seated, center), as District Administrative Officer of Beersheba Home of Aref al-Aref, Beersheba By 1919, al-Aref was involved in political activism in Palestine, agitating for unity of Palestine with Syria. In October 1919, he became editor of the recently established newspaper Suriya al-Janubiya (Southern Syria), which was the first Arab nationalist newspaper published in Jerusalem and was an organ of the al-Nadi al-'Arabi (The Arab Club). Initially Suriya al-Janubiya supported the British military authorities, but soon became an opponent of the British Mandate. Al-Aref attended the Nebi Musa religious festival in Jerusalem in 1920 riding on his horse, and gave a speech at the Jaffa Gate. The nature of his speech is disputed. According to Benny Morris, he said \\"If we don't use force against the Zionists and against the Jews, we will never be rid of them\\",, quoting the official history of the Haganah while Bernard Wasserstein wrote \\"he seems to have co-operated with the police, and there is no evidence that he actively instigated violence\\". In fact, \\"Zionist intelligence reports of this period are unanimous in stressing that he spoke repeatedly against violence\\". Soon the festival became a riot involving attacks on the local Jews. Al-Aref was arrested for incitement, but when he was let out on bail he escaped to Syria together with co-accused Haj Amin al- Husseini. In another version, he was warned and escaped before being arrested. He advised Arabs against violence, urging them instead to adopt the \\"discipline, silence, and courage\\" of their opponents. In his absence, a military court sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. In Damascus, al-Aref became a deputy to the General Syrian Congress and with Hajj Amin and others formed al-Jam'iyya al-'Arabiyya al-Filastiniyya (Palestinian Arab Society). He became its Secretary-General and campaigned against the decisions of the San Remo conference. After the French invasion of Syria in July 1920 he fled to Transjordan. He returned to Jerusalem late in 1920 after being pardoned by the new High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, but the government refused to allow his newspaper to reopen. Political career In 1921, he was appointed as a District Officer of the British administration by the Civil Secretary Colonel Wyndham Deedes. He served in that capacity in Jenin, Nablus, Beisan, and Jaffa. In 1926 he was seconded to the Government of Transjordan as Chief Secretary, where he served for three years. However he continued his political activities on the side to the displeasure of his British superior. He returned to Palestine in 1929, where he served as District Officer in Beersheba and later in Gaza. In 1933 he received a special commendation from the High Commissioner for keeping his district quiet during a time of disturbances elsewhere. In 1942 he was promoted and transferred to al-Bireh. He continued as a Mandate official until 1948. Upon Jordanian control of the West Bank, al-Aref was appointed military governor of Ramallah governorate then from 1949 to 1955 served as mayor of East Jerusalem. In 1967, he was appointed director of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.

It is divided into two cantons: * Canton de Bas de la Vingtaine de la Ville * Canton de Haut de la Vingtaine de la Ville The Vingtaine de la Ville maintains an autonomous financial existence, unlike other vingtaines in Jersey, thanks to an endowment which has its origins in the purchase of Le Mont de la Ville by the British government in 1804. Formerly, Le Mont de la Ville, a craggy plateau overlooking the town of St. Helier, was topped by open common land used for grazing and rabbit hunting. In 1785 part of the plateau was levelled as a parade ground, which led to the discovery of a dolmen which the vingtaine presented to the Governor of Jersey, General Henry Seymour Conway (later Field Marshal), who subsequently transported it to his estate at Henley-on-Thames where it was re-erected. As it is now a listed monument in the United Kingdom, attempts to have it returned to Jersey have been to no avail. The continuing Napoleonic threat persuaded the British government to fortify the hill and Fort Regent was constructed. The proceeds from the sale established the original fund that lay at the foundation of the finances managed by the vingtaine's two elected procureurs today. Until 1831, many bodies and individuals in Jersey issued their own banknotes. The parishes of Jersey issued notes, as did the Vingtaine de la Ville. Legislation in 1831 attempted to regulate such issues, but the parishes and the Vingtaine de la Ville were exempted from the regulatory provisions. Gradually, administrative and financial functions carried out by the vingtaine were taken over by the parish and by the States of Jersey. Elections For electoral purposes, St. Helier is divided into four districts. The Vingtaine de la Ville forms District No. 1 and elects 3 Deputies to the States of Jersey. Heritage Despite the effects of inflation and the passage of time, the funds available to the vingtaine are still sufficient to enable small-scale heritage projects to be undertaken. The vingtaine has its own website here, which contains sites of historical interest, maps, and details of plaques. In all there are over 50 plaques and features in the Vingtaine that have been erected to commemorate people and/or events that have a special place in the history of the Island or the Vingtaine.

It is the melting of the DNA which is not induced by a promoter, but purely by the superhelical (also called topological) nature of the DNA. It is based on a statistical mechanics treatment of DNA made by Craig J. Benham and Richard M. Fye. This stress-induced unwinding was shown to coincide with DNA promoter regions of bacterial plasmids and may direct the global response of cells to changes in their external environments by affecting which genes are transcribed. The computational model itself calculates the probability profile of a given base-pair sequence of DNA to denature, as well as the energy profile of sequence. It is through this energy profile that the technique derives its name: base pairs at lower energies are less stable (destabilized) than those of higher energies and more likely to denature. Stress related to the linking number (specifically its twist component) of the DNA causes the destabilization of the double helix (duplex); hence, Stress-Induced Duplex Destabilization. Applet Craig Benham has also developed an online applet that calculates the SIDD profile of input DNA sequences. It also shows the probability profile for the given base pair sequence to denature, as well as counting the number and location of denaturation runs. As the full SIDD computational method takes up a large amount of machine processing time (due to its complex nature), an accelerated algorithm proposed by Benham, et al., in their 1999 paper is implemented in the WebSIDD algorithm. This accelerated algorithm truncates the partition function by ignoring contributions of certain conformational states.

Their appearance may be due to a combination of erosion by underground rainwater and then by subsequent weathering after they were exposed. Most of the pillars emerge without a break from the underlying granite. Their structural base may be of orthogonal or vertically-aligned sheet jointing.

Fuld, The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk (Courier Dover Publications, 5th edn., 2000), , p. 502. Meaning and origin The seesaw is one of the oldest 'rides' for children, easily constructed from logs of different sizes. The words of \\"See Saw Margery Daw\\" reflect children playing on a see-saw and singing this rhyme to accompany their game. No person has been identified by the name Margery Daw and so it is assumed that this was purely used to rhyme with the words 'seesaw'. The rhyme may have its origins as a work song for sawyers, helping to keep rhythm when using a two-person saw. In his 1640 play The Antipodes, Richard Brome indicated the connection between sawyers and the phrase \\"see saw sacke a downe\\". The game of see-saw in which two children classically sit opposite each other holding hands and moving backwards and forwards first appears in print from about 1700. The Opies note that \\"daw\\" means \\"a lazy person\\", but in Scots it is \\"an untidy woman, a slut, a slattern\\" and give this variant of \\"Margery Daw\\": :See-saw, Margery Daw, :Sold her bed and lay on the straw; :Sold her bed and lay upon hay :And pisky came and carried her away. :For wasn't she a dirty slut :To sell her bed and lie in the dirt?

The Philippines is one of the two nations in Asia having a substantial portion of the population professing the Catholic faith, along with East Timor, and has the third largest Catholic population in the world after Brazil and Mexico. The episcopal conference responsible in governing the faith is the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. Christianity was first brought to the Philippine islands by Spanish missionaries and settlers, who arrived in waves beginning in the early 16th century in Cebu. Compared to the Spanish Era, when Christianity was recognized as the state religion, the faith today is practiced in the context of a secular state. In 2015, it was estimated that 84 million Filipinos, or roughly 82.9% to 85% of the population, profess the Catholic faith.Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths, Pew Research. July 19, 2012. History =Spanish Era= Starting in the 16th century Spanish explorers and settlers arrived in the Philippines with two major goals: to participate in the spice trade which was previously dominated by Portugal and to evangelize and in nearby civilizations, such as China. While many historians claim that the first Mass in the islands was held on Easter Sunday of 1521 in a little island near the present day Bukidnon Province, the exact location is disputed. A more verifiable Mass was held at the island-port named Mazaua on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1521, as recorded by the Venetian diarist Antonio Pigafetta who travelled on the Spanish expedition to reach the islands in 1521 led by Ferdinand Magellan. Later, the Legazpi expedition of 1565 that originated and was organized from Mexico City marked the beginning of the Hispanisation of the Philippines, beginning from Cebu.\\"Cebu‚ÄîCradle of the Philippine Church and Seat of Far-East Christianity.\\" International Eucharistic Congress 2016, December 4, 2014, accessed December 4, 2014, http://iec2016.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cebu%E2%80%94Cradle-of-the- Philippine-Church-and-Seat-of-Far-East-Christianity.pdf This expedition was an effort to occupy the islands with as little bloodshed and conflict as possible, ordered by Phillip II. Lieutenant Legazpi, in an effort to make peace with the natives and to achieve swift conquest, set up colonies. Naga Cathedral, metropolitan see of the Archdiocese of Caceres centered in Naga City. Christianity expanded from Cebu when the remaining Spanish missionaries were forced westwards temporarily due to conflict with the Portuguese, and laid the foundations of the Christian community in the Panay in around 1560 to 1571. A year later the second batch of missionaries reached Cebu. The island became the ecclesiastical \\"seat\\", as it is the center for evangelization. A notable missionary was Fray Alfonso Jimenez , who travelled and penetrated the Camarines region through the islands of Masbate, Leyte, Samar, and Burias and centered the church on Naga City. He was called the first apostle of the region. By 1571 Fray Herrera, who was assigned as chaplain of Legazpi, advanced from Panay further north and founded the local Church community in Manila. The good father thereafter voyaged in the Espiritu Santo and shipwrecked in Catanduanes; there he attempted to convert the natives, and was martyred for the faith. In 1572 the Spaniards led by Juan de Salcedo marched from Manila further north with the second batch of Augustinian missionaries and pioneered the evangelization in the Ilocos (starting with Vigan) and the Cagayan regions. Under the encomienda system, Filipinos had to pay tribute to the encomendero of the area and in return the encomendero taught them the Christian faith and also protected them from enemies. Although Spain had used this system, it did not work quite as effectively in the Philippines as it did in America. The missionaries were not as successful in converting the natives as they had hoped. In 1579, Bishop Salazar and clergymen were outraged because the encomenderos had abused their powers. Although the natives were resistant, they could not organise into a unified resistance towards the Spaniards due to geography, ethno-linguistic differences, and overall mutual indifference. Filipinas ready for church, 1905 Cultural impact The Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫, the oldest Christian artefact in the Philippines. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan gave this statue to a Cebuano chieftain that converted to Christianity The Spaniards had observed the natives' lifestyle and disagreed with it wholeheartedly. They saw the influence of the Devil and felt the need to \\"liberate the natives from their evil ways\\". Over time, geographical limitations have shifted the natives into what are called barangays, which are small kinship units consisting of about 30 to 100 families. Each barangay had a mutable caste system, with any sub-classes varying from one barangay to the next. Generally, patriarchal lords and kings were called datus and rajas, while the mah√°rlika were the nobility and the timawa were freedmen. The alipin or servile class were dependent on the upper classes, an arrangement misconstrued as slavery by the Spaniards. Intermarriage between the timawa and the alipin was permitted, which created a more or less flexible system of privileges and labour services. The Spaniards attempted to suppress this class system based on their misconception that the dependent, servile class were an oppressed group. Although they failed at completely abolishing the system, they instead worked to use it to their own advantage. Religion and marriage were also issues that the missionaries of Spain wanted to transform. Polygyny was not uncommon, but was mostly confined to wealthier chieftains. Divorce and remarriage were also common as long as reasons were justified. Illness, infertility, or a finding better potential to take as a spouse were justified reasons for divorce. Along with those practices, missionaries also disagreed with the practices of paying dowries, the \\"bride price\\" where the groom paid his father-in-law in gold, or with \\"bride-service\\", in which the groom performed manual labour for the bride's family, the latter custom dying out only in the late 20th century. Missionaries had disapproved of these because they felt bride-price was an act of selling one's daughter, and labour services in the household of the father allowed premarital sex between the bride and groom, which contradicted Christian beliefs. Pre-conquest the natives followed a variety of monotheistic and polytheistic cults. Often, localized forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam or Tantrism admixed with Animism. Bathala (Tagalog ‚Äì Central Luzon) or Laon (Visayan) was the ultimate, creator deity above subordinate gods and goddesses. Natives also worshiped nature and venerated the spirits of their ancestors whom they propitiated with sacrifices. There was ritualistic drinking and many rituals performed aimed at cure for a certain illness. Magic and superstition also existed among the natives. The Spaniards claimed to liberate the natives from their wicked practices and show them the right path to God. In 1599, negotiation began between a number of lords and their freemen and the Spaniards. The native rulers agreed to submit to the rule of a Castilian king and convert to Christianity, and allow missionaries to spread the faith. In return, the Spaniards agreed to protect the natives from their enemies, mostly Japanese, Chinese, and Muslim pirates. Difficulties Magellan's Cross outside of the Basilica del Santo Ni√±o, Cebu City. The Cross is a symbol of the introduction of Christianity to the islands. Several factors hindered the Spaniards' efforts to spread Christianity throughout the archipelago. An inadequate number of missionaries on the island made it difficult to reach all the people and harder to convert them. This is also due to the fact that the route to the Philippines was in itself a rigorous task and some clergy never had the opportunity to set foot on the islands. Some clergy fell ill or waited years for their chance to take the journey. For others, the climate difference once they arrived proved to be unbearable. Other missionaries desired to go to Japan or China instead and spread their faith there, or those who remained were more interested in mercantilism. The Spaniards also quarreled with the Chinese population in the Philippines. The Chinese had set up shops in what was called the Parian or bazaar during the 1580s to trade silk and other goods for Mexican silver. The Spaniards anticipated revolts from the Chinese and therefore were under constant suspicion of the latter. The Spanish government was highly dependent on the influx of silver from Mexico and Peru since it supported the government in Manila, the main city, and to continue the Christianization of the archipelago. The most difficult obstacles facing the missionaries were the dispersion of the Filipinos and their seemingly endless varieties of languages and dialects. The geographical isolation forced them into numerous small villages and every other province supported a different language. Furthermore, incessant privateering from Japanese Wokou pirates and slave-raiding by Islamic Moros continuously frustrated Spanish attempts to Christianize the archipelago and, in order to offset the damaging effects of incessant warfare with them, the Spanish had to resort to militarizing the local populations, importing soldiers from Latin America, and to construct networks of fortresses across the islands. The Spanish Empire and its local allies being in a state of constant war against such pirates and slavers caused the Philippines to be a drain to the Vice-royalty of New Spain in Mexico City, which paid the costs of maintaining the captaincy of Las Islas Filipinas in lieu of the crown of Spain. Religious orders The Philippines is home to many of the world's major religious congregations, these include the Redemptorists Augustinians, Recollects, Jesuits, Dominicans, Benedictines, Franciscans, Carmelites, Divine Word Missionaries, De La Salle Christian Brothers, Salesians of Don Bosco, and the indigenous Religious of the Virgin Mary. The five regular orders who were assigned to Christianize the natives were the Augustinians, who came with Legazpi, the Discalced Franciscans (1578), the Jesuits (1581), the Dominican friars (1587) and the Augustinian Recollects (simply called the Recoletos, 1606). In 1594, all had agreed to cover a specific area of the archipelago to deal with the vast dispersion of the natives. The Augustinians and Franciscans mainly covered the Tagalog country while the Jesuits had a small area. The Dominicans encompassed the Parian. The provinces of Pampanga and Ilokos were assigned to the Augustinians. The province of Camarines went to the Franciscans. The Augustinians and Jesuits were also assigned the Visayan islands. The Christian conquest had not reached the Mindanao province due to a highly resistant Muslim community that existed pre-conquest. The task of the Spanish missionaries, however, was far from complete. By the seventeenth century, the Spaniards had created about 20 large villages and almost completely transformed the native lifestyle. For their Christian efforts, the Spaniards justified their actions by claiming that the small villages were a sign of barbarism and only bigger, more compact communities allowed for a richer understanding for Christianity. The Filipinos faced much coercion; the Spaniards knew little of native rituals. The layout of these villages was in gridiron form that allowed for easier navigation and more order. They were also spread far enough to allow for one cabecera or capital parish, and small visita chapels located throughout the villages in which clergy only stayed temporarily for Mass, rituals, or nuptials. Indigenous resistance The Filipinos to an extent resisted Christianisation because they felt an agricultural obligation and connection with their rice fields: large villages took away their resources and they feared the compact environment. This also took away from the encomienda system that depended on land, therefore, the encomenderos lost tributes. However, the missionaries continued their proselytising efforts, one strategy being targeting noble children. These scions of now-tributary monarchs and rulers were subjected to intense education in religious doctrine and the Spanish language, with the theory that they in turn could convert their elders, and eventually the nobleman's subjects. Despite the progress of the Spaniards, it took many years for the natives to truly grasp key concepts of Christianity. In Catholicism, four main sacraments attracted the natives but only for ritualistic reasons, and they did not fully alter their lifestyle as the Spaniards had hoped. Baptism was believed to simply cure ailments, while Matrimony was a concept many natives could not understand and thus they violated the sanctity of monogamy. They were however, allowed to keep the tradition of dowry, which was accepted into law; \\"bride-price\\" and \\"bride-service\\" were practiced by natives despite labels of heresy. Confession was required of everyone once a year, and the clergy used the confessionario, a bilingual text aid, to help natives understand the rite's meaning and what they had to confess. Locals were initially apprehensive, but gradually used the rite to excuse excesses throughout the year. Communion was given out selectively, for this was one of the most important sacraments that the missionaries did not want to risk having the natives violate. To help their cause, evangelism was done in the native language. The Doctrina Christiana is a book of catechism, the alphabet, and basic prayers in Tagalog (both in the Latin alphabet and Baybayin) and Spanish published in the 16th century. =American period: 1898‚Äì1946= During the sovereignty of the United States, the American government implemented the separation of church and state. It reduced the significant political power exerted by the Church, which led to the establishment of other faiths (particularly Protestantism) within the country. In this era, in the first decade of 1900, Jorge Barlin was ordained as the first Filipino bishop of the Catholic Church, for the Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres. A provision of the 1935 Philippine Constitution mimicked the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and added the sentences: \\"The exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall be forever allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil political rights.\\" But the Philippine experience has shown that this theoretical wall of separation has been crossed several times by secular authorities. =1946‚Äìpresent= Catholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila, 2010 When the Philippines was placed under Martial Law by dictator Ferdinand Marcos, relations between Church and State changed dramatically, as some bishops expressly and openly opposed Martial Law. The turning point came in 1986 when the CBCP President then-Archbishop of Cebu Ricardo Cardinal Vidal appealed to the Filipinos and the bishops against the government and the fraudulent result of the snap election; with him was then-Archbishop of Manila Jaim√© Cardinal Sin, who broadcast over Church-owned Radio Veritas a call for people to support anti-regime rebels. The people's response became what is now known as the People Power Revolution, which ousted Marcos. Church and State today maintain generally cordial relations despite differing opinions over specific issues. With the guarantee of religious freedom in the Philippines, the Catholic clergy subsequently remained in the political background as a source of moral influence especially during elections. Political candidates continue to court the clergy and religious leaders for support. In the 21st century, Catholic practice ranges from traditional orthodoxy, to Folk Catholicism and Charismatic Catholicism. Of the roughly 84 million Filipino Catholics today, 37 percent are estimated to hear Mass regularly, 29 percent consider themselves very religious, and less than 10 percent ever think of leaving the church. During the Philippine Drug War, the Church in the Philippines has been critical of extra judicial killings, and what it sees as Duterte Administration approval of the bloodshed. Members of the Catholic clergy have been killed during the drug war. In response, some churches offer sanctuary to those who fear death due to the drug war violence. In response to the criticism he has received from the Church, Duterte criticized the Church and said: On March 2020, in response to the prohibition of mass gatherings during the \\"enhanced community quarantine\\" throughout Luzon, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) through its President, Archbishop Romulo Valles, said that the celebration of the Eucharist, other liturgical services and spiritual activities from every diocese under their jurisdiction have to be broadcast live through the internet, television or radio. All activities for the Lenten season are also cancelled. Earlier during the Metro Manila partial lockdown, the Archdiocese of Manila through its Apostolic Administrator, Bishop Broderick Pabillo, already cancelled the celebration of the Holy Mass and dispensed the faithful from attending it. Internal movements Quiapo Church, the Basilica Minore of the Nazarene is home of the statue of the Black Nazarene, which is the focus of widespread popular devotion in the country. =Catholic Charismatic Renewal= A number of Catholic Charismatic Renewal movements emerged vis-a-vis the Born-again movement during the 70s. The charismatic movement offered In-the-Spirit seminars in the early days, which have now evolved and have different names; they focus the charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit. Some of the charismatic movements were the Ang Ligaya ng Panginoon, Assumption Prayer Group, Couples for Christ, the Brotherhood of Christian Businessmen and Professionals, El Shaddai, Elim Communities, Kerygma, the Light of Jesus Family, Shalom, and Soldiers of Christ. =Neocatechumenal Way= The Catholic Church's Neocatechumenal Way in the Philippines has been established more than 40 years. Membership in the Philippines now exceeds 25,000 persons in more than 700 communities, with concentrations in Manila and IloIlo province. A neocatechumenal diocesan seminary, Redemptoris Mater, is located in Para√±aque, while many families in mission are all over the islands. The Way has been mostly concentrated on evangelisation initiatives under the authority of the local bishops. Papal visits Pope Francis in Tacloban in January 2015 * Pope Paul VI (1970) was the target of an assassination attempt at Manila International Airport in the Philippines in 1970.\\"Apostle Endangered\\".

The assailant, a Bolivian Surrealist painter named Benjam√≠n Mendoza y Amor Flores, lunged toward Pope Paul with a kris, but was subdued. * Pope John Paul II (1981 and 1995) returned for World Youth Day 1995 which was reported to have an attendance of around five million Filipino and foreign people in Rizal Park. * Pope Francis (2015) visited the country on January 15 to 19, 2015, and was invited by Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle to return for the International Eucharistic Congress in Cebu in 2016. At the Mass at Manila's Quirino Grandstand inside Rizal Park on Sunday, January 18, 2015. the attendance was pegged at about six to seven million worshippers, making the event the highest number ever recorded in papal history according to Fr. Federico Lombardi, director of the Vatican Press Office. Education The Catholic Church is involved in education at all levels. It has founded and continues to sponsor hundreds of secondary and primary schools as well as a number of colleges and internationally known universities. The Jesuit Ateneo de Manila University, La Salle Brothers De La Salle University, and the Dominican University of Santo Tomas are listed in the \\"World's Best Colleges and Universities\\" in the Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings.Top Universities Other prominent educational institutions in the country are St. Scholastica's College Manila, Angeles University Foundation, Holy Angel University, Vincentian's Adamson University, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, University of San Carlos, University of San Jose ‚Äì Recoletos, San Beda College, Saint Louis University, Saint Mary's University, St. Paul University System, Canossa School, San Pedro College, San Sebastian College ‚Äì Recoletos de Manila, Ateneo de Davao University, Xavier University ‚Äì Ateneo de Cagayan, University of St. La Salle, University of the Immaculate Conception, Notre Dame University, Notre Dame of Marbel University, Notre Dame of Dadiangas University, Salesians of Don Bosco in the Philippines, Saint Mary's Academy of Nagcarlan, Sanctuario de San Antonio Children's Learning Center, and the University of San Agustin, La Consolacion College, Universidad de Santa Isabel, Ateneo de Naga University, University of Santo Tomas - Legazpi Political influence President Duterte meets with Cardinal Tagle at the Malaca√±an Palace The Catholic Church wields great influence on Philippine society and politics. One typical event is the role of the Catholic hierarchy during the bloodless People Power Revolution of 1986. Then-Archbishop of Cebu Ricardo Cardinal Vidal and then-Archbishop of Manila Jaime Cardinal Sin were the two pillars of the uprising against autocratic dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. The Cebu Archbishop, who was president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines at that time, led the rest of the Philippine bishops and made a joint declaration against the government and the results of the snap election, while the Manila Archbishop appealed to the public via radio to march along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in support of rebel forces. Some seven million people responded in what became known as the 1986 People Power Revolution, which lasted from February 22‚Äì25. The non-violent revolution successfully drove President Marcos out of power and into exile in Hawaii. In 1989, President Corazon Aquino asked Cardinal Vidal to convince General Jose Comendador, who was sympathetic to the rebel forces fighting her government, to peacefully surrender. His attempt averted what could have been a bloody coup. In October 2000, an aged Cardinal Sin expressed his dismay over the allegations of corruption against President Joseph Estrada. His call sparked the second EDSA Revolution, dubbed as \\"EDSA Dos\\". Cardinal Vidal stepped forward again and personally asked Estrada to step down, to which he agreed at around 12:20 p.m. of January 20, 2001, after five continuous days of protest at the EDSA Shrine and cities, municipalities and provinces of the Philippines and various parts of the world. His Vice-President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, succeeded him immediately and was sworn in on the terrace of the Shrine in front of Cardinal Sin. On the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared three days of national mourning, and was one of many dignitaries at his funeral in Vatican City. Political turmoil in the Philippines widened the rift between the State and the Church. Arroyo's press secretary Ignacio Bunye called the bishops and priests who attended an anti- Arroyo protest as hypocrites and \\"people who hide their true plans\\". The Church in the Philippines strongly opposed the Reproductive Bill, which is commonly known as RH Bill. The country's populace ‚Äì 80% of which self-identify as Catholic ‚Äì was deeply divided in its opinions over the issue.Dentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre Japan (2006) In 2017, a USA Today reporter remarked that the Church reached it political peak in 1986, when it was instrumental in replacing the Marcos regime. It lost influence when it opposed contraceptives in 2012. It was therefore less effective when it tried to rally public support against the Duterte administration's killing of 8,000 people in 2017. Marian devotion Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Concepcion, is the principal patroness of the Philippines Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia has almost five to nine million devotees attending its annual feast in Naga City. The Philippines has shown a strong devotion to Mary, evidenced by her patronage of various towns and locales nationwide. Particularly, there are pilgrimage sites where each town has created their own versions of Mary. With Spanish regalia, indigenous miracle stories, and Asian facial features, Filipino Catholics have created hybridized, localized images, the popular devotions to which have been recognized by various Popes. Filipino Marian images with an established devotion have generally received a Canonical Coronation, with the icon's principal shrine being customarily elevated to the status of minor basilica. Below are some pilgrimage sites and the year they received a canonical blessing: * Our Lady of the Abandoned (Nuestra Se√±ora de los Desamparad√≥s) Marikina City ‚Äì 2005 * Our Lady of La Leche (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Leche Y Buen Parto) Diocese of Imus, Silang, Cavite * Our Lady of Aranzazu (Nuestra Se√±ora de Aranzazu) San Mateo, Rizal ‚Äì 2017 * Our Lady of Bigl√°ng Aw√† (Nuestra Se√±ora del Pronto Socorro) Boac, Marinduque ‚Äì 1978 * Our Lady of Caysasay (Nuestra Se√±ora de Cays√°say) Taal, Batangas ‚Äì 1954 * Our Lady of Charity (Nuestra Se√±ora de Caridad) ‚Äì Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity ** Bantay, Ilocos Sur ‚Äì 1956 ** Agoo, La Union ‚Äì 1971 * Our Lady of Consolation (Nuestra Se√±ora de Consolaci√≥n y Correa) San Agustin Church, Intramuros, City of Manila * Mother of the Divine Shepherd (Nuestra Se√±ora Divina Pastora) Gapan, Nueva Ecija ‚Äì 1964 * Our Lady of Namacpacan (Nuestra Se√±ora de Namacpacan) Luna, La Union ‚Äì 1959 * Our Lady of Buen Suceso (Para√±aque) (Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Suceso de Para√±aque) Para√±aque City ‚Äì 2005 * Our Lady of Guadalupe (Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe) Pagsanjan, Laguna * Our Lady of Guadalupe of Cebu (Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Ceb√∫) Cebu City ‚Äì 2006 * Our Lady of Guidance (Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia) Ermita, City of Manila ‚Äì 1955 * Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of Pasig (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Pasig) Pasig City ‚Äì 2008 *Our Lady of Immaculate Conception (Nuestra Se√±ora de La Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Malab√≥n) Malabon City ‚Äì 1986 *Our Lady of Immaculate Conception (Virgen Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Malolos) Malolos, Bulacan ‚Äì 2012 * Our Lady of La Naval (Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠simo Rosario de la Naval de Manila) Quezon City ‚Äì 1907 * Our Lady of Lourdes (Nuestra Se√±ora de Lourdes) Quezon City ‚Äì 1951 * Our Lady of Manaoag (Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠simo Rosario de Man√°oag) Manaoag, Pangasinan ‚Äì 1926 * Our Lady of Orani (Nuestra Se√±ora del Santo Rosario de Orani) ‚Äì Orani, Bataan * Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz y Buen Viaje) Antipolo, Rizal ‚Äì 1926 * Our Lady of Pe√±afr√°ncia of Naga (Nuestra Se√±ora de Pe√±afr√°ncia de Naga) Naga City, Camarines Sur ‚Äì 1924 * Our Lady of Pe√±afr√°ncia of Manila (Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario de R√≠o P√°sig) Paco, City of Manila ‚Äì 1985 * Our Lady of Piat (Nuestra Se√±ora de P√≠at) Piat, Cagayan ‚Äì 1954 * Our Lady of the Pillar (Nuestra Se√±ora la Virgen del Pilar) Zamboanga City ‚Äì 1960 * Our Lady of the Pillar of Imus (Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Imus) Imus, Cavite ‚Äì 2012 * Our Lady of the Pillar of Manila (Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Manila) Santa Cruz, Manila ‚Äì 2017 * Our Lady of the Rule (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Regla) Opon, Cebu ‚Äì 1954 * Our Lady of Solitude of Vaga Gate (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga) Cavite City * Our Lady of Sorrows of Tur√∫mba (Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores de Tur√∫mba) Pakil, Laguna * Our Lady of the Presentation (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candel√°ria) Jaro, Iloilo City * Our Mother of Perpetual Help (Nuestra Se√±ora del Perpetuo Socorro) Baclaran, Para√±aque City * Our Lady of Salvation (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salvaci√≥n) Joroan, Tiwi, Albay * Our Lady of Mercy (Nuestra Se√±ora dela Merced) Novaliches, Quezon City * Our Lady of Soterra√±a de Nieva, currently under the ownership of Imelda Marcos * Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga (Indu Ning Capaldanan) Archdiocese Of San Fernando Pampanga * Our Lady of Hope of Palo (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Esperanza) Archdiocese of Palo, Palo, Leyte *Our Lady of the Rose de Macati (\\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Rosa de Macati\\") Archdiocese of Manila, Poblacion, Makati Religious observances Catholic holy days, such as Christmas and Good Friday, are observed as national holidays,gov.ph with local saints' days being observed as holidays in different towns and cities. The Hispanic-influenced custom of holding fiestas in honour of patron saints have become an integral part of Filipino culture, as it allows for communal celebration while serving as a time marker for the year. A nationwide fiesta occurs on the third Sunday of January, on the country-specific Feast of the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫. The largest celebrations are the Sinulog Festival in Cebu City, the Ati-Atihan in Kalibo, Aklan, and the Dinagyang in Iloilo City (which is instead held on the fourth Sunday of January). With regard to most holy days of obligation, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) granted dispensation for all the faithful who cannot attend Masses on these days, except for the following yuletide observances: *Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, *Christmas Day *Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God on January 1 In 2001, the CBCP also approved a reform in the liturgical calendar, which added to its list of obligatory memorials the Feasts of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Maximilian Kolbe, Rita of Cascia, Ezequiel Moreno and many others. Filipino diaspora Overseas Filipinos have spread Filipino culture worldwide, bringing Filipino Catholicism with them. Filipinos have established two shrines in the Chicago Metropolitan Area: one at St. Wenceslaus Church dedicated to Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ and another at St. Hedwig's with its statue to Our Lady of Manaoag. The Filipino community in the Archdiocese of New York has the San Lorenzo Ruiz Chapel (New York City) for its apostolate. Ecclesiastical territories The Catholic Church in the Philippines is organized into 72 dioceses in 16 Ecclesiastical Provinces, as well as 7 Apostolic Vicariates and a Military Ordinariate.

The Indonesian term kabupaten is also sometimes translated as \\"municipality\\". Regencies and cities are divided into districts (Kecamatan, or Distrik in Papua). The English name \\"regency\\" comes from the Dutch colonial period, when regencies were ruled by bupati (or regents) and were known as regentschap in Dutch (kabupaten in Javanese and subsequently Indonesian). Bupati had been regional lords under the precolonial monarchies of Java. When the Dutch abolished or curtailed those monarchies, the bupati were left as the most senior indigenous authority. They were not, strictly speaking, \\"native rulers\\" because the Dutch claimed full sovereignty over their territory, but in practice, they had many of the attributes of petty kings, including elaborate regalia and palaces and a high degree of impunity. Etymology Portrait of a Javanese regent in gala uniform (circa 1900). The Indonesian title of bupati is originally a loanword from Sanskrit originating in India, a shortening of the Sanskrit title bhumi- pati (bhumi ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø '(of the) land' + pati ‡§™‡§§‡§ø 'lord', hence bhumi-pati 'lord of the land'). In Indonesia, bupati was originally used as a Javanese title for regional rulers in precolonial kingdoms, its first recorded usage being in a Telaga Batu inscription during the Srivijaya period, in which bhupati is mentioned among the titles of local rulers who paid allegiance to Sriwijaya's kings.Casparis, J.G., (1956), Prasasti Indonesia II: Selected Inscriptions from the 7th to the 9th Century A.D., Dinas Purbakala Republik Indonesia, Bandung: Masa Baru. Related titles which were also used in precolonial Indonesia are adipati ('duke') and senapati ('lord of the army' or 'general'). Pre-independence period Regencies in Java territorial units were grouped together into residencies headed by exclusively European residents. This term hinted that the residents had a quasi-diplomatic status in relation to the bupati (and indeed they had such a relationship with the native rulers who continued to prevail in much of Indonesia outside Java), but in practice the bupati had to follow Dutch instructions on any matter of concern to the colonial authorities. The relationship between those sides was ambivalent: while legal and military power rested with the Dutch government (or, for a long time, with the Dutch East India Company (commonly known as the VOC, an abbreviation of the Dutch ) under a Governor General in Batavia on Java, the regents held higher protocollary rank than the assistant-resident who supposedly advised them and held day-to-day sway over the population. After the independence of Indonesia in 1945, the terms bupati and kabupaten were applied throughout the archipelago to the administrative unit below the residency (karesidenan). Recent history Since the start of the Reform Era in 1998 a remarkable secession of district governments has arisen in Indonesia. The process has become known as pemekaran (division). Following the surge of support for decentralisation across Indonesia which occurred following the fall of Suharto in 1998, key new decentralisation laws were passed in 1999. Subsequently, there was a jump in the number of regencies (and cities) from around 300 at the end of 1998 to over 490 in 2008 ten years later. This secession of new regencies, welcome at first, has become increasingly controversial within Indonesia because the administrative fragmentation has proved costly and has not brought the hoped-for benefits. Senior levels of the administration have expressed a general feeling that the process of pemekaran now needs to be slowed (or even stopped for the time being) but local politicians at various levels across government in Indonesia continue to express strong populist support for the continued creation of new regencies. Yosua Sitomorang, 'Strategic Asia: When it comes to Regional Autonomy in Indonesia, Breaking Up Should be Harder to Do' , The Jakarta Globe, 9 June 2010. Since 1998, a large portion of governance have been delegated from central government in Jakarta to local regencies, with regencies now playing important role in providing services to Indonesian people. Direct elections for regents and mayors began in 2005, with the leaders previously being elected by local legislative councils.

These Tibetic languages share the same written script, but their pronunciations, vocabularies and grammars are different. These differences may have emerged due to geographical isolation of the regions of Tibet. Khams Tibetan is used alongside Standard Tibetan and Amdo Tibetan in broadcasting. Khams Tibetan is not mutually intelligible with other Tibetic languages. Like Central Tibetan, Khams Tibetan is a tonal language. Khampa Tibetan is also spoken by about 1,000 people in two enclaves in eastern Bhutan, the descendants of pastoral yak-herding communities. Dialects There are five dialects of Khams Tibetan proper: * Central Khams, spoken in D√™g√™ County and Chamdo * Southern Khams, spoken in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. There are several subdialects due to the mountainous terrain, as well as contact with neighboring language communities for trade. * Northern or Northeastern Khams, spoken in Nangq√™n County and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture * Eastern Khams, spoken in Kangding * Hor, or Western Khams, spoken in Nagqu Prefecture * The G√™rz√™ dialect is sometimes considered Western Khams These have relatively low mutual intelligibility, but are close enough that they are usually considered a single language. Khamba and Tseku are more divergent, but classified with Khams by Tournadre (2013).

Bye was born in Paignton, Devon and graduated from Oxford University. He was Liberal candidate for Torbay in the 1987 election. Bye served on Torbay Council for five years and served a term as civic mayor in 2003-04. In October 2005, he became the first directly elected mayor of Torbay. He beat Liberal Democrat Nicholas Pannell in the second round of counting with a total of 7,096 votes to Pannell's 5,197. After the election, Bye noted that \\"it is quite clear from canvassing that a lot of people did not want an elected mayor.\\" Bye was the Conservative Party's third directly elected mayor, after Chris Morgan and Linda Arkley in North Tyneside and the first directly elected mayor in the South West. In 2008 fellow Conservative Boris Johnson was elected as the first Conservative mayor of London. Bye was one of three contenders for the Totnes Conservative candidacy, after the announcement by Anthony Steen that he will not stand in the next election. He placed third in the Totnes primary, and defeated by Sarah Wollaston. Bye was the subject of a complaint to Torbay Council's standards committee in August 2010, over the proposed development of a large housing estate on land currently being occupied by Churston Golf Club. This complaint relates to his interests in Eric Lloyd & Co Estate Agents, the only estate agency business with an office in Churston. In 2006 Bye registered the fact that he had a financial interest in the company, and council documents have also shown he is entitled to a profit related bonus from the company. On 12 November 2010 Bye confirmed that he will be seeking to stand as Mayor of Torbay for a further 4 years however he was deselected by the Conservative Party in favour of former independent candidate, Gordon Oliver, and stood for re-election as an independent. He failed to secure re-election in May 2011, losing to his Conservative opponent Gordon Oliver. In December 2014 it was announced that Nicholas Bye has rejoined the Conservative Party and is standing for election to Torbay Council for the Wellswood ward in the upcoming 2015 local elections.

The band is named after the Rosetta Stone, an Egyptian historical artifact, and the band used much ancient mythological imagery, especially in their earlier work. Their early style and first album reflected the jangly-guitar sounds of 1980s gothic rock, and their first big break came after live gigs supporting the then already well- established band The Mission. The band then moved to a more electronic sound before disbanding in 1998. After time spent on different music projects, new Rosetta Stone material appeared in 2019 and 2020. History After playing live gigs around Liverpool and then nationally from 1988 onwards and releasing several independently produced singles to increasing popularity, Rosetta Stone recorded their first full-length album, An Eye for the Main Chance, releasing it in 1991. They also recruited Porl Young as a second guitarist and toured extensively to promote the album. Following on from this, the band released their most successful single, the 12\\" Adrenaline. Porl Young subsequently left the band to produce Children on Stun whilst Porl King and Karl North released a cover version of The Rattles' 1970 hit The Witch which took the band into the UK top 40 singles chart. The band went on to sign a US record and distribution deal with Cleopatra Records who released much of their early cassette and vinyl singles and EPs in 1993 as an album under the title Foundation Stones, and a CD album Adrenaline which, along with the title track, also featuring earlier singles such as An Eye for the Main Chance and The Witch. In the UK they released a CD album (on Minority One) entitled On The Side Of Angels, compiling previous vinyl singles and their various remixes. Using the advance money for 1995's The Tyranny of Inaction, Porl King purchased an Alesis ADAT multi-track digital recorder, the use of which substantially changed Rosetta Stone's sound. That album and most subsequent work featured a much more industrial/electronic sound, with extensive use of sampling. Following an accident in late 1997, Porl King lost part of his left little finger, which changed his guitar style considerably. The band split in 1998 after releasing Chemical Emissions and a radical remix of Tyranny as a limited release CD gENDER cONFUSION and playing a final headlining live performance at the Whitby Gothic Weekend festival in October that year. Karl North went on to join the already-established UK band, the Dream Disciples (their next album Asphyxia notably featuring Karl's Rosetta-sounding bass), and their subsequent live performances attracted much of Rosetta Stone's most ardent UK fanbase. Porl King produced one more album (contractually) of 80s new romantic cover versions under the name Rosetta Stone for Cleopatra Records. He then went on to work on other projects. Rosetta Stone was presumed to have finished as a band. In May 2019, Rosetta Stone, still consisting solely of Porl King, released a new album Seems Like Forever on Cleopatra Records, which included some new material plus songs previously released under Porl's Miserylab project re-recorded with more of Rosetta's signature guitar sound. The album was mixed by Jurgen Engler of Die Krupps. A video was released to promote the track \\"Tomorrow For Us\\". A further full length album, Cryptology, was released in August 2020. Consisting completely of new material, it continued the social commentary of Seems Like Forever, tackling issues such as Brexit, racism and austerity in the UK. Members' related works Porl King wrote and produced his own music throughout the 2000s and early 2010s under the name Miserylab. King also operated as a remixer and producer, working for the likes of the Mercury Music Award -nominated Elbow and the Fluke side-project Syntax. In the 2010s, King worked on the solo project In Death It Ends. The dark, foreboding nature of this project abandons prior interest in politics, and is connected with the witch house scene. Porl returned to release a new album under the Rosetta Stone name in 2019. The Dream Disciples (Karl North) ceased to be active after their performance at Whitby Gothic Weekend in April 2004. Young was resident DJ at Heaven in London. He is co-owner of the Tuff Twins label, and has produced and mixed several club tunes. Fanbase Rosetta Stone were one of the biggest names in the 1990s UK goth live circuit, due both to frequent and extensive early touring and to the successful independent promotion and sales of their records. Porl King was one of the few well-known goth musicians to contribute actively to online discussions with fans, for example on Usenet's uk.people.gothic newsgroup. Their dedication, successive tours and live appearances have gained them a solid fanbase - the most loyal followers became known as \\"Quarriers\\".

As George Dennis wrote, \\"Vulci is a city whose very name... was scarcely remembered, but which now, for the enormous treasures of antiquity it has yielded, is exalted above every other city of the ancient world.\\" Many impressive remains of the city can be seen today. Vulci was located near the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea about 80 km northwest of Rome, on the Fiora River, between Montalto di Castro and Canino. The Vulci, like other Etruscans, became master sculptors in bronze as acknowledged by ancient writers.Athenaeus Deipnosophists 1.28bVitruvius iii.3.5 Pliny Natural History 16 Although most large bronzes have been lost, there remain some magnificent examples of Etruscan bronze work such as the Chimera of Arezzo and the Monteleone chariot, possibly made in Vulci. In the 19th century thousands of the ancient tombs of Vulci were discovered, and many were so well known and spectacular, such as the Tomb of the Sun and Moon, that they were included on the Grand Tour of Europe. From these tombs more Attic vases have been found in the Vulci tombs than at any other ancient siteThe Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, Chapter XXI Vulci, George Dennis, 1848. (at least by the 1850s) and many of these masterpieces as well as Etruscan bronzes have found their way into the major museums of the world where they can be seen today. Despite these discoveries most of these tombs were later forgotten and lost. History The Vulci were a tribe or people who gave their name to their city and were one of the legendary twelve peoples of Etruscan civilization who later formed the dodecapolis Etruscan League to protect their interests. Although the wealth, magnificence and population of Vulci must have been among the first of Etruscan cities, it is mentioned only rarely in ancient literature or potential texts for some periods have been lost; hence the history of Vulci may be reconstructed mainly from archaeology. In the Villanovan period, the wealth of metal resources in the Colline Metallifere hills was important in the development of trade especially with Sardinia. The most important discovery that testifies to the contact between Etruscans and Sardinians in this period was the Tomb of the Sardinian Bronzes in 1958 in the necropolis of Cavalupo, dated 850‚Äì800 BC, of a Sardinian woman of high rank. Among the funeral contents is a magnificent bronze statue of a warrior now in the National Etruscan Museum in the Villa Giulia. Numerous Villanovan fibulas have also been found in Sardinia. Cinerary urn in the form of a house, 8th c. BC, Vulci Vulci's expansion in the Orientalising period of the 8th century BC is marked by the start of production of bronze objects such as covered urns in the shape of a house or cone, and the first of these products showed up in Greece towards the end of the century. The 7th century is represented by the tomb of the Bronze Wagon, and in its later stages valuable and sophisticated products were imported from many Mediterranean markets showing the rise in wealth and culture of Vulci, whilst many Greeks came to live in Vulci as shown by the craftsmanship, manufacture and trade in fine ceramics (e.g. bucchero), bronze and gold. Vulci's golden age of influence and wealth was in the 6th century BC when it ruled over the cities of Orbetello, Saturnia, Sovana, Castro, Pitigliano and Marsiliana. It became a centre of imports of refined Attic pottery, precious oriental balm, beautiful jewels of the most unusual shapes to satisfy its wealthy citizens, as is shown by the many masterpieces of Greek and Etruscan art from the tombs in national museums today. In return it exported its treasures throughout the Mediterranean: pottery, bronzes and wine. The original port of Vulci was a quay on the river Fiora but the expansion of trade led it to build a larger coastal port at Regisvilla (or Regae) and it became a major maritime power although it was located some miles up the river, like Rome. Originally the Etruscans were co-founders of Rome and they continued to dominate it. Vulci had some influence on early Rome, as Servius Tullius and the Vibenna brothers (Caile and Avle Vipinas) were from Vulci. Their names and pictures appear on a fresco in the Fran√ßois Tomb. After the population of Rome had become predominantly Italic, the Etruscan kings were overthrown. After a time of crisis in the 2nd half of the 5th century, Vulci seems to have undergone a new expansion in the 4th century when the great tombs were built such as the Fran√ßois tomb. The Roman‚ÄìEtruscan Wars lasted many years before the Romans gained control over Etruria and the Etruscans were soundly defeated at Lake Vadimo in 310 and 283 BC.Polybius, The Histories, 2.19.7-13 Nevertheless, Vulci was strong enough to further resist until Tiberius Coruncanius triumphed over Vulci in 280 BCrecorded in the Fasti Consulares, preserved in the Capitol. and the colonia of Cosa was founded in its territory. The Romans took the coast from Vulci, cutting the base of their power which seems to have led to the decline of the city. The Etruscan league splintered apart during the war and the Etruscans were soon assimilated. =Roman Period= Vulci does not seem to have been of great importance in the remaining Roman period, even though the Romans built the Via Aurelia through it in 240 BC. However, rich and impressive buildings in the city date to this period. A surviving milestone gives the distance to Rome as 70 milia passuum (miles). The road outside the north gate was repaved probably under Trajan's reign, showing that it continued in good repair. Later Vulci became an episcopal see. The final abandonment seems to be in the 8th c. AD. The Site Recent excavations are discovering much more information on the history and importance of the city. =Necropoli= The former wealth of the town was shown first by the discoveries made in its extensive necropoli starting from the 18th centuryThe Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria by George Dennis, London, 1848 \\\\- Greek vases,N. Spivey, ‚ÄòGreek Vases in Etruria‚Äô, in N. Spivey and T. Rasmussen (eds.), Looking at Greek Vases (Cambridge, 1991) bronzes and other remains. From these tombs more Attic vases have been found in Vulci than at any other ancient site. Many of the finds were sold by the excavators and many found their way into the major museums of the world where they can be seen today. In the 18th and 19th centuries many of the tombs were so well known and spectacular, such as the Tomb of the Sun and Moon, that they were included on the Grand Tour of Europe. Despite these discoveries most of these tombs were later forgotten and lost, except for the Cuccumella tomb, the largest tumulus mound in the whole of Etruria.

Another important burial chamber, the so-called Isis Tomb, proved to be a rich source of finds, most of which are now in the British Museum. The beautiful frescoes of the Hellenistic Tomb of the Bell-Ringers are preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Florence. Recent excavations have brought to light more large and spectacular tombs such as the Tomb of the Silver Hands.Archaeology Magazine, The Tomb of the Silver Hands, Tuesday, July 15, 2014; http://www.archaeology.org/issues/138-1407/features/2170-etruscan-tomb- of-the-silver-hands =City Walls= Etruscan city walls The walls were built in the first half of the 4th c. BC before the wars with the Romans and are about 6.5 km in circumference. Several sections can be seen. Three impressive and strong defensive gates of the five originals are now exposed. The remains of the north gate show an imposing defensive structure. On its west external side a votive ditch was discovered which was rich in materials documenting a cult linked to fertility dating from the Hellenistic era until the end of the first century AD. Near the ditch are tombs carved into a rocky bank. Not far away you can see the facing cross-linked by a building still to be explored. The West Gate is the starting point of the Decumanus Maximus, the well- preserved east-west road of the city, paved with volcanic stone. Cryptoporticus of the Villa =Villa of the Cryptoporticus= Along the decumanus is an area occupied by a large residential complex. The first building, a large domus north of the decumanus, is preceded by a series of small rectangular rooms, perhaps workshops (tabernae), overlooking the main street. Among these open the two entrances of the Villa (or Domus) of the Cryptoporticus, so named for its unusual and impressive underground rooms (cryptoporticus literally means covered porch, partly underground and was used in Roman architecture to build terraces or a covered market). It is a large and sumptuous private residence built in the classical style of noble Roman houses (domus with atrium and peristyle). Its earliest phase was the late 2nd and early 1st century BC and underwent numerous renovations in the Augustan period. Further changes were made between the Flavian and Hadrianic periods, while in late antiquity parts of the domus were partially reused. Later the area was abandoned and used as a cemetery from the discovery of tombs in the cellar. The large main entrance leads into a vast atrium, around which are arranged various rooms, divided into bedrooms (cubicula) and living quarters (triclinia). A second entrance leads to a courtyard with a fountain in the centre, the result of the transformation of an original small lobby, probably in the late 1st century AD. This leads to the main lobby and then the rectangular peristyle surrounded by columns on all four sides. At the north- eastern corner of the peristyle are stairs giving access to the upper storey which is lost. The rich floor mosaic which dates from the first phase of the domus is still preserved; the mosaics of the two rooms that open onto the porch are dated to the Augustan age. The porch overlooks an apsidal nympheum which includes a swimming pool probably built in Imperial times. Roman Villa of the Cryptoporticus In the north-western part are thermal baths that were reduced from four to three rooms in the restructuring of the Augustan age. They are composed of a dressing room (apodyterium), a Turkish bath (laconicum) and a room for hot water bath (calidarium), covered with intact mosaic floors supported on columns of bricks to allow the circulation of hot air. Areas immediately south of the baths were a general sector for services directly connected with the decumanus by a narrow private road. The underground part of the house, the cryptoporticus, is accessed via a corridor to the east of the peristyle covered by a well preserved barrel vault. The underground environment was ventilated and lit from 18 windows that open at the level of the garden above. The function of the underground complex was especially the preservation of products such as wine and oil that needed a suitable environment. Next to the north-western side of the domus is a series of rooms built probably in the Hellenistic age. It is a complex of two or more buildings of still uncertain date and use. They are characterised by the presence of works of canalisation and different types of paving, using brickwork, tiles and local stone. Roman arch of Publius Sulpicius Mundus (c.100 BC) =Roman Arch of Publius Sulpicius Mundus= In 2003 the foundations of a triumphal arch were discovered on the Decumanus at the west side of the Roman forum. Many fragments were found which allowed reconstruction of the arch, and a long inscription was also found which dedicated it to Publius Sulpicius Mundus who was a Roman senator in around 100 BC. =The Temple= The temple has an imposing base of sides 36.5 x 24.5m. The temple had a continuous colonnade on all four sides, doubled on the front by four additional columns; it is preceded by a projection with a central staircase. The temple reveals at least two construction phases; the oldest (late 6th century BC) had numerous architectural terracottas with Ionic columns. In the early Roman Imperial age the temple was rebuilt, which involved the replacement of the wooden elements of the elevation with travertine structures and opus caementicium. Among the many elements of the elevation which have collapsed and are visible around the monument, a fragment of the architrave with inscription can be seen. =Late Roman Basilica= On the south side of the Decumanus is an apsidal rectangular building, believed to be a late Roman basilica. Originally with a gabled roof, it has a small apse and shows a combination of building techniques in the walls (especially in the east), such as opus reticulatum and opus incertum. =Ponte dell'Abbadia= Ponte dell'Abbadia As George Dennis described it: It is verily a magnificent structure, bestriding the rocky abyss like a colossus, with the Fiora fretting and foaming at a vast depth beneath. But what means this extraordinary curtain of stalactites which overhangs the bridge on this side, depending in huge jagged masses from the parapet, and looking as though a vast cataract had rolled over the top of the bridge, and been petrified in its fall, ere it could reach the ground?....The stalactites stand out six or seven feet from the wall, and depend to a depth of fifteen or twenty feet. Independently of their remarkable conformation, their colouring ‚Äî a clear yellowish white ‚Äî combines, with the grey or reddish masonry, to add to the effect of the bridge. The Ponte dell'Abbadia over the Fiora is a Roman bridge with a main arch of 20 m span and 30 m above the stream and was built upon an Etruscan bridge (the Tufo buttresses are very probably Etruscan, for they are evidently the piers of the original bridge). It carried the ancient road and the Romans, unusually, incorporated an aqueduct on it leading to Vulci about 1.5 km away. The overflow of the aqueduct after it fell into disrepair caused the \\"curtain of stalactites\\". The waters still flow from an aqueduct into the gardens of the adjoining Castello dell'Abbadia. The site also houses a mithraeum. Ancient Etruscan quay on the river Fiora Museum The Vulci museum is located in the Castello dell'Abbadia which houses an extensive collection of finds.

Weilerbach is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Weilerbach (population about 14,500).  History of the Town  = Founding until 1794 = Weilerbach was first mentioned in a document from 1214, in which King Friedrich II gave the right of patronage to his loyal Reinhard von Lautern, knight of Hoheneck, for the parish church at Ramstein with its daughter church in Weilerbach (Wilrebach) und Spesbach (Spethisbach). In 1253, Siegfried von Hoheneck gave these rights and the income therefrom to the Teutonic Order in Kaiserslautern. Pope Alexander IV confirmed in 1258 the Order's possession of Ramstein, Weilerbach, und Spesbach. In 1257, the names Steinmar and Diederich von Weilerbach appear as do the names Hertlin und Theodor von Weilerbach in 1273 as witnesses in documents of the cloister at Lautern and Enkenbach. Michael Frey: Versuch einer geographisch-historisch- statistische Beschreibung des k√∂n. bayer. Rheinkreises, Band 3, Neidhard, 1837, S. 86 ff. (Google Books) Until the end of the 18th Century, Weilerbach belonged to the Electoral Palatinate with its Oberamt in Lautern. Weilerbach was the local court for the towns of Erzenhausen, Eulenbis, P√∂rrbach, Rodenbach, Schwedelbach, and Weilerbach as well as the hamlets of Atzenhausen (today known as 'Samuelshof'), Einsiedlerhof, M√ºckenhof and Schellenberg. The court was composed of the village mayor (a 'Schulthei√ü'), four laypeople ('Sch√∂ffe') and a court reporter from Ramstein. The old roads from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and from Zweibr√ºcken to Bingen am Rhein intersected in Weilerbach, causing the establishment of a customs station under the Electoral Palatinate. In 1787, the town had 119 families and 578 inhabitants. The town's buildings included three churches, two parish houses, two school houses, and ninety-three homes. Johann Goswin Widder: Versuch einer vollst√§ndigen Geographisch-Historischen Beschreibung der Kurf√ºrstl. Pfalz am Rheine, Band 4, Frankfurt/Leipzig 1788, S. 285 (Google Books) = French and Bavarian Administration = In 1794, the troops of the French Revolution had overtaken Left Bank of the Rhine. From 1798 to 1814, Weilerbach and the surrounding region belong to the Canton of Kaiserslautern in the Mont-Tonnerre department. Under this French administration, Weilerbach was made into a Mairie, that in addition to the 751-person town of Weilerbach itself, encompassed the neighboring communities of Erfenbach (298 inhabitants), Erzenhausen (386), Rodenbach (322), Siegelbach (293), and Stockborn (63).P. A. M√ºller: Statistisches Jahrbuch f√ºr die deutschen L√§nder zwischen dem Rhein, der Mosel und der franz√∂sischen Grenze. Kupferberg, Mainz 1815, S. 147 (Google Books) Pursuant to agreements made at the Congress of Vienna and the Treaty of Munich (1816) between Bavaria and Austria, the Palatinate was transferred in 1816 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Under Bavarian administration, Weilerbach remained in the Canton of Kaiserslautern, subpart of the Landkommissariat of Kaiserslautern that in 1862 was renamed to the Bezirksamt Kaiserslautern within the Circle of the Rhine. In 1837, Weilerbach had 1286 inhabitants of whom 525 were Roman Catholic, 746 were Protestant, and 15 were Mennonite. Proposed American Military Hospital The Verbandsgemeinde Weilerbach is the site for a new American hospital intended to replace the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) on the Landstuhl Army Base, in nearby Landstuhl, Germany. The LRMC has been active since 1953; Citing the difficulty of maintaining the aging structure, officials have proposed replacing the LRMC with a new facility. Ground breaking took place in October 2014, and the planned completion date is summer 2020. =Controversy= In 2008, the Department of Defense approved $400 million to expand and renovate the existing hospital, contingent upon congressional support for the funding. In 2010, the proposal was changed to total replacement and relocation from Landstuhl to Weilerbach, with increased funding of up to $1.2 billion (USD). Both plans were met with some opposition, both within the US and in Germany. Congressional leaders and Pentagon officials have questioned the need and costs of the new hospital, in light of the reduction of forces in Germany, the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and the reduction of the military presence in Afghanistan. Some Germans who deem the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan illegal and are opposed to continued US military presence in Germany consider the significant financial commitment to medical facilities to imply an intention for long-term occupation. Concerns about deforestation at the new site, as well as potential for groundwater pollution have also been expressed. The suggested removal of the hospital from Landstuhl has led to concerns that the economy of Landstuhl will suffer. A different view is that a new hospital would be advantageous to the local economy; it would stimulate the state's building industry, with estimates of putting up to one billion dollars (USD) into the local economy over the long term. =Scope of the new facilities= The proposed new hospital would combine the medical facilities from nearby Ramstein Air Base, and the existing LRMC hospital into one co-located medical center. The LRMC provides treatment for more than 245,000 U.S. military personnel and their families within the European Command. LRMC is also the evacuation and treatment center for all injured U.S. service members and contractors as well as members of 44 coalition forces serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as Africa Command, Central Command, European Command and Pacific Command.

NASA contends the murder board was created by Hans Mark, Director of Ames Research Center from 1969 to 1977,http://history.arc.nasa.gov/hist_pdfs/bugos_nasa_sp2014_4314.pdf derived from the earlier concept of the tiger team. In highly risk-averse, technical endeavors where extreme efforts are taken to prevent mistakes (e.g. satellite operations), murder boards are used to aggressively review, without constraint or pleasantries, a situation's problem, assumptions, constraints, mitigations, and the proposed solution. The board's goal is to kill the well-prepared proposal on technical merit; holding back even the least suspicion of a problem is not tolerated. Such argumentative murder boards consist of many subject matter experts of the specific system under review and of all interfacing systems. In project management, a murder board is a process where a committee asks questions from project representatives as part of the project selection process.Ashe, Kenneth, The Project Management Murder Board, Accessed 11 January 2016. In U.S. politics, murder boards are used in preparing candidates for debates and presidential appointees for Senate confirmation hearings. On April 20, 2010 representative Mary Jo Kilroy asked former Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld if he had set up a murder board to prepare for his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee concerning the 2008 Lehman Brothers failure. Fuld expressed confusion at the expression, apparently unfamiliar with the term.

Although scholarly and reserved, he preached two sermons in 1892 in which he attacked the political corruption of New York City government. Backed by the evidence he collected, his statements led to both the exposure of Tammany Hall and to subsequent social and political reforms. Early years He was born on a farm on April 17, 1842 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Parkhurst did not attend a formal school until he was twelve. Despite this, he showed a strong interest in education and graduated from Amherst in 1866. He became principal of the high school in Amherst in 1867. He married Ellen Bodman on November 23, 1870, she being one of his former students. Parkhurst studied theology at Halle in 1869, and became a professor at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts, in 1870‚Äì1871. After further studies in Leipzig in 1872‚Äì1873, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He was pastor of a congregational church at Lenox, Massachusetts, from 1874 until 1880, when he was called to the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, New York City, where he served from 1880 to 1918. Later life Interested in municipal affairs, Parkhurst was elected president of the New York Society for the Prevention of Crime in 1891, and he challenged the methods of the city police department. He inaugurated a campaign against the political and social corruption of Tammany Hall. The hall had begun innocently as a social club, but had drifted into politics and graft. It acquired a lock on elections in the city, and its bosses protected crime and vice in Manhattan and surrounding boroughs. Grand jury investigations were ineffective, despite the appeals of social reformers. Few in Parkhurst's congregation recognized that Tammany Hall, the police, and organized crime were interconnected. On February 14, 1892, he challenged Tammany Hall from the pulpit. Pointing to the hall's political influence and their connection with the police, he noted that men fed upon the city while pretending to protect it saying, When the municipal grand jury asked him for hard evidence, Parkhurst personally hired a private detective and, with his friend John Erving, went to the streets in disguise to collect proof of the corruption. From the pulpit on March 13, 1892, he preached a sermon backed with documentation and affidavits. Parkhurst's campaign led to the appointment of the Lexow Committee to investigate conditions, and to the election of a reform mayor in 1894. Although Tammany Hall did publicly clean house, it remained influential on both the political front and in organized crime until the 1950s. Women's suffrage Parkhurst was opposed to women voting. He wrote: > \\"That quality of feminine blatancy which is being at present so extensively > advertised here and in England, that disposition toward self-exploitation > indulged in by short-haired women and encouraged by long-haired men, is of a > sort to chill and then freeze over those masculine impulses that seek > restful and satisfying companionship in a member of the opposite > sex.\\"\\"Perhaps a Fighting Woman Is Not So Very Pleasing,\\" Hearst Wire, New > York Evening Journal, March 9, 1909, image 10 Family His first wife, Ellen Bodman, died on May 28, 1921. He married Eleanor Marx on April 18, 1927, in Los Angeles. Death Parkhurst died on September 8, 1933, by sleepwalking and walking off the porch roof in his Ventnor City, New Jersey, home.

This achievement would in turn lead to Britain's celebrated World War II Ultra operation. Life Bertrand joined the French military as a private in 1914 and was wounded in 1915 at the Dardanelles. From 1926, he worked in radio intelligence. In the 1920s, French radio intelligence was decentralized. Decryption of foreign, chiefly German and Italian, ciphers and codes was the responsibility of a General Staff cryptology department, while radio monitoring was conducted by the intelligence service, Service de Renseignement or S.R. At the end of 1930, decryption was turned over to the S.R., which created a Section D (for Decryptement), of which Bertrand became chief. He later took over all of French radio intelligence.

Bertrand's intelligence associates had purchased documents pertaining to the Enigma machine from Hans-Thilo Schmidt (codenamed \\"Asch√©\\" by the French), an employee at the German Armed Forces' Cryptographic Agency. In December 1932, then-Captain (later, General) Bertrand turned these documents over to the Polish Cipher Bureau's chief, Major Gwido Langer. Asch√©'s documents, according to cryptologist Marian Rejewski's testimony, proved in practice crucial to his mathematical solution of the military Enigma machine's wiring. During his work with the Poles, Bertrand used the code name Bolek, given him by the Poles. Bertrand was to learn of the Poles' success against Enigma only six and a half years later, at a trilateral Polish-French-British conference held in the Kabaty Woods, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939, just five weeks before the outbreak of World War II.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 59. After Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939, then-Major Bertrand from October 1939 to November 1942 sponsored the continued work of prewar Cipher Bureau personnel: first at PC Bruno, outside Paris; then, after Germany's invasion of France (May‚ÄìJune 1940), at the Cadix center in southern France's Vichy \\"Free Zone.\\" Over a year after the Cadix center had been scattered to avert capture by the Germans, on 5 January 1944, Bertrand was captured by the Germans as he waited at the famous Church of Sacr√© C≈ìur, in Paris' Montmartre district, for a courier from London. The Germans suggested that he work for them. Pretending to agree, Bertrand was allowed to return with his wife Mary to Vichy to contact British intelligence. There he sent his underground comrades into hiding and went into hiding himself. On 2 June 1944, four days before the D-Day Normandy landings, at an improvised airstrip in France's Massif Central, Bertrand, his wife and a Jesuit priest who served as a courier of the Polish Resistance climbed into a small, unarmed Lysander III aircraft that flew them to the British Isles. Bertrand and his wife moved into a house in the Hertfordshire village of Boxmoor just a short walk from the Polish radio-intercept station and cipher office at the nearby village of Felden where Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski were working. Bertrand retired from the French Secret Service in 1950 and went on to become mayor of Th√©oule-sur-Mer in southern France. In 1973, the Paris publishing house Plon published his book, Enigma ou la plus grande √©nigme de la guerre 1939-1945 (Enigma, or the Greatest Enigma of the War of 1939-1945).

The term is also widely used for the different process of coating a metal with solder before soldering. It is most often used to prevent rust, but is also commonly applied to the ends of stranded wire used as electrical conductors to prevent oxidation (which increases electrical resistance), and to keep them from fraying or unraveling when used in various wire connectors like twist-ons, binding posts, or terminal blocks, where stray strands can cause a short circuit. While once more widely used, the primary use of tinplate now is the manufacture of tin cans. Formerly, tinplate was used for cheap pots, pans, and other holloware. This kind of holloware was also known as tinware and the people who made it were tinplate workers. The untinned sheets employed in the manufacture are known as black plates. They are now made of steel, either Bessemer steel or open-hearth. Formerly iron was used, and was of two grades, coke iron and charcoal iron; the latter, being the better, received a heavier coating of tin, and this circumstance is the origin of the terms coke plates and charcoal plates by which the quality of tinplate is still designated, although iron is no longer used. Tinplate was consumed in enormous quantities for the manufacture of the tin cans in which preserved meat, fish, fruit, biscuits, cigarettes, and numerous other products are packed, and also for the household utensils of various kinds made by they tinsmith. History The practice of tinning ironware to protect it against rust is an ancient one. This may have been the work of the tinner. This was done after the article was fabricated, whereas tinplate was tinned before fabrication. The manufacture of tinplate was long a monopoly of Bohemia, but in about the year 1620 the industry spread to Saxony. Tinplate was apparently produced in the 1620s at a mill of (or under the patronage of) the Earl of Southampton, but it is not clear how long this continued. Andrew Yarranton, an English engineer and agriculturist, and Ambrose Crowley (a Stourbridge blacksmith and father of the more famous Sir Ambrose Crowley III) were commissioned to go to Saxony and if possible discover the methods employed. They visited Dresden in 1667 and found out how it was made. In doing so, they were sponsored by various local ironmasters and people connected with the project to make the River Stour navigable. In Saxony, the plates were forged, but when they conducted experiments on their return to England, they tried rolling the iron. This led to two of the sponsors, the ironmasters Philip Foley and Joshua Newborough, erecting a new mill, Wolverley Lower Mill (or forge), in 1670. This contained three shops: one being a slitting mill, which would serve as a rolling mill, the others being forges. In 1678 one of these was making frying pans and the other drawing out blooms made in finery forges elsewhere. It is likely that the intention was to roll the plates and then finish them under a hammer, but the plan was frustrated by one William Chamberlaine renewing a patent granted to him and Dud Dudley in 1662. Yarranton described the patent as \\"trumped up\\". The slitter at Wolverley was Thomas Cooke. Another Thomas Cooke, perhaps his son, moved to Pontypool and worked there for John Hanbury (1664‚Äì1734). According to Edward Lhuyd, by 1697, John Hanbury had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making \\"Pontypoole Plates\\" machine.H. R. Schubert, History of the British iron and steel industry ... to 1775, 429. This has been claimed as a tinplate works, but it was almost certainly only producing (untinned) blackplate. However, this method of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders, enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the old plan of hammering, and in consequence the English tinplate became recognized as superior to the German. Treforest tin works, Glamorganshire Tinplate first begins to appear in the Gloucester Port Books (which record trade passing through Gloucester, mostly from ports in the Bristol Channel in 1725. The tinplate was shipped from Newport, Monmouthshire.Data extracted from D. P. Hussey et al., Gloucester Port Books Database (CD-ROM, University of Wolverhampton 1995). This immediately follows the first appearance (in French of R√©aumur's Principes de l'art de fer-blanc, and prior to a report of it being published in England. Further mills followed a few years later, initially in many ironmaking regions in England and Wales, but later mainly in south Wales. In 1805, 80,000 boxes were made and 50,000 exported. The industry continued to spread steadily in England and especially Wales, and after 1834 its expansion was rapid, Great Britain becoming the chief source of the world's supply. In that year her total production was 180,000 boxes of 108 lb each (around 50 kg, in America a box is 100 lb), in 1848 it was 420,000 boxes, in 1860 it reached 1,700,000 boxes. But subsequently the advance was rapid, and the production reached about 2,236,000 lb in 1891. One of the greatest markets was the United States of America, but that market was cut off in 1891, when the McKinley tariff was enacted there. This caused a great retrenchment in the British industry and the emigration to America of many of those who could no longer be employed in the surviving tinplate works. In 1891, the United States made 11,000 tons of tinplate and imported 325,100 tons, but in 1899, it made 360,900 tons, importing only 63,500 tons (mostly for re-export). British exports were further hindered by the Dingley tariff, which removed the advantage of Welsh plate on America's Pacific coast, had by 1900 increased to more than 849,000,000 lb, of which over 141,000,000 lb were terne-plates. The total imports in that year were only 135,264,881 lb. In later years, again, there was a decline in the American production, and in 1907 only 20% of the American tinplate mills were at work, while the British production reached 14 million boxes. Despite this blow, the industry continued, but on a smaller scale. Nevertheless, there were still 518 mills in operation in 1937, including 224 belonging to Richard Thomas & Co. However the traditional 'pack mill' had been overtaken by the improved 'strip mill', of which the first in Great Britain was built by Richard Thomas & Co. in the late 1930s. Strip mills rendered the old pack mills obsolete and the last of them closed in about the 1960s. Plate production methods =The pack mill process= The pack mill process begins with a tin bar, which is a drawn flat bar that was usually purchased from an ironworks or steel works. The tin bar could be wrought iron or mild steel. The cross-section of the bar needed to be accurate in size as this dictates the length and thickness of the final plates. The bar was cut to the correct length to make the desired size plate. For instance, if a plate is desired the tin bar is cut to a length and width that is divisible by 14 and 20. The bar is then rolled and doubled over, with the number of times being doubled over dependent on how large the tin bar is and what the final thickness is. If the starting tin bar is then it must be at least finished on the fours, or doubled over twice, and if a thin gauge is required then it may be finished on the eights, or doubled over three times. The tin bar is then heated to a dull red heat and passed five or six times through the roughing rolls. Between each pass the plate is passed over (or round) the rolls, and the gap between the rolls is narrowed by means of a screw. The plate is then reheated and run through the finishing rolls.. If the plate is not finished on singles, or without doubling the plate over, it is doubled over in a squeezer. The squeezer was like a table where one half of the surface folds over on top of the other and a press flattens the doubled over plate so the rolled end will fit in the rollers. It is then reheated for another set of rolling. This is repeated until the desired geometry is reached. Note that if the plate needs to be doubled over more than once the rolled end is sheared off. The pack is then allowed to cool. When cool, the pack is sheared slightly undersized from the final dimensions and the plates separated by openers.. At this point, the plates are covered in scale and must be pickled. This involves dipping the plates in sulfuric acid for five minutes. The pickling turns the scales into a greenish-black slime which is removed via annealing. The plates are annealed for approximately 10 hours and then allowed to slowly cool. At this point the plates are known as pickled and annealed black plates. These plates were commonly sold for stamping and enameling purposes.. After this, the plates are rough and not straight, so they are cold rolled several times. The rolling lengthens the plates to their final dimension. They are then annealed again to remove any strain hardening. These plates are called black plate pickled, cold rolled, and close annealed (black plate p. cr. and ca.). To attain perfect cleanliness the plates are pickled again in a weak sulfuric acid. Finally they are rinsed and stored in water until ready to be tinned.. The tinning set consists of at least one pot of molten tin, with a zinc chloride flux on top, and a grease pot. The flux dries the plate and prepares it for the tin to adhere. If a second tin pot is used, called the wash pot, it contains tin at a lower temperature. This is followed by the grease pot, which contains oil and a tinning machine. The tinning machine has two small rollers that are spring-loaded together so that when the tinned plate is inserted the rolls squeeze off any excess tin. The springs on the tinning machine can be set to different forces to give different thicknesses of tin. Finally, the oil is cleaned off with fine bran and dusted clean.. What is described here is the process as employed during the 20th century. The process grew somewhat in complexity over time, as it was found that the inclusion of additional procedures improved quality. The practice of hot rolling and then cold rolling evidently goes back to the early days, as the Knight family's tinplate works had (from its foundation in about 1740) two rolling mills, one at Bringewood (west of Ludlow) which made blackplate, and the other the tin mill at Mitton (now part of Stourport, evidently for the later stages.L. Ince, The Knight family and the British Iron Industry (1991). The strip mill Early hot rolling strip mills did not produce strip suitable for tinning, but in 1929 cold rolling began to be used to reduce the gauge further, which made tinning achievable. The plate was then tinned using the process outlined above. Tinning processes There are two processes for the tinning of the black plates: hot-dipping and electroplating. =Hot-dipping= Tinplate made via hot-dipped tin plating is made by cold rolling steel or iron, pickling to remove any scale, annealing to remove any strain hardening, and then coating it with a thin layer of tin. Originally this was done by producing individual or small packs of plates, which became known as the pack mill process. In the late 1920s strip mills began to replace pack mills, because they could produce the raw plates in larger quantities and more economically. =Electroplating= In electroplating, the item to be coated is placed into a container containing a solution of one or more tin salts. The item is connected to an electrical circuit, forming the cathode (negative) of the circuit while an electrode typically of the same metal to be plated forms the anode (positive). When an electric current is passed through the circuit, metal ions in the solution are attracted to the item. To produce a smooth, shiny surface, the electroplated sheet is then briefly heated above the melting point of tin. Most of the tin-plated steel made today is then further electroplated with a very thin layer of chromium to prevent dulling of the surface from oxidation of the tin. Alternatives *Terne-plate is a similar product to tinplate, but the bath is not of tin, but of tin and lead mixed, the latter metal constituting from 7.59% of the whole. The name derives from 'terne' - meaning dull or tarnish. Terne-plates began to be produced in England about the middle of the 19th century, and are widely employed in the United States for roofing purposes. Other applications included fuel tanks and gas meters. The last Terne-plate mill in Brockmoor, West Midlands in the UK was closed in 2006. *For many purposes, tinplate has been replaced by galvanised (zinc-coated) vessels, though not for cooking as zinc is toxic, where stainless steel is often used. Zinc protects iron electrolytically, that is, the zinc will oxidise and turn to a white powder to preserve the iron, whereas tin will only protect the iron if the tin-surface remains unbroken, as it electrolytically cannibalises unprotected iron to preserve itself. See also *Blackplate *Plating for other processes for plating metals *Sherardizing *Tinsmith *Tinware Kalai - the art of coating vessels with tin in India =Introduction= The art of Kalai (Kalhai or Qalai) is the process of coating the alloy surface i.e. Copper or Brass by deposition of metal tin on it. The word \\"Kalai\\" is derived from the Arabic language which means \\"white wash or tin\\". A cultural Sanksirt work by Keladi Basava called \\"Sivatattva Ratnakara\\" (1699) mentions \\"Kalaya-lepa\\" in the chapter of cookery or \\"Supashashtra\\" which means applying Kalai on utensils. People practicing the art of Kalai are called Kalaiwala or Kalaigar. Basically, Kalaigars or Kalaiwalas are community craftsmen. The art of Kalai =History= Vessels with Kalai, both on its interior and exterior have been found in the excavations of Bramhapuri at Kolhapur, Maharashtra which adds to the archeological evidence of Kalai Art. From this evidence, P K. Gode, who studied tin coating on metallic vessels in India, stated that the history of tin coating dates back to 1300 C.E. The history of Kalai is also recorded in \\"Parsibhashanushasana\\" of Vikaramasimha (before Samvat 1600 i.e. C.E. 1544) and also in the famous Ain- I -Akbari (C.E. 1590) by Abul Fazal. The art of Kalai was first practiced by the Muslims and is current even today. =Spiritual approach to Kalai= The copper vessels with Kalai were used to store water and cook food earlier because of a spiritual belief that copper attracts and transmits a divine consciousness also called \\"Chaitanya\\". The spiritual approach to the use of copper vessels to store water is that Copper and Tin have Sattva-Raja (the basic component of creation/universe) component that is transferred to water. =Scientific approach to Kalai= Kalai is required to be done on the vessels after approximately every two months of the doing the same. Earlier, copper and brass vessels were used because of their high conductivity. High conductivity of copper vessels reduces the fuel cost. Tin also conducts heat almost as quickly as copper, so there's no question of copper losing its conductivity because of the Kalai. The vessels had to be tin-coated frequently to maintain the taste of the food as after sometime the food tastes bitter and it led to even food poisoning. The copper, in traces gets dissolved in water when the water is stored in a copper vessel for a long period of time. This scientific process is called \\"Oligodynamic effect\\". Copper reacts with certain foods and can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms. By doing Kalai, the deposition of tin layer works as a safe substance between the copper and the food. Tin will melt if the temperature is above 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218.333 degrees Celsius). Tin from the copper vessel wears away with time so usage of metal utensils, so wooden or silicone spatulas should be used. Cooking of acidic foods should be avoided. A chemical reaction between copper and oxygen called Oxidization turn the copper vessels black. If Kalai is not done on the copper vessels, copper will react with the air's moisture and create copper carbonate, which is green in color. This can make a person severely ill. =The process of Kalai= The steps of Kalai are as follows: *First step is to clean the utensil with water. There are two ways of cleaning the utensil further to remove any impurities such as dust. The first is to clean it with caustic soda. The other is to wash it with dilute acid solution which contains gold purifying compound known as 'Sufa'. If the latter is used, the utensil should be cleaned immediately after applying the dilute acidic solution as it may bear a mark if not done immediately. *After the cleaning, the vessel is heated on burning coal for about 2 to 3 minutes. The Kalaiwala, Kalaigar, or Kalaikar then digs a small pit in the ground to burn the coal. He/she prepares a temporary blast furnace to do Kalai and blows air through bellows. *After the vessel turns pinkish hot, virgin grade tin (called 'Ranga' in Hindi) in the form of strips is applied on the hot vessel. This step is called 'casting' by the Kalaigars. *Ammonium chloride powder (also called 'sal ammoniac' in mineral form, or 'Nausadar' in Hindi) is sprinkled on the vessel as a flux. The tin melts rapidly which is then rubbed evenly on the utensil with the help of a cotton cloth or a swab of cotton. The rubbing process is known as 'Majaay' in Hindi. A whitish smoke with the peculiar smell of ammonia is released when the 'Nausadar' powder is rubbed on the utensil. A silvery lining appears on the vessel with a shine. *The final step of Kalai is to dip the utensil in cold water. =Present scenario= Kalai was earlier done with silver instead of tin but now it would be expensive for the Kalaigars to use silver. As the stainless steel and aluminum ware came into being, the usage of copper and brass utensils reduced which led the Kalaigars to suffer losses. Now-a-days only some hotels and a very few people use vessels with Kalai done on it. As a result, there are a very few Kalaigars left. The art of Kalai is vanishing.

Description Alpine lady's-mantle is a perennial plant with a woody rhizome growing to a height of between . The weak stems are silkily hairy and grow from a basal rosette and the leaves are palmate with about seven lanceolate leaflets with toothed tips, smooth above and densely hairy underneath. There are alternate pairs of leaves on the stems and the inflorescence forms a dense cyme. The flowers are lime green with four sepals, no petals, four stamens and a solitary carpel. They are hermaphrodite and the seeds develop apomictically without being fertilised. The flowers begin to bloom in June and fade in September and their seeds can be collected from August to October. Because the seeds develop without cross fertilisation, any mutations that may occur gradually cause cumulative changes to populations and there are a great many very similar species of lady's-mantle, sometimes called micro-species. Alpine lady's-mantle is easily distinguished from other lady's-mantles by the fact that its leaves have clearly separate leaflets while other species have neatly pleated leaves. Distribution and habitat Alpine lady's-mantle grows in northern Europe and in mountainous regions further south such as the Alps and the Pyrenees. It also grows in southern Greenland. Its natural habitat is moorland, alpine meadows, cliffs, stream banks and areas covered in drifts of snow during the winter.

History =State monopoly= It was established in July 1982 by the UK government to provide type approval services to the telecommunications terminal industry. At that point in history, British Telecom was a state monopoly, and even by 1982 BT only allowed (via approval) the four British manufacturers (STC, GEC, Plessey, and Thorn-Ericsson) to supply its twenty five types of phone through them, and not independently. However around 200,000 unapproved, independently bought phones were being used on the network. Loyalty to BT was of importance (commercially sensitive) to STC, Plessey and GEC as equipment for BT's exchanges was made exclusively by them. In the same year, BT was becoming more commercially minded, opening up around one hundred new BT Phone Shops having become separated from the GPO through the British Telecommunications Act 1981 which also created the BABT. In 1982 there was a step-change in types of BT phones entering the market, and technology used for connecting phones, and the BABT was needed with a greater variety of phones than was previously available: BT was about to lose its monopoly on supplying phones. =Mechanism of approval= alt=BABT ‚ÄúGreen Dot‚Äù label From July 1982, manufacturers could submit phones to be approved by BABT for a cost of ¬£1,700, and if approved would carry the green circular label (right). The main four British suppliers of telephones were very wary about supplying to non-BT independent retailers. At the same time BT was introducing its so-called IXT phones (IneXpensive Telephone), designed for the new plug-and-socket connections - another innovation. Philips TMC (formerly the Telephone Manufacturing Company) also made the new (more electronic) IXT phones.Philips TMCHistory of TMC The British telephone sockets were introduced on 19 November 1981. On 19 July 1982, the government announced its desire to privatise BT, which happened in late 1984. By 1982, 15 million British homes had a phone, with 5 out of 6 only having one phone. Adding an extra phone without the new sockets was heavy work. In the 1980s, it shared offices with the BEAB in Hersham, Surrey. The Telecommunications Act 1984 detailed standards for modems, which had to conform to BABT standards.

This was at that time an unusual choice because the majority of Japanese aircraft at that time used air-cooled radial engines. Design and history The Ki-60 was designed by Takeo Doi and his deputy Shin Owada of in response to a 1939 Imperial Japanese Army Aviation Bureau requirement for a heavily armed specialised interceptor fighter to be powered by the liquid-cooled Daimler-Benz DB 601 inverted V12 engine, which had been selected for license production by Kawasaki as the Ha-40. The emphasis in the requirements was for a high speed and a good rate of climb, along with a cannon armament. This was a complete change from the usual IJAAF penchant for lightly armed, highly manoeuvrable fighters with lightweight structures, epitomised by the Nakajima Ki-27 and the later Nakajima Ki-43. A requirement was issued at the same time for a lighter, less heavily armed, general-purpose fighter which was to be designed almost in parallel with the Ki-60; this became the Ki-61. Priority was to be given to the Ki-60, design of which started in February 1940. The first prototype of the Ki-60 emerged in March 1941 as a compact, all metal, stressed skin monoplane with a relatively deep fuselage () and tapered wings with rounded tips built around a system of three spars; a Warren truss main spar and two auxiliary spars. The rear spar carried the split flaps and long, narrow chord ailerons, while the front spar incorporated the undercarriage pivot points. The undercarriage track was . The pilot's seat was mounted high over the rear spar, giving the fuselage a distinctive \\"humped\\" profile; the hood featured a framed, rear sliding canopy and an elongated rear transparent section. The main coolant radiator was housed in a long ventral bath under the wing centre-section and central fuselage, while the oil cooler was mounted under the engine with a long air intake. The prototype was powered by an imported DB 601A as production of the Ha-40 had not yet started. A total fuel capacity of 410 l (90.2 Imp gallons) was carried. The armament carried was two synchronized, fuselage mounted 12.7 mm caliber Ho-103 machine guns which were set in a \\"staggered\\" configuration (the port weapon slightly further forward than that to starboard) in a bay just above and behind the engine. One German made Mauser MG 151/20 20 mm cannon was housed in a weapons bay in each wing. With a normal loaded weight of and a gross wing area of the wing loading was 181.76 kg/m2 (37.23 lb/ft2), which was extremely high by Japanese standards (the standard IJAAF fighter, the Ki-27, had a wing loading of 70 kg/m2 (14.33 lb/ft2)). From the start of flight testing it became apparent that the design was seriously flawed in several key areas. The take-off run was unacceptably long, while in flight the aircraft displayed some lateral instability, excessively heavy controls and poor control response. The spinning characteristics were described as \\"dangerous\\" and the stalling speed was extremely high. Although a top speed of had been projected the Ki-60 was only able to achieve . As a result, the second and third prototypes, which were still being built, were hurriedly modified in an attempt to mitigate some of the more undesirable traits. Approximately were removed, primarily by replacing the MG 151 cannon with Ho-103 machine guns. This reduced the normal loaded weight to . Coupled with a slight increase in wing area to , this resulted in a slightly lower wing loading of 169.7 kg/m2 (34.76 lb/ft2). Detail changes were made to airframe sealing and to the contours of the air intakes and radiator bath. Flight tests were still disappointing, with both of the modified prototypes displaying most of the shortcomings of the first. A top speed of only was reached, with a climb rate still well below specifications. By this time the Nakajima Ki-44, which had also been designed as a dedicated interceptor, was beginning to show some promise and the Koku Hombu selected this in fulfilment of its requirements. From early 1941 the full attention of Takeo Doi and Shin Owada was focused on the Ki-61; the Ki-60 became important in that the Ki-61 design was able to be improved using the lessons learned from the poor characteristics of the Ki-60. Plans for production were cancelled in late 1941 after three airplanes had been built.Berliner 2011, p. 141.

It was named for Al L√≥pez, the first Tampa native to play Major League Baseball (MLB), manage an MLB team, and be enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Al L√≥pez Field was built in 1954 and hosted its first spring training in , when the Chicago White Sox moved their training site to Tampa from California. Al L√≥pez became the White Sox's manager in 1957, and for the next three springs, he was the home manager in a ballpark named after himself. The Cincinnati Reds replaced the White Sox as Al L√≥pez Field's primary tenant in and would return every spring for almost 30 years. The Tampa Tarpons, the Reds' Class-A minor league affiliate in the Florida State League, played at the ballpark every summer from 1961-1987, and many members of the Reds' Big Red Machine teams of the 1970s played there early in their professional baseball careers. The Tampa Bay area sought a major league expansion franchise beginning in the 1980s, and the Al L√≥pez Field site was widely regarded as the best location for a new major league ballpark if Tampa gained a team. With the city of Tampa unwilling to agree to a new long-term lease, the Reds moved their spring training home to a new facility in nearby Plant City, Florida in . The Tarpons moved to Sarasota, Florida a year later, leaving Al L√≥pez Field without a tenant. The facility was razed in 1989 and Raymond James Stadium was built at its former location in 1998. Pre-history and design Al L√≥pez Field shortly before its demolition in 1989 Tampa was one of the first spring training locations in Florida. Beginning with the Chicago Cubs in , a series of major league teams trained at Plant Field, a multipurpose facility near downtown Tampa. Plant Field was also the home ballpark of the minor league Tampa Smokers, who were a charter member of the Florida State League. While the Cincinnati Reds were still training at Plant Field into the 1950s, the facility was old (it was built in 1898) and had to be shared among many different teams and events. City leaders decided that a new baseball-only facility would insure that Tampa would continue to be an attractive spring training location. In 1949, the city of Tampa bought of open land near West Tampa from the federal government. The large, grassy parcel had once been the perimeter of Drew Field, a World War II-era airfield which was the precursor to Tampa International Airport, and was purchased with the idea of building a large community sports complex.\\"Big Deeds Need Big Plans\\" St. Pete Times, June 9, 1949 The construction of Al L√≥pez Field in 1954 was the first phase of this project. It was located east of Dale Mabry Highway (US Highway 92) and north of Tampa Bay Boulevard, near the center of the land parcel purchased in 1949. Tampa Stadium, a much larger football stadium, was constructed beyond the baseball park's left field wall in 1967. Much like the original Tampa Stadium, the design of Al L√≥pez Field was functional and minimalist. The grandstand was primarily constructed from concrete and featured a high, curved aluminum overhang with no obstructing columns, a design similar to that of Miami Stadium. Sporting history Construction on Al L√≥pez Field was not quite complete on October 6, 1954, when it was officially dedicated as part of \\"Al L√≥pez Day\\" in Tampa. It was, however, ready for spring training in March , when the Chicago White Sox opened camp at the new stadium. After the White Sox went north for the beginning of the regular season, their new Florida State League Class-A team, the Tampa Tarpons, took the field. Al L√≥pez became the White Sox manager in , putting him in the unusual position of managing in his hometown in a stadium that bore his name. During one ballgame, Lopez got into an argument with umpire John Stevens and was ejected. As Lopez said later, \\"The umpire threw me out of my own ballpark!\\" The White Sox moved their spring training home to Payne Park in Sarasota, Florida in , and the Cincinnati Reds (who had continued to train at Plant Field) moved their spring operations across town to become Al L√≥pez Field's new tenants. The Reds would become the major league club most associated with the ballpark, as they used the stadium and the adjacent training facilities (nicknamed \\"Redsland\\") as their spring home for almost 30 years. As part of the agreement, the Tampa Tarpons became the Reds' Florida State League affiliate in 1960 and would remain in their minor league system until 1987. Consequently, several members of Cincinnati's championship- winning \\"Big Red Machine\\" of the 1970s, including Pete Rose. Johnny Bench, and Dave Concepci√≥n, played some of their first professional baseball in Tampa with the Tarpons and later returned for spring training with the big league club. The Reds hosted the New York Yankees at the park on March 17, 1978. In honor of Saint Patrick's Day, Reds general manager Dick Wagner had green versions of the Reds' uniforms made. This was the first time a major league team wore green trimmed uniforms on March 17, a practice adopted in subsequent years by multiple major league teams on St. Patrick's Day. Besides professional baseball, Al L√≥pez Field regularly hosted amateur and semi-pro baseball games, including many Florida high school baseball championships, and occasionally hosted boxing and wrestling matches. Other events Al L√≥pez Field was the site of several large civic events, particularly before Curtis Hixon Hall was built downtown in 1965. During a visit to Tampa in November 1963, President John F. Kennedy delivered his last major speech to an overflow crowd of 10,000 people at the ballpark only days before being assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Closing and aftermath Entrance to Al L√≥pez Park By the 1980s, the Tampa Bay area was widely discussed as a possible home for either a major league expansion team or a relocated existing team, and the site of Al L√≥pez Field was considered a prime location for a new major league ballpark if Tampa received a team. With the uncertainty about the future of the site, the Tampa Sports Authority would only offer the Reds a series of short-term leases for the continued use of the ballpark and the adjacent training facilities. The team responded by building a new facility in nearby Plant City, Florida. The season was the last in which the Cincinnati Reds held spring training in Tampa and the Tampa Tarpons were a Reds minor league affiliate. The Tampa Tarpons reached an affiliation agreement with the Chicago White Sox for the season. However, various local groups continued to pursue a major league team and announced various plans for large stadiums at the Al L√≥pez Field site, leading the Tarpons' local owners to sell the minor league team to the White Sox in November 1988. The Tarpons moved to Sarasota in 1989 and were rechristened the Sarasota White Sox, leaving Tampa without professional baseball for the first time in over 70 years. With no tenants and with a sense that the city would have to move quickly to build a major league stadium, the Tampa Sports Authority decided to demolish AL Lopez Field in early 1989. Al L√≥pez himself had retired to Tampa and lived only a few miles from the ballpark that bore his name. In a 1992 interview, Lopez said that the razing of the stadium \\"wasn't very disappointing. I saw a diagram of the new stadium, and I didn't feel bad because I thought they were going to build a bigger one and a better one. After that, something happened, and they never built the ballpark. Then it was a disappointment.\\" Horizon Park, a public park just north of Tampa Stadium, was renamed Al L√≥pez Park in his honor in 1992. While Tampa waited to build a new ballpark until it was guaranteed a major league team, St. Petersburg went ahead with construction on the domed stadium that is now known as Tropicana Field. It was completed in 1990, and St. Pete was awarded the expansion Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays in . Meanwhile, Tampa resumed its long affiliation with professional baseball in 1994, when the New York Yankees agreed to move their spring training home and Florida State League affiliate (the Tampa Yankees) to Tampa if the city built a new ballpark for their use. The city built George M. Steinbrenner Field (originally known as Legends Field) across Dale Mabry Highway from Tampa Stadium, about a quarter mile northwest of the former site of Al L√≥pez Field. The city of Tampa also upgraded the nearby training facilities formerly known as Redsland for use by the Yankees. The former site of Al L√≥pez Field was a parking area for Tampa Stadium until 1998, when Raymond James Stadium was built on its footprint.

The Wells lifeboat was an open boat propelled by a combination of oars and sail, based at the old lifeboat house on the quay at the head of Wells Harbour. Because of the strong tides in the mile long channel that connects the quay with the harbour mouth, it was common for the lifeboat to use the services of a steam tug to be towed to sea. On 29 October 1880, gales were lashing the north coast of Norfolk. The Ocean Queen, of 171 tons and built in Sunderland in 1838, was on passage from Southampton to Seaham when she was caught in the storm and sought shelter at Wells. At 1:00pm, the Wells lifeboat launched to the aid of another brig, the Sharon Rose, which had run ashore on the beach at nearby Holkham. Seven sailors were rescued from the vessel and the lifeboat returned safely to Wells. However, on arrival back to the quay, the Ocean Queen was seen close to the harbour entrance, flying a distress flag. The former lifeboat station (1869) which is now used as the Harbour Masters Office and a Maritime Museum After changing 8 of her 13 crew, the Eliza Adams was again towed to sea. By this stage the Ocean Queen had been driven ashore on the nearby sands. The lifeboat reached the brig, but was unable to help and so set sail to return to port. In so doing, a heavy wave broke over the lifeboat and it capsized. Eleven of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without a father. One crew member, William Bell, managed to stay with the boat until it righted itself. Another, Thomas Kew, was washed ashore alive. A memorial to the members of the Wells lifeboat crew who lost their lives stands adjacent to the old lifeboat house. The Grade II listed building is used jointly as the Harbour Masters Office and a Maritime Museum. The crew of the Ocean Queen remained aboard their vessel, and were able to walk ashore once the storm had abated and the tide receded. Since 1895, the current Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station, housing both an all- weather lifeboat and an inshore rescue boat is located at the harbour entrance.

According to the story, each time the heavily sealed marble vault had been opened for the burial of a family member including 1808, twice in 1812 and in 1816 and 1819, all of the lead coffins had changed position. The facts of the story are unverified, and skeptics call the tale \\"historically dubious\\". and a masonic hoax The story The first published version of the story appeared in 1833 in (General) James Edward Alexander's Transatlantic Sketches. According to Alexander, a Mrs. Goddard was buried in the vault in 1807, followed in 1808 by 2-year-old Ann Maria Chase, and in 1812 by her older sister Dorcas Chase, aged 12. When the vault was opened again in late 1812 for the burial of their father Thomas Chase, the caskets of the Chase girls were said to be found \\"in a confused state, having been apparently tossed from their places.\\" Alexander wrote that when the vault was later opened \\"to receive the body of another infant, the four coffins, all of lead, all very heavy, were much disturbed\\" and that similar disturbances were found when opening the vault for burials in 1816 and 1819: Different versions of the story appeared over the years, with other accounts published in 1844 and 1860. The origins According to author Jerome Clark, the story of the Chase Vault appears to originate from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave \\"conflicting accounts\\" of the tale, each containing variations. Clark says the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 Transatlantic Sketches, and further repeated the same year in the \\"Anecdote Gallery\\" section of Reuben Percy's The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Clark says that most stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault referred back to sources that could be traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that Scottish folklorist Andrew Lang identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in Folk-Lore Journal.A Lang \\"Death's Deeds A bi-located Story\\" Folk Lore December 1907 pp. 376‚Äì90 After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary newspapers on Barbados, aside from an \\"unpublished firsthand account\\" by a Nathan Lucas, who claimed to be present at the opening of the vault in April 1820. The Governor, ordered the bodies be re-interred in separate burial plots, with the vault now sealed and empty. Masonic allegory Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell said that stories about the Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them \\"historically dubious.\\"Nickell, Joe; 1982. \\"Barbados' restless coffins laid to rest.\\" Fate, Part I, 35.4 (April): 50‚Äì56; Part II, 35.5 (May): 79‚Äì86 Nickell, who had investigated an earlier alleged Masonic hoax involving a tale of buried treasure at Oak Island, contended that the Barbados story was fashioned around the Masonic allegory of a \\"secret vault\\" which, according to a Masonic text, \\"was ... in the ancient mysteries, symbolic of death, where alone Divine Truth is to be found.\\" Nickell wrote that two of the men named in the Chase Vault story were members of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and that a similar tale of \\"restless coffins\\" was circulated in 1943 that specifically included a party of Freemasons and a vault containing the founder of Freemasonry in Barbados. Nickell noted that Chase Vault stories were loaded with symbols and phrases which Freemasons would have recognized. Notes * Gould, Rupert T. Oddities. New York: Paperback Library, 1969.

History Grady T. Allred, Sr., a founder of K&W; Cafeterias, entered the restaurant business on Thanksgiving Day 1935 as an employee of a small restaurant on Cherry Street in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Carolinian Coffee Shop was owned by brothers Thomas, Kenneth and William Wilson and their brother-in-law T.K. Knight. In 1937, the initials K&W; (for Knight and Wilson) were adopted and K&W; Restaurant was established. Allred later acquired a one- third interest in the K&W; Restaurant. After operating the restaurant with his partners for a few years, Allred purchased their interests and became the sole owner of K&W; Restaurant around the year 1941. The K&W; Restaurant continued to flourish at the Winston-Salem Cherry Street location until fire damage forced it to close for several months. After repairs and restoration were completed, it reopened as a restaurant/cafeteria combination. The cafeteria concept of the operation became so popular and successful that Allred decided to convert the unit entirely to cafeteria style food service. K&W; occupied its original location in Winston-Salem until an urban renewal project forced a move to 720 Coliseum Drive in Winston-Salem. On January 18, 1988, the K&W; located at 380 Knollwood Street in Winston-Salem exploded due to a natural gas leak. The restaurant was destroyed and the attached Sheraton hotel was severely damaged. The blast occurred while the restaurant was closed. Of the four persons in the lobby/cafeteria building at the time of the explosion, three sustained minor injuries. A fourth person sustained a fractured ankle.Report on 1988 Knollwood location explosion Both the restaurant and the hotel were damaged beyond repair and were subsequently demolished. In 1991, K&W; began offering takeout service through the To Go Shop. In 2009, K&W; Catering began, for events such as weddings and corporate meetings. While other cafeteria chains went bankrupt during the 1980s and 1990s, K&W; continued to prosper. From the original restaurant establishment, which seated 110 people, K&W; now operates 29 cafeterias and has over 2500 employees throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. On September 6, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic effects on restaurants, K&W; announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Grady Allred, Sr. died in 1983.

He was considered a pioneer of a contemporary approach to the field that began in the 1950s. Beginning in 1952, he embarked on a mission to combine the visual ideas found in fine art with the responsibility of journalist. At the time, many practitioners of illustration were expected to paint and draw for advertising and magazine assignments with artwork that was conservative, idealized and saccharine, while other illustrators such as Ronald Searle, Arthur Szyk, George Grosz, Kathe Kollwitz and later Ralph Steadman and Tomi Ungerer injected their own opinion into the matter. Weaver joined this latter tradition by moving his role of an illustrator from a page decorator to a journalist. He ventured from the typical haven of an illustrator's studio into the world and used a pencil to observe, record facts, and draw real life based visual essays, the way that illustrators such as Burt Silverman and Franklin McMahon did. This approach would later be termed \\"visual journalism\\" and in 1983 would form the basis of a special master's degree, Illustration as Visual Essay, from the School of Visual Arts in New York.Smith, Roberta. \\"Robert Weaver, 70, Painterly Illustrator And Noted Teacher\\", The New York Times, September 9, 1994. Accessed November 27, 2007. \\"He was influential both as an artist and as a teacher at the School of Visual Arts, where he worked for more than 35 years.\\" In an article for the AIGA in 1990, graphic art historian Steve Heller categorized Weaver as a journalistic illustrator. Other artists included Bob Gill, Jack Beck, Robert Andrew Parker, Thomas B. Allen and Philip Hays. They received crucial assignments from a group of visionary art directors that included Cipe Pineles, Leo Lionni, Otto Storch and Henry Wolf. For five decades, Weaver created work for clients such as Esquire, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Life, Look, The New York Times and Columbia Records. These patrons allowed him to cover stories with the same mission afforded a photojournalist, such as the time he covered John F. Kennedy's campaign. Weaver's style was considered by the Art Directors Club to be \\"timeless\\". A combination of pencil and acrylic paint, his illustrations were typically realistic, but with expressive use of color and framing. He was also noted for his ability to tell stories through a sequence of related pictures and was evidence of his desire to push his profession to new realms. Known for bringing the narrative qualities of cinematic storytelling to his profession, Weaver once said, \\"Life is not a single snapshot, it is a series of events that are chain linked and proceed frame by frame.\\" References Sources *A Master of Change by Steven Heller, 1990, AIGA article on Paul Davis *Exhibition essay, Seeing Is Not Believing: Norman Rockwell Museum External links *Art Directors Club biography and portrait * http://www.graphicwitness.org/ineye/weaver.htm *Robert Weaver Collection, Modern Graphic History Library Quotes: \\"To fiction illustration the illustrator should bring the accuracy of journalism, to journalism the drama of fiction, and to editorial illustration the contradictions of reality.\\" Robert Weaver, 1979 1924 births 1994 deaths American illustrators School of Visual Arts faculty ","title":"Robert Weaver (illustrator)"},{"id":"2960658","text":"Cobblestone Runway is the sixth studio album from Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith.

Bygdedans are the oldest and most distinctive among Norwegian folk dances.Bygdedans (University of Oslo) The music accompanying bygdedans is normally seen as the oldest living musical traditions in the country. These traditions have mainly survived in the more isolated farming communities of the country. In the urban areas and along the coastline where the interaction with other cultural expressions was more intense, these dances have been left behind in favour of new popular dances such as the gammeldans which became popular with the arrival of new instruments like the accordion. The basic form of the bygdedans is the ' (walking dance in 2/4 or 3/8) and the ' (running dance in even rhythm or 3/4) distinguished from each other mainly by tempo and intensity of the music and the dance. Both dances were characterised by a sequence of three parts: the figuring part; the free dancing part (') and the closed hold part ('). Through time much regional variation has developed and most dances today have a clear 3/4 pulse, which character varies considerably regionally. For instance in Telemark the pulse is best characterised as longer ‚Äì long ‚Äì short, whereas in Valdres it is short ‚Äì longer ‚Äì long. The ' today is only a living tradition in Telemark and Setesdal. In the western part of Norway the ' and its traditional tunes have been taken over by ' or ', a dance with a more modern waltzing style. The more athletic Halling or Lausdans can also be seen as an heir of ' but is mostly danced by men. The areas of bygdedans correlate mainly with the regions where the hardanger fiddle is used as the main folk music instrument. In the parts of Norway where the violin is more common, the traditional dances like pols and ', have taken up more modern traits associated with the gammaldans.

The meadow is located on the Skyline Drive at Milepost 51 and contains the park's Harry F. Byrd Visitor Center, a lodge, camp store, and camping area. Several hiking trails can be accessed from Big Meadows, including the Mill Prong Trail which leads to Rapidan Camp on the Rapidan River, the fishing retreat of President Herbert Hoover from 1929‚Äì1933, which is now restored to its 1930s configuration. President Roosevelt used Big Meadows in 1935 as the site for dedicating Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive. In 1962, during the Ash Wednesday Storm, Big Meadows recorded Virginia's greatest 24-hour snowfall with 33 inches, and the total storm snowfall was 42 inches at Big Meadows. In the Blizzard of 1996, Big Meadows recorded Virginia's greatest storm snowfall accumulation at 47 inches. Big Meadows Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Activities Big Meadows has a dining hall, gift shop, horse trails, and a series of lodges for guests to stay in. Each lodge guestroom has a stone fireplace and a supply of firewood, although the building has natural gas-fired central heating - the fireplaces are for decorative purposes only. Entrance to the Big Meadows Lodge Big Meadows Wayside has a campground with some 200 lots. There is a shower building, laundry accommodations, a storage building for packaged campfire wood, and a small office at which ice, firewood and basic supplies can be purchased. There are several hiking trails: :Lewis Spring Falls follows the Appalachian Trail for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the main campground to the falls overlook. It is an easy trail with standard hard-packed pebbles and dirt, with a few rock scrambles along the way. :Dark Hollow Falls begins at a parking lot close to the Byrd Center. From the parking lot, a 0.7-mile (1.1 km) trail takes hikers to overlooks at the top and bottom of the falls. The trail is scenic and wide, but somewhat steep on the return. Woods at Big Meadows; a mother bear and two cubs are barely visible at center The summit of Blackrock Mountain is located 0.3 mile (0.5 km) from the main campground and adjacent to the Big Meadows Lodge. It is the highest point at Big Meadows and provides a scenic view of the Shenandoah Valley. The Big Meadow A part of the campground area, called The Big Meadow, is adjacent to the camp store and the Byrd Visitor center. Campers often wander the grassy trails of the meadow, watching for blueberries and blackberries. Usually, the bears have harvested the ripe stuff before the hikers arrive; in early-morning hikes, bears are sometimes spotted around the edges of the meadow. Wildlife There are white-tailed deer, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels and a variety of birds who visit the campground area and are very used to people. The deer are eager to find campers who will hand out food and treats. The rangers discourage this, but the result is that the deer wander the campgrounds throughout the day. It is not uncommon to have a deer take food from a human's hand in a campsite. Daytime bear sightings are not uncommon. The black bears are not aggressive, and no attacks on humans have been reported. The park provides bear-proof metal lockers around the camp area to protect food at night. The biggest concern is the skunk population. Like the deer, they forage the campsites for food. Campers will sometimes note the aroma of a skunk who was startled during the night. Wise campers ensure there is no food on the ground to attract skunks, and that the tent flap is secured against skunk entry. Other wildlife includes venomous snakes, although they are relatively rare. The park houses rattlesnakes, copperheads, as well as garter snakes and other non-venomous species.

At one stage, after the bowling greats Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose retired from international cricket, Dillon was the spearhead of the West Indies bowling attack. Subsequently, Dillon was labelled by Simon Briggs as \\"the natural successor to Courtney Walsh\\", noting that \\" his action has a hint of [Walsh's] well-oiled efficiency\\". According to Briggs, \\"he takes a high percentage of wickets with the ball that angles in then just holds its own\\". Steve Waugh labelled him \\"the West Indies' most notable underachiever...when he had his act together, [he] didn't lose much in comparison to his legendary predecessors [Ambrose and Walsh]...such days were a rarity.\\" He was involved in a remarkable over at Kandy's Asgiriya Stadium on 21 November 2001 in a test against Sri Lanka when he contracted abdominal pains and was replaced by Colin Stuart after two balls of his third over. Stuart was banned from bowling for the remainder of the innings by umpire John Hampshire after delivering two high, fast full-tosses (called as no-balls) in his first three balls. Chris Gayle completed the last three balls of the over with his off-breaks. It was the only instance in Test cricket history, when three bowlers were used in completing one over.

Beyazƒ±t Tower, also named Seraskier Tower, from the name of the Ottoman ministry of War, is an fire-watch tower located in the courtyard of Istanbul University's main campus (formerly Ottoman Ministry of War) on Beyazƒ±t Square (known as the Forum Tauri in the Roman period) in Istanbul, Turkey, on top of one of the \\"seven hills\\" which Constantine the Great had built the city, following the model of Rome. Beyazƒ±t Tower was ordered by the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II (1808‚Äì1839), and designed by Senekerim Balyan, who built it of stone in 1828 on the place of the original wooden Beyazƒ±t Tower, which was destroyed in a fire and was constructed earlier by the architect's brother, Krikor Balyan. It is currently equipped with lighting system to indicate weather conditions in different colors. Red colour means snow, blue‚Äînice and clear weather, green‚Äîrain and yellow‚Äîfog.  History  The first fire-watch tower in Beyazƒ±t was built of timber in 1749, but it was burnt down during the 1756 Great Fire of Cibali. It was replaced by another timber tower on the same location, which was destroyed following the riots stirred by Sultan Mahmud II's decision to dissolve the Janissary Corps in 1826. The same year, another wooden tower was erected on the plot, designed and built by the palace architect Krikor Balyan, which was again set on fire by adherents of the Janissaries. Finally, the current tower, made of stone, was built in 1828 by Senekerim Balyan in Ottoman Baroque style. The stone tower originally had a single floor of around 50 m¬≤ at the top for fire watching, which was reached through a wooden staircase of 180 steps. This watch room has 13 round arched windows. Initially, the tower had a timber roof in the form of a cone. In 1849, three floors in octagonal plan with round windows were added on the top section: one for signaling, one for signal baskets and the last one for flags. The smaller diameter of the highest three floors makes space for a terrace at the second floor. In 1889, an iron pole of 13 metres was erected on the roof. The tower was partly damaged by the earthquake of 1889 and was subsequently restored. At present, the tower has a stone roof and a wooden staircase of 256 steps. Fire was an important threat for Istanbul and caused numerous wide scale disasters, largely because most houses in the Old City's historic quarters were made of timber. Beyazƒ±t Tower, Galata Tower and ƒ∞cadiye Fire Tower (on Vanik√∂y Hill) were used for spotting fire threats, as they commanded long-distance views of the city from above. The entire Old City (Yedikule, Topkapƒ±, Kocamustafapa≈üa, Fatih, Beyazƒ±t), the cross-section of the Golden Horn districts (Fener, Balat, Emin√∂n√º) and those of the Bosphorus (Tophane, Be≈üikta≈ü, Ortak√∂y), the entrance of the Sea of Marmara (√úsk√ºdar, Kadƒ±k√∂y) and even the Princes' Islands towards the southeast of the city were within the range of watch sight from Beyazƒ±t Tower. Fire was signaled at daytime by lowering baskets and at night by lighting colored lamps. The number of the baskets or the number and the color of the lamps indicated the location, i.e. in which district of Istanbul the fire outbroke. As a response, the Watch Tower of Icadiye on the Anatolian side of the Bosphorus then fired 7 volleys to inform the citizens of the fire. Twenty firefighters were stationed in the Beyazƒ±t Tower until 1923. In 1997, the structure underwent a thorough restoration.16 Nisan 1999 Beyazƒ±t Tower is still in use today as a watch-tower as well as for signaling weather forecast and maritime navigation information to the ships on the Golden Horn at night. The tower lost its importance with the development of advanced communications technology. Recently, two firefighters in three shifts are stationed in the tower for guarding purposes only. Since 1972, special permission is required to enter the tower.

Richard Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby (1708 ‚Äì 10 October 1794), was an Anglo-Irish churchman. Life He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1730, MA 1733, BD & DD 1748). Robinson came to Ireland as chaplain to the Duke of Dorset in 1751. He was translated from the See of Kildare to the Archbishopric of Armagh in 1765. In 1777 he was created Baron Rokeby, of Armagh in the County of Armagh, in the Peerage of Ireland, with special remainder to Matthew Robinson (1694‚Äì1778) of West Layton, in the North Riding of the county of Yorkshire, his second cousin, twice removed, who predeceased him. In 1774 he founded the County Infirmary. In 1780 he donated land for the erection of a new prison and in 1771 he founded the Armagh Public Library.Armagh Public Library In 1790 he founded the Armagh Observatory as part of his plan for a university in Armagh. Archbishop Lord Rokeby died at Clifton in Bristol on 10 October 1794, and was buried in Armagh Cathedral. He was succeeded by Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby, the son of his second cousin Matthew Robinson, who inherited his titles, and was a noted eccentric.

He is regarded as Tajikistan's national poet and one of the most important writers in the country's history.  Biography  Sadriddin Ayni on a 1958 Soviet stamp. Ayni was born in a peasant family in the village of Soktare in what was then the Emirate of Bukhara. He became an orphan at 12 and moved to join his older brother in Bukhara, where he attended a madrasa and learned to write in Arabic. In the early 1920s Ayni helped to propagate the Russian Revolution in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In 1934 he attended the Soviet Congress of Writers as the Tajik representative. By purporting national identity in his writings, he was able to escape the Soviet censors that quieted many intellectuals in Central Asia. Ayni survived the Soviet Purges, and even outlived Stalin by one year. He was member of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan for 20 years, was awarded the Order of Lenin three times, and was the first president of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR. After 1992, his writing helped to bind together a sense of Tajik nationalism that survived the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ayni gave indigenous Tajik literature in Tajikistan a boost in 1927 by writing Dokhunda, the first Tajikistani novel in the Tajik language. In 1934 and 1935, leading Russian director Lev Kuleshov worked for two years in Tajikistan at a movie based on Dokhunda but the project was regarded with suspicion by the authorities as possibly exciting Tajik nationalism, and stopped. No footage survives. Ayni's four-volume Yoddoshtho (Memoirs), completed 1949-54 are famous and widely read. In 1956, Tajik director Boris (Besion) Kimyagarov (1920‚Äì1979) was finally able to get approval for a movie version of Dokhunda. Ayni's early poems were about love and nature, but after the national awakening in Tajikistan, his subject matter shifted to the dawn of the new age and the working class. His writings often criticized the Amir of Bukhara. Two well-known are The Slave and The Bukhara Executioners. Ayni died in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, where a mausoleum stands in his honor.

It lies north of the Seine and east of Le Havre. History Before the Roman conquest of Gaul Iuliobona was the capital of the Caletes, or inhabitants of the Pays de Caux. It was destroyed by Julius Caesar and afterwards rebuilt by Augustus. Before it was again ruined by the barbarian invasions, it had become an important centre whence Roman roads branched out in all directions. It was an administrative, military and commercial city located close to the Seine. This made it a great transportation route between Brittany (current England) and the remainder of the Roman Empire. It was also a crossroads of communication in order to bring Roman ways to Harfleur, √âtretat, Dieppe, √âvreux and Rouen. The remains of Roman baths and of a theater capable of holding 3,000 persons have been brought to light. Many Roman and Gallic relics, notably a bronze statue of Apollo (displayed in Le Louvre), and two fine mosaics exposed to the museum at Rouen, have been found. In the Middle Ages the fortifications of the town were constructed out of materials supplied by the Roman theater. The town recovered some of its old importance under William the Conqueror.

The park contains a fine cylindrical keep and other remains of a castle founded by William the Conqueror and rebuilt in the 13th century. The Gallo-Roman amphitheater of Lillebonne was built in the first century and was altered in the second century so that it could be used as both an amphitheater and a theater. Part of its remains are still visible today from F√©lix Faur Square, and the foundations of some of its remnants (the wings and backdrop) remain under the square. Economy The principal industries were cotton-spinning and the manufacture of calico and candles. There was also a prosperous manufacture of starch belonging to the Legrain family. Petrochemistry is now the main industry in the area, with a part of the nearby Notre-Dame-de-Gravenchon refining and petrochemical complex extending over the Lillebonne commune.

It is about Joachim Mahlke, an alienated only child without a father. The narrator Pilenz \\"alone could be termed his friend, if it were possible to be friends with Mahlke\\" (p. 78); much of Pilenz's narration addresses Mahlke directly by means of second-person narration. The story is set in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) around the time of the Second World War and Nazi rule. Plot summary The narrator describes the character \\"The Great Mahlke\\" from their youth together through to Mahlke's disappearance near the end of the Second World War. Much of the action of the story is on a half-submerged sunken minesweeper of the Polish Navy, on which the narrator, Mahlke and their friends meet each summer. Mahlke explores the shipwreck by diving through a hatch, and with his ever-present screwdriver salvages various items (information plaques, objects left behind by the crew, and even a gramophone) to sell or collect for himself. Over the course of the novella Mahlke steals an Iron Cross from a visiting U-boat captain, and is expelled from school. He joins a Panzer division and himself receives an Iron Cross thanks to his successes in battle. Returning to the school from which he was expelled, however, the principal forbids him from making a speech to the students, on the grounds of his former disgrace. The narrative in the story is often fairly incoherent. For instance, the timeline of the narration is often treated flexibly, moving from the narrator's perspective to different points within his memory of the events. There is also disunity about whether Mahlke is addressed in the second- or third-person, with Grass sometimes changing the form of address within a single sentence, possibly indicating the narrator's inability to remove his own emotions and feelings of guilt from an objective account of Mahlke. Mahlke, with the help of the narrator, returns to the shipwreck. Mahlke's main reason for entering the war in the first place was to make a speech at his school afterwards. Since he is denied that wish, Mahlke deserts his post, seeing no other reason to fight. Desertion implies treason and in consequence death. Pilenz, whose relationship to Mahlke becomes increasingly ambivalent, takes advantage of the situation and pressures an unwell Mahlke to dive into the wreck once more to hide, aware that Mahlke might not survive the dive. Pilenz never sees Mahlke again. Interpretations The title relates to the central metaphor, in which Mahlke is the mouse and society is the cat. Mahlke's large larynx is the leitmotif: > ...Mahlke's Adam's apple had become the cat's mouse. It was so young a cat, > and Mahlke's whatsis was so active ‚Äî in any case the cat leapt at Mahlke's > throat; or one of us caught the cat and held it up to Mahlke's neck; or I > ... seized the cat and showed it Mahlke's mouse; and Joachim Mahlke let out > a yell, but suffered only slight scratches. (p. 6) The anthropomorphism and metaphorical embodiment of gross social forces is common in Grass's work; here the sentence \\"It was a young cat, but no kitten\\" describes the German state in the 1940s ‚Äî young but by no means innocent (p. 5). The narrative style ‚Äî the evasion, self-justification, and eventual, chatty disclosure of the truth ‚Äî is also characteristic. Trivia Oskar Matzerath, protagonist of The Tin Drum, makes an appearance as \\"a little brat, who must have been about three, pound[ing] monotonously on a child's tin drum, turning the afternoon into an infernal smithy\\" (p. 17). He appears later in reference to the \\"Dusters\\" as \\"a three-year old child whom the gang had cherished as a kind of mascot\\" (p. 86). In 1961 an attempt was made to put the book on the index of Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, particularly due to a scene of group masturbation, in which Mahlke displays his enormous penis and remarkable sexual endurance. After protest from both the public and other writers the request was withdrawn.

Career Carroll was born Ronald Cleghorn in 116 Roslyn Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1934, the son of a plumber. He scored his first hit in 1956 with \\"Walk Hand in Hand\\" on the Philips label. He is the only singer to have represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest two years in succession.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. Having taken part in the 1960 UK Eurovision selection contest with the song \\"Girl with a Curl\\", he returned to win the selection and be Britain's entry in the 1962 contest, and with the song \\"Ring-a-Ding Girl\\" shared fourth place, the same placing he reached in 1963 with \\"Say Wonderful Things\\". This success was followed by two Top 10 hits during 1962 and 1963, but a lack of good material meant that he could not sustain a chart presence. In 1962 he appeared on the bill of \\"The Winifred Atwell Show\\". From Monday, 17 September 1962, for one week only, he gave twice nightly performances at the Brighton Hippodrome. Carroll subsequently worked on cruise ships, including the QE2, with John Marcangelo who was the drummer with the Ronnie Carroll Orchestra. He played a pop musician named 'Ronnie' in the 1963 film Blind Corner. In 2005, he released a comeback album, Back on Song. Political career Carroll contested his home Hampstead and Highgate constituency seat in the 1997 UK General Election, and the Uxbridge by-election in July that year with the Rainbow Alliance. He stood in the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election as a candidate for Make Politicians History and received 29 votes, despite announcing that he was trying to enter the record books by receiving no votes. He stood as a candidate (under the name 'The Eurovisionary Carroll') for the 2015 general election, in the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency. Nominations had closed on 9 April 2015, just four days before his death, but polling day was not until 7 May. He was standing as an independent so the poll continued; if he had won the election, the ballot would have been re-run at a later date. In the event he polled 113 votes to finish sixth out of seven candidates. Personal life Through work in variety theatre he met his first wife, Millicent Martin, to whom he was married from 1958 to 1960. His second wife was the Olympic runner June Paul with whom he ran an unsuccessful nightclub in Grenada. He was declared bankrupt in 1974 and his second marriage ended. Carroll later married and divorced a third wife, South African-born Glenda Kentridge. He latterly lived in Hampstead, north London, and was a regular caller to phone-in shows on BBC London 94.9. He died in London on 13 April 2015, at age 80. He was survived by two sons with June and a daughter and son, his children with Glenda.

The term \\"Joy Riding\\" was coined by a New York judge in 1908. Joyriders or other car thieves often gain access to a locked car with just a flathead screwdriver, although modern cars have systems to prevent a screwdriver from opening locks. Locks in cars manufactured before the early to mid-1990s were very weak and could be opened easily. The vehicle is started by either hot-wiring or breaking the ignition lock. Ignition systems were much less sophisticated before the early to mid-1990s and easier to bypass. The vehicle is often driven through rural areas or less busy residential areas to avoid police notice, dumped when it is exhausted of fuel or damaged. Sometimes, it is then destroyed by being set on fire with an igniter, like gasoline. Incidence and laws =Common-law systems= Under English law and other common-law systems,England and Wales; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60 Theft Act 1968 (c. 60)], ss. 12, 12A; Scotland: Strathern v. Seaforth, 1926 J. C. 100; Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52), s. 178; Northern Ireland: Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 (Chapter 16), s. 12; Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 (No. 154 (N.I. 1)), Art. 172 joyriding is not considered to be theft because the intent to \\"permanently deprive\\" the vehicle's owner of the vehicle cannot be proven. Instead, joyriding constitutes a separate, statutorily established offense of \\"unauthorized use\\" or \\"taking without owner's consent\\" (usually known by the acronym TWOC, or the slang terms \\"twoccing\\" or \\"twocking\\"). United Kingdom Joyriding was a major problem in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s, but has eased off since the year 2000 largely due to improved security standards on newer cars and the number of old cars with more basic security diminishing. Many surviving older cars have had modern security features fitted in order to reduce the risk of theft. High performance cars, including Ford's high performance XR and Cosworth models, were a popular choice for car thieves when joyriding in the United Kingdom was its peak, which contributed to a rise in insurance premiums for owners of such vehicles. Many motorists fitted their cars with security features before such equipment became standard on new cars. Since the advent of immobilisers and car alarms, car thieves have frequently mugged motorists or broken into their homes in order to steal the keys to a car. In 2005, the Home Office conducted a survey to find out the most stolen cars per registered in the UK: #Vauxhall Belmont (1986‚Äì1991) #Vauxhall Astra Mk2 (1984‚Äì1991) #Ford Escort Mks 3 and 4 (1980‚Äì1990) #Austin/MG Metro (1980‚Äì1990) #Vauxhall Nova (1983‚Äì1993) #Ford Orion (1983‚Äì1993) #Rover Metro (1990‚Äì1994) #Austin/MG/Rover Maestro (1983‚Äì1994) #Austin/MG/Rover Montego (1984‚Äì1994) #Ford Fiesta Mks1, 2 and 3 (1976‚Äì1995) The lack of security in older cars compared to modern equivalents is reflected in the fact that all of the cars listed had been out of production for at least 10 years, and the oldest examples of most of these cars were at least 20 years old. In 2009, the Home Office conducted a new survey and found out the most stolen cars (per registered) were as follows: #Vauxhall Astra (1980‚Äìpresent) #Volkswagen Golf (1974‚Äìpresent) #Ford Fiesta (1976‚Äìpresent) #Ford Focus (1998‚Äìpresent) #Ford Escort (1968‚Äì2000) #Vauxhall Corsa (1993‚Äìpresent) #Ford Mondeo (1993‚Äìpresent) #Ford Transit (1964‚Äìpresent) #Vauxhall Vectra (1995‚Äì2008) #Honda Civic (1972‚Äìpresent) The information released does not show the specific generation of a car, making it difficult to determine how many older examples were stolen in relation to more modern ones. For instance, the Ford Transit nameplate dates back to 1964, and the Ford Fiesta first appeared in 1976. However, the Ford Focus is the only nameplate on the list to have been introduced after 1995, around the time that car security standards became more advanced. United States In the United States, the most stolen cars in 2007 (per registered) were: #Honda Civic #Honda Accord #Toyota Camry #Ford F-150 #Chevrolet Silverado #Acura Integra #Ram 1500 #Nissan Sentra #Toyota Pickup #Toyota Corolla =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland, joyriding is a common crime, and many people have campaigned against it. Since the 1980s, a number of youth gangs have been in existence, particularly in nationalist areas of Belfast, dedicated to joyriding and other criminal activities. During The Troubles, paramilitaries such as the Provisional IRA administered to suspected joyriders extralegal punishment, usually consisting of breaking their fingers or kneecaps, in order to temporarily or permanently incapacitate them from operating most motor vehicles. These punishments are still given today by the Continuity IRA, a breakaway organization from the Provisional IRA.

This means the probability that a pair of particles with given velocities will collide can be calculated by considering each particle separately and ignoring any correlation between the probability for finding one particle with velocity and probability for finding another velocity in a small region . James Clerk Maxwell introduced this approximation in 1867 although its origins can be traced back to his first work on the kinetic theory in 1860.See: * Maxwell, J.C. (1860) \\"Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part I. On the motions and collisions of perfectly elastic spheres,\\" Philosophical Magazine, 4th series, 19 : 19‚Äì32. * Maxwell, J.C. (1860) \\"Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part II. On the process of diffusion of two or more kinds of moving particles among one another,\\" Philosophical Magazine, 4th series, 20 : 21‚Äì37. The assumption of molecular chaos is the key ingredient that allows proceeding from the BBGKY hierarchy to Boltzmann's equation, by reducing the 2-particle distribution function showing up in the collision term to a product of 1-particle distributions. This in turn leads to Boltzmann's H-theorem of 1872, L. Boltzmann, \\"Weitere Studien √ºber das W√§rmegleichgewicht unter Gasmolek√ºlen.\\" Sitzungsberichte Akademie der Wissenschaften 66 (1872): 275-370. English translation: which attempted to use kinetic theory to show that the entropy of a gas prepared in a state of less than complete disorder must inevitably increase, as the gas molecules are allowed to collide. This drew the objection from Loschmidt that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics and a time-symmetric formalism: something must be wrong (Loschmidt's paradox). The resolution (1895) of this paradox is that the velocities of two particles after a collision are no longer truly uncorrelated. By asserting that it was acceptable to ignore these correlations in the population at times after the initial time, Boltzmann had introduced an element of time asymmetry through the formalism of his calculation. Though the Stosszahlansatz is usually understood as a physically-grounded hypothesis, it was recently highlighted that it could also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis. This interpretation allows using the principle of maximum entropy in order to generalize the ansatz to higher-order distribution functions.

History Loches (the Roman Leucae) grew up around a monastery founded about 500 by St. Ours and belonged to the Counts of Anjou from 886 until 1205. In the latter year it was seized from King John of England by Philip Augustus, and from the middle of the 13th century until after the time of Charles IX of France the castle was a residence of the kings of France, apart for a brief interlude in 1424 when it was heritably granted to Archibald Douglas, Duke of Touraine. Antoine Guenand, Lord of La Celle-Guenand was appointed Captain-Governor of Loches in 1441. Population Sights The town, one of the most picturesque in central France, lies at the foot of the rocky eminence on which stands the Ch√¢teau de Loches, the castle of the Anjou family, surrounded by an outer wall thick, and consisting of the old collegiate church of St Ours, the royal lodge and the donjon or keep. The church of St Ours from The royal lodge The church of St Ours dates from the tenth century to the twelfth century; among its distinguishing features are the huge stone pyramids surmounting the nave and the beautiful carving of the west door. It contains the tomb of Agn√®s Sorel. The royal lodge The royal lodge, built by Charles VII of France and once used as the subprefecture, contains the oratory of Anne of Brittany. It was here on 11 May 1429 that Joan of Arc arrived, fresh from her historic victory at Orleans, to meet the king. The donjon includes, besides the ruined keep (12th century), the Martelet, celebrated as the prison of Lodovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, who died there in 1508, and the Tour Ronde, built by Louis XI of France and containing the famous iron cages in which state prisoners, including according to a story now discredited, the inventor Cardinal Balue, were confined. Loches has a town hall and several houses of the Renaissance period. The town hall was constructed after royal approval by Francis 1st in 1515. On the right bank of the Indre, opposite the town, is the village of Beaulieu-l√®s-Loches, once the seat of a barony.

Breton language The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d'ar brezhoneg on November 26, 2008. Economy Locmariaquer has a small port, but is one of the most important oyster producing areas in the world, due to its production of the finest and possibly the rarest oyster types. =History of oyster farming= View of the port feast of oysters The ancient Romans knew of the existence of deposits of natural edible oysters (or flat oyster) (Ostrea edulis, Linn.), but it was not until the late 19th century that oyster farming started. The municipality of Locmariaquer was then regarded as the cradle of the edible oyster. The first concessions in the Auray River were issued in 1882.http://vivierslocker.fr/index.php/en/https://www.ouest- france.fr/bretagne/locmariaquer-56740/locmariaquer-la-famille-percevault-dans- l-ostreiculture-depuis-1874-4771281 Three generations devoted themselves to building oyster parks on the shores of Locmariaquer: they had to remove the mud, replace it with sand, and map out the locations. Their job was to collect the spat (oyster larvae) clime coat the tiles or stakes and to take off or (d√©troquage) the growing areas and then sow the young oysters in parks for breeding for a duration of three years, during which there was a need to protect oysters against predators, algae, toxins, and storms. After 1927, Locmariaquer specialized mainly in the reproduction and the half-rearing of the oysters. After growing them to half size they were shipped off to Marennes, Holland England and Spain. The oyster industry grew to be very prosperous: 350 to 400 people worked in the construction of sites and parks almost all year round. However, in 1973‚Äì1974, flat oysters in the Gulf of Morbihan were decimated or destroyed by parasites. They were then replaced by cultivated oysters of Japanese origin, Crassostrea gigas). Today, Locmariaqu√©rois oyster farmers are cultivating Pacific oysters in the Gulf and River St Philibert. The crop and livestocks of the flat oyster are mainly in the Bay of Quiberon. Despite mechanization tests, the need of manpower is still high, both in culture itself and the pre-marketing operations (refining, sizing, etc.). As of 2008, thirty oyster farms still existed around Locmariaquer. They occupied about fifty people full-time, as well as seasonal workers in October to May. Sales to wholesalers, retailers or directly to consumers were handled individually by the farms. A careful observer might find a few vendors selling the old original Plattes oysters.

When the foundations of the present chapel were built, a quantity of medallions bearing the effigy of Caesar and other motifs were found. Today, the chapel looks like a rectangular building 14 metres long and 7 meters wide. On its portal is a decoration depicting three lily flowers in relief and a stone bearing the date 1813 and a damaged patch representing the arms of Robien.

Biography There are varied assumptions about the birth date of Topchubashov, different authors and journals claim that he was born in 1865, 1862, 1859 and other similar dates. After all these resorts on archive data, it is finally known that he was born in 4 May in 1863 in Tiflis (now Tbilisi). The Topcubashovs family was originally from Ganca city, but they were living at Tbilisi, near the Char Palace. In 1868, he lost his father and later his mother. Therefore, he was grown up by his grandmother. After studying at Tiflis Gymnasium, he entered Saint Petersburg University and graduated from the law faculty in 1888. While studying in Tiflis Gymnasium, Alimardan bey Topchubashov wrote some comic journals and spread them among students. During university years in Petersburg, he actively participated in Muslim students‚Äô organizations.d'Ali Mardan-bey Toptchibachi, carton n 3. CERCEC, EHESS, Paris, p.1 He was offered to remain at University and teach law if he would convert to Christianity, but he refused and returned to the Caucasus, where he worked at several small positions. He married Pari Malikova, daughter of Hasan bey Zardabi, founder of the first Azerbaijani newspaper, Akinchi. In 1897 oil magnate Zeynalabdin Taghiyev bought Kaspi newspaper and invited Topchibashov to be its editor-in- chief. Starting from that time he was actively involved in politics and quickly became one of the prominent leaders of Azerbaijani and Muslim people of Russian Empire. His main platform was the political equality of all subjects of Russian Crown and the end to discriminations of Turkic and Muslim people. At the brink of the First Russian Revolution Topchubashov was one of the initiators of famous meeting of Azerbaijani intelligentsia and bourgeoisie at Taghiyev's palace on 15 March 1905. As a result of this meeting a petition was addressed to Tsar asking for: * Implementation of local self-governing and new type of courts (jury) in the entire Caucasus * Granting of full political rights and freedoms to the Muslim subjects of the Crown * Distribution of land to the peasants who lack it * Improvement of fabric legislation to include Muslim workers too. Under the occupation of Russian Empire, all Russian Muslims united in attempt to defend their interests and freedom. In this process, the first All-Russian Muslim congress was held although official permission couldn't be obtained on 28 August 1905. The focus was on establishing a Union (Ittifaq) to safeguard political and social rights of the Muslims. An excerpt from the speech of Alimardan bey Topchubashov clearly reflects the atmosphere of the congress: ‚ÄòWe the Turkish sons have the same origin, same ancestry and same language. From the West to the East, it used to be our ancestors‚Äô lands. In spite of the fact that our ancestors were such a heroic nation, today, in the mountains of Caucasia, in the gardens of the Crimea, in the steppes of Kazan, in the lands of our ancestors, in our homeland we did not have the freedom to speak our own needs. Thanks God.. we succeeded (in that) today‚Äô. At the same time Topchubashov was one of the founders of Ittifaq al-Muslimin (first political party of Russian Muslims) and organized its three conferences. He headed party's third conference and became its bureau member and chief of its Law Commission. Later he became the leader of Party's Muslim faction at the Russian State Duma, the new Russian parliament (1906). But after the First Duma was dissolved by Tsar Topchubashov was arrested for three months, lost his right to be ever a parliament member, deprived of his place at Baku Municipality and ‚ÄúKaspi‚Äù newspaper. During this time Iran invited him to head one of the departments of Iranian Ministry of Justice and reform its judiciary system, but Topchubashov rejected this offer and remained in Russian Empire to continue his struggle for emancipation of Muslim population. After the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was proclaimed on 28 May 1918, Topchubashov became its ambassador to Armenia, Georgia and the Ottoman Empire, and was sent to Istanbul. Then he was made minister of foreign affairs at the second cabinet and was elected the head of the Parliament in absentia on 7 December 1918, thus becoming second head of state of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, after Mammed Amin Rasulzade. Agreeing to head the Azerbaijani Delegation at Versailles Conference, he left Istanbul for Paris. Topchubashov on a 2019 stamp of Azerbaijan At the conference, he managed to meet US President Woodrow Wilson and achieved the de facto recognition of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in January 1920. But after the Bolshevik takeover of ADR he could not return and stayed in Paris, where he died on 8 November 1934. He is buried in the communal cemetery of Saint-Cloud (near Paris), with his wife who died in 1947, and two other people who bear his name.Alimardan Bey Topchubashov grave monument in Communial , St Cloud, Hauts- de-Seine, France, Gravestone Photographic Resource. Topchubashov never gave up his job even when he was in France. He published books, brochures, and journals in an attempt to introduce and represent Azerbaijan to foreigners.

The album sold over 2 million copies.

That's what started it off. We just liked the name \\"Crusader\\".

Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered Saxon's turn to \\"a low-cal, kinder, gentler metal... a well-conceived experiment\\" and denied those who called Crusader \\"a failure\\" and \\"a bald-faced commercial maneuver\\", finding the album \\"refreshing if more than occasionally flawed.\\" The album reached No. 1 in the metal charts in Sweden, France and Germany.

Initially supporting the Central Powers against Imperial Russia, Pi≈Çsudski hoped for the defeat of one of the partitioning powers‚ÄîRussia‚Äîwith the help of the other two partitioning states, Austria-Hungary and Germany. However, after the Russian defeat in 1917 it became clear that the Central Powers were in no position to guarantee the independence of Poland. Despite the Act of November 5th of 1916 and the creation of Kingdom of Poland, it was apparent that the newly created state would be little more than a puppet buffer-state for Germany, a part of its Mitteleuropa plan. At this point, Pi≈Çsudski decided to switch allegiances to gain the support of the Entente, particularly France and the United Kingdom, for the cause of Polish independence. A good pretext appeared in July 1917, when the Central Powers demanded that the soldiers of the Polish Legions swear allegiance and obedience to the Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. Persuaded by Pi≈Çsudski, the majority of the soldiers of the 1st and 3rd Brigades of the Legions declined to take the oath. In the end, soldiers who were citizens of Austria-Hungary (roughly 3,000) were then forcibly drafted into the Austro- Hungarian Army or the Polnische Wehrmacht, demoted to the rank of private and sent to the Italian Front, while those born in other parts of occupied Poland were interned in prisoner of war camps in Szczypiorno and Beniamin√≥w. Approximately 7,500 soldiers joined the rump Polish Auxiliary Corps.

Among his most recognisable works are Monty Python's Life of Brian for film, and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Brideshead Revisited for television, the latter two earning Ivor Novello Awards in 1979 and 1981 respectively. He also won BAFTAs for his themes for the remake of The Forsyte Saga and Longitude. Burgon also achieved success and a serious following with vocal, orchestral, concert and stage works. Life and career Burgon was born in Hambledon, Hampshire in 1941, and taught himself the trumpet in order to join a jazz band at school (Pewley Grammar School, Guildford). He entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with the intention of becoming a professional trumpet player. However, under the direction of his mentor, composer Peter Wishart, he found that he was more interested in composition. Burgon initially supported himself and his family as a freelance jazz trumpeter. At the age of 30 he sold his instruments, except one, and devoted himself to composition. He lived through a lengthy period of poverty before critical success eventually brought financial reward. The critical success of his Requiem at the Three Choirs Festival in 1976 sealed his reputation as a composer and led to many commissions from major organisations. Continuing the tradition established by Benjamin Britten, Burgon's fluent and effortless language was particularly well suited to the voice and he had a long-standing collaboration with counter-tenor James Bowman. Burgon also had considerable success writing for film and television and twice received both BAFTA and Ivor Novello Awards. His style was essentially conservative, influenced by Benjamin Britten and medieval music rather than modern styles. His music was therefore not favoured by music critics and was sometimes labelled as commercial, but nevertheless it was widely appreciated.The Times 24 Sep 2010 Burgon saw his work in film and television as subsidising his passion for, and ability to devote time to what he called his \\"serious work\\" for concert., BBC DVD, Doctor Who: Seeds of Doom, Playing in the Green Cathedral interview, 2010 He married Janice Elizabeth Garwood in 1963 and had a son, Matthew and a daughter, Hannah. They were separated in 1970 and the marriage was dissolved in 1975. In 1992 he married Jacqueline Kroft, a Canadian pianist and singer/songwriter; they had a son, Daniel. He was a keen cricketer and wrote detective novels in his spare time. Burgon died on 21 September 2010 after a short illness.

It was formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of a number of training colleges, and gained full university status as the University of Northampton in 2005. History Northampton Technical College was opened at St George's Avenue‚Äînow the site of the Avenue Campus‚Äîin 1924. Eight years later, a new building for the College was formally opened by the Duke and Duchess of York. A School of Art opened later in 1937. The entrance to Avenue Campus At the beginning of the 1970s, Northamptonshire was one of the few counties in England to lack a teacher-training college. A college in Liverpool lost its home and was transferred to what is now the Park Campus. The College of Education was opened by the Secretary of State for Education and Science, Margaret Thatcher, in 1972. In 1975, this College amalgamated with the Colleges of Technology and Art to become Nene College of Higher Education, taking its name from the River Nene. In 1978, it integrated the Leathersellers College from London. In 1993, the college incorporated St. Andrew's School of Occupational Therapy and was granted undergraduate degree awarding powers. In 1997, it took in the Sir Gordon Roberts College of Nursing and Midwifery. It became University College Northampton in 1999 and gained full university status in 2005. To gain university status it had to convince the Privy Council that a Royal Decree banning the establishment of a university in Northampton, signed by King Henry III in 1265 following the Battle of Lewes, should be repealed. In 2005, the university also received the power to validate its own research degrees, which had formerly been validated by the University of Leicester. In the graduation ceremonies in July 2006, seven students received the first doctoral degrees validated by the University of Northampton. In January 2010, the School of Applied Sciences was renamed the School of Science and Technology and moved into the newly refurbished Newton Building at Avenue Campus. The Newton Building was officially opened in September 2010 by Princess Anne. Campus under Northampton university Main entrance to the Avenue Campus The university has three sites: Avenue Campus, just north of the town centre, opposite a large open park known as the Racecourse; the new Waterside Campus, which opened in September 2018 and is now the main campus for the university; and an Innovation centre opposite Northampton railway station. The former Park Campus in Kingsthorpe to the north of the town is now being wound down following the opening of Waterside. The university has various types of halls of residence on its two older campuses, with just over 1,600 rooms. Most first-year students live in halls, and few second- or third-years do so. Many of them live in the Abington area, north-east of the town centre. The main halls are now located in the student village of the Waterside Campus, and include Francis Crick; Margaret Bondfield; John Clare; and Charles Bradlaugh. A former ground-floor flat in the latter is a multi-faith Chaplaincy Centre, and another in John Clare houses the Centre for Community Volunteering; Bassett-Lowke. Simon Senlis hall The university also offers accommodation at Belinda Ferrison House in the Mounts area of the town centre. In April 2012, Northampton Borough Council granted planning permission for a 464-room hall of residence on the site of the St John's Surface Car Park in the town centre. It opened in 2014 and mainly accommodates international and post-graduate students. New buildings include a Santander Bank, \\"one-stop\\" student centre on Park Campus, an innovation centre at Avenue Campus for small and start-up businesses, and a complete re-fit of the editing and sound studios at Avenue Campus. The Newton Building The university recently took ownership of the Grade II-listed former Kingsley Park Middle School, next door to Avenue Campus. This has undergone an ¬£11m refurbishment and now houses most of the School of Science and Technology, formerly split between Avenue Campus and Park Campus. The building has been renamed the Newton Building, after Sir Isaac Newton. The university achieved the Ecocampus Silver award in 2011. In May 2012, the university announced plans to establish a new riverside campus in the town centre, on the site of the disused Northampton Power Station on the south bank of the River Nene and located within the Northampton Waterside Enterprise Zone (known simply as Northampton Waterside). The Waterside Campus opened to students in September 2018. Organisation and administration = Governance = The Vice-Chancellor is Nick Petford, who was preceded in the post by Ann Tate (who received an honorary degree from the university in 2011) and Martin Gaskell.

It is the sole representative of its genus in the Western Hemisphere, assuming T. caroliniana is treated as a subspecies or local ecotype of T. americana. Common names include American basswood and American linden.  Description  A specimen in the Arnold Arboretum leafing out in spring The American basswood is a medium-sized to large deciduous tree reaching a height of exceptionally with a trunk diameter of at maturity. It grows faster than many North American hardwoods, often twice the annual growth rate of American beech and many birch species. Life expectancy is around 200 years, with flowering and seeding generally occurring between 15 and 100 years, though occasionally seed production may start as early as 8 years. The crown is domed, the branches spreading, often pendulous. The bark is gray to light brown, with narrow, well defined fissures. The roots are large, deep, and spreading. The twigs are smooth, reddish-green, becoming light gray in their second year, finally dark brown or brownish gray, marked with dark wart-like excrescences. The winter buds are stout, ovate-acute, smooth, deep red, with two bud scales visible. The leaves are simple, alternately arranged, ovate to cordate, asymmetrical, unequal at the base (the side nearest the branch the largest), (can grow up to ) long and broad, with a long, slender petiole, a coarsely serrated margin and an acuminate apex. Bean noted that occasionally, enormous leaves measuring long by wide appear on thick, succulent shoots. They open from the bud conduplicate, pale green, downy; when full grown are dark green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath, with tufts of rusty brown hairs in the axils of the primary veins; the small stipules fall soon after leaf opening. The fall color is yellow-green to yellow. Both the twigs and leaves contain mucilaginous sap. The flowers are small, fragrant, yellowish-white, in diameter, arranged in drooping, cymose clusters of 6‚Äì20 with a whitish-green leaf-like bract attached for half its length at the base of the cyme. They are perfect, regular, with five sepals and petals, numerous stamens, and a five-celled superior ovary. The leaves emerge in mid-spring, but the flowers require day lengths of approximately 14 hours and 30 minutes to form, hence T. americana's range is limited to north of the 35th parallel. Time of flowering varies by several weeks depending on the latitude; early May in Canada and early June in the extreme southern extent. Leaf drop in fall occurs between early and late October depending on the latitude. The flowers are fragrant and insect-pollinated. The fruit is a small, globose, downy, hard and dry cream-colored nutlet with a diameter of .USDA NRCS Tree Guide: Tilia americana (pdf file)  Ecology  American basswood is dominant in the sugar maple‚Äìbasswood forest association, which is most common in western Wisconsin and central Minnesota, but occurs as far east as New England and southern Quebec in places that have mesic soil with relatively high pH. It also has minor occurrence in many other forest cover types. Its flowers provide abundant nectar for insects. The seeds are eaten by chipmunks, mice, and squirrels. Rabbits and voles eat the bark, sometimes girdling young trees. The leaves serve as food for caterpillars of various Lepidoptera (see Lepidoptera which feed on Tilia). The ribbed cocoon maker species Bucculatrix improvisa has not been found on other plants. This species is particularly susceptible to adult Japanese beetles (an invasive species in North America) that feed on its leaves. The mushroom Pholiota squarrosoides is known to decay the logs of the tree.  Cultivation and uses  Sections of Tilia americana from The American Woods The American basswood can be propagated by cuttings and grafting as well as by seed. Propagated plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are susceptible to many pests. The American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods coppice extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut. The American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect. It is often planted on the windward side of an orchard as a protection to young and delicate trees. It is cultivated at least as far north as Juneau, Alaska.Juneau: Downtown Juneau Tree Guide The foliage and flowers are both edible, though the tender young leaves are more palatable. It is a beneficial species for attracting pollinators as well. Bees produce excellent honey with a mildly spicy flavor from its blossoms. The inner bark was used historically as a fiber source for making baskets, rope, and fishing nets. Basswood attracts many insect pests including Japanese beetles and skeletonized leaves are common. Mite galls commonly form on the foliage. Cultivars include 'Nova', 'Duros' (with an upright crown), the pyramidal 'Frontyard' and the conic-crowned 'Redmond'. The tree was introduced to the UK in 1752, but has never prospered there, being prone to dieback.Bean, W. J. (1921). Trees and shrubs hardy in the British Isles. 3rd edition, Vol. II., p.590. London, John Murray. = Wood = basswood carving The wood is pale brown, sometimes nearly white or faintly tinged with red; light, soft with fine close grain; clear of knots but does not split easily. It is low in strength and has a poor steam-bending classification. It can take stains and polish without difficulty and it planes, glues, screws and nails well. It is sold generally under the name basswood, but is sometimes confounded with tulip-wood and then called white-wood, and is largely used in the manufacture of wooden-ware, wagon boxes and furniture. It has a density of 0.4525 (relative to water). The wood is considered odorless. This makes it valuable in the manufacture of wooden-ware, cheap furniture, and bodies of carriages; it is also especially adapted for wood-carving. The inner bark is very tough and fibrous, used in the past for making ropes. It is a common wood for use in the production of solid-body electric guitars, where it is considered an analogue for aspen and poplar, because it is light, strong and resonant, though it is usually used for guitars that will be painted an opaque color, because its lack of notable grain makes it an unattractive candidate for transparent finish. It is especially popular in heavy metal. = Medicinal uses = Although Tilia cordata is believed to be stronger, T. americana is also used medicinally. The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Linden tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. The flowers, leaves, wood, and charcoal (obtained from the wood) are used for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients in the linden flowers include flavonoids (which act as antioxidants), volatile oils, and mucilaginous constituents (which soothe and reduce inflammation). The plant also contains tannins that can act as an astringent. Linden flowers are used in colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. The flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria, and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, irregular heartbeat, and vomiting. The leaves are used to promote sweating to reduce fevers. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and surrounding soft tissue). The wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection, such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg. Several animal studies showed that the extract of T. americana increased sleeping time by 50 minutes (similar to the effects of diazepam) and decreased movement, which indicates sedative effects. It is argued that its mechanism of action is due to the flavonoid quercetin, as it inhibits the release of histamine.

It was re-released in 2015 for Steam with support for Windows and Mac OS. The game can also allow the player interact with a pair of Stereoscopic Vision Glasses. Like many Apogee games of the time, Word Rescue includes 3 episodes, with only the first episode playable in the shareware version. *Episode 1 - Visit Gruzzleville and the Castle *Episode 2 - Explore GruzzleBad Caverns *Episode 3 - See the spooky Haunted House Apogee still sells the registered version of this game. The game is followed by Word Rescue Plus. Plot The story centers on creatures called \\"The Gruzzles\\". Because the Gruzzles cannot read, they steal words out of books, preventing others from reading as well. Playing as a boy or girl, the player must help Benny Bookworm take back all the stolen words and match them with their meanings so he may put them back in the books. Gameplay The player moves around the screen in a platform shooter style environment. He/she tries to match words with their corresponding pictures, located randomly in the level. In addition, the player must avoid both Gruzzles and dangers. Touching them will result in having to start the level over. Once all 7 words are matched, Benny Bookworm magically turns the player's collected words into a key, which is used to open the door in the level which takes the player to the next level. If the player matches a word with the wrong picture, a \\"Gruzzle\\" appears. To deal with a Gruzzle the player must press the Space bar to order Benny the Bookworm to pour slime on it. The player only has a limited supply of slime but slime can be replenished by collecting slime buckets or completing the mystery word. One word from the level is randomly chosen at the beginning of each level to be the mystery word, and the letters of that word are placed in a random order around the level, despite the fact that they are in the same places every time. If the player completes the word by collecting the letters of that word in order, bonus points and full slime are awarded. Bonus points can also be earned by collecting books, sliming Gruzzles and matching words with their pictures. Depending on the difficulty level, there are also a set number of Gruzzles on each level. The Easy difficulty is easy for young players, as there is only one predetermined Gruzzle in the level. The Hard difficulty, however, often has as many or more Gruzzles as there are words to find and 20 books must be collected to reveal the mystery word. This makes the game challenging even for adults.

James Bond: The Legacy. Boxtree, 46. Shot from the point of view of a presumed assassin, it features James Bond walking, turning, and then shooting directly at camera, causing blood to run down the screen. The visuals are usually accompanied by the \\"James Bond Theme\\", written by Monty Norman. Originally designed by Maurice Binder, the sequence has featured in every James Bond film produced by Eon Productions. While it has retained the same basic elements, it has evolved noticeably throughout the series.Barnes, Alan & Hearn, Marcus (2000). Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: The Unofficial James Bond Companion. Batsford, 18. It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and is featured heavily in marketing material for the films and their spin-offs. The British media historian James Chapman suggests that the sequence is a significant part of the James Bond mythos because it \\"foregrounds the motif of looking, which is central to the spy genre.\\" Description In virtually every Eon-produced Bond film, the sequence begins with a white dot blinking across the screen, from left to right. Upon reaching the right edge of the frame, the dot opens up to reveal a gun barrel's interior. From the point of view of an off-screen assassin, the camera follows James Bond as he walks from right to left against a neutral background.Pfeiffer, Lee & Lisa, Philip (1995). The Incredible World of 007: An Authorized Celebration of James Bond. Boxtree, 200. Suddenly he becomes aware of being observed and stops at the centre of the screen before he quickly turns to the camera and shoots his gun towards it. A blood-red wash, representing the gunman bleeding, runs down the screen. The gun barrel dissolves to a white dot which moves from side-to-side across the screen and settles in the corner. With a few exceptions, the circle then either shrinks and disappears, fades from white to a circular cutout of the first scene, expanding to reveal the full view of the scene shortly thereafter, or simply fades to black from the final Bond firing pose. Origins calibre gun barrel with its six-sided rifling, similar to the gun barrel shown in the movies The Great Train Robbery, acted out by Justus D. Barnes, may have influenced the James Bond gun barrel sequence. Maurice Binder created the opening titles of the first Bond film, Dr. No, in 1962. Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera to solve the problem, and the barrel became crystal clear. Binder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before his death in 1991: The media historian James Chapman observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of The Great Train Robbery (1903).Chapman, James (2000). Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films. Columbia, 61. Evolution of the sequence Bob Simmons in Dr. No =Sean Connery= 1962‚Äì1964 Because Binder had designed the gun barrel sequence to feature Bond only in silhouette, with a non-widescreen aspect ratio, he used stunt man Bob Simmons, rather than Sean Connery, to film the scene. Simmons hops slightly as he pivots to assume the firing position and, following the blood wash, the dot becomes smaller and jumps to the lower right-hand corner of the frame before simply vanishing. In Dr. No, the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line \\"Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli present\\" appears across the dot. The text is wiped and the dot continues the sequence. The sequence is accompanied by a soundtrack of electronic noises and then numerous notes that sound like they are being plinked from a wind-up jack in the box; the latter is cut short by the gunshot. The \\"James Bond Theme\\" then plays very loudly, albeit with the first portion, featuring the theme's plucked electric guitar riff, truncated. The gun barrel sequence in Dr. No segues directly into the credits, a grid matrix of large-scale, bright and rapidly changing coloured circular dots against a black background. This version, without the electronic noises or the Saltzman-Broccoli credit line, was also used in From Russia with Love with more red coloured blood and Goldfinger which fades into the pre-credit sequence. 1965‚Äì1967 For Thunderball, the aspect ratio of the films was changed to a Panavision anamorphic format and so the gun barrel sequence had to be reshot, this time with Sean Connery in the role.Lane, Andy & Simpson, Paul (1998). The Bond Files: The Unofficial Guide to the World's Greatest Secret Agent. Virgin, 145. It is also the first gun barrel sequence in which the white dot segues to the film's pre-credit sequence, opening up to reveal the entirety of the scene. Connery wobbles slightly while firing his gun as he adjusts his balance from an unstable position and he bends over to fire. Although the sequence was shot in color for Thunderball, it is rendered in black and white for You Only Live Twice. =1969 (George Lazenby)= With a new actor, George Lazenby, in the role of James Bond for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), a third sequence had to be filmed. As with Thunderball, the sequence was once again shot in color. In this rendering, the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line \\"Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli Present\\" appears, much as it did in Dr. No (albeit spelling out \\"and\\" instead of using the ampersand). The James Bond theme keeps playing though. As the barrel begins to move and when it stops centre-screen, Bond is walking to position for around a second before turning and shooting as the camera tracks with him, resulting in a \\"treadmill\\" effect. Lazenby is the only Bond who kneels down to fire; this is also the only version where the descending blood completely erases Bond's image, leaving only the red circle. In this version, the gun barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light. =1971 (Sean Connery)= When Sean Connery returned to the role of Bond for Diamonds Are Forever (1971), the gun barrel sequence filmed for Thunderball was used. As with You Only Live Twice, the sequence was rendered in black and white, but was given a bluish tint. As in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light, which this time ripple through it. Unlike On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the splashes of light are erased by the descending blood. This was the last time the sequence was rendered in black and white until Casino Royale (2006). It is also the last gun barrel sequence in which Bond wears a hat. =Roger Moore= 1973‚Äì1974 With the introduction of Roger Moore, and the use of a 1.85:1 matted aspect ratio, a fourth sequence was shot. It was used for just two films: Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun. Moore wears a business suit and, unlike Simmons, Connery and Lazenby, uses both hands instead of one hand to fire his gun, his left hand bracing his gun arm. It is worth noting that the gun barrel moves side-to-side only to the left of Bond, without alternating to the right. This is the first gun barrel sequence in which Bond is not wearing a hat. Additional footage of this sequence was shot of Bond walking straight towards the camera, putting his face into view, seen in the theatrical trailer. The dots that start the gun barrel in The Man with the Golden Gun are blue but in subsequent releases the dots are white. It is the last gun barrel sequence until Quantum of Solace where Bond wears a business suit. 1977‚Äì1985 The anamorphic format was reinstated for The Spy Who Loved Me, necessitating a fifth version of the sequence. Moore's Bond wears a dinner suit (tuxedo) rather than a business suit and again uses both hands to fire his gun. This rendering would feature in all Moore's subsequent films in the series, for a total of five appearances, the most uses of the same footage to date. In this version of the sequence, unlike previous and later incarnations, the prop gun held by the actor is never actually fired until Octopussy, as can be determined by the lack of gunsmoke in the freeze-frame. It is also noticeable that the background of this version of the sequence is tinted, rather than the usual white. The tint changes with every Moore film. The Spy Who Loved Me, for example, features an eggshell tinted background whereas the background in Moonraker has a strong shade of buff. In For Your Eyes Only, once the white dot moves in the middle of the screen, it does not open up to reveal the pre- credits scene, but cuts abruptly. =1987‚Äì1989 (Timothy Dalton)= A new gun barrel sequence was shot due to the change in actor from Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton and was used for both of Dalton's films. Dalton walks swiftly with a slight bounce before sharply spinning and firing. Dalton crouches down slightly when he fires. Unlike Moore, Dalton shoots one-handed. John Barry orchestrates the music for the gun barrel in The Living Daylights (1987) but Michael Kamen composes a different orchestration for Licence To Kill (1989). This was the last gun barrel sequence to be designed by Maurice Binder before his death in 1991. =1995‚Äì2002 (Pierce Brosnan)= Following Maurice Binder's death in 1991, Daniel Kleinman became the designer of the Bond opening graphics. Beginning with GoldenEye (1995), the barrel was computer-generated (but still resembles the original images of the barrel itself) emphasising light and shade variations in the rifling spiral as the reflected light shifts with the gun's movement. Like Dalton, Brosnan shoots one-handed. Unlike the previous Bonds, he remains bolt upright as he fires, with his gun arm extended straight at the camera. The blood in this sequence is noticeably darker and falls faster than in previous incarnations; in keeping with this new pace, the main melody line of the James Bond theme is omitted in two of Brosnan's gun barrel sequences, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. In prior versions of the sequence, the white dot would open up to reveal the gun barrel before it reaches the right edge of the screen; in all four of Brosnan's films, however, the dot continues moving right until it disappears off screen. Then the gun barrel scrolls in leftward from off screen. The World Is Not Enough is the first Bond movie where the white dot opens up to reveal Bond. The teaser trailer for GoldenEye featured its own gun barrel sequence in which Bond, appearing in shadow, quickly shoots away the onscreen text \\"ONLY ONE MAN\\", before shooting the letter \\"M\\" into a \\"7\\" to only leave \\"007\\". Bond walks into the foreground, revealing Brosnan's face and proclaiming \\"You were expecting someone else?\\", introducing him as the first actor to play Bond since 1989. The theatrical trailer for Tomorrow Never Dies featured its own gun barrel sequence in which Bond, in a dinner suit, fires with both hands ala Roger Moore, at the six-grooved gun barrel. In Die Another Day (2002), Lee Tamahori, the film's director requested a CG bullet be added into the sequence, which is seen zooming from Bond's gun at the screen and disappearing, suggesting that Bond has fired straight into his opponent's weapon. This was the last gun barrel sequence where Bond wears a dinner suit and the last one until Spectre where the sequence opens the film. =Daniel Craig= 2006 The gun barrel sequence was revised again for Daniel Craig's first portrayal of Agent 007 in Casino Royale. Unlike previous installments, the gun barrel sequence does not open the film as a standalone segment; it is part of the plot. Having seemingly committed the first kill on his way to becoming a Double-O agent, Bond stops to pick up his gun from the floor but his victim, Fisher, who is a henchman of rogue MI6 section chief Dryden, recovers and seizes his own weapon. As Fisher brings his pistol up to shoot Bond in the back, the frame shifts instantly to the gun barrel perspective; Bond spins around to outshoot his opponent. This sequence differs considerably from previous versions: it is incorporated into the film's narrative; it begins with Bond standing stationary (although he was walking toward the door before stopping and turning); it is not filmed against a blank white void and it includes the person whom Bond shoots. In keeping with the black-and-white theme of the pre-title sequence of the film, it is also the first to be presented in monochrome since Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and the first in which Bond is wearing neither a business suit nor a dinner suit, but is dressed casually. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed. Furthermore, the computer-generated rifling is microgroove rather than the traditional eight rifling grooves, and the blood comes down the screen quickly, not in a wave, but in rivulets. This is also the first gun barrel sequence without some variation of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" as, instead, it is accompanied by the opening bars of the film's theme song, \\"You Know My Name\\". 2008 The gun barrel was refilled and edited for 2008's Quantum of Solace. It reverts to a more traditional style, although the sequence was placed at the end of the film to start the closing credits, due to a final cliffhanger scene being cut by Marc Forster. The sequence represents Bond as a blunt and cold-blooded assassin due to the pace of the scene. For example, the white dot travels across the screen much faster than in previous gun barrel sequences, Daniel Craig moves swiftly into position, noticeably faster than its predecessors, and the blood comes down in a large quick wash. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed. The design of the gun barrel is also more simplistic, with a grey colour to it as well as fewer and more widely spaced grooves. The white circle also spins into the centre of the Q in the title graphic for Quantum of Solace, and in the Q, Bond is shown walking away after firing for the first time in the sequence. The closing credits of the film follow. 2012 Yet another redesigned gun barrel is used for the film Skyfall (2012). Although director Sam Mendes had originally intended to place the gun barrel at the start of the film, he felt that it would be better placed at the end, as in Quantum of Solace. The film's opening shot instead harks back to the gun barrel, with Bond emerging into a corridor, pointing his gun directly at the camera, accompanied by the first two notes of the \\"James Bond Theme\\". Mendes recalled, \\"I tried very hard to put the gun barrel at the beginning and my intention was always to do that. If you see the film, the film starts with Bond walking down a corridor towards camera and lifting a gun. And of course the gun barrel is him walking, stopping and lifting a gun. When I put the two together, it looked ridiculous!\\" Like with Quantum of Solace, the blood is dark red and runs down the frame in rivulets. However, Bond moves across the screen substantially slower (at a similar speed to the pre-Casino Royale sequences). Unlike all previous gun barrel openings, Craig swings both his arms as he walks, resulting in a partial glimpse of his gun before he turns to fire. After the blood runs down the frame, the screen fades to black, before being replaced by a title card with a small gun barrel logo celebrating fifty years of Bond films and the text \\"James Bond Will Return\\" underneath. This gun barrel sequence is the first time Bond has worn a business suit instead of a tuxedo since Roger Moore's original sequence. Craig shoots one-handed from the chest. 2015 The gun barrel is placed at the immediate opening of Spectre, the first time since Die Another Day that a Bond film has opened with the gun barrel. The gun barrel design is similar to that of the original Maurice Binder era and the Pierce Brosnan era, although slightly blurrier. Daniel Craig moves at an average speed (again swinging both of his arms as he walks, but this time resulting in his gun being made much more prominently visible), before spinning, facing the camera and firing, to which the lighting grows darker: it silhouettes Bond's figure and the blood runs down the screen, looking similar but noticeably slower than in Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. Craig shoots one-handed again from the chest. Costume From Dr. No to Diamonds Are Forever, the gun barrel sequences by Bob Simmons, Sean Connery, and George Lazenby feature James Bond in a business suit and trilby. For his first two films, Roger Moore's Bond continues this tradition but without the hat. The following films, beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), feature Bond in black tie, wearing a dinner suit (tuxedo). It also continued from Moonraker (1979) to Die Another Day (2002). In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig's James Bond is the first shown wearing a more casual ensemble and an open-necked shirt; his attire reverts to a business suit in Quantum of Solace, which is retained for Skyfall and Spectre. The 007 Legends video game tie-in reverts to the dinner suit. Music The gun barrel sequence is traditionally accompanied by an arrangement of the \\"James Bond Theme\\", a trademark established in Dr. No. A slightly different version of the theme has been used in each film, often reflecting the styles and locations featured. Some composers have not used the familiar opening bars that punctuate the appearance of the white dots. Others, while retaining them, have felt free to noticeably alter the usual rendition, e.g. Michael Kamen and √âric Serra, who scored Licence to Kill and GoldenEye respectively. Kamen's orchestration was a symphonic fanfare, while Serra's arrangement is played by synthesiser. Casino Royale has the only gun barrel sequence which omits the \\"James Bond Theme\\" completely, instead featuring the opening bars of \\"You Know My Name\\" by Chris Cornell. The \\"James Bond Theme\\" returns to accompany the gun barrel sequence in Quantum of Solace, where it continues into the credits. The same goes with Skyfall's gun barrel, though the theme starts before the sequence in the last scene of the film when the new M gives 007 the dossier for his next mission. Other uses The gun barrel sequence is widely used in advertisements and merchandise. References to its circular motif regularly appear in the films' trailers. A version of the sequence is used at the start of the 2012 documentary Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007 which showed each Bond composited together, turning and shooting.Luke Williams interview with director Stevan Riley: http://www.007magazine.co.uk/news_james_bond_50_eon.htm The music videos to the James Bond title themes \\"A View to a Kill\\", \\"The Living Daylights\\", \\"Licence to Kill\\", \\"GoldenEye\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"Another Way to Die\\" each feature their own variation of the gun barrel sequence. The 007 sequence in Never Say Never Again Because the gun barrel sequence is copyrighted by Eon, the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again, released by rival Warner Bros., instead employed a frame filled with 007's, with the camera zooming into the one in the middle of the screen. There is, however, a scene in which James Bond and Maximilian Largo play a video game together. The nuclear missile defense shield used in the game resembles a gun barrel. Video games The sequence is commonly used in James Bond video games and their marketing. GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64 uses the gun barrel sequence in the opening titles. A commercial for The World Is Not Enough parodied the gun-barrel by replacing Bond with a man who resembled Valentin Zukovsky; he was shot at with a machine-gun before diving off-screen. It was used in a commercial for the video game Agent Under Fire asking, \\"Do you have what it takes to be Bond?\\", and showing people trying to repeat the shot, but spoiling the try. Nightfire and Everything or Nothing each use a version similar to the Pierce Brosnan films. From Russia with Love uses the Bob Simmons gun barrel from the film of the same name. In the video game adaptation of Quantum of Solace, the gun barrel resembles the one used for Casino Royale, as the game adapts elements from both films. Parodies As with any cultural icon, the gun barrel sequence has inspired numerous parodies and takeoffs since its first appearance in 1962. The sequence has been spoofed in films, sitcoms, cartoons and in advertisements, including: Bons Baisers de Hong Kong, Dave Allen at Large, The Simpsons, SpongeBob SquarePants, Family Guy, American Dad!,Monty Python's Flying Circus, Logorama, and Garfield and Friends. WWE wrestler Cesaro's entrance is also similar to that of James Bond gun barrel sequence. In the 1986 horror/comedy film Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, the opening credits show Jason Voorhees, the main antagonist in the series, emulating the gun barrel sequence by walking across the screen in a Bond-like fashion and then turning to face the camera whilst swinging his signature machete, drenching the screen with blood in a similar manner to the original Bond sequences.

History Originally a modest farmhouse which was bought around 1700 William Marsden Esq, a highly influential Barnsley attorney and Steward to the 1st Duke of Leeds. He had the house altered to be more suitable for the residence of a gentleman. William Marsden died in 1718 apparently worth ¬£30,000 he left his estates to be divided in certain proportions amongst his children. His son William, succeeded him as attorney of Barnsley and Royal Surveyor of the Woods north of the River Trent to King George III. He too, was a man of great influence, and was a good deal mixed up in the affairs of the town and district. His Grandson, Captain Francis Marsden ‚Äì West Yorkshire Militia/5th Regiment of Foot served as a British officer in the early years of the American Revolution. Arriving in Boston in 1774 from Monkstown, Ireland he was initially in command of the Grenadier Company in which he served with Lieutenant Lord Francis Rawdon. He probably participated in the battles of Lexington and Concord but at this time the Grenadier Company was commanded by Captain George Harris (later Baron Harris). The overall command of the regiment at this time fell to Colonel Lord Hugh Percy, later 2nd Duke of Northumberland. He died at Burntwood on 12 February 1780, aged 27 from wounds received five years before at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. He was buried at Wakefield Cathedral, although his grave has since moved there still stands a wall monument in his memory inside the Cathedral. His sister, Hannah Maria who paid for the monument was married to John Carr Esq of Carr Lodge Horbury, who was a nephew to the famous architect, John Carr. Hannah Maria named her son, John Francis Carr in memory of her brother. John Carr of York, John Carr, Hannah Maria and a granddaughter are all buried in the same vault in St Peter and St Leonard's Church, Horbury. The Marsden family held the Lord of the Manor of nearby Bolton on Dearne with Goldthorpe and benefited from the 1761-1767 Inclosure Awards, gaining further land from several of the village commons (Carr, Bolton on Dearne and Goldthorpe among others). The family continued to live mostly in Burntwood, though they had several smaller estates including Newhall, and Kettlethorpe Hall for 150 years. The last being William Henry Marsden, the son of Dr John Marsden who was Vicar of Felkirk and Chaplain to Dr Robert Hay Drummond the Archbishop of York, died at Burntwood in 1815. Burntwood was then bought by Mr. S. H. Taylor who lived here for around 60 years before selling the estate to the local Dymond family, whom continued to live here until 1961. The Hall was then used for several years as offices for a bus company. Today Burntwood Hall is a nursing home for the elderly and the kitchen garden is now a centre for disabled people. Architecture and Grounds The hall is a mixture of classical and Gothic revival architecture and on the south side there is a porch supported by doric columns The grounds originally incorporated both an entrance lodge on the south entrance (though this became neglected and was later demolished) and a stable block (now converted and used as staff accommodation). In 2003 some of the garden ornaments, including the sundial were stolen. It has the only 'secret' tunnel in the area that can be authenticated, running for thirty yards (27 m) under the road to the kitchen gardens. West Haigh Wood and Howell Wood (now a country park) were landscaped as the grounds of the hall and as a game reserve, as was the open space of the old Burntwood. It is possible that there was once a hunting lodge located within Howell Woods though any visible trace of this is long gone. Artificial lakes were set in Howell Wood and West Haigh Wood, the one in Howell Wood being the only one surviving today and used as a fishing lake. Next to the lake in Howell Woods remains the 18th century ice house, which is now home to various forms of wildlife. Howell Wood Country Park is managed by the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster.

His great grandfather Jafar Qoli, the Khan of Khoy was defeated by the Iranian Fath-Ali Shah and with his 20,000 army retreated to Echmiadzin. In the 1804-1813 Russo-Persian war, Jafar Qoli Khan sided with Russian Empire and was therefore rewarded by tsar Alexander I by being appointed the Khan of Shaki Khanate and his rank was raised to lieutenant colonel. After receiving his school education at Ganja gymnasium, Fatali Khan studied at the Law Faculty of the Moscow University, from which he graduated in 1901. After the graduation, Khoyski worked as a court lawyer in Ganja, Sukhumi, Batumi, Kutaisi. Once he was appointed Assistant Prosecutor of Yekaterinodar county court, he began to be involved in socio-political activities. Political career =Russian Empire= Fatali Khan Khoyski (seated left) with a group of deputies of the II State Duma Muslims. 1907 Khoyski was elected a deputy to the Second Duma of Russian Empire from Elisabethpol Governorate. While delivering a speech before the Duma on 2 February 1907, he criticized the Russian colonization policies in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus. Although he was formally registered with Constitutional Democratic Party (known as the Kadets), he also joined the Muslim fraction in Duma. On 27 March, soon after the 1917 February revolution in Russia, Khoyski became a member of the Temporary Executive Committee of Muslim National Councils (MNCs). During the first Musavat summit on 26‚Äì31 October 1917, Khoyski spoke in favor of autonomy for Azerbaijan. In December 1917, he was elected a member of the newly created Transcaucasian Sejm and subsequently appointed the Minister of Justice of an independent Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. =Azerbaijan Democratic Republic= On 28 May 1918, the republic dissolved and an independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was proclaimed. It was the first state ever in the Muslim world to function and be based on principles of republic government. Fatali Khan was put in charge of forming the first cabinet of the republic. ADR stamps published on Khoyski's initiative Prime Minister Khoyski had the distinct honor to send radiogram to the main political centers of the world on the proclamation of an independent Azerbaijan republic on 30 May 1918. When the government moved to its temporary residence in the city of Ganja the government encountered serious challenges. Azerbaijani statehood came under fire. On 17 June, Fatali Khan announced the resignation of the government at the closed session of the National Council but he was assigned to form the government again. In addition to the post of prime minister, he was the post of justice minister in the second government. Khoyski served as the Chairman of Cabinet of Ministers and Minister of Internal Affairs. On 17 June 1918 the second government was formed by Khoyski led by Nasib Yusifbeyli. He played a significant role in making alliance with the Turkish government, defeating and removing the Centrocaspian Dictatorship from power in Baku as well as establishing diplomatic ties with other countries. On 22 December, he was elected as a foreign minister of the newly formed government. Khoyski protected the Azerbaijan's statehood in this post. Furthermore, he defended the independence of Azerbaijan by achieving the recognition of the independence of Azerbaijan at the Paris Peace Conference. He is also credited for establishing the Azerbaijan State University. During the period of the third government formed by Khoyski, he served as Chairman of the National Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan. During his term in office, he succeeded in removing the city names Elisabethpol and restoring the historic name of Ganja and renaming the Karyagino county to Jabrayil province, establishing a multi-party system, printing of Azerbaijani postage stamps and Azerbaijani currency Manat, founding schools and colleges teaching in Azerbaijani. In March 1919, the third government dissolved. In January 1920, when the Allied Powers de facto recognized Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Council of Allied Powers, Georgy Chicherin, the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs repeatedly mailed Khoyski asking him to open a new front to confront Anton Denikin and his White movement to which Fatali Khan gave negative responses saying ADR would not meddle into internal affairs of Russia. In his fourth last correspondence, Chicherin notified Khoyski about the upcoming invasion of the 11th Red Army of Azerbaijan. Khoyski moved his family to Tbilisi before the Bolshevik Red Army invaded Baku on 28 April 1920. Assassination Fatali Khan Khoyski was assassinated in Tiflis, near the central Erivansky Square on 19 June 1920 by Aram Yerganian as part of Operation Nemesis organised by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). The ARF accused Khoyski in having played a major role in the September 1918 massacre of Armenians in Baku.

Around 1751, Giganti came under the patronage of Giuseppe Stella, Bishop of Mazara del Vallo, with whom he went to Palermo, where he studied for the priesthood and was ordained. After ordination, he entered the household of the Sicilian aristocrat the Prince of Scordia, where he seems to have been employed as both confessor and private architect, working on the various houses owned by the Scordia family. Giganti designed other Sicilian buildings in the baroque style, including: Villa Galetti at Bagheria, Villa Ventimiglia, at Mezzo- Monreale, the church of S. Paolo dei Giardinieri, and the dais and high altar at the church of San Salvatore in Palermo. A trained engineer, Giganti was also responsible for a number of bridges.

His professional career was extensive, lasting from 1912 to 1936 and was interrupted by World War I which robbed Girardengo of some of his best years. He was ranked number one in the World in 1919, 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926. He raced almost exclusively in his home country as was the custom in those days, as foreign travel was not easy. Girardengo was of only small stature and this earned him the nickname \\"The Novi Runt\\". Career Born in Novi Ligure (province of Alessandria, Piedmont), Costante Girardengo turned professional in 1913 at the age of 20 for the Maino-Dunlop team after impressing as an amateur the previous year by finishing runner up in the Tour of Tuscany. He met with immediate success winning a stage in the Giro d‚ÄôItalia (his first of 30 stage wins in the Giro) and becoming Italian road race champion. He repeated these successes in 1914 and also took his first of his five wins in Milano‚ÄìTorino. 1914 saw Girardengo win the longest ever stage in the Giro d'Italia, a 430 kilometre leg between Lucca and Rome.www.cycling4all.com. States that Girardengo won longest ever Giro stage in 1914. Later that same year Girardengo took part in the Tour de France for the only time in his career, riding as a guest for the Automoto team he crashed several times in stages five and six and abandoned the race.www.bikeraceinfo.com. Details 1914 Tour de France participation. 1915 saw him take another win in Milano‚ÄìTorino but Milan‚ÄìSan Remo resulted in disappointment when he was disqualified after winning the race for going off course. Much of the professional cycle racing was stopped after 1915 because of the First World War and it was not until 1918 that Girardengo took another win, taking the first of his six victories in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, a record which Eddy Merckx eventually eclipsed over 50 years later. He also finished in the first three of the same race every year from 1917 to 1926 and was first over the Turchino Pass on five occasions. His post 1918 form was all the more remarkable as during the First World War Girardengo had contracted Spanish flu and nearly died, his manager believing a survivor of that disease could not race properly refused at one point to renew his licence.\\"European Cycling\\" Page 8 (Gives info on Spanish Flu). Girardengo took the first of his Giro d‚ÄôItalia wins in 1919 (including seven stage wins), however his form in the Giro was not always good and he abandoned the race in the early stages in 1920, 1921 and 1922 before dominating in 1923. 1923 was undoubtedly Girardengo‚Äôs best year with 16 victories, he took his second Giro d‚ÄôItalia win including eight of the ten stages as well as many of the top Italian one day races. Despite racing in Italy for most of his career, Girardengo had a burning desire to win Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, he first raced there in 1921 but he was unlucky on several occasions, breaking his bike when well placed and never coming close to winning. In 1924 Girardengo won the GP Wolber in France, then regarded as the unofficial World Championship. Girardengo finished runner up in the inaugural World Championship road race held on the N√ºrburgring in Germany in 1927, the four man Italian team also included Alfredo Binda, Gaetano Belloni and Domenico Piemontesi, the Italians worked perfectly as a team with Binda breaking away 20 miles from the finish to win comfortably, the Italians filled the first four places on that rainy day in Germany. He took his sixth win in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo in 1928 and this was his last big victory on the road although he continued riding until the 1936 season when he retired at the age of 43. After his retirement Girardengo became involved as a coach of the professional Maino team. He also became the head coach of the Italian national squad for a time, advising Gino Bartali when he won the 1938 Tour de France.www.museociclismo.it. Gives info on Coach of Maino team and Italian national coach. Later on he gave his name ‚ÄúGirardengo‚Äù to a brand of motorbikes manufactured between 1951 and 1954 in the northern Italian city of Alessandria. He has been immortalised in Italian popular culture through the critically acclaimed song \\"Il Bandito e il Campione\\" by Francesco De Gregori that juxtaposes his life with that of his childhood friend the notorious bandit and outlaw Sante Pollastri. He died in 1978 at Cassano Spinola, just outside Novi Ligure, at the age of 84.

It is situated on both banks of the Sambre (here canalized), east of Valenciennes and about from the Belgian border. History Maubeuge (ancient Malbodium, from Latin, derived from the Old Frankish name Malboden, meaning \\"assizes of Boden\\") owes its origin to Maubeuge Abbey, a double monastery, for men and women, founded in the 7th century by Saint Aldego, the relics of whom are preserved in the church. It subsequently belonged to the territory of Hainaut. The town was part of the Spanish Netherlands and changed hands a number of times before it was finally ceded to France in the 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen. As part of Vauban's pr√© carr√© plan that protected France's northern borders with a double line of fortresses, it was extensively fortified as directed by Louis XIV of France. Besieged in 1793 by Prince Josias of Coburg, it was relieved by the victory of Wattignies, which is commemorated by a monument in the town. It was unsuccessfully besieged in 1814, but was compelled to capitulate, after a vigorous resistance, in the Hundred Days. As a fortress, Maubeuge has an old enceinte of bastion trace which serves as the center of an important entrenched camp of 18 miles perimeter. The fortress was constructed after the War of 1870 but has since been modernized and augmented. The forts were besieged in World War I by the German Empire. Maubeuge suffered heavily in World War II: 90% of the town centre was destroyed by bombardments in May 1940. Fighting again occurred in early September 1944, in and around the outskirts of Maubeuge, involving units of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division during the American push toward Belgium.Official site of the town of Maubeuge =Heraldry= Economy There are important foundries, forges and blast furnaces, together with manufactures of machine tools and porcelain. The town has a board of trade arbitration, a communal college, a commercial and industrial school. Transport Being close to the Belgian border, the station has two lines to Belgium: one leading North towards Mons, the other Eastbound to Charleroi. Neither have seen passenger service for several years, however from December 2018 there is announced a limited service to Namur via Charleroi.https://www.hgbtf.net/download/file.php?id=7279 Official announcement, in Dutch Trains to the South-West are frequent.

The show originally had a 4-week run, which was extended twice due to the popularity of the performance. The video led to Izzard being invited to the Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, awarded a British Comedy Award for \\"Top Stand Up Comedian\\", and receiving an Olivier Award nomination for \\"Outstanding Achievement\\". Live at the Ambassadors was Izzard's first show made available on VHS, which for many years was out of production and very difficult to come by. Izzard hated his physical appearance on the show, and was also on low performance rights with the copyright owner, and thus a DVD version will never be released. However, it is available on CD from the official Eddie Izzard website. Fans and critics alike recognise the change in Izzard's comedy over the years; Live at the Ambassadors is an example of Izzard's very early and less confident style of stand-up (during the interval, Izzard comments that the first half was ' a bit clunkey at the beginning').https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0IYydf9614&t;=3s In particular, there is very little evidence of his cross dressing, something that would become a major part of the Izzard 'brand' later in his career, with only simple nail varnish obvious. However, his bizarre sense of humour has remained the same throughout performances, and various themes and ideas that can be seen in later recordings can be identified in Live at the Ambassadors such as Christian hymns (and religion in general), politics, history, cult television and wordplay/oddities within the English language.

It is a variant of the situation calculus; the main difference is that situations are considered representations of states. A binary function symbol \\\\circ is used to concatenate the terms that represent facts that hold in a situation. For example, that the box is on the table in the situation s is represented by the formula \\\\exists t . s = on(box,table) \\\\circ t. The frame problem is solved by asserting that the situation after the execution of an action is identical to the one before but for the conditions changed by the action. For example, the action of moving the box from the table to the floor is formalized as: : State(Do(move(box,table,floor), s)) \\\\circ on(box,table) = State(s) \\\\circ on(box,floor) This formula states that the state after the move is added the term on(box,floor) and removed the term on(box,table). Axioms specifying that \\\\circ is commutative and non-idempotent are necessary for such axioms to work.

He was a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and was the head of the Revolutionary Court which issued death sentences against 143 Dujail residents, in the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on the president on 8 July 1982. Arrest and trial After the US invasion, he was formally handed over to the interim Iraqi Government in 2004. On 31 July 2005, at the Al- Dujail trial, the Iraqi Special Tribunal tried al-Bandar for crimes against humanity for issuing the death sentences where he pleaded not guilty. On 5 November 2006, al-Bandar was sentenced to death by hanging along with co- defendants Hussein and Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti. His body was buried next to Saddam Hussein in Al-Awja. Al-Bandar's defence counsel consisted of Bader Awad Hamed Alsa'doon as lead defense and Saadoun Sughaiyer al-Janabi (also: Sa'doon al-Janabi). The latter was assassinated on 20 October 2005 one day after being abducted from his home in Baghdad. Execution The sentence was widely expected to be carried out on 30 December 2006, shortly before 6:00 AM Iraqi local time. Hussein was hanged at 6:05 AM Iraqi local time (0305 UTC). Initially, al-Tikriti and al-Bandar were also believed to have been hanged with him. A few hours later, official statements clarified that the executions of al-Bandar and his remaining co-defendant had been postponed to give special significance to the day that Hussein was executed. The United States claimed that it did not have helicopters available to fly the remaining two to the place of execution; the Iraqi government later said that they did not have time. On 3 January 2007, an Iraqi government official told the Associated Press that preparations were under way to hang Saddam's half-brother al- Tikriti, a former intelligence chief, and al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court on Thursday 4 January 2007. Both were hanged before dawn on 15 January 2007. They were pronounced dead at 3:05 AM (0005 UTC). Al- Bandar's legal counsel was not allowed to attend. Hussein and his half-brother al-Tikriti were also not allowed to have their lawyer present when they were executed.

Album notes The album is the first not to feature original bassist Steve Dawson, who had left the band earlier in 1986. For the recording of this album, vocalist Biff Byford, who had incidentally begun his career as a singer/bassist, recorded all the bass parts in Dawson's place. However, Paul Johnson joined the band as bassist before the album was released and is therefore credited in the liner notes. Reception Rock the Nations received mixed reviews from critics. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic gave the album two stars out of five and said in his review for the band's previous album Innocence Is No Excuse that \\"Saxon's internal chemistry was significantly unbalanced by the subsequent departure of key songwriter [Steve] Dawson -- a loss from which they would take years to fully recover.\\" in his review for this album, he said that although the album was \\"graced with a somewhat rougher sound more in line with the band's New Wave of British Heavy Metal early years\\" it was still \\"arguably less heavy than its predecessor\\" and also criticised the songs \\"We Came Here to Rock\\", \\"Running Hot\\" and the title track for being \\"clich√©-ridden\\" and \\"Waiting For The Night\\" and \\"Northern Lady\\" for being \\"unconvincingly sappy ballads\\", though he did regard \\"Party 'til You Puke\\" as being \\"good for a laugh\\" and also of interest for the guest appearance of Elton John. However, he concluded that the album is one that \\"the Saxon faithful would likely rather forget\\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff found Rock The Nations \\"a little more full-bodied production-wise and less overtly metallic and by-the-book construction-wise\\" than Innocence Is No Excuse, \\"while still suffering for coasting on [Saxon]'s scant laurels\\".

It provides the most comprehensive range of neuro-musculoskeletal health care in the UK, including acute spinal injury, complex bone tumour treatment, orthopaedic medicine and specialist rehabilitation for chronic back pain. The RNOH is a major teaching centre and around 20% of orthopaedic surgeons in the UK receive training there.  History  The hospital's old central London site, on Great Portland Street, in use from 1909 to 1984 The hospital's old out-patients clinic, on Bolsover Street, in use from 1909 to 2006 The hospital's new out-patients clinic, on Bolsover Street, in use since 2009 The hospital was established by way of a merger of the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital (founded in 1840 and based in Hanover Square) and the National Orthopaedic Hospital (founded in 1836 and based in Great Portland Street) in August 1905. The City Orthopaedic Hospital (founded in 1851 and based in Hatton Garden) joined the merger in 1907. New facilities for the merged entities were built on Great Portland Street and were opened by King Edward VII in July 1909. During the First World War, the hospital in Great Portland Street became an emergency hospital for the military and from early 1918 also accommodated discharged disabled soldiers. The Great Portland Street site continued to accommodate short-term in-patients after the war. In 1922 the hospital management acquired the Mary Wardell Convalescent Home for Scarlet Fever in Stanmore and established its country branch there. The Duke of Gloucester laid the foundation stone for a major extension at the Stanmore site shortly thereafter. The Stanmore site started to accommodate long-term in-patients at this time. In April 1979, the Prince of Wales opened a Rehabilitation Assessment Unit at the Stanmore site, built with funds raised by the British Motor Racing Drivers Association in memory of Graham Hill who had once been a patient of the hospital. In March 1984 the Princess of Wales opened a spinal injuries unit at the Stanmore site. Later that year the lease on the building in Great Portland Street ended and services were transferred to the Stanmore site. The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital has had a central London out-patients clinic on Bolsover Street since 1909; the old facility closed in 2006 and a completely re-built facility opened on Bolsover Street in 2009. In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91-year-old British man, was recognised as having the world's oldest hip replacement implants. The two vitallium implants had been implanted at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in November 1948. The 67-year-old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Mr Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis. Services As a national centre of excellence, the RNOH treats patients from across the country, many of whom have been referred by other hospital consultants for second opinions or for treatment of complex or rare conditions. Performance It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 1310 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 2.88%. 87% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 71% recommended it as a place to work. It expects to lose ¬£15.2m in income, 11% of its turnover during 2016‚Äì17 under changes to the NHS tariff, more than a 25% of what it received last year for inpatient work. In 2014 the Care Quality Commission recorded the Hospital as requiring improvement.

Therefore, imports from the United States and Japanese companies such as IBM, DEC, Unisys, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC greatly increased. However, high tariffs discouraged the direct import of computers, instead encouraging foreign corporations to provide hardware and software to domestic enterprises.

The political term \\"women of color\\" surfaced in the violence against women movement. In the late seventies it unified all women experiencing multiple layers of marginalization with race or ethnicity as a common issue.  History  Although similar to the term \\"person of color,\\" the history of the term women of color has political roots, as explained by the women's rights leader Loretta Ross. During the 1977 National Women's Conference, a group of African American women created the Black Women's Agenda to work with the conference. They aimed to substitute the proposed \\"Minority Women's Plank\\", which was included in the documentation for the conference. When other minority women wanted to be included in the agenda, negotiations to rename the group led to the creation of the term \\"women of color\\", encompassing all minority women. Although it seems to have a biological connotations, the term \\"women of color\\" is a unifying term that also addresses the political and social issues.  Feminist movement  The first wave of the feminist movement, primarily between 1960 and 1980, did not deal with the issues faced by women of color. This wave used the term \\"universal woman\\", attempting to speak for the overall oppression faced by all women. Many involved in the first wave of feminism spoke from the white middle-class female perspective and concluded that gender was the main site of their oppression. Nevertheless, feminism slowly began to address cultural inequalities, especially after the influence of the civil rights movement. As a result, noting their range of economic, social, and political differences, women of color sought to address the unique experiences of non-white women, generally excluded from the term \\"feminism\\". In the 1980s Africana womanism was created to practice Afrocentricism as in America, much was based on a Eurocentric standpoint. Despite the Eurocentrism of feminism during this time period, many women of color still became prominent feminist icons. The mujerismo movement also came about during this time to confront the issues that Latina women were facing. The term is derived from the Spanish word mujer, or \\"woman\\"'; it was a name for oppressed women of color who found their issues were not being addressed within the white feminist movement. The struggles of women of color needed to be better publicized and addressed, encouraging black women to let their voices be heard. Intersectionality‚Äîthe effects of experiences based primarily on age, sex, race, gender, sexuality, and disability‚Äîis an important consideration in connection with the contributions of women of color to the feminist movement. It is also important to focus on issues specific to women of color in view of the particular problems they have faced. Women of color not only had to deal with the problems of being a woman, but also because they were marginalized as people of color. For example, a high percentage of women of color were of lower socio-economic status as a result of economic discrimination. This is often ignored by the mainstream feminist movement. The feminist writer Maylei Blackwell discusses this historical silencing of \\"other\\" aspects of feminism in her book ¬°Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement, expressing the need for what she calls retrofitted memory.Retrofitted memory is a form of countermemory against privileged readings of history that allows marginalized perspectives to be recognized.  Media representation  In the United States, women of color have frequently been misrepresented by the media for over 50 years or more. In 1968, the Kerner Commission released a report of its investigation into the 1967 race riots. It was highly critical of the way race was being treated in the media. Starting in 1971, the Federal Communications Commission required broadcasting stations to implement EEO programs, specifically focused on helping racial minorities and women. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that six years after starting these programs, minorities and women still remained discriminated against by the media. In order to create a positive impression, they were treated as window-dressing or misleading examples. The manner in which media represents women of color has been an issue throughout most of television and film history, especially by their white-washing women on television and film. Time and time again, roles that should have been given to women of color have been given to white actors and actresses. In films such as Aloha and Breakfast at Tiffany's, directors have replaced traditional Asian roles with actors/actresses of non-Asian descent. \\"Yellow Facing\\" has even been present in plays and musicals such as Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen. In this example, \\"the role of a Japanese man, Sakini, was given to a white actor named Kenneth Nelson, a decision that aligned with all the previous white actors who had played the role, including Marlon Brando\\". According to the theater researcher Esther Kim Lee, \\"popular representation of Asians in mainstream theater are actually stereotypical and overtly mocking of Asian culture, furthermore, most Asian roles were given to white actors\\". Not only have these issues led to public outcry and protests but harmful representations of Asian women are frequent, with the result that future opportunities for them may well be tarnished in the process. According to the media researcher Lori Kido Lopez, many Asian American actors and actresses have been told by producers and directors that they were not 'real' as 'orientals' or Asians. \\"As a result of decades of Asian representation being commandeered by white actors in yellowface, the idea of \\"Asianness\\" had been reduced to an image of prosthetic eyepieces and heavy accents‚Äîso much so that it was not even considered realistic for an actual Asian actor to play such a role\\". Although white-washing is a topic that has been pushed aside over the years, it is one that severely impacts opportunities for many women of color and hinders the diversification of races in media. Because of these many pre- existing stereotypes of Asian women from the early days of Hollywood, Western culture often associate them with concepts such as the dragon lady, the femme fatale or a devious seducer. According to Sharad Rajgopal of Westfield State University, \\"Eastern cultures have been represented in Western mainstream cinema as dangerous, devious and evil; all characteristics that represent the mythical Asian Dragon\\". Although the image of the dragon lady was more popular in early cinema and television, many still maintain its belief today. According to Sharad Rajgopal, \\"The femme fatale is also present among Asian women, for example, in the 1931 film Daughter of the Dragon Anna May Wong is portrayed as a dangerous threat not because of her strength, but because of her \\"mythical\\" beauty and seduction\\". This image of the femme fatale can be seen in contemporary films too, such as Lucy Liu's role in Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill series. The constant association of Asian women with dangerousness due to their exotic and seducing looks is harmful for Asian women everywhere. Adding to the stereotype of seduction, \\"Asians have also appeared in scenes carrying strong sexual overtones, or involving sexual acts, such as the film Call Girl II: Modern Call Girls\\". With the multiple stereotypical portrayals of Asian women being seen through film and television everywhere, they may continue to face issues that are difficult to resolve as a result of the harmful, pre-existing images of themselves set forth by media. It is normal for programmers to focus on representing their consumers, and because the majority of those who watch television are white, most of the media is white- washed. In its history, when Fox wished to appeal to young audiences, it aired shows about young people. Ladies Night on television was intended to draw a female audience. Economists refer to these patterns as \\"externalities\\". They are caused by rational profit-seeking behavior of media organizations facing competition for the positive attention of white-dominated mass audiences. When advertisers want to show things such as vacations, cute couples, luxurious or family scenes, most of the time they automatically think white. In the words of African American specialist Theodore Ransaw: \\"According to the world of TV advertising, Whites are the ones who occupy the realm of ideal humanity, of human warmth and connection\\".Ransaw, Theodore. \\"Alive and in Color, Gender and Racial Bias in the Media: The Search for the Inclusion of Women of Color In the Term Women.\\" Academia.edu. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Apr. 2017. Because of this, the media tend to broadcast women with Eurocentric, thin features. Women of color are underrepresented, but when they are included, they are often depicted in racially biased ways. Analyses have showed that people of color have historically been portrayed as athletes, or in lower-class occupations such as fast-food workers and in minor, non-speaking roles. Black and Latina women are often portrayed as either slaves/maids, or poor, working-class figures with too many children. Women of color are lightened by different companies, stripped of their heritage and pride, or photoshopped to appear slimmer and more suitable for television. Women of color also face dehumanization by the media. The white women are usually portrayed as angelic and innocent. When a woman of color gets cast on a TV show, she is often portrayed as being very sexual. These women also face lower body satisfaction, because they either need to be slim or curvy. Women of color are forced to try to live up to a standard that is set by white women, which in most cases is unreachable. = Television = Minorities are typically underrepresented on television despite making up approximately 40% of the United States population as of 2014.Bunche The first woman of color leading a television show was Teresa Graves who starred in Get Christie Love!, a 1974 series on ABC. She was the first African American woman to star in an hour-long drama. There would not be a woman of color leading a television show until 2012, when Kerry Washington starred in Shonda Rimes' Scandal on ABC. Due to Washington's work, for \\"the second season of Scandal, Washington was nominated for an Emmy at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the first African-American woman to be nominated in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 18 years.\\"Freydkin = Stereotypes = African American women typically have been negatively stereotyped in television. In his 2010 Journal of African American Studies article \\"But She's Not Black!\\" author Philip Kretsedemas examined stereotypes of American women in television and noted the three most common: the mammy stereotype, the jezebel stereotype, and the sapphire stereotype, also known as the angry black woman stereotype. The mammy stereotype creates a view of an African American woman as a caregiver, who is loyal and often sassy. The jezebel stereotype portrays African American women as seductive, alluring, aggressive, and overtly sexualized. The sapphire stereotype displays African American women as sassy, rude, loud, and angry, but also comical and status-climbing. Asian and Asian American Women are typically given specific stereotypes in television as well. Two common stereotypes of Asian and Asian American women are described by Hemant Shah in his 2003 article \\"'Asian culture' and Asian American identities in the television and film industries of the United States\\" as the Dragon Lady stereotype and the Lotus Blossom stereotype. The Dragon Lady stereotype portrays Asian and Asian American women as sneaky, evil, and malicious, but also promiscuous and alluring‚Äîworking to seduce men and manipulate them. Another common stereotype is the Lotus Blossom stereotype. This stereotype, also known as the \\"China Doll\\", portrays Asian and Asian American women as loyal and good women, but also submissive and hypersexualized. Latinas, or women with roots in Latin America, are also viewed through stereotypes in television. In her article \\"Three Faces of Eva: Perpetuation of The Hot-Latina Stereotype in Desperate Housewives\\", within the Howard Journal of Communications, Debra Hoskins discusses these common portrayals of Latinas. She finds that within Anglo and Hispanic television and film, there are three notable stereotypes of Latinas. The first listed stereotype is the Cantina Girl, characterized by a Latina having \\"great sexual allure\\", and being represented as a sexual object. The next stereotype described is the \\"Faithful, self-sacrificing senorita\\". This stereotype includes a Latina starting off as a good character, but then turning evil later on in the show/film. She then makes a sacrifice, often death, to save a man and show that she realized she was wrong. Lastly, there is the Vamp stereotype, which portrays Latinas as women who use both intellect and sexual desire to manipulate a man and get what they want. Arab and Arab American women are likewise portrayed in television and film in a stereotypical way. Jennifer Bing-Canar and Mary Zerkel explore these portrayals in their article, \\"Reading the Media and Myself: Experiences in Critical Media Literacy with Young Arab- American Women\\". In this article, it is noted that Arab women are typically seen as either promiscuous, belly-dancing, hypersexualized women, or as persecuted women wearing the hijab. In both of these portrayals, women are objectified or oppressed by men. There is also a less frequent stereotype that portrays Arab women as terrorists, although this is more commonly seen in Arab men. Native American women are not often included in film and television, but when they are, they usually fall under certain stereotypes. In the article \\"The YouTube Indian: Portrayals of Native Americans on a viral video site\\", Maria Kopacz and Bessie Lee Lawton examined these depictions. One of these portrayals is the negative stereotype of the Squaw. The Squaw stereotype depicts Native American women as promiscuous and abused servants, who are inferior to whites. The other stereotype used to represent Native American women is the Indian Princess. This includes a chief's daughter who is beautiful, but also rebellious, as she sacrifices her culture to adopt American culture and to live happily in relation with a white man. According to Kopacz and Lawton, one good example of the Indian Princess stereotype is the main character and storyline in Disney's movie, Pocahontas.  Structural intersectionality and rape  Women of color are often isolated when it comes to economic, social, and political status. They are less likely to have their needs and problems taken care of, than women who are racially privileged. Although there are plenty of rape centers available to women, women of color still experience discrimination. For example, counselors for rape victims often report that a high portion of their resources must be spent on handling problems other than rape. Violence Domestic violence is a recurring problem that greatly affects women of color around the world. Examples for women of color include physical violence, emotional abuse, victimization, economic abuse, intimidation, oppression, and threats. The violence against women of color directly correlates to high rates of poverty, poor education, limited job resources, language barriers, fear of deportation, and lack of knowledge in finding support. Many women of color accept a lifetime of abuse because they have a robust, personal, and familial identification with a certain community. They are submissive to religious beliefs, they have fear of alienation and estrangement from their daily lives, or they are skeptical of the helpfulness of intervention services. As of today, women of color are the most violently targeted community of persons in the world. According to Thompson Lee, \\"African American females are more likely to be victimized, raped, or assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetimes\\". Black women experience higher rates of intimate partner homicide when compared to the statistical analysis of violence against white women. The modern racism in the world is a direct cause of violence against African American women; a black woman would be less likely to report her situation or to seek help because of blatant discrimination. Black stereotypes often amplify the female convolutions in regard to violence. \\"Myths that African American women are dominant figures that require control or are exceptionally strong under stress increase their vulnerability and discourage most from speaking out about abuse.\\" Nonetheless, Black women are often more likely to obtain help from authority than black men. To understand violence against Black women one must understand the violent history that Black women have endured in America. Black women were brought to America as slaves to be overworked, tortured, raped, and stripped of their dignity. They were forced to entertain their owners and perform sexual acts. They had no rights of their bodies, actions, or surroundings. Even after One-hundred and fifty years later, the trauma that Black women endured has carried over to them today. According to Kimberl√® Crenshaw, Black women are members of two marginalized groups, being black and being a woman. Not only are they stereotyped because of their gender but also because of their race Their voices are not being heard. Black women continue to be \\"killed, abused, stigmatized, and denied basic human rights because of stereotypes of being both Black and a woman.\\". When it comes to violence against them they are thought to be an inconvenience when encountering law enforcement, even though they are more likely to seek help from authority. According to major scholars, the relationship between Black women and law enforcement has not been ideal. Instead of feeling safe and secure, Black women are fearful and hopeless when it comes to law enforcement . The unfortunate circumstances of cases where Black women have experienced violence at the hands of law enforcement are nearly non-existent. Author Michelle Jacobs states ‚ÄúThere is no database that authors could access to identify Black women killed or brutalized by the police. Authors solely relied on the families of the women killed and their own researchers to compile the women‚Äôs stories . Sadly, many of these cases have resulted in death. This behavior between law enforcement and Black women have been normalized within American society. Black women are stereotyped into the ‚Äúangry black women‚Äù which causes a stigma dealing with law enforcement. The stereotypes are historically rooted in our society which is causing a problem on how law enforcement see, interact, and treat Black women. Because of the uncertainty and distrust of law enforcement, Black women who have been abused, are less likely to use social services or programs compared to white women. They are also less likely to go to hospitals to treat their injuries . Kimberl√® Crenshaw states, the intersectional oppression that Black women experience because of their race and gender is the reason why Black women experience a different type of treatment from law enforcement. When cases of violence against Black women are taken to court, the court system analyzes both race and gender separately which takes the reality away for a Black woman who lives in her skin and gender on a daily basis . Although ‚Äúlegal slavery has ended, the rape and sexual torture of Black women and the justification for this torture still continues‚Äù . Not recognizing both her gender and race, people will never truly understand the discrimination and oppression the Black female victim has gone through. Women have made a huge impact and have fought so hard to get the rights that they have now, but it isn't all women, who can celebrate these rights freely. Black women are still fighting to be seen as equals in society and to law enforcement. Law and enforcement and society's general perspective about Black women is toxic and limiting Asian and Pacific Islander women also experience many forms of domestic violence. \\"41-60 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women have reported experiencing domestic violence during their lifetimes in a survey conducted by the Asian and Pacific Islander Institute.\\" The labels placed in Asian and Pacific Islander communities such as emotional control, authoritative respect, submissiveness, and other highly valued traits contribute to this group's reluctance to express or share their abuses. In a survey put out by the National Violence Against Women organization, about 24 percent of Hispanic and Latina women are abused domestically by an intimate partner during their lifetimes. In regard to immigration, \\"48 percent of Latinas reported that their partner's violence increased since immigrating to the United States\\". Latina and Hispanic culture significantly influences the actions women take when dealing with violence. \\"In the Latino culture, women are often designated to the roles of wife and mother. It is socially unacceptable to be divorced, to marry several times, or to remain single and have children out of wedlock. For these reasons, it may take some time for battered women to consider leaving their partners\\". Similarly, religious beliefs and inaccessibility to resourceful information prevent many Hispanic and Latina women from seeking assistance. Latina and Hispanic women are often \\"concentrated in low-paying, semiskilled occupations in contrast to the overall workforce. Their limited finances and proficiencies create barriers for women trying to escape abuse and obtain legal assistance\\". The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was implemented to protect women against men's violence. Communities of color that are referred to as the \\"tribal land\\" were disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system. However, cases of violence against indigenous women living on tribal land in the U.S. was often ignored or unnoticed because the closest federal police station would be far away and there were not enough resources to send officers. As a result, men who were U.S. citizens would specifically target women and girls on tribal land because those men knew it would be almost impossible for them to be prosecuted. In these situations, VAWA failed to protect women living on tribal land. However, in 2013 a renewal was passed that addressed these issues, although many say that there needs to be further legislation.  Patriarchy  In Patriarchy, the System, Allan G. Johnson defines the term \\"patriarchy\\" as a set of symbols and ideas that make up a culture embodied by everything from the content of everyday conversation to literature and film. Johnson continues by discussing how the patriarchy regulates the way social life is expected to be and what it is about: it is male-centered, male- identified and male-dominated. Women of color are the majority of those who are oppressed by this system. Johnson notes that we all participate in the system and will always be a part of it. We can only control how we participate in the patriarchy. The common picture of someone with power is a white, heterosexual male. The structure of the patriarchy exists in the unequal distributions of power, opportunities, resources, and rewards. This is what makes male dominance possible. When we assess the social norms around us, the involvement of the patriarchy becomes clear. Johnson gives excellent examples: the standards of feminine beauty and masculine toughness, the media portrayal of feminine vulnerability and masculine protectiveness, acceptance of older men involved with younger women and elderly women alone, a career as primary for a husband, childcare being a priority for women and secondary for men, defining men and women as opposites, the acceptance of male aggression as natural but not for women, and the devaluing of femininity and being female. Although all women are affected, women of color suffer more than anyone else within this system.  In business  According to numerous studies, women of color encounter different experiences in business and the work force than Caucasian women. A study by Boyd suggests that when looking for jobs, women of color have less chance of acquiring a job than other groups. Furthermore, finding a job is even more difficult for women of color when there are fewer jobs available or when the economy is not doing well. For example, during The Great Depression, a time of immense economic struggle in the United States, vast numbers of black women were dismissed from their jobs at proportionally higher rate than white women. This in turn affected the families and livelihoods of the women of color as income become harder to obtain. The lack of availability of jobs and discrimination against these women forced them into unemployment in greater numbers than men of color. But, when the resources and opportunities are present, women of color have found solace in building their own businesses and becoming entrepreneurs. However, Loscocco and Robinson claim that when women of color open their small businesses, their chances of success are much slimmer than for men. People usually open their own businesses after losing their jobs or as a result of annoyance with their prior professional positions in which they could have encountered discrimination, sexual harassment, and other disturbances. There has been an increase in the number of women pursuing self-employment within businesses of their own in recent decades. But, although having similar motives and displaying comparable skill sets as men, women have had less success within their businesses. Women are also subjected to opening a business within a limited number of fields and cannot usually venture into areas deemed as more masculine such as construction or carpentry, where they face the risk of failure. In their study of women's business ventures, Loscocco and Robinson note that \\"while gender segregation explains a large part of women's disadvantage, as expected, we find that U.S. women fare less well even when they operate businesses in the same industry categories and subcategories as men.\\" Accordingly, women of color have had an even higher incidence of failure within their businesses. Mora and Davila find that \\"minority- and female-owned new firms thus had a higher risk of closing down within one year than those owned by non-Hispanic white men; being a female entrepreneur of color exacerbated this risk.\\" Women of color confront even more challenges because they face both gender and race discrimination. Bell finds that \\"racism and sexism are forces that serve to heighten black women's psychological anxiety. Due to the contemporary socio-psychological forces and the historical legacy of slavery, it is extremely complicated for black women to separate the subtleties of sexism and racism.\\" Women of color are thus confronted with the difficulties that their gender and races bring them and are often questioned of their abilities because of those attributes. Consequently, the intersectionality of the identities of women of color plays a grand role in their presence in business and the workforce. In her study, Adia Harvey observes that \\"the intersection of race, gender, and class often leaves minority women with limited occupational opportunities (Ammott and Matthei 1997; Browne 1999; Browne and Misra 2003; England 1992; Higginbotham and Romero 1997). Minority women, particularly African American women, are disproportionately concentrated in the service industry as cooks, janitors, and cashiers (Hesse-Biber and Carter 2000). Institutional discrimination, widespread acceptance of stereotypes, glass ceilings, and poverty are all structural causes that lead to the occupational segregation of working-class black women (Browne and Kennelly 1999; Browne 1999). The dual influence of race and gender means that African American women generally trail black men, white women, and white men in earnings, prestige, and power in the workplace. Many studies draw attention to the institutionalized racial- and gender-based barriers in the labor force that shape black women's occupational patterns and experiences. Browne and Kennelly (1999) argue that stereotypes of black women as irresponsible single mothers can cloud employers' treatment of black women workers. Similarly, St. Jean and Feagin (1998) assert that while some employers view black women as less threatening than black men, this does not translate into a perception that black women are competent, professional, adept workers. Instead, they must prove their capabilities repeatedly and are routinely subjected to racist and sexist hostilities, lack of mentoring opportunities, and discriminatory treatment in the workplace. Still other researchers argue that black women workers are likely to experience feelings of marginalization, dissonance, and alienation in predominantly white male workplaces (Alfred 1999; Bell and Nokomo 2001; Bonner 2004).\\"  References  Anti-racism Feminism and history Intersectional feminism Multicultural feminism Race and society Person of color Social groups Sociological terminology Womanism Women Women of African descent ","title":"Women of color"},{"id":"2961180","text":"The Paulinskill (also known as Lake Paulinskill or Paulinskill River) is a tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. With a long-term median flow rate of 76 cubic feet of water per second (2.15 m¬≥/s), it is New Jersey's third-largest contributor to the Delaware River, behind the Musconetcong River and Maurice River.USGS National Water Information System: Web Interface - Real-Time Data for New Jersey: Streamflow no further authorship information given, accessed October 30, 2006. The Paulinskill drains an area of across portions of Sussex and Warren counties and 11 municipalities. The Paulinskill flows north from its source near Newton, and then turns southwest. The river sits in the Ridge and Valley geophysical province. The Paulinskill was a conduit for the emigration of Palatine Germans who settled in northwestern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania during the colonial period and the American Revolution. Remnants of their chiefly agricultural settlements are still found in local architecture, cemeteries, farms and mills, and the area remains largely rural. Flowing through rural sections of Sussex and Warren counties, the Paulinskill is regarded as an excellent place for fly fishing. The surrounding area is used for hiking and other forms of recreation such as observing birds and other wildlife. Course The main branch of the Paulinskill begins to form immediately north of Newton, in the marshes that straddle the town. The headwaters start near Route 622 in Fredon Township. The Paulinskill flows southwest for the rest of its journey, through Hampton and Stillwater townships in Sussex County. Trout Brook, which rises on Kittatinny Mountain, flows into the Paulinskill near Middleville in Stillwater Township. Swartswood Lake feeds Trout Brook through Keen's Mill Brook. The Paulinskill continues its course southwest, entering Warren County, where it initially forms the border between Frelinghuysen and Hardwick townships. It enters Blairstown immediately after, where it is joined by Blair Creek, named (as is the town) for John Insley Blair (1802‚Äì1899), as well as Jacksonburg Creek, Susquehanna Creek, Dilts Creek and Walnut Creek. Yards Creek, which rises at the Yards Creek reservoir in Blairstown, enters the Paulins Kill near the hamlet of Hainesburg in Knowlton Township. Finally, in Warren County its waters enter the Delaware River just south of the Delaware Water Gap at the hamlet of Columbia in Knowlton Township. After the establishment of Swartswood State Park in 1914, a dam was built in the 1920s across the Paulinskill in Stillwater Township to create Paulinskill Lake. Summer cottages were built to attract vacationers from nearby New York City. Today, Paulinskill Lake is a private, year-round residential community with over 500 homes. Watershed The Paulinskill drains a portion of the Kittatinny Valley watershed. Kittatinny Valley is bordered to the northwest by the Kittatinny Ridge segment of the Ridge and Valley Appalachian Mountains, and to the southeast by the New Jersey Highlands. High Point, near the northeastern end of the ridge, is the highest peak in New Jersey, reaching an elevation of . The lower southern and eastern portions of the valley are drained by the Paulinskill and the Pequest River, which flow generally south to the Delaware River watershed. The upper northwestern area is drained by the Big Flatbrook River to the Delaware River watershed in the south. The Wallkill River drains the northeastern portion of the valley, flowing north to the Hudson River watershed.  History  = Origins of the name = A vintage postcard view of the Paulins Kill at Baleville, in Hampton Township, New Jersey, circa 1905. The Paulins Kill is a calm, slow-flowing river, without significant disturbance or rapids, and looks much like this view for all of its length. The U.S. Geological Survey Board of Geographic Names decided that the official spelling of the name would be Paulins Kill in 1898. Other spellings (Pawlins Kill or Paulinskill) have remained in common use. Kill is a Dutch word for \\"stream\\".\\"A fishy name will stay the same\\" by Mary Ann McRae (September 6, 1996), CNN. Local tradition says that the Paulins Kill was named for a girl named Pauline, the daughter of a Hessian soldier. During the American Revolution, Hessian soldiers captured at the Battle of Trenton and other skirmishes within New Jersey were held as prisoners of war in the Stillwater area. Several of these Hessians are alleged to have deserted the British and taken up residence in Stillwater because of the village's predominantly German emigrant population. The assumption is that the name Paulins Kill was derived from \\"Pauline's Kill\\".Northwestern New Jersey‚ÄîA History of Somerset, Morris, Hunterdon, Warren, and Sussex Counties, Vol. 1. (A.

(1881) History of Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey, With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers. (Philadelphia: Everts & Peck, 1881), 379. However, the fact that the name Paulins Kill is present on maps and surveys dating from the 1740s and 1750s‚Äîtwo and three decades before the Revolution‚Äînegates the veracity of this tradition.Labelled \\"Tockhockonetkunk or Pawlings Kill\\" on an untitled map of Jonathan Hampton (1758) in the collection of the New Jersey Historical Society, Newark, New Jersey; also Documents Relating to the Colonial, Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary History of the State of New Jersey. [Title Varies]. Archives of the State of New Jersey, 1st‚Äì2nd series. 47 volumes. Newark, New Jersey, 1880‚Äì1949, passim. Two other possibilities for the naming of the Paulins Kill are more likely. First, that the wife of one of the area's first settlers, Johan Peter Bernhardt (died 1748), was named Maria Paulina and that she had died prior to the first settlement at Stillwater in 1742. However, very few records are extant detailing Bernhardt's family. The second and most likely etymological origin is that the Native American name given to the mountain on the valley's western flank, Pahaqualong (also spelled Pahaqualin, Pohoqualin and Pahaquarra) may have been corrupted and anglicized to a spelling such as \\"Paulins\\" by early white settlers or surveyors. Pahaqualong is roughly translated as \\"end of two mountains with stream between\\", from a combination of the words pe‚Äôuck meaning \\"water hole,\\" qua meaning \\"boundary,\\" and the suffix -onk meaning \\"place.\\"Decker, Amelia Stickney, That Ancient Trail (Trenton, New Jersey: Privately printed, 1942), 151Anthony and Brinton, op. cit. This translation is thought to refer either to the valley of the Paulins Kill itself, or to the Delaware Water Gap. Local tradition does place an Indian village named Pahaquarra near the mouth of the Paulinskill which is immediately south of the Delaware Water Gap. Likewise, the former Pahaquarry Township in Warren County derived its name from this origin.Snell, op. cit., 23 A village named Paulina located a short distance east of Blairstown on Route 94, is said to have been named \\"from the stream upon which it is located.\\" William Armstrong, a local settler, built the first grist mill there along the river in 1768, and the village took root.Snell, op. cit., 688. The Paulins Kill was originally known as the Tockhockonetcong by the local Native Americans, who were likely Munsee, a tribe or phratry of the Lenni Lenape. The name Tockhockonetcong (or Tockhockonetcunk) roughly translates to \\"stream that comes from Tok-Hok-Nok\\"‚ÄîTok-hok-nok being an Indian village believed to have been within the boundaries of present-day Newton, New Jersey, near which the eastern (main) branch of the Paulins Kill begins, and the Lenape roots hannek meaning \\"stream\\" and the suffix -ong denoting \\"place\\".Anthony, A. S., Rev. and Brinton, Daniel G. Lenape-English Dictionary. (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1883). = Early settlement = The first human settlement along the Paulins Kill was by early Native Americans circa 8,000‚Äì10,000 BC at the close of the last ice age (known as the Wisconsin glaciation). At the time of the first settlement by emigrating Europeans in this region, it was populated by the Munsee tribe of the Lenni Lenape (or Delaware) Indians. Artifacts (often of stone, clay or bone) of the Native American culture are often found in nearby farm fields and at the site of their ancient villages.Schrabisch, Max.

(Trenton, N.J., MacCrellish and Quigley co., state printers, 1917). Typically, early European settlement along the Paulins Kill was by Palatine Germans who had emigrated to the New World via the port of Philadelphia from 1720 to 1800. Many had trekked north through the valley of the Delaware and settled along the Musconetcong, Pequest and Paulins Kill valleys in New Jersey and along the Lehigh River valley in Pennsylvania. Areas along the Paulins Kill generally were not settled until the 1740s and 1750s.Chambers, Theodore Frelinghuysen. The early Germans of New Jersey: Their History, Churches, and Genealogies. (Dover, New Jersey, Dover Printing Company, 1895), passim. Often villages established and settled by German emigrants remained culturally German well into the Nineteenth Century, with German Lutheran and Reformed churches (often as \\"Union\\" churches) established shortly after the first settlements (as was the case in Knowlton and in Stillwater). However, by the early Nineteenth Century, many descendants of these German settlers removed to newly opened lands in the West (i.e. Ohio, the Northwest Territory, the Southern Tier of New York) and those that remained had assimilated into English-speaking culture, and the German Reformed or Lutheran Churches often became Presbyterian.Schaeffer, Casper, M.D. and Johnson, William M.

The German cultural impact of this community can still be seen in local architecture‚Äîmost notably in barns and in stone houses‚Äîand in cemeteries containing intricately carved gravestones often bearing archaic German text and funerary symbols.Viet, Richard F. \\"John Solomon Teetzel and the Anglo-German Gravestone Carving Tradition of 18th century Northwestern New Jersey\\" in Markers XVII (Richard E. Meyer, ed.), Journal of the Association for Gravestone Studies, XVII: 124‚Äì161 (2000). English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers located in the Paulins Kill valley throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century, often traveled north from Philadelphia, or west from Long Island, Newark, and Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth).Schaeffer, Casper, M.D. and Johnson, William M.

The area around present-day Stillwater was first settled by the family of Casper Shafer (1712‚Äì1784), a Palatine German who had emigrated to Philadelphia a few years earlier. Shafer, with his father-in-law, Johan Peter Bernhardt (?‚Äì1748), and his brother-in-law Johann Georg Windemuth (or John George Wintermute) (1711‚Äì1782), settled at Stillwater in 1742. Both Shafer and Windemuth were married to Bernhardt's daughters.Wintermute, Jacob Perry. Wintermute Family History. (Columbus, Ohio: Champlin Press, 1900)Wintermute, Leonard. Windemuth Family Heritage. (Baltimore, Maryland: Gateway Press, 1996). Shafer, who operated a grist mill at Stillwater starting in 1746, transported flour, fruit, and other products by flatboat down the Paulins Kill and the Delaware River to the market in Philadelphia. Most of the New Jersey shoreline and cities such as Elizabethtown and Newark were practically unknown to the German settlers along the Paulins Kill who learned of the existence of these cities only through trade with the local Lenni Lenape.Schaeffer and Johnson. op. cit., 33. The first road connecting Elizabethtown, and Morristown with settlements along the Delaware River, was the Military Road built by Jonathan Hampton (1711‚Äì1777) in 1755‚Äì1756.Military Trail at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area website, no further authorship information given, accessed October 29, 2006. This road, which crosses the Paulins Kill at present-day Baleville, in Hampton Township, was built to supply fortifications built in the Delaware valley at this time to protect New Jersey during the French and Indian War. Very few passable, large roads were built in this section of New Jersey, then largely a sparsely populated wilderness, before the creation of turnpike companies in the early decades of the Nineteenth Century. During much of the mid-eighteenth century, trade in the northwestern reaches of New Jersey was conducted through Philadelphia by way of the Delaware River.Schaeffer and Johnson, loc. cit. About the year 1760, Mark Thomson (1739‚Äì1803) settled in Hardwick Township (now Frelinghuysen Township) and erected a gristmill and sawmill on the Paulins Kill. The settlement that arose was later named Marksboro in his honour. Thomson, who removed to Changewater in Hunterdon County, became an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, and served two terms in the House of Representatives. = Commercial and industrial impact = The Paulinskill or Hainesburg Viaduct, built 1908 to 1911, carried the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad across the Paulins Kill Valley on the Lackawanna Cut-Off Chiefly a pastoral river in a largely undeveloped area of New Jersey, the Paulins Kill has remained generally unaffected by industrial pollution. Dams were erected to power various small-town gristmills, sawmills, oil expellers, and fulling mills, and the electrical power plant at Branchville established in 1903. Columbia, a hamlet near the mouth of the Paulins Kill in Knowlton Township, was known for a large glass manufacturing factory. In recent decades, the dams have been breached or no longer impede the flow of the river.Branchville, New Jersey - History, no further authorship information given, accessed October 29, 2006. Still, pollution reaches the Paulins Kill from nearby residential developments and farm run-off containing agricultural pesticides and fertilizers. Several farms along the banks of the Paulins Kill produce alfalfa, wheat, corn, hay (and historically, barley, buckwheat and rye). Fruit trees in orchards produce cherries, apples, plums, peaches and pears, while native wild grape vines, and blackberry bushes are also found in the valley. New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection occasionally brings civil actions against local firms that pollute in the Paulins Kill watershed, such as a $121,500 fine for a Sussex County shopping mall sewage treatment facility which discharged pollutants into a tributary of the Paulins Kill between 1996 and 1998.NJ DEP Attains Settlement Over Water Pollution Violations affecting Paulinskill River (Press Release) at NJDEP website, no further authorship information given, accessed October 29, 2006.

Begun in 1908, this bridge was deemed an engineering marvel for its use of reinforced concrete. Spanning 1,100 feet (335 m) across the Paulins Kill Valley, the Viaduct rises 115 feet (35 m) above the valley floor, and opened for rail traffic in 1911.Cunningham, John T.

After the New York, Susquehanna and Western decommissioned the route in 1962, the right-of-way along this corridor was purchased by the City of Newark the following year. Newark hoped to use the bed for a water pipeline connecting to the proposed dam and reservoir project on the Delaware River. However, this project‚Äîcontroversial from the start because of environmental concerns and the federal government's abuse of eminent domain‚Äîwas canceled during the 1970s. Newark sold their claim to the corridor in 1992 to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for $600,000, and the Paulinskill Valley Trail was created.Paulinskill Valley Trail at Rails-to-Trail Conservancy, no further authorship information given, accessed August 24, 2006.

At the same time, Breuer‚Äôs theoretical essay, with its examination of the principle of constancy, and its differentiation of bound and mobile cathexis,Sigmund Freud: On Metapsychology, PFL 11), p. 277 and p. 298. would continue to inform Freud‚Äôs thinking as late as the twenties and the writing of Beyond the Pleasure Principle. At the time of its release, Studies on Hysteria tended to polarise opinion, both within and outside by the medical community.Ernest Jones, The life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 223-4 While many were critical, Havelock Ellis offered an appreciative account, while a leading Viennese paper would characterise the work as ‚Äúthe kind of psychology used by poets‚Äù.Ernest Jones, The life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 224 Studies on Hysteria received a positive review from psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, although Bleuler nevertheless suggested that the results Freud and Breuer reported could have been the result of suggestion. The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani comment that Studies on Hysteria gave Freud, \\"a certain local and international notoriety\\". Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani write that, contrary to what Freud and Breuer claimed, Freud \\"always knew that the treatment of Bertha Pappenheim...had not been an unmitigated success\\".

Early life Jean-Philippe Charbonnier was born in Paris into a family of artists and intellectuals. His mother, Annette Vaillant was a writer and daughter of Alfred NatansonWho, incidentally, taught Vuillard photography; Guy Cogeval (2003) E. Vuillard Yale University Press a.k.a. Alfred Athis, a founder of the Revue Blanche, and actress Martha Mellot; his father, Pierre Charbonnier, was a painter, and as a boy, Jean-Philippe met Max Ernst, Pierre Bonnard and the photographer Jacques- Henri Lartigue. His parents separated and he was brought up by his stepfather, Gustave Moutet. At the Lyc√©e Condorcet in Paris he studied philosophy, English and German, but at 18, Jean-Philippe received a camera from his father who encouraged him to become a photographer, and he discontinued his studies to work in the movie star portrait studio of Sam L√©vin ('discoverer' of Brigitte Bardot). He left his hometown to follow L√©vin to Lyon, Marseille and Toulon, then went into exile for two years in neutral Switzerland early in the Second World War, where he met with Jean Manevy who instructed him in the art of typography and journalism. Photojournalism On return to France in 1944, Charbonnier worked for Th√©odore (Th√©o) Blanc (1891‚Äì1985) and Antoine (Tony) Demilly (1892‚Äì1964) in their darkrooms in Lyon, where he learnt how to print. At the end of the war he photographed, in the village of Vienne, near Grenoble, the execution of a Nazi collaborator in front of a crowd of five thousand people.\\"Impressive proof of [Charbonnier's] skill early in his career is shown by his coverage of a public execution during the World War II period. He shot the entire story in only 30 frames‚Äîpossibly because film was scarce then. The drama had a beginning (marching in of the firing squad), a middle (complete with coup de grace), and an end (carting away the corpse in a coffin)‚Äîall this before a large crowd of French citizens. Charbonnier's work bears the trademark of all great photojournalists- superb technique matched with an observant eye. His early work involved indoor flash with extensions, a style it was then obligatory to master. Versatile on location, he covered assignments from the Folies Berg√®re to the desert and Arctic.\\" Popular Photography, Feb 1984, Vol. 91, No. 2. p.52. ISSN 1542-0337 In the late 40s, he became the chief typesetter for Liberation, and later France Dimanche. He also wrote for Point de Vue, where for the first time his photographs were published, in 1949, by editor Albert Plecy (1914-1977). In 1950, he was appointed reporter for the magazine R√©alit√©s,Mondenard, Anne de & Guerrin, Michel & Maison europ√©enne de la photographie (Paris, France) (2008).

In 1951 he was photographing the Tuaregs in North Africa; in 1954, shoeshine boys in Brazil; as early as 1955 he visited China and then Outer Mongolia, where he was the first Western photographer given a licence to work; then in Moscow during the Cold War; as well as Kuwait, where he made one of his best remembered pictures, of a veiled Kuwaiti woman carrying a sewing machine on her head; the former French Equatorial Africa, where he photographed Albert Schweitzer (and his pelican) in Gabon; and Alaska.\\"Jean-Philippe Charbonnier.\\" The Times: 46.

Charbonnier decided to leave the magazine Realities in 1974 to concentrate on his Paris neighborhood of Notre- Dame de Paris and produced extended essays on that precinct. Commercial photography In the 1960s, with television beginning to replace the glossy magazines, Charbonnier turned increasingly to commercial photography, working for large companies such as Carrefour and Renault, freelancing for the Ministry of Labour and the World Health Organisation and also in the fashion industry, photographing Pierre Cardin, his fashions and models, from 1958. He taught photography in Paris at the Ecole Sup√©rieure des Arts Graphiques and also in England. Recognition and legacy Today Charbonnier's photographs are historical documents showing us the transformation of French society between 1945 and 2004. In 1970, at the invitation of writer Michel Tournier, Charbonnier participated in the first Rencontres d'Arles as a guest of honor, and was included in first public evening meeting of three important 'Photographers of the Moment', with Brihat Denis and Jean-Pierre Sudre.

Charbonnier died, of a disease contracted during his travels, in Grasse on May 28, 2004, in the same year as Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom he regarded as '...a formidable \\"statue\\"...THE Living National Treasure at its best...''In Henri, a booklet edited by Brigitte Ollier and published by Filigranes in 2003, Charbonnier remembered his first meeting with Cartier-Bresson (pp. 16-17); \\"'The Monument' [...] I think I met him by chance at Pierre Gassman's Picto, rue de la Comete, or maybe rue Delambre [...] We were doing the same job, we had the same lab to get our rolls processed, but we did not have the same stripes on our sleeves. [...] I can see him going for the first time over the contact sheets of a series he had just shot. Here comes Pierre who stops and stands behind him. \\"Get the hell out of here!\\" said Henri. There was an attitude that matched the character, he wanted to be the first one to look at his contact sheets. Every photographer behaves this way, one does not just get master pieces out of 36 exposures, and one does not have to advertise one's hesitations and errors. Later we exchanged two photographs. He is a formidable \\"statue\\", Henri, even if I regret that he should be so stiff.

Located twelve kilometers north of Nazareth near the Arab town of Shefaram, it falls under the jurisdiction of Jezreel Valley Regional Council. In it had a population of . Etymology The biblical name Hanaton () appears in the Book of Joshua (19:14), where it is listed as in the area of the tribe of Zevulun, forming the border with the tribe of Asher's area. Archaeology Tel Hanaton, an archaeological site associated with the biblical location lies to the east of the kibbutz. The tel is in the western end of the Beit Netofa Valley, and covers an area of roughly 100 dunam (25 acres). It was occupied from the Bronze Age through the Ottoman Empire. General view of Tel Hanaton Geography Kibbutz Hanaton overlooks Lake Eshkol, an important component of the National Water Carrier (Lake Eshkol is a 4.5 million m3 reservoir which Hanaton overlooks at the end of the Beit Netofa Canal). To the north of the kibbutz is the Arab village of Kafr Manda. Southwest of the kibbutz, across highway 79, lies Alon HaGalil. History In the 1980s, inspired by the Reform movement's first kibbutz, Yahel, a group of students affiliated with the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City decided to establish a kibbutz for adherents of Conservative Judaism. Gar'in Nitzan recruited members from across the United States and joined forces with the Israeli branch, the Masorti Movement. In Israel, they hired rabbi Ehud Bandel to organize high school seniors interested in joining a Nahal gar'in. On 1 September 1983, Gar'in Noam (30 members, aged 18‚Äì19) moved to Kfar HaHoresh for training. They were joined by Gar'in Nitzan (40 members, aged 19‚Äì35, including several families with small children). In September 1984, the founders moved into the new kibbutz, which was named for a biblical town that existed in the area and is mentioned in the Book of Joshua. The founders were later joined by immigrants from South Africa, South America, the Netherlands, and Canada. In 1997 the United Kibbutz Movement began to send HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed groups to the kibbutz, but they have not been accepted as full- fledged members for ideological reasons. In 2006, in the wake of financial difficulties, attorney Sagi Mirom was appointed as a dissolution trustee. Under his stewardship the annual deficit of 80,000 NIS (about $22,000 US at the time) was reversed, and the kibbutz recovered economically. In 2008, it was decided to recharter Hanaton as a \\"renewed kibbutz\\" (). Since March 2011, the kibbutz has been accepting new members and new housing units are under construction. Economy Kibbutz Hanaton dairy herd In its early years, the kibbutz engaged in agriculture. A small crafts business, Hadran, manufactures rug kits. The kibbutz operates a dairy in partnership with Kibbutz Gat and a state-of-the-art chicken coop where chicken and turkey hatchlings are raised in a controlled, computerized environment. It grows greenhouse tomatoes, table grapes and grapefruits. A primary source of income is the Education & Lodging Center that provides lodging and workshops for Conservative Jewish youth groups from North America.

The station is at street level, on Station Approach, Pontyclun. It is a stop on the South Wales Main Line, served by trains on the Maesteg Line, and occasionally by the Swanline Cardiff to Swansea regional services, as well as one early-morning daily service to Manchester and a late-night daily service to Carmarthen. The station and all trains are operated by Transport for Wales Rail. The station was rebuilt and reopened under British Rail as Pontyclun on 28 September 1992. It was previously called Llantrisant station and was originally two separate railway stations that were merged in 1925, those originally belonging to the South Wales Railway and the Cowbridge Railway, whose successors, the Great Western Railway and the Taff Vale Railway respectively, had amalgamated in 1922. History A 1903 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (left) railways in the vicinity of Pontyclun (shown here as LLANTRISANT). GWR in yellow; TVR in green. The first section of the South Wales Railway (SWR), that between and , opened on 18 June 1850. The original stations on that line included one named Llantrissant for Cowbridge. The station became a junction with the opening of the first section of the Ely Valley Railway (EVR) to on 2 August 1860, although passenger services along that line did not begin until 1 August 1865. The EVR opened a branch to Brofiskin Colliery in 1862, and another railway, the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway, which opened in December 1863, intended to use part of that branch to gain access to Llantrisant via a connection at Maesaraul Junction, but in order to do this, the Brofiskin branch had to be altered to mixed gauge - this occurred in December 1864. The station name was simplified to Llantrissant , by which time the SWR had amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863. Adjacent to this station was the terminus of the Cowbridge Railway, which opened on 18 September 1865, originally being named Llantrissant. The Cowbridge Railway was leased by the Taff Vale Railway (TVR) in 1876, and absorbed by that concern in 1889. Both the GWR and TVR stations had their names amended to Llantrisant by 1902. The TVR in its turn amalgamated with the GWR on 1 January 1922, and on 21 September 1925 their respective stations were merged as a single station. The former Llantrisant station in 1962 Llantrisant was a major intermediate station on the South Wales Main Line. It consisted of two central through platforms and bays for the Ely Valley line, the Llantrisant & Taff Vale Junction line and the branch to Cowbridge and Aberthaw. The station was closed on 2 November 1964. Under the auspices of Regional Railways sector of British Rail and Mid Glamorgan the station was reopened. The station was rebuilt and reopened as Pontyclun on 28 September 1992. Extensive sidings existed around the station for the coal and mineral traffic generated by the mines in the area. At least the line to Cwm Colliery was in regular use until 1984. Cwm Colliery branch line A single track railway runs north from Pontyclun station - the remnants of the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway. The track turns east at Talbot Green to run roughly parallel to the Afon Clun, alongside the north of the A473, which runs between Pontypridd and Bridgend. At Cross Inn the track turns north east, running south of Llantrisant and north of Caerau Hillfort, an Iron Age enclosure. Originally, it ran to the Cwm Coking Works at Tynant, Beddau, just past the former station Llantwit Fardre, although the track has been totally dismantled and the trackbed is now a cycle path that currently terminates at Westfield Crescent, Cross Inn. None of the original railway paraphernalia remains intact between Talbot Green and Pontyclun, apart from a footbridge with cages above the former track (to prevent people throwing things (or themselves) onto the trains, tracks or coal wagons) that crosses the A473 where it meets the A4222 near Leekes. The track remains embedded in the road where it crosses the A473, and warning lights were at the roadside and road signs warned drivers to stop if they saw warning lights flash at the level crossing but these were removed during construction of the cycle path. A consultative study in 2006 (Sewta Rail Strategy Study) considered the possibility of reopening the Pontyclun to Beddau branch line, as a passenger line rather than just for freight. This would require new stations at Talbot Green, Llantrisant, Gwaun Meisgyn and Beddau (Tynant).

VGT and French Belgian Sign Language are very closely related, but now generally recognized as distinct languages. VGT is estimated to include around 6,000 sign-language users (Loots et al., 2003). History When the first deaf schools were established in Flanders, the teachers were directly or indirectly influenced by the methods used at the Paris deaf school (and consequently by French Sign Language). They either followed training programs in Paris or in two deaf schools in the Netherlands (Groningen and Sint-Michielsgestel), which were themselves influenced by the Paris school. As with other neighbouring countries, the education of deaf children was strongly influenced by the resolutions that took place at the Milan Conference in 1880. These resolutions banned the use of signs in the education of deaf children in favour of an oral approach. It has been viewed as a dark day in the history of sign language. By the beginning of the 20th century, there was a deaf school in every major town in Flanders. Some towns even had two: one for boys and one for girls. Most of the schools were residential and pupils only went home during the holidays, and later on also during the weekends. As a result, regional sign language varieties started to develop around every school. Regional variation It is now generally accepted and confirmed by research that Flemish Sign Language consists of five regional varieties. They have developed in and around the different Flemish deaf schools: West Flanders, East Flanders, Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, and Limburg (De Weerdt et al., 2003). Besides the differences between regions, there is also intra-regional variation. Until the 1970s, there were separate schools for deaf boys and girls, which has led to gender variation. Some signs which are commonly used today were boys‚Äô or girls‚Äô signs in origin. There are more reasons for the relatively high degree of intra-regional variation. At the moment there is no standardized sign language in Flanders. There is however an ongoing process of spontaneous standardization (mostly due to increased contact between deaf people from different regions). Federalization Another important aspect influencing the language is the federalization process which has taken place in Belgium along ethnic lines as Flemish or Walloon. Today, every Belgian belongs to a certain linguistic group and the same goes for deaf people. Ironically they are also considered Flemish or Walloon, part of the linguistic majority of speakers of Dutch or French, despite the sign language they use and the linguistic minority to which they belong. The federalization occurred in 1993, which was the result of a long process. In the 1970s, the national deaf federation, NAVEKADOS, split up into a Flemish and a Walloon federation. Fevlado (Federatie van Vlaamse Dovenorganisaties or the \\"Association of Flemish Deaf Organizations\\") was founded in 1977. Cultural activities have been organized separately since then, and the Flemish and the Walloon deaf clubs have been subsidized from different sources. Contacts between Flemish and Walloon deaf people have become less and less frequent. This affected the sign languages' development in both communities, which are becoming more divergent as they go through separate standardization processes. Therefore, the name for the sign language has changed over time. \\"Belgian Sign Language\\" became \\"Flemish-Belgian Sign Language\\", which later became the now preferred \\"Flemish Sign Language\\" on the Flemish side. On the Wallonian side, \\"French Belgian Sign Language\\" became \\"Walloon Sign Language\\". Legal recognition On 26 April 2006, the Flemish Parliament unanimously recognised the Flemish Sign Language as a language in Flanders.Decreet houdende de erkenning van de Vlaamse Gebarentaal The decree consists of three major parts: ;Recognition :The Flemish Sign Language is recognised as a language in the Flemish Community, including the Brussels- Capital Region. ;Advisory committee :An advisory committee on the Flemish Sign Language is instated, with a maximum of fifteen members, half of which have to be deaf. Advise can be requested by the Flemish Government or the Flemish Parliament, but the committee can also formulate advises autonomously. ;Knowledge and information centre :The decree arranges the recognition of a knowledge and information centre which has to: coordinate and stimulate linguistic research, support the further development of VGT, develop educational tools for use in teaching VGT and be the first point of contact. Usage Since December 2012, the VRT news broadcast is available in the Flemish Sign Language.Het journaal: Vlaamse Gebarentaal The Flemish Parliament had sign language interpreters for the parliamentary debates while Helga Stevens, who is deaf, was member of the parliament.

The DPG's worldwide membership is cited as 60,547, as of 2019, making it the largest physics society in the world. It holds an annual conference () and multiple spring conferences (), which are held at various locations and along topical subjects of given sections of the DPG.Circa 1918 its membership was about 750 and in the 1930s about 1400. See Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A. The DPG serves the fields of pure and applied physics. Main aims are to bring its members and all physicists living in Germany closer together, represent their entirety outwards as well as foster the exchange of ideas between its members and foreign colleagues. The DPG binds itself and its members to advocate for freedom, tolerance, veracity and dignity in science and to be aware about the fact that the people working in science are responsible to a particularly high extent for the configuration of the overall human activity. Conferences and fostering young talent The DPG itself does not carry out any research, but its conferences promote the sharing of information about the latest findings in the field of physics. The traditional spring meetings held by the DPG each year at venues across the country are among largest physics conferences in Europe, attended by around 10,000 experts from Germany and abroad.Physik Journal 09/2011 S.99 ff ‚Äì DPG Annual Report 2010 Fostering young talent is another central concern of the DPG : its conferences provide a platform particularly for younger scientists. The conferences provide students with opportunities to meet renowned scientists in person. The DPG also runs a nationwide network for physics students in the working group Young DPG. Female physicists have a forum of their own in the annual German Conference of Women in Physics. Awards and school projects The DPG honours outstanding achievements in physics with awards of international repute. The highest awards which are presented by the DPG are the Max Planck Medal for work in theoretical physics, first awarded in 1929, and the Stern‚ÄìGerlach Medal for work in experimental physics, first awarded in 1933. Some awards, such as the Gustav Hertz Prize for Young Physicists, intend to foster young talent. Others are awarded by the DPG in cooperation with other organisations in Germany and abroad, such as the Max Born Medal and Prize or the Otto Hahn Prize. The Medal for Natural Science Journalism is awarded by the DPG to personalities who have made a special contribution to bringing scientific facts to the attention of the general public. In addition, the DPG awards prizes to school graduates throughout the country for outstanding achievements in physics.DPG ‚Äì Medals and Prizes It supports competitions for school students such as the (national research contest for young scientists), promotes innovative school projects and organises advanced training courses for teaching staff. = Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics = Since 2002, the (Physics of Socio-Economic Systems Division) recognizes \\"outstanding original contributions that use physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems\\". Awardees are Vittoria Colizza (2013), Arne Traulsen (2012), Santo Fortunato (2011), Dirk Brockmann (2010), Duncan Watts (2009), Fabrizio Lillo (2008), Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron (2007) for the Sznajd model, Xavier Gabaix (2006), Reuven Cohen (2005), Illes Farkas (2004), Vasliki Plerou (2002) and Damien Challet (2002). Publications The DPG produces a range of various publications. The membership journal of the DPG provides news reports from the DPG and about physics in general. Besides, the DPG joins forces with the British Institute of Physics to publish the electronic open access journal New Journal of Physics. The articles published here have gone through a strict peer review in line with the stringent scientific quality standards propounded by the New Journal of Physics. Moreover, the DPG also publishes its conference programme every year under the name (Programme Booklets for DPG Conferences), listing the abstracts of around 8,000 papers. And the web portal www.welt-der- physik.de, operated jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), provides much information about physics even for nonexperts. =Historical publications= Publications of the DPG have included:Jungnickel, Volume 2, 1990, p. 421. See the listing for the German Physical Society.  (continued as ) (continued as European Physical Journal) From the time of its creation in 1845, the DPG published and its , but by 1919, the had become too voluminous, so DPG chairman Arnold Sommerfeld formed a committee consisting of Albert Einstein, Eugen Goldstein, Fritz Haber, E. Jahnke, Karl Scheel, and Wilhelm Westphal, which recommended that a new journal, the , should be established for rapid publication of original research articles by established scientists without peer review; it began publication the following year. In 1975 was merged with Physics of Condensed Matter (). was published as a 4-part journal from 1920‚Äì1997 by Springer-Verlag under the auspices of the DPG. During the early 20th century, it was considered one of the most prestigious journals in physics, with its golden years coinciding with the golden years of quantum mechanics.Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik: A Historical Reminiscence at the EPJ website. It was the vehicle used by those with avant-garde views and the young generation of quantum physicists in the 1920s.Kragh, 1999, pp. 150‚Äì151. Physics and public relations The DPG plays an active role in the dialogue between science and the general public with a range of popular scientific publications, physics outreach, and public events. These activities also include the Highlights of Physics, an annual physics festival organised jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It is the largest festival of its kind in Germany with around 30,000 visitors every year.Home Studies and social commitment The DPG engages in socio-political discussions by releasing press statements, carrying out studies, giving statements and attending parliamentary evenings. It deals with current issues such as fostering young talent, climate protection, energy supply or arms control through to science and cultural history issues. The DPG is very particularly committed to equal opportunities for men and women and to promote women in natural sciences. In Bonn and Berlin The DPG office headed by the Chief Executive Bernhard Nunner is located in the (physics conference centre in Bad Honnef), in the neighbourhood of the university and federal city of Bonn. The is not only a meeting place and discussion forum of outstanding significance for physics in Germany but also an international brand for the discipline of physics. Students and cutting edge scientists through to Nobel Prize winners meet here to share their thoughts and ideas on a scientific level. Teaching staffs also gladly come to Bad Honnef time and again to attend advanced training courses relating to pure physics and the didactic aspects of this discipline, in the seminars held by the DPG. The DPG is also present in Germany's capital Berlin. It has been running the Magnus-Haus in Berlin since its reunification with the Physical Society of East Germany in 1990. This urban palace completed in 1760 ‚Äì bearing the name of the natural scientist Gustav Magnus ‚Äì has close links to the history of the DPG: it was the regular meeting place of scholars during the 19th century that eventually resulted in the Physical Society of Berlin being founded in 1845, which later became the DPG. Today it is a venue for meetings and lectures on physical and socio-political issues. The Magnus-Haus is also home to the DPG's historical archive. Under National Socialism The DPG was in opposition to National Socialism's persecution of the Jews in general, and their promotion of , in particular. On 7 April 1933, barely two months after Adolf Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, was passed; under this law, Jewish civil servants and regime opponents were removed from their jobs. These policies had significant effects on physics in GermanyBeyerchen, 1977, pp. 40‚Äì50.Kragh, 1999, 230‚Äì256. through significant qualitative and quantitative losses of physicists as a result of emigration and through political decisions overriding those based on academic and scientific considerations; 25% of the physicists holding academic positions in the period 1932‚Äì1933 were lost due to the policies.Beyerchen, 1977, p. 200. The losses in the physics community were significantly higher than the losses in the other natural sciences. The opposition can be illustrated by just a few examples, such as the DPG not immediately dismissing Jews after passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Max von Laue's address at the opening of the 1933 physics convention in W√ºrzburg, opposition to Johannes Stark exercising the in attempting to become the dictator of physics, and Carl Ramsauer's opposition to the politicization of education: *When the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed in 1933, the DPG dragged its feet in the dismissal of Jews for more than five years. It was not until the end of 1938, on the initiation of Herbert Stuart and Wilhelm Orthmann, that the DPG asked Jewish members to withdraw their membership.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entry for the DPG.DPG ‚Äì Membership 1938 vs. 1939 *Max von Laue, as chairman of the DPG, gave the opening address at the 1933 physics convention held in W√ºrzburg.

These actions brought opposition from members of the DPG. For example, Max von Laue, in 1933, blocked Stark's regular membership in the .Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Max von Laue. Furthermore, also in 1933, Stark, President of the (PTR),Stark was President of the PTR as of May 1933, and the DPG election was in September of that year. ran for president of the DPG against Karl Mey, the industrial physicist and head of Osram. Stark received only two votes! In retribution, Stark canceled the DPG's use of its rooms in the PTR, deleted PTR travel expenses for its personnel to attend DPG meetings, and forbade PTR personnel from lecturing at DPG meetings.Hoffmann, 2005, pp. 299 and 307. *Carl Ramsauer, president of the DPG 1940 to 1945, and his deputy, Wolfgang Finkelnburg, steered a relatively independent course from the party line of the National Socialists and against , which was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially including modern physics, i.e., quantum mechanics. Early in 1942, as chairman of the DPG, Ramsauer, on Felix Klein's initiative and with the support of Ludwig Prandtl, submitted a petition to Reich Minister Bernhard Rust, at the (Reich Education Ministry).

Reunification After the conclusion of World War II, in 1946, von Laue initiated the founding of the in only the British Zone, as the Allied Control Council would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. The DPG was eventually also reinstituted individually in the American and French sectors. These individually established organizations were united in West Germany in 1950, only after the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 May 1949. It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall that the DPG again fully unified across Germany.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entry on the DPG.

Named in honour of Saint Thomas the Apostle, the Cathedral is located in the historic centre of Mumbai, Horniman Circle, and is close to Flora Fountain and Bombay House. The 300-year-old church is oldest church in Mumbai and is controlled by the Cathedral and John Connon School. The foundation stone of the church was first laid in 1676, although the church was only finally consecrated for divine service 1718 as the first Anglican church in Mumbai (then called Bombay), within the walls of the fortified British settlement. The Cathedral then lead to the creation of the Cathedral & John Connon School in 1860, in order to provide choristers to the church. The cathedral is a landmark in South Mumbai and is one of the oldest churches in India. It is used by the school for its Founder's Day Service on 14 November every year, Carol Service on the last day before the school's Christmas vacation and other special occasions. The Churchgate railway station derives its name from the St. Thomas Cathedral, as the station was linked to the cathedral by a road way leading through one of the three gates of the fortified island city of Mumbai. The walls of the Bombay Fort were demolished in 1862 and the gate leading to the church was replaced by the Flora Fountain in 1864. History thumb thumb The original plan of St. Thomas Church completed in 1718 Zero Point Plaque of Mumbai at the compound of St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai The name of nearby Churchgate station refers to this church. One of the gates in the Fort which the East India Company had built to protect their settlement was the entrance to the St. Thomas Church. It was called Churchgate. That is why the whole area towards the West of the Church is called \\"Churchgate\\" even today. The street leading to the Church was originally called Churchgate Street and was later renamed like many streets in Bombay, and is now known as Veer Nariman Road. The island of Bombay which was a Portuguese possession became a part of the dowry of the Portuguese princess Infanta Catherine of Braganza on her marriage to Charles II of England under the Anglo Portuguese treaty of June 1661. In 1668 King Charles transferred it to the East India Company for a loan of pounds Sterling 50,000 at 6% interest and with a rental of pounds Sterling 10 per annum. Gerald Aungier was placed in charge of the British East India Company's newly acquired factories at Surat and Bombay, which had until then belonged to Portugal. As Governor of Bombay from 1672‚Äî1677, Angier built a church, a hospital, a court of justice and other civic amenities on the English model, and fortified the Company's commercial establishment. The foundation stone for the church was laid in 1676, on Bombay Green, at the present site of the St. Thomas' Cathedral, but over 40 years elapsed before construction could be completed. Richard Cobbe, the Chaplain, completed the construction of the building between 1715 and 1718. It was opened for divine service on Christmas Day 1718, and since then has served continuously as an Anglican place of worship. \\"About Us\\", St. Thomas Cathedral website However in 1816 the church was dedicated to St. Thomas, the apostle, by Thomas Middleton, the first Bishop of Kolkata. The church was consecrated as a cathedral in July 1837 concurrent with the appointment of the first Bishop of Bombay, Thomas Carr. The tower and the clock at the western end were added in 1838. About 25 years later a major renovation scheme was launched to enlarge the chancel. This was completed by 1865. King George V and Queen Mary attend the service at the church in 1911 prior to their departure to the third Delhi Durbar to be held in the Coronation Park, Delhi. They occupied the chairs in the first row and chairs have been preserved till date with name of the king and queen written in brass plates. A beautiful fountain stands at the entrance of the church. It was financed by Parsi entrepreneur and philanthropist Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney. It was designed by George Gilbert Scott and was installed in 1870s. Memorials The Cathedral contains many carved stone memorials from the eras of Company rule in India and the British Raj. Significant among this number: * Memorial to Thomas Carr: Recumbent effigy of Thomas Carr, First Bishop of Bombay by British sculptor Matthew Noble * Memorial to officers and crew of steam ship Cleopatra: Cleopatra was a steam operated wooden paddle sloop that sank of the Malabar coast on 15 April 1847. The ship was transporting 100 convicts from Bombay to Singapore. The ship had a crew of 15i, including 9 officers. The plaque contains the names of te nine officers and mentions about the 142 other crew members, but there is no mention of the 100 odd convicts. * Memorial to Frederick Lewis Maitland: Maitland died on 30 November 1839 whilst at sea on board the Wellesley, off Bombay. He was buried at Bombay. * Memorial to Captain Hardinge: Captain George Nicholas Hardinge was the captyain of San Fiorenzo, which was involved in a small three-day (6-8 March, 1808) but epic naval struggle against the French ship Piedmontaise, off the cost of Colombo, Ceylon. Hardigne died of a grapeshot wound, shortly before the French surrendered. His elaborate memorial was executed by John Bacon. * Memorial to John Campbell: John Campbell was Lieutenant-Colonel of the British army who took an active part in the Siege of Mangalore Fort and subsequent conflict with Tippoo Sultan. He died in Bombay on 23 March 1784 out of exhaustion. The marble memorial consists of life-sized figures of Death and Hope flanking an urn on a tall pedestal. It was designed by Charles Peart. Mumbai Zero Point The cathedral marks colonial Bombay's point zero, the exact centre of the city. From the church 16 mile stones were laid out, leading to the north of the city. The milestone measured 4 feet in height but are submerged by the increasing road level. So far, 11 of the 16 milestones have been located.

It is from . Its three letter station code is PWY. It is managed by Great Western Railway, who provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every hour in each direction between and . The station was opened by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1863 with a single platform, west of the current location, but was resited in 1885 when the line was widened to double track. The station once had large buildings and a goods yard, but these were demolished in the late 20th century, with small brick shelters built in their place. The line through Patchway is due to be electrified by 2018 as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.  Description  Patchway railway station is located in the Patchway area of South Gloucestershire, within the Bristol conurbation. There is a large Rolls-Royce industrial area to the west of the station, while the area to the north and east is primarily residential. To the south is a large amount of railway land, including the Filton Triangle depot. The station is on the South Wales Main Line between and , and just off the Cross Country Route north of and the east end of the Henbury Loop Line. It is from and from via Bristol Parkway.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. The station is just north of Patchway Junctions 1 and 2, where the lines from Bristol Parkway, Filton Abbey Wood and Henbury converge. The next station east is Bristol Parkway, the next station south is Filton Abbey Wood, and the next station west is .Passenger services do not currently use the Henbury Loop Line. The station is on a rough north/south alignment, curving towards the west at the north end. There are two platforms, separated by two running lines and connected by an open footbridge. Platform 1, on the east side of the station and adjacent to the Up Tunnel track, is for trains towards Filton Abbey Wood and Bristol Parkway. Platform 2, on the west side and adjacent to the Down Tunnel track, is for trains towards Pilning. Both platforms are long, and the tracks have a speed limit of . The line through Patchway has a loading gauge of W8, and handles over 15 million train tonnes per year. It is not electrified, though it is planned to be electrified as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line. The main access to the station is from Station Road to the east, however there is also a set of steps and a turnstile into the industrial estate to the west. Facilities at the station are minimal ‚Äì there are small brick shelters on each platform, but no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. A small car park with 15 spaces, and racks for four bicycles, is on the east side of the station on Station Road. CCTV cameras are in operation at the station. Access to the eastern platform is step-free from the car park, however there is no step-free access to trains. The only public access to the western platform is via the stepped footbridge. From 2002 to 2014, annual passenger numbers at Patchway more than quintupled, from 16,898 to 92,540, and the station was noted in 2013 as having a high growth trend. However, these numbers are still fairly low: Patchway is the 1,730th busiest station in Great Britain (of 2,540); and the fifth busiest station in South Gloucestershire, busier only than Pilning. Services Almost all services at Patchway are provided by Great Western Railway, using a mixture of diesel multiple units. Patchway is managed by Great Western Railway, which operates most services from the station. The basic service from Monday to Friday is one train per hour in each direction between and , with some trains extended beyond Taunton to , or . In addition, there is one early morning service to and a late night service to , with similar return workings. There is also an early morning CrossCountry service from Cardiff to via Bristol Temple Meads, and a return working in the evening. On Saturdays there is a similar level of service throughout most of the day, with one train per hour in each direction between Cardiff and Taunton, in addition to the single CrossCountry return service. On Sundays a more limited service operates, with roughly one train every three hours between Cardiff and Westbury, with trains terminating at either Portsmouth Harbour, or . Throughout each day, Great Western Railway services between and South Wales pass through non-stop, two trains per hour in each direction on weekdays, one train per hour at weekends. All trains southbound call next at , and almost every train westbound calls next at . Despite being the next station along the South Wales Main Line, there is only one weekday service which calls at both Patchway and , that being an early morning service from Taunton to Cardiff; and there are only two trains per week which call at both Patchway and . The local services described above are formed using , , and diesel multiple-unit trains. The CrossCountry services are operated using and Voyager diesel-electric multiple units, and the non- stop services between London and Wales use Class 800s. The standard journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is 13 minutes, and to Cardiff Central is 45 minutes. History A boulder marks the site of the original station. Patchway railway station first opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from to , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track broad gauge. Patchway was from Temple Meads, adjacent to the Bristol to Gloucester road, what is now the A38 Gloucester Road. The station was only a small structure, and very little is known about it. There were initially six trains per day on weekdays in each direction, with three trains per day on Sundays. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR), which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to standard gauge. Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so a tunnel was built under the Severn. To cope with the anticipated increase in demand, it was decided that the line should be increased to twin track. However, the gradient between and Patchway, 1 in 68, was considered undesirably steep for trains heading up the hill towards Bristol, particularly for heavy coal trains, and so a three-mile deviation was built with a 1 in 100 gradient between Pilning and a point south of Patchway. Trains uphill towards Bristol would use the new line, while trains downhill towards Wales would continue to use the steeper, original track. The deviation left the two tracks at Patchway at significantly different levels, and so made the original site impractical for a station. The station was rebuilt south along the line at its present site, from Bristol Temple Meads. A boulder and information board marks the site of the original station. The original Patchway railway station was west of the current site. It was abandoned when a new, less steep, track (left) was built for trains from Wales towards Bristol. The new station opened on 10 August 1885, and was originally known as \\"Patchway & Stoke Gifford\\", but reverted to \\"Patchway\\" from 27 October 1908. The station was on a north/south alignment and had two platforms, separated by two running lines, with a third line, a goods loop, behind the western platform. There was a goods yard to the south of the station on the eastern side, with an adjacent signal box. As now, the eastern platform was for trains towards Bristol, the western platform for trains towards Wales. The station buildings were of a standard 1880s GWR design, with tall chimneys and fretted wooden canopies. The main building was on the eastern platform, containing the booking office, toilets, and waiting rooms. A matching brick shelter with canopy was built on the western platform. The eastern platform also had a \\"bicycle house\\" at the northern end. A large covered and glazed footbridge linked the two platforms. The goods yard included two sidings: a short, south-facing one adjacent to a loading dock; and a longer north-facing one. There was also a weigh bridge and a coal office. At the north end of the station was a south-facing siding and an oil store. The station did not have a dedicated approach road as it was adjacent to a road connecting Gloucester Road to the west and Gypsy Patch Lane to the south. This road subsequently became known as Station Road. At the time of construction, the station was mostly surrounded by fields, with the Bristol conurbation almost away. In 1900, almost all trains from London to Wales travelled via Bath and Bristol, with some still routed via . However, the final to Bristol were relatively slow and congested, so a new route was built further north, the GWR's Badminton Line, now part of the South Wales Main Line, running from Wootton Bassett Junction to a junction just south of Patchway. The new line opened in 1903, and allowed faster services to Wales. There was a new triangular junction between Patchway and Filton, with the new line coming in from the east. As part of the work, the station signal box was closed, replaced by a larger one closer to the junction on 19 October 1902. The new signal box would later become one of only a few to be double glazed, due to the noise from jet engine testing from the Bristol Siddeley Aero- Engines factory (now the Rolls Royce factory) opposite the box. The Henbury Loop Line opened in 1910, connecting to the main lines south of Patchway. From 1928, some trains from Bristol would travel in loops via Patchway and . A passenger train passes west through Patchway in 1958. In the background on the right, a freight train can be seen using the goods loop. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Patchway came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, there were 11 trains towards South Wales and 13 towards Bristol each weekday, with three trains per day in each direction on Sundays. However, by 1965 this had reduced to eight trains on weekdays towards South Wales and six towards Bristol, with no Sunday service. Traffic levels fell - the station was closed to goods traffic on 5 July 1965, and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 October 1968. The goods loop was taken up and the station buildings demolished, replaced by small brick shelters. The structure of the footbridge remained, but the roof was removed. The goods yard was repurposed as vehicle storage. In 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect, the southern part of Gloucestershire, including the district of Patchway, became part of the new county of Avon. Avon was disbanded in 1996, with the region now governed by South Gloucestershire council. South of Patchway is Patchway Junction, where the lines from London, Bristol and Avonmouth converge. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Patchway passed to Regional Railways. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, and rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. From December 2006, Virgin CrossCountry began operating a single daily service Newcastle to Cardiff Central via Bristol Temple Meads and Patchway. This service was taken over by Arriva CrossCountry when the CrossCountry franchise changed hands in 2007, and then replaced by a daily service each direction between Cardiff Central and . Since the mid-2000s, the Severnside Community Rail Partnership have been working to enhance Patchway station. One of the first acts was installing new community notice boards. A local working group was formed to \\"adopt\\" the station, and the group negotiated with Rolls Royce to use their CCTV system to cover the station. A successful bid was made to the Department for Transport's \\"Access for All\\" scheme, which provided for improved signage, lighting and seats. A station garden was created in partnership with nearby Patchway Community College, and two decorative mosaics were installed. The disused railway land adjacent to the station was cleared through a Community Payback scheme.  Future  First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The CrossCountry franchise is also due to expire in 2019. The South Wales Main Line from London to Cardiff is due to be electrified by 2017, as is the line to Bristol Temple Meads. However, the lines to Weston- super-Mare and Southampton will not be electrified in the near future, so services at Patchway will still be provided by diesel trains, with \\"Sprinter\\" units to be replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing to Weston, as does MP for Weston-super-Mare John Penrose. The station footbridge is expected to be replaced with a higher bridge to allow the installation of overhead electrification, and it is hoped that adjacent railway land could be used to expand the car park. There are also calls for the station to be made accessible to disabled users.

As a medication, L-asparaginase is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is given by injection into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. A pegylated version is also available. In food manufacturing it is used to decrease acrylamide. Common side effects when used by injection include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, blood clotting problems, high blood sugar, kidney problems, and liver dysfunction. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. As a food it is generally recognized as safe. Asparaginase works by breaking down the amino acid known as asparagine without which the cancer cells cannot make protein. Asparaginase was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is often made from Escherichia coli or Erwinia chrysanthemi. Uses Asparaginases can be used for different industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. =Medical= E. coli strains are the main source of medical asparaginase. Branded formulations (with different chemical and pharmacological properties) available in 1998 include Asparaginase Medac, Ciderolase, and Oncaspar. (Crasnitin has been discontinued.) Spectrila is a new recombinant E. coli asparaginase. Asparaginase produced by Dickeya dadantii (formerly called Erwinia chrysanthemi) instead is known as crisantaspase (BAN), and is available in the United Kingdom under the trade name Erwinase. One of the E. coli asparaginases marketed under the brand name Elspar for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is also used in some mast cell tumor protocols. Unlike most of other chemotherapy agents, asparaginase can be given as an intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection without fear of tissue irritation. =Food manufacturing= The most common use of asparaginases is as a processing aid in the manufacture of food. Asparaginases are used as a food processing aid to reduce the formation of acrylamide, a suspected carcinogen, in starchy food products such as snacks, biscuits and fried potato. Asparaginases are marketed under the brand names Acrylaway and PreventASe. Side effects The main side effect is an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction; anaphylaxis is a possibility. Additionally, it can also be associated with a coagulopathy as it decreases protein synthesis, including synthesis of coagulation factors (e.g. progressive isolated decrease of fibrinogen) and anticoagulant factor (generally antithrombin III; sometimes protein C & S as well), leading to bleeding or thrombotic events such as stroke. Bone marrow suppression is common but only mild to moderate, rarely reaches clinical significance and therapeutic consequences are rarely required. Other common side effects include pancreatitis. These side effects mainly attributes to the dual activity of L.Asparaginase as it can also hydrolysis L.Glutamine to Glutamic acid and ammonia Mechanism of action =As a food processing aid= Acrylamide is often formed in the cooking of starchy foods. During heating the amino acid asparagine, naturally present in starchy foods, undergoes a process called the Maillard reaction, which is responsible for giving baked or fried foods their brown color, crust, and toasted flavor. Suspected carcinogens such as acrylamide and some heterocyclic amines are also generated in the Maillard reaction. By adding asparaginase before baking or frying the food, asparagine is converted into another common amino acid, aspartic acid, and ammonium. As a result, asparagine cannot take part in the Maillard reaction, and therefore the formation of acrylamide is significantly reduced. Complete acrylamide removal is probably not possible due to other, minor asparagine-independent formation pathways. As a food processing aid, asparaginases can effectively reduce the level of acrylamide up to 90% in a range of starchy foods without changing the taste and appearance of the end product. =As a drug= The rationale behind asparaginase is that it takes advantage of the fact that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and some other suspected tumor cells are unable to synthesize the non-essential amino acid asparagine, whereas normal cells are able to make their own asparagine; thus leukemic cells require high amount of asparagine. These leukemic cells depend on circulating asparagine. Asparaginase, however, catalyzes the conversion of L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. This deprives the leukemic cell of circulating asparagine, which leads to cell death. =Enzyme regulation= Type I L-asparaginase protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.  Cost  Normal asparaginase costs less than its pegylated version, pegaspargase. However, because it doesn't stay as long in the body, the injections need to be more frequent, with the result that total cost of treatment may be lower for the pegylated version. History The discovery and development of asparaginase as an anti-cancer drug began in 1953, when scientists first observed that lymphomas in rat and mice regressed after treatment with guinea pig serum. Later it was found out that it is not the serum itself which provoke the tumour regression, but rather the enzyme asparaginase. After researchers comparing different kinds of asparaginases, the one derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi turned out to have the best anti-cancer ability. E. coli has thereby become the main source of asparaginase due to the factor that it is also easy to produce in large amount. Names Crisantaspase is British Approved Name (BAN) for asparaginase obtained from Erwinia chrysanthemi. Colaspase is the BAN of asparaginase obtained from Escherichia coli. The United States Adopted Name of crisantaspase is asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi. Elspar, Kidrolase, Leunase and Spectrila are brand names for colaspase, while Erwinase and Erwinaze are brand names for crisantaspase. The pegylated version of colaspase is called pegaspargase. Oncaspar is the brand name of pegaspargase.

As a scholarly organization, SBL has been a constituent society of the American Council of Learned Societies since 1929.SBL @ American Council of Learned Societies official site.  History  The eight founders of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis first met to discuss their new society in Philip Schaff's study in New York City in January 1880. In June the group had their first Annual Meeting with eighteen people in attendance. The new society drew up a constitution and by-laws and discussed several papers. Membership dues were set at three dollars. By the end of the year, membership had grown to forty-five and publication of the meeting proceedings were in the planning stages. The Journal of Biblical Literature (JBL) was launched the following year. The SBL was not the first association dedicated to biblical studies in North America, but it was the first that was interdenominational. The thirty-two founding members of SBL in 1880 even included a Unitarian, Ezra Abbott. The society's development was contemporary with increasing interest in Ancient Near East studies. The society shortened its name to Society of Biblical Literature in 1962.  Publications  The Society of Biblical Literature has published the flagship Journal of Biblical Literature since 1881.

He was the son of Adrien de Briquemault and Alexane de Sainte Ville. His first campaign was under the count of Brissac in the Piedmontese wars. On his return to France in 1554 he joined Admiral Coligny. Charged with the defence of Rouen, in 1562, he resigned in favor of Gabriel Montgomery, to whom the Prince of Cond√© had entrusted the task, and went over to England, where he concluded the Treaty of Hampton Court on 20 September. He then returned to France, and took Dieppe from the Catholics before the conclusion of peace. If his share in the second religious war was less important, he played a very active part in the third. He fought at Jarnac, Roche-Abeille and Montcontour, assisted in the siege of Poitiers, was nearly captured by the Catholics at Bourg-Dieu, re-victualled V√©zelay, and almost surprised Bourges. In 1570, being charged by Coligny to stop the army of the princes in its ascent of the Rh√¥ne valley, he crossed Burgundy and effected his junction with the admiral at Saint-√âtienne in May. On the 21st of the following June he assisted in achieving the victory of Arnay-le-Duc, and was then employed to negotiate a marriage between the prince of Navarre and Elizabeth I of England. Being in Paris on the night of St. Bartholomew he took refuge in the house of the English ambassador, but was arrested there. With his friend Arnaud de Cavagnes he was delivered over to the parlement, and failed in courage when confronted with his judges, seeking to escape death by unworthy means. He was condemned, nevertheless, on 27 October 1572, to the last penalty and to the confiscation of his property, and on 29 October he and Cavagnes were executed.

Aghajanian; 18 September 1895 ‚Äì 16 May 1971) was an Armenian Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was the head of the Armenian Catholic Church (as Patriarch of Cilicia) from 1937 to 1962 and supervised the Catholic Church's missionary work for more than a decade, until his retirement in 1970. He was considered papabile on two occasions. Educated in Tiflis and Rome, Agagianian first served as leader of the Armenian Catholic community of Tiflis before the Bolshevik takeover of the Caucasus in 1921. He then moved to Rome, where he first taught and then headed the Pontifical Armenian College until 1937 when he was elected to lead the Armenian Catholic Church, which he revitalized after major losses the church had experienced during the Armenian Genocide. Agagianian was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) from 1958 to 1970. Theologically a moderate, a linguist, and an authority on the Soviet Union, he served as one of the four moderators at the Second Vatican Council and was twice considered a serious papal candidate, during the conclaves of 1958 and 1963. Early life and priesthood Agagianian was born Ghazaros Aghajanian on September 18, 1895 in the city of Akhaltsikhe, in the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire‚Äîin present-day Samtskhe-Javakheti province of Georgia. At the time, around 60% of city's 15,000 inhabitants were Armenians. His family was part of the Catholic minority of Javakhk Armenians, most of whom were followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church. His ancestors came from Erzurum in the aftermath of a Russo- Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829. Fleeing Ottoman persecution, they sought refuge in the Russian Caucasus. He lost his father, Harutiun, at an early age. He attended the Russian Orthodox Tiflis Seminary and then the Pontifical Urban University in Rome in 1906. His outstanding performance in the latter was noted by Pope Pius X, who told young Agagianian: \\"You will be a priest, a bishop, and a patriarch.\\" He was ordained priest in Rome on December 23, 1917. Despite the upheaval bought by the Russian Revolution, he thereafter served as a parish priest in Tiflis and then as the head of the city's Armenian Catholic community from 1919. He left for Rome in 1921 when Georgia was invaded by the Red Army and did not see his family until 1962, when his sister Elizaveta traveled to Rome through the intervention of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. In 1921, Agagianian became a faculty member and vice-rector of the Pontifical Armenian College (Pontificio Collegio Armeno) in Rome. He later served as rector of the college from 1932 to 1937. He was also a faculty member of the Pontifical Urban University from 1922 to 1932. Agagianian was appointed titular bishop of Comana di Armenia on July 11, 1935 and was ordained bishop on July 21, 1935 at the San Nicola da Tolentino Church in Rome. His episcopal motto was Iustitia et Pax (\\"Justice and Peace\\"). Armenian Catholic Patriarch On November 30, 1937, Agagianian was elected Patriarch of Cilicia by the synod of bishops of the Armenian Catholic Church, an Eastern particular church sui iuris of the Catholic Church. The election received papal confirmation on December 13, 1937. He took the name Gregory Peter (; Armenian: Krikor Bedros) and became the 15th patriarch of the Armenian Catholic Church, which had some 100,000 adherents. All Armenian Catholic Patriarchs have Peter (Petros/Bedros) in their pontifical name as an expression of allegiance to the church founded by Saint Peter. According to Rouben Paul Adalian, the Armenian Catholic Church regained its stature in the Armenian diaspora under the \\"astute management\\" of Agagianian following the sizable losses in the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. Agagianian reportedly played a key role in keeping the Armenian-populated village of Kessab within Syria when Turkey annexed the Hatay State in 1939 by intervening as a representative of the Vatican. Agagianian inaugurated the Armenian Catholic church in Anjar, Lebanon in 1954 and founded a boarding house for orphaned boys there. He resigned the pastoral governance of the Armenian patriarchate on August 25, 1962 to focus on his duties at the Vatican. Cardinalate Agagianan was made Cardinal on February 18, 1946 by Pope Pius XII. He was appointed Cardinal-Priest of San Bartolomeo all'Isola on February 22, 1946. =Propaganda Fide= Cardinal Agagianian (center) in Rome, 1958. Agagianian was appointed Pro-Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) on June 18, 1958 and Prefect on July 18, 1960. As such he supervised the training of Catholic missionaries all over the world. According to Lentz, Agagianian was \\"largely responsible for liberalizing the church's policies in developing nations.\\" He traveled extensively to the missionary areas for which he was responsible. In February 1959 Agagianian visited Taiwan to oversee missionary work in the island. He later entrusted Paul Y√º Pin, Archbishop of Nanking, to reestablish the Fu Jen Catholic University. He arrived in Japan for a two week long visit in May 1959, which included a meeting with Emperor Hirohito. On December 10, 1959 he presided over the First Far East Conference of Bishops at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines with attendance of 100 prelates, 10 papal representatives, 16 archbishops, 79 bishops from almost every country in the Far East. His visit to the Republic of Ireland in June 1961 was the highlight of the Patrician Year. Agagianian received a great popular welcome there.\\"I remember Cardinal Agagianian. I remember when he came to visit Ireland. The people gave him a great welcome.\\" ‚Äì According to journalist Gerard O'Connell who conducted interviews for the following book: Conservative President of Ireland √âamon de Valera was famously pictured kissing Agagianian's ring. In September 1963 he visited South Vietnam and met with Madame Nhu, the Catholic first lady. On October 18, 1964 when the Uganda Martyrs where canonized by Pope Paul VI, Agagianian presided over the Holy Mass at Namugongo. In November 1964 he traveled to Bombay, India to open the 38th Eucharistic Congress. =Papabile= As a cardinal, Agagianian participated in the papal conclaves of 1958 and 1963, during which he was considered to have been papabile. According to J. Peter Pham, Agagianian was considered a \\"serious (albeit unwilling) candidate\\" for the papacy in both conclaves. Contemporary news sources noted that Agagianian was the first serious non-Italian papal candidate in centuries. 1958 conclave According to Greg Tobin and Robert J. Wister, Agagianian, known to have been close to Pope Pius XII, was one of the favorites in the 1958 conclave. His candidacy was widely discussed in the press. Even before the death of Pope Pius XII, The Milwaukee Sentinel wrote that some authoritative voices of Vatican affairs believe that Agagianian was \\"without question the leading candidate\\" to succeed Pope Pius XII. On October 9, the day Pope Pius died, The Sentinel wrote that he is \\"considered by very responsible Vatican circles as the foremost choice\\" to succeed Pope Pius. The Chicago Tribune wrote on October 25 that although Agagianian was popular amongst believers, the cardinals were expected to try first to agree on an Italian cardinal. The election was seen as a struggle between Italian Angelo Roncalli (who was eventually elected and became Pope John XXIII) and non-Italian Agagianian. Agagianian came in second according to Massimo Faggioli and contemporary press reports. Three months after the conclave, Roncalli revealed that his name and that of Agagianian \\"went up and down like two chickpeas in boiling water\\" during the conclave. Armenian-American journalist Tom Vartabedian suggests that it is possible that Agagianian might have been elected but declined the post. 1963 conclave According to John Whooley, an authority on the Armenian Catholic Church, Agagianian was considered \\"a strong contender, most 'papabile before the 1963 conclave and there was \\"much expectation\\" that he would be elected. The conclave instead elected Giovanni Battista Montini, who became Pope Paul VI. According to the Armenian Catholic Church website, Agagianian was rumored to have been actually elected at this conclave but declined to accept. According to speculations by Italian journalists Andrea Tornielli (1993) and Giovanni Bensi (2013); also published in Russian: Italian intelligence services were involved in preventing Agagianian from being elected pope in 1963. They maintain that SIFAR (Servizio informazioni forze armate), the Italian military intelligence service, mounted a smear campaign against Agagianian prior to the conclave by disseminating the narrative that Agagianian's 70-year-old sister, Elizaveta‚Äîwho had visited Rome a year earlier to meet him‚Äîhad ties with the Soviet authorities. The Tablet wrote in 1963 that their meeting, which was preceded by negotiations partly conducted by the Italian ambassador in Moscow, \\"must rank as one of the best- kept diplomatic secrets of all time\\". Views Thomas Rausch described him as \\"hardly a strict traditionalist.\\" According to Ralph M. Wiltgen, he was \\"regarded by the liberals as the most acceptable of the Curial cardinals\\" in the Second Vatican Council. In 1963 Life magazine called him a liberal, cosmopolitan, and a moderate. He was described as the Catholic Church's \\"topmost champion of the unity of the Christian churches under the Pope.\\" In 1950 he issued a pastoral letter in which he directly appealed to all Armenians (most of whom adhere to the Armenian Apostolic Church) to accept the authority of the Catholic Church. =Second Vatican Council= Agagianian sat on the Board of Presidency of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), which took place from 1962 to 1965. He was appointed by Pope Paul VI as one of the four moderators who directed the course of the debates, along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius D√∂pfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian was the only one of these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World. =On the Soviet Union= During his lifetime, Agagianian was considered the Catholic Church's leading expert on communism and the Soviet Union. Norman St John- Stevas wrote 1955 that Agagianian is \\"uncommitted\\" in the Cold War. In a January 1958 diplomatic report Marcus Cheke, UK Ambassador to the Holy See, wrote that Agagianian \\"believes that the best thing for the Western powers to do is to hang on, avoid war (and the more strongly armed and united they are, the less danger there is of Russia venturing on a war) and to wait for a transformation inside Russia, which he thinks will happen sooner or later.\\" In contrast, Agagianian called for a \\"heroically Christian\\" struggle against communism during his visit to Australia in 1959. Agagianian opposed the repatriation of Armenian Catholics from the Middle East to Soviet Armenia in 1946. He noted that there was an intolerant environment in the Soviet Union towards religion and argued that \\"We [Armenian Catholics] are forced to remain as emigrants to preserve our church and faith.\\" ;Reception in the Soviet Union Agagianian's statements regarding repatriation of Armenians were received as defamation and hostile in the Soviet-controlled homeland. In the early 1950s, Etchmiadzin, the Soviet-based official publication of the Armenian Apostolic Church, published articles severely criticizing Agagianian. One article claimed that he was created cardinal in order to \\"damage the unity\\" and \\"disunite\\" the Armenian people. It also argued that Agagianian also held the \\"key to submitting the Oriental Orthodox churches of the Middle East (Coptic, Assyrian, Ethiopian, etc.) to the Catholic Church.\\" In another article, Agagianian was accused in \\"seek[ing] to bring Armenian believers under the control of the Vatican\\" and make them \\"anti-national [...] without an ideal and dignity [....] in short, a cosmopolitan crowd, which will serve the Turkish-American war machine.\\" Retirement and death Agagianian effectively retired when he resigned as prefect on October 19, 1970, and was appointed Cardinal-Bishop of the Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano on October 22. Agagianian died of cancer in Rome on May 16, 1971. Pope Paul VI called him a \\"noble figure\\" upon Agagianian's death. Vazgen I, head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, sent Pope Paul VI a letter mourning Agagianian's death. His funeral took place on May 21 at St. Peter's Basilica. He was buried in Rome's San Nicola da Tolentino Armenian church. There is a monument to Agagianian inside the church, flanked by the virgin martyr Hripsime and St. Vartan. Reputation The tomb of Agagianian at San Nicola da Tolentino, Rome In 1966, Italian journalist Alberto Cavallari wrote that Agagianian is the \\"undisputed leader of non-European Catholicism. He is regarded by all as one of the most powerful cardinals in the Curia and is invested with autonomous powers equaled by none except the pope.\\" Upon his death, The New York Times wrote that \\"Despite his failure to win election from the Sacred College of Cardinals, [Agagianian] nevertheless made a major impact on the development of the [Catholic] church and its role in the newly developing nations.\\" Agagianian has been called \\"the most celebrated Armenian Catholic in history.\\" He was the second Armenian Catholic churchman ever to be made cardinal, after Andon Bedros IX Hassoun in 1880. Since Agagianian spent most of his adult life in Rome, he was \\"Romanized\\" and reportedly spoke with a Roman accent. Richard McBrien wrote that Agagianian was \\"regarded by some, including fellow Eastern- rite Catholics, as more Roman than the Romans.\\" Agagianian was considered to have been bi-ritual as he used both the Armenian and Latin rites. Pope Pius XII, who had a \\"great interest in the Eastern churches,\\" called on Agagianian to celebrate a pontifical Mass in the Armenian rite in the Sistine Chapel on March 12, 1946. Agagianian was a polyglot and renowned linguist. He spoke fluent Armenian (his mother language), Russian, Italian, French, English, and Latin and learned German, Spanish, classical Greek, Arabic. He had \\"a working knowledge of the Slavic languages and [could] speak most of the languages of the Middle and Far East.\\" He was described as the College of Cardinals' \\"top linguist\\" in 1953. Norman St John-Stevas wrote of him in 1955 as \\"a man of distinguished presence, a fine scholar.\\" Honors and awards ;Honorary degrees *Honorary Doctor of Laws from Boston College (1952) *Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Santo Tomas (1958) *Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Notre Dame (1960) *Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Boston College (1960) *Honorary Doctor of Laws from the Catholic University of America (1960) *Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from St. John's University (1960) *Honorary Doctor of Laws from the National University of Ireland (1961) ;State orders and awards *Order of Merit of the Italian Republic ‚Äì Knight (Cavaliere, 1963) Publications  References =Notes= =References= =Bibliography= 1895 births 1971 deaths People from Akhaltsikhe Georgian Armenians Imperial Russian Armenians Eastern Catholic monks Pontifical Urban University alumni Pontifical Urban University faculty Armenian Catholic Patriarchs of Cilicia 20th-century Eastern Catholic archbishops Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII Armenian cardinals Cardinal-bishops of Albano Participants in the Second Vatican Council Members of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith Deaths from cancer in Italy 20th-century cardinals ","title":"Gregorio Pietro Agagianian"},{"id":"2961428","text":"Kleinwalsertal is a part of Mittelberg in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg. It is part of the Bregenz district and due to the geographic location in the Allg√§u Alps with its alpine terrain, the Kleinwalsertal has no direct traffic connection to the rest of Vorarlberg. It is accessible only via Oberstdorf, Germany, to the north, and thus is an Austrian \\"practical exclave\\" or \\"pene- exclave\\". Prior to Austria joining the European Union, the area had tax-free status. The local football club, SV Kleinwalsertal, has the distinction of being one of only a few clubs in Central Europe that play in a local league based outside of the club's country. They play in the 10th tier A-Klasse Allg√§u 4 in 2016‚Äì17. Etymology The name of the valley derives from the Walsers who moved there from the Valais (German: Wallis) in the 13th century (see also \\"Gro√üwalsertal\\"). Geography =Location= The Kleinwalsertal is a high valley in the Allg√§u Alps and is located in the east of Vorarlberg. The Breitach river runs through the entire valley and is fed by a few side streams, which come from the side valleys of the Kleinwalsertal. The Kleinwalsertal is almost completely surrounded by high mountains. These are part of the Allg√§u Alps, which are part of the northern eastern Alps. Its highest elevation is the Gro√üer Widderstein at . The Kleinwalsertal is cut off from the rest of Austria. A traffic connection exists only to the Bavarian town of Oberstdorf. =Towns= The Kleinwalsertal includes the municipality of Mittelberg and consists of three villages which are situated along the River Breitach: Mittelberg, Hirschegg and Riezlern. The official name of this entire municipality is Mittelberg after the first populated place. On an area of live 4,902 inhabitants with primary residence, which results in a population density of almost 51 inhabitants per square kilometre (). Mountains of Kleinwalsertal Mittelberg, 1900 *Hoher Ifen *Kanzelwand *Walmendingerhorn *Fellhorn *Elfer *Zw√∂lfer (Vorarlberg) *Widderstein History The Kleinwalsertal was populated by the Walsers in 1270, a group of people who migrated from Switzerland. This Alemannic origin still distinguishes the inhabitants from the inhabitants of the surrounding communities by their dialect. From 1891, the Kleinwalsertal enjoyed a customs union with Germany, a free border, and used the German Marks as currency. Since Austria joined the European Union in 1995, followed by the signing of the Schengen Agreement (1997) and the introduction of the Euro (2002), this special status has no longer applied. By the time of EU accession goods from Austria had to be cleared in Germany or the import turnover tax had to be paid while German goods were free of taxes. Taxes were to be paid to the Austrian tax office in D-Mark until the introduction of the Euro. A special tariff was also applied to Swiss Post. Shipments to Austria were calculated according to the domestic tariffs of Austrian Post, those to Germany were to be freed with domestic porti of the Federal Post. Economy and tourism The most important industry in the last century was agriculture, which currently has only a marginal importance. Now tourism plays the major role and as early as 1960 the number of overnight stays reached a million. In 2015, there were 792,026 overnight stays in summer and 816,240 in winter of 2015/2016. The hiking and excursion tourism - especially of families with small children and seniors - is very pronounced. The choice of easy walks and moderately difficult hiking trails is correspondingly wide and well signposted. Mobility in the valley is ensured with the tightly driven Walserbus, which is free of charge to tourists paying the tourist tax via ownership of the Walsercard. The good transport connections to the north also helped to strengthen tourism. So you only need about two and a half hours for the Stuttgart-Kleinwalsertal route. In Central Europe, the region is known as a ski and hiking resort. The 5,000 inhabitants, who are called \\"Walser\\", can provide up to 10,300 beds for tourists. =Winter tourism= Skiing is certainly the mainstay of winter tourism in the Kleinwalsertal, but it also has ski mountaineering and easy winter hiking. The great importance of tourism is also reflected in the winter sport infrastructure. The valley offers the opportunity to use 30 ski lifts, 6 chair lifts and 2 cable cars. The first mountain railway of the valley, the Kanzelwandbahn, was completed in Riezlern in 1955. The railway, renewed in 1989, transports winter sportsmen to above sea level. The \\"Kanzelwand- Fellhorn\\" ski area comprises 13 facilities, some of which are modern. =Summer tourism= In the summer, the guests usually come for mountain hiking. There are also two very popular climbing routes (Mindelheimer Klettersteig and Zweienland Klettersteig) on the border to the neighbouring commune area of Oberstdorf, which are mostly accessed via the Kleinwalsertal because of the shorter route and easier accessibility. The conditions for mountaineering on the Hohen Ifen and the B√§renk√∂pfle are very good. However, it is severely restricted or completely forbidden for hunting reasons.  Culture  The Literaturfest Kleinwalsertal is a 2017 established literary festival that organises lectures, workshops, poetry slams and exhibitions. It takes place in autumn. The festival intends to bring together authors and the public. A project within the festival is a virtual storytelling hiking path which is an easy hike of two hours. With the help of texts, it aims at bringing people together along the path, and at blurring the boundaries of writers and readers.

Early years  Born in Duxhurst, Surrey, Simon is the youngest of six children born to Bob and Peggy Gallup. After moving to Horley, Surrey in 1961 he attended Horley Infants and Junior Schools between 1961 and 1971, followed by Horley Balcombe Road Comprehensive from 1971‚Äì1976. Between 1976 and 1978 he worked in a plastics factory and became the bass player for local punk band Lockjaw, who later evolved into The Magazine Spies (1979‚Äì1980), also known as The Mag/Spys.Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith, The Cure: Ten Imaginary Years, Zomba Books, 1987, p. 120. Lockjaw and The Mag/Spys played regular live shows with Easy Cure and later The Cure between 1977 and 1979, and after collaborating in the studio on the Cult Hero recording sessions in October 1979, both Gallup and keyboardist Matthieu Hartley left The Mag/Spys to join The Cure.Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith, The Cure: Ten Imaginary Years, Zomba Books, 1987. Former Mag/Spys Gallup, Hartley and Stuart Curran later performed together under the name of The Cry and later Fools Dance during Gallup's hiatus from The Cure between 1982 and 1984. Career =The Cure= Gallup first joined The Cure in 1979, replacing Michael Dempsey on bass guitar. He also has been credited for occasionally playing the keyboards, particularly after Matthieu Hartley's departure in 1980. He took over keyboard lines for many of the songs that Hartley played. Examples of songs he played keyboard on live include \\"At Night\\", \\"A Forest\\", \\"A Strange Day\\" and \\"Pornography\\". During \\"Cold\\" he multi-tasked playing bass guitar and bass pedals. On the Swing Tour in 1996, he played twelve-string acoustic guitar on \\"This Is a Lie\\". On the Dream Tour in 2000 he played a Fender Bass VI on \\"There Is No If\\". Gallup is also credited with singing lead vocals for a demo for \\"Violin Song\\". Gallup first performed on The Cure albums that make up \\"The Dark Trilogy\\": Seventeen Seconds, Faith, and Pornography. =Departure from The Cure= During the Pornography Tour in 1982, a series of incidents prompted Gallup to leave The Cure, including an incident on 27 May 1982 after a live performance at Hall Tivoli, Strasbourg, France when he got into a fist fight with Robert Smith at a nightclub in Strasbourg reportedly over a bar tab. Gallup has said that \\"I was about to leave when some guy came up and told me I hadn't paid for my drinks. He thought I was Robert. I was knackered but the bloke took me up to the bar and Robert appeared to see what was going on. I hit him, he responded and we had a fight\\". Smith, on the other hand, said that \\"I was on the first floor of this club when they came up and told me there was a problem downstairs. Simon was so wound up that no-one could talk to him - he was screaming at the barman, this young kid who was nearly in tears. By himself, Simon would have never behaved like that but he was surrounded by the road crew so he was behaving the way he thought a rock and roller ought to behave. He didn't want to pay for his drinks because he thought I wasn't paying for mine. I told him to shut up and he punched me. It was the first time he really laid into me, we had an enormous ruck and I said 'That's it', walked out, got a cab back to the hotel, got my suitcase, my passport from the tour manager's room and got on the first flight to London. That was at 6.30 am and I was home by half past 10. I left a note saying I wasn't coming back. Simon returned the same afternoon. I'd left so I suppose he thought he could do the same. Good idea ... we had three days off!\\". Lol Tolhurst adds that \\"The pressures of having to keep up the intensity and aggressive sentiments of Pornography turned Simon into someone different though, at the time, I don't think he noticed. Or didn't want to ...\\". Gallup and the rest of The Cure returned to complete their Fourteen Explicit Moments Tour in support of Pornography, concluding their 11 June 1982 live performance at Ancienne Belgique, Brussels, Belgium with an improvised song, \\"The Cure Is Dead\\", with Gary Biddles singing abuse about Smith and Tolhurst. Smith, on drums, then threw his drumsticks at Biddles, and they stormed off stage. Tolhurst played bass guitar and Gallup played rhythm guitar during this last song. This second incident, occurring weeks after the first notable incident, was more infamous and resulted in Gallup leaving The Cure to form Fools Dance with Biddles. Initially, at this concert, The Cure decided to play \\"Forever\\", with instrument changes; Gallup played guitar, Tolhurst played bass, Smith played the drums, and Biddles, a part-time roadie and friend of Gallup's, doing vocals. As soon as he got on stage, Biddles started singing, \\"Smith is a wanker, Tolhurst is a wanker, only Simon is worth anything in the band! The Cure is dead!\\". Smith got angry and threw his drumsticks at Biddles's head, and yelled \\"Fuck off!\\". =Fools Dance= Gallup left the band and started The Cry with Gary Biddles and Matthieu Hartley. Their first gig was at the Covent Garden Rock Garden on 19 April 1983, supported by SE London-based band The Wait. They later changed their name to Fools Dance, which released two EPs; Fools Dance and They'll Never Know. Biddles sang most of the songs that were released by this band, Gallup sang on one called \\"The Ring\\". When asked why he left The Cure, he said, \\"It's just basically that Robert and I are both really arrogant bastards, and it got to such an extreme. I suppose you just can't have two egocentrics in a band, and Robert was sort of 'the main man'.\\" =Return to The Cure= In 1984, Smith asked Gallup to return to The Cure, an offer which he accepted. Since then, the two of them have remained on good terms. Gallup also served as best man at Smith's wedding in 1988. In late 1992, Gallup again took a brief break from the band during the Wish Tour, after he had to be transported to hospital, suffering from pleurisy after being ill for several months. During this time, he was replaced on bass by former Associates and Shelleyan Orphan member, Roberto Soave.  Gear  *Gallup's favourite bass is his Gibson Thunderbird. In 2004 Gibson created a special red Thunderbird bass for Gallup, to celebrate his 25th year as the bassist for The Cure. *He has also played Fender Precision, Fender Jazz, Rickenbacker 4001, Music Man StingRay, Washburn AB10 acoustic, Kramer acoustic, custom Dick Knight, Epiphone Jack Casady and Eccleshall 335 basses live. *In 2011 Gallup started using a Schecter signature model based on their Ultra Spitfire bass. *Gallup uses the following Boss guitar effect pedals: BF-2 Flanger, CE-5 Chorus Ensemble, MT-2 Distortion, DD-3 Digital Delay and NS-2 Noise Suppressor. *Gallup is a supporter of Reading Football Club and draped a team flag over his amp while playing in Sydney and Melbourne during the band's 2007 Australasian tour. He also draped a Reading F.C flag over his amp at Coachella 2009, during the set at Bestival 2011, Isle of Wight, during Reading Festival in 2012, Lollapalooza 2013 in Chicago and Glastonbury 2019.There is also a Reading Football Club flag covering one of the large speakers of their 2013 concert held in Austin, Texas which is clearly visible on the live concert video available on YouTube.

The term is used by Arab Muslims, as well as Muslims all over the world. Internationally Muslims use it as a greeting for use on the festivals of Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. Eid means \\"Celebration\\", and Mubarak (derived from the Semitic root B-R-K) means \\"Blessed\\". In the social sense, people usually celebrate Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid-al-Adha in the month of Dhul Hijjah (the 12th and final Islamic month). Some state that this exchange of greetings is a cultural tradition and not part of any religious obligation.http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/709700jizz/What-is- Eid-Mubarak-Eid-Al-Adha-2016 Regional variations Throughout the Muslim world there are numerous other greetings for Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr. The companions of the Prophet Mohammad used to say to each other in Arabic when they met on Eid ul-Fitr: Taqabbalall√¢hu minn√¢ wa minkum (which means \\"[May] God accept from us and you [our fasts and deeds]\\"). Throughout the Muslim world, variations in Eid greetings exist. =Arab world= Arab Muslims use the term Eid Mubarak, and have a number of other ways to say happy holiday. Some Arabs also add \\"kul 'am wantum bikhair\\" (ŸÉŸÑ ÿπÿßŸÖ Ÿà ÿ£ŸÜÿ™ŸÖ ÿ®ÿÆŸäÿ±), which means \\"May you be well with every passing year\\". There is another common term in GCC states which is \\"Minal Aidin wal Faizin\\" (ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸäÿØŸäŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÅÿßŸäÿ≤ŸäŸÜ), an Arab sentence meaning \\"May we be sacred [one more time] and may we be succeed [in our fasting]\\", and the reply will be ‚ÄúMinal Maqbulin wal Ghanmin‚Äù (ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿ®ŸàŸÑŸäŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿßŸÜŸÖŸäŸÜ), which means ‚ÄúMay [our good deeds] be accepted [by God] and may we win [the paradise]‚Äù. =Bosnia & Herzegovina= Bosnian Muslims also commonly say \\"Bajram ≈†erif mubarek olsun\\"; the response is \\"Allah razi olsun\\". Another common Eid greeting by Bosnian Muslims is \\"Bajram bareƒáula\\". =Serbia= In Serbia, Muslims usually celebrate by saying \\"Bajram ≈†erif Mubarek Olsun\\" to which the other replies with \\"Allah Razi Olsun\\" =Turkey= In Turkey, Turks wish each other happy Eid with Turkish phrases including: \\"Bayramƒ±nƒ±z kutlu olsun\\" (\\"May your Eid be blessed\\"), \\"ƒ∞yi Bayramlar\\" (\\"Good Eid days\\"), and \\"Bayramƒ±nƒ±z m√ºbarek olsun\\" (\\"May your Eid be blessed\\"). =South Asia= In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, People say Eid Mubarak wishes by shaking hands and hugging them three times followed by hand shake one more time after the Salat al Eid. Pakistan Pashto speakers (mainly Pashtun people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Afghanistan) also use the Eid greeting \\"May your festival be blessed\\" ( ; akhtar de nekmregha sha). Balochi speakers (mainly Baloch people from Balochistan province and Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province) also use the Eid greeting \\"May your Eid be blessed\\" ( ; aied tara mubarak ba). Brahui speakers may also use the Eid greeting \\"Have a blessed Eid\\" ( ; aied ne mubarak mare). Bangladesh Many Bangladeshis may also use the phrase \\"Eid Mubarak\\" or \\"Eid greeting, \\"Eid's Greetings\\" (‡¶à‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≠‡ßá‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡¶æ; Eider Shubhechchha). =Southeast Asia= Muslims in countries such as Indonesia and the Malay language-speaking populations of Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore use the expression \\"Selamat Hari Raya\\" or \\"Selamat Idul Fitri\\" (Indonesian) or \\"Salam Aidilfitri\\" (Malay). This expression is usually accompanied by the popular expression \\"Minal Aidin wal Faizin\\", an Arab sentence meaning \\"May we be sacred one more time and succeed in our fasting\\". It is a quotation from a poem written by Shafiyuddin Al-Huli during the time Muslims ruled in Al- Andalus. Philippines In the Philippines, it is recognized as a legal holiday, though the Arabic greeting of Eid Mubarak has gained traction only recently. The traditional greeting of Muslims in the Philippines resembles that of the neighboring Malay-speaking world. This is namely \\"Salamat Hariraya Puwasa\\" (Selamat Hari Raya Puasa) for Eid al-Fitr, and \\"Salamat Hariraya Hadji\\" (Selamat Hari Raya Hajji) for Eid al-Adha. =West Africa= The Hausa language, originally from Northern Nigeria and Niger, is widely spoken among Muslims theoughout West Africa. Their equivalent Eid greetings in Hausa is \\"Barka da Sallah\\", which translates to \\"blessed Eid prayers\\". In Mali, the greeting in Bambara on Eid al-Adha is \\"Sambe-Sambe\\". This greeting is similarly used by countries that have majority Mande speaking peoples, another Lingua Franca spoken by Muslims in West Africa, or were once part of the historic Mali Empire. Ghana \\"Ni ti yuun' palli\\" is the Eid greeting among Dagbanli and Kusaase speakers in Ghana. It means \\"Happy new Eid season\\". The Hausa greeting \\"Barka da Sallah\\" is also commonly used during the period. =Latin America= Muslims in countries in Latin America use the expression \\"Feliz Eid\\" (Spanish). =Persian speakers= Persian-speaking Muslims use the term \\"eid shoma mubarak\\"(ÿπ€åÿØ ÿ¥ŸÖÿß ŸÖÿ®ÿßÿ±⁄©)(happy Eid). =Albania= Muslims in Albania and Kosovo use the term ( Urime e festa fitr/ kurban bajramit).

It is the fourth and last book of the Dalemark Quartet, and follows the adventures of a group of people trying to reunite North and South Dalemark under a new king. Plot summary The book is set in two parallel times; the present-day Dalemark, and the time of Mitt (Drowned Ammet) and Moril (Cart and Cwidder), some 200 years in the past. Mitt, who has recently escaped from the South and met Moril in North Dalemark, finds himself embroiled in a race to find an heir to the throne of Dalemark, which has lain empty for over 200 years, and gets mixed up in the machinations of a number of powerful forces. Maewen, a girl from present-day Dalemark, is transported by magic back in time to assist with the restoration of the royal line. In ancient Dalemark, Noreth Onesdaughter, a twin likeness of Maewen and apparently descended directly from the ancient kings of Dalemark, asks people to accompany her on her quest to become Queen. Unfortunately, just before she goes to meet her followers, she disappears. Maewen is drafted to replace her, and she has to lead Noreth's followers, collect the four tokens that will prove her right to the throne, and convince everyone that she is Noreth, all the while hearing mysterious voices in the air. Maewen sets out on her quest for the ancient crown of Dalemark with a small band of followers from the previous books in the series: Moril, Mitt, Navis Haddsson (a refugee nobleman from the South, see Drowned Ammet), Wend (the ancient magician-singer Tanamoril, Osfameron or Duck: see The Spellcoats), and Hestefan the Singer (who is eventually exposed as the evil Kankredin's agent and the murderer of Noreth). When they finally receive the crown from the One, the supreme god-like power of Dalemark, it is not Maewen who receives it ‚Äì but Mitt. As the new king, Mitt assumes the name Amil (one of the One's secret names) and continues to reunite and rebuild Dalemark as Amil the Great. Maewen goes back to her future, but she is followed by the evil Kankredin who seeks to kill her for foiling his plans in the past. This is represented as a bomb threat to the building where Maewen is. Mitt, who we now learn is one of the Undying, appears as a bomb expert, and destroys Kankredin by invoking the \\"strong name\\" of the god-like Earth Shaker, who has been helping Mitt ever since his adventures in Drowned Ammet. Mitt leaves, sending Maewen a message to wait four years to contact him, presumably until she is old enough to marry. On hearing this, Maewen decides that four years is far too long, and sets off to find him. The Crown is a particularly interesting addition to the Dalemark series, as many of the characters from previous books are seen from quite different perspectives, not necessarily favourable. Hildrida Navissdaughter, Earl Keril of Hannart, and the singer- magician Osfameron (appearing as Wend) are notable for the negative sides of their personalities that are brought out in the book. Characters =Main Characters= *Mayelbridwen Singer, called Maewen, a 13-year girl from the present. She is sent by magic to Mitt's time in Dalemark to take part in the quest for the new king because of her remarkable likeness to the chief claimant to the crown, Noreth Onesdaughter. *Mitt Alhammittsson, the hero of Drowned Ammet who escapes from the South to the North, takes part in the quest for the crown of Dalemark, and is crowned by the One as the new king of Dalemark. Mitt assumes the name Amil, one of the One's secret names, and becomes known as Amil the Great, the king who united and rebuilt Dalemark. Marries Biffa. *Moril Clennensson (full name Osfameron Tanamoril Clennensson), a highly talented traveling Singer who inherited his father's magic cwidder and learned to use its powers with dramatic results, both during the escape from the South in Cart and Cwidder and during the quest for the Dalemark crown in the present book. *Navis Haddsson, the youngest son of the tyrannical Earl Hadd of Holand in South Dalemark and the father of Hildrida and Ynen (Drowned Ammet). He escaped to the North, where he shows his organizational and military talent during the quest for the Dalemark crown. Elevated to Duke of Kernsburgh by Amil the Great after the unification of Dalemark. The new title ensured that Navis outranked all the earls in the kingdom. *Wend, a mysterious man working for Maewen's father. Wend transports Maewen into the past, where the past version of himself travels with Noreth Onesdaughter to guard her on her quest. Wend is really Noreth's father and one of the Elder Undying: Duck, Mage Mallard, Osfameron, and Tanamoril are all names he has gone by, and his epithet is the Wanderer. =Minor Characters= *Noreth Onesdaughter, an 18-year-old girl who claims to be the One's daughter and to have a claim to the throne of Dalemark. When Noreth is murdered by Hestefan the Singer acting on orders from Earl Henda, Maewen is transported to the past by Wend to take Noreth's place because of the remarkable likeness between the two. Noreth only appears in the book at the very beginning, where she meets Mitt and declares her intention of riding to Kingsburgh, but her existence is the driving force behind the plot. *Alk, a former lawman and the earl consort of the Countess of Aberath in the earldom of the North Dales. Physically a very large person, Alk devotes his time to inventing steam engines and eventually, almost single- handed, brings about the industrial revolution in Dalemark. Alk's trains ultimately run on the ancient green roads, a feat of civil engineering accomplished in far antiquity by King Hern, the first known king of Dalemark. *Biffa (short for Enblith), a very large and clever girl, who is a friend of Hildrida Navissdaughter (Drowned Ammet) at the Gardale Lawschool. Marries Mitt after he is made King Amil and becomes Queen Enblith (not the legendary \\"Enblith the Fair\\"). *Hestefan, one of the traveling Singers from Cart and Cwidder. Participates in the quest for the Dalemark crown together with his apprentice, the young singer Moril Clennensson, but betrays the cause by becoming the agent of Kankredin and murdering Noreth Onesdaughter. *Hildrida Navissdaughter (Hildy), bratty and snobbish granddaughter of a southern earl who escaped to the North with Mitt and her father Navis (Drowned Ammet). Appears briefly in this book as a student at Gardale Lawschool who is in danger of being abducted by Keril, Earl of Hannart, as part of the machinations surrounding the quest for the Dalemark crown. Hildy goes into hiding on Biffa's family farm, and after the unification of Dalemark she is appointed by Amil the Warden of the Holy Islands. *Kialan Kerilsson, the current Adon, son of and heir to Earl Keril of Hannart. Came North with Moril and Brid in Cart and Cwidder. Kialan disagrees with some of his father's tactics and helps free Ynen, whom Keril had been holding hostage to ensure Mitt's and Navis's behavior. He is a claimant to the throne, but feels happy enough just inheriting Hannart. *Ynen Navisson, son of Navis and Hildy's kind younger brother. He is a claimant to the throne, but drops out of the running early on because of his kindness. After the unification of Dalemark, Ynen becomes King Amil's Admiral-in-Chief and designs several steamships. =Undying= *The One (Adon, Amil, Oreth), the most powerful of the Undying. After being unbound by his granddaughter Tanaqui in The Spellcoats, the One took an oath to root out Kankredin from the land. *Kankredin, an evil magician intending to usurp the power and place of the One. In this book Kankredin, disguised as Maewen's horse, schemes to frustrate the restoration of monarchy in Dalemark by impersonating the One to Maewen and trying to force her to kill Mitt, the future king. *Cennoreth (Tanaqui, the Weaver), a legendary witch, mother of the Adon's second wife Manaliabrid, and weaver of Dalemark's past, present, and future. Cennoreth is Tanaqui from The Spellcoats. *Old Ammet (Alhammitt, Ynynen, the Earthshaker), one of the elder Undying. The Earth Shaker began assisting Mitt with his magic during the escape from the South (Drowned Ammet) and continued to help him during the quest for the Dalemark crown and the battle against the evil Kankredin.

This article describes the delimitation of the Alps as a whole and of subdivisions of the range, follows the course of the main chain of the Alps and discusses the lakes and glaciers found in the region. DEM-based shaded relief/hypsometric image of the Alps with the borders of the countries. The Alps form a large mountain range dominating Central Europe, including parts of Italy, France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Slovenia, Germany and possibly Hungary (if one includes the G√ºnser Gebirge or the √ñdenburger Gebirge in the Alps). In some areas, such as the edge of the Po Basin, the edge of the range is unambiguous, but where the Alps border on other mountainous or hilly regions, the border may be harder to place. These neighbouring ranges include the Apennines, the Massif Central, the Jura, the Black Forest, the B√∂hmerwald, the Carpathians, and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula. The boundary between the Apennines and the Alps is usually taken to be the Colle di Cadibona, at 435 m above sea level, above Savona on the Italian coast. The Rh√¥ne forms a clear boundary between the tectonically-formed Alps and the largely volcanically-formed Massif Central. Moving upstream, the Rh√¥ne turns to the east near Lyon, and passes to the south of the Jura range before reaching Lake Geneva. An area of flat ground reaches from there to Lake Neuch√¢tel, continuing the border, with the Jura to the north-west and the Alps to the south east. From Lake Neuch√¢tel to its confluence with the Rhine, the Aare forms the border. The Black Forest is separated from the Alps by the Rhine and Lake Constance, but exact delimitation is difficult in southern Germany, where the land gently slopes up to meet the mountains (known in German as the Schw√§bisch-Bayerisches Alpenvorland, the \\"Swabian-Bavarian pre-Alps\\"). In Austria, the Danube runs to the north of the Alps, separating it from the majority of the B√∂hmerwald, although some small areas, such as the Dunkelsteiner Wald south of the Wachau, belong geologically to the B√∂hmerwald despite being south of the Danube. The Wienerwald near Vienna forms the north-eastern corner of the Alps, and here the Danube passes at its closest to the Alps (see Viennese Basin). East of Vienna, only the Marchfeld, a 30-km wide flood plain separates the easternmost Alps from the Lesser Carpathians. After Vienna, the Pannonian Basin, a large area of steppe, meets the edge of the Alps, clearly delimiting the eastern limit of the Alps. The south-easternmost extension of the Alps is to be found in Slovenia, including Pohorje, the Kamnik Alps and the Julian Alps (the last being shared with Italy). The town of Idrija may be taken as marking the dividing line between the Alps to the north and the Karst plateau to the south, which then leads on to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula. The remainder of the southern edge of the Alps is clearly delimited by the basin of the Po. This delimitation of the Alps is, however, largely subjective and open to argument. In particular, some people restrict the use of the term \\"Alps\\" to the higher mountains in the centre of the range, relegating the surrounding hills and mountains to the status of \\"pre-Alps\\" or foothills. This can sometimes lead to conflicting definitions, such as Mont Ventoux being considered to lie outside the Alps (there are no comparably sized mountains around it, and it is at a considerable distance from the main chain of the Alps). It is also not possible to define the Alps geologically, since the same orogenous events that created the Alps also created neighbouring ranges such as the Carpathians. See also Geology of the Alps. The Alps are a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System physiographic division, but the Alps are composed of three distinct physiographic sections, the Eastern, Western and Southern Alps physiographic sections. Subdivisions While smaller groups within the Alps may be easily defined by the passes on either side, defining larger units can be problematic. A traditional divide exists between the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, which uses the Spl√ºgen Pass () on the Swiss-Italian border, together with the Rhine to the north and Lake Como in the south as the defining features. While the Spl√ºgen Pass is neither the lowest nor the most important pass in the Alps, it is approximately halfway along the main chain, and makes a convenient boundary. =Eastern Alps= The Eastern Alps are commonly subdivided according to the different lithology (rock composition) of the more central parts of the Alps and the groups at its northern and southern fringes: * Flysch zone (up from the Vienna Woods to the Bregenz Forest). * Northern Limestone Alps, peaks up to 3000 m; * Central Eastern Alps (Austria, Swiss), peaks up to 4050 m; * Southern Limestone Alps, peaks up to 3500 m. The border between the Central Eastern Alps and the Southern Limestone Alps is the Periadriatic Seam. The Northern Limestone Alps are separated from the Central Eastern Alps by the Grauwacken Zone. However, the geologic subdivision, based on tectonics, suggests a different system: * The Helvetic system in the north (including the Jura mountains, which do not geographically belong to the Alps), * the Penninic system: mainly Central Alps (Engadine and \\"Tauern window\\") and Flysch Alps, * the Austroalpine system: Northern Limestone Alps, Graywacke-Schist zone, Central Crystalline, * the Southern Alps (Southern Limestone Alps and other chains south of the Periadriatic Seam) * south of a huge geologic fault (\\"alpine-dinaric seam\\") parts of the Dinarides. =Western Alps= The Western Alps are commonly subdivided into the following: *Ligurian Alps (from Savona to Colle di Tenda) *Maritime Alps (from Colle di Tenda to Colle della Maddalena) *Cottian Alps (from Colle de la Maddalena to Montgenevre Pass) *Dauphin√© Alps (from Col du Mont Genevre to Col du Mont Cenis) *Graian Alps (from Col du Mont Cenis to the Col Ferret) *Chablais Alps (from Lake Geneva to the Col des Montets) *Pennine Alps (from Col Ferret to the Simplon Pass) *Lepontine Alps (from Simplon Pass to Spl√ºgen Pass) *Bernese Alps (north of the Rh√¥ne to the Grimsel Pass) *Urner Alps (from Grimsel Pass to the Reuss) *Glarus Alps (north-east of Oberalp Pass) *Appenzell Alps (north of Sargans) Within the Eastern Alps, the most widely used subdivision is the Alpine Club's 1984 classification, which divides the region into about seventy small areas. Main chain The \\"main chain of the Alps\\" follows the watershed from the Mediterranean to the Wienerwald, passing over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. The most important passes and peaks which it crosses are given below (mountains are indented, passes unindented). From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs westwards, before turning to the north-west and then, near the Colle de la Maddalena, to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-north-east, a heading it follows until its end near Vienna. *Colle di Cadibona (Italy, 435 m) *Colle di Tenda / Col de Tende (France / Italy, 1908 m) *Colle della Maddalena / Col du Larche (France / Italy, 1994 m) **Monte Viso (France / Italy, 3841 m) *Col de Montgen√®vre (France / Italy, 1854 m) *Col de Fr√©jus (France / Italy, 2537 m) *Col du Mont Cenis (France, 2084 m) **Aiguille de la Grande Sassi√®re (France / Italy, 3751 m) *Little St Bernard Pass (France / Italy, 2188 m) **Mont Blanc / Monte Bianco (France / Italy, 4810.45 m,Mont Blanc shrinks by 45cm in two years highest point in the Alps) *Great St. Bernard Pass (Switzerland / Italy, 2469 m) **Matterhorn / Monte Cervino (Switzerland / Italy, 4478 m) **Monte Rosa (Switzerland / Italy, 4634 m) *Simplon Pass (Switzerland, 2005 m) **Blinnenhorn (Switzerland / Italy, 3374 m) *Saint Gotthard Pass (Switzerland, 2044 m) **Rheinwaldhorn (Switzerland, 3402 m) *Spl√ºgen Pass / Passo dello Spluga (Switzerland / Italy, 2113 m) *Maloja Pass (Switzerland, 1809 m) **Piz Bernina (Switzerland / Italy, 4049 m) *Fuorn Pass (Switzerland, 2419 m) **Piz Sesvenna (Switzerland / Italy, 3205 m) *Reschen Pass (Austria / Italy, 1504 m) **Wei√ükugel (Austria / Italy, 3738 m) *Timmelsjoch / Passo del Rombo (Austria / Italy, 2491 m) **Zuckerh√ºtl (Austria, 3507 m, highest point in the Stubaier Alpen) *Brenner Pass (Austria / Italy, 1371 m) **Hochfeiler (Austria / Italy, 3509 m) **Gro√üvenediger (Austria, 3666 m) **Gro√üglockner (Austria, 3798 m, highest mountain in Austria) *Hochtor (Austria, 2575 m) **Ankogel (Austria, 3246 m) *Radst√§dter Tauern (Austria, 1739 m) **Hochgolling (Austria, 2863 m) *Schober Pass (Austria, 849 m) **Hochschwab (Austria, 2277 m) *Gerichtsberg (Austria, 581 m) **Sch√∂pfl (Austria, 893 m, highest point in the Wienerwald) *Danube, 160 m Some of the highest peaks in the Alps, however, fall to one side or other of the main chain.

For more detailed lists of passes, please see the articles about individual areas of the Alps. Glaciers Several glaciers are located in the Alps, the longest of which is the Aletsch Glacier in the Bernese Alps. They may be found in all of the higher groups of mountains from the Dauphin√© Alps in France to the Hohe Tauern in central Austria, and the main ascent routes on many of the highest mountains pass over glaciers. Lakes Very few large lakes are found within the body of the Alps, but a number are situated around the edge, particularly in areas formerly covered by glacier tongues. These include Lake Geneva on the northern side of the alps, on the French/Swiss border, Lago Maggiore, Lake Como and Lake Garda on the southern side of the Alps in Italy/Switzerland, and the lakes of Switzerland, southern Germany and the Austrian Salzkammergut in the north. Rivers The main drainage basins of the Alps are those of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube and the Po. These have as main tributaries: *Rhine: Aare, Reuss, posterior Rhine; *Rhone: Durance, Dr√¥me, Is√®re; *Danube: Sava, Drava, Mur, Enns, Inn; *Po: Oglio, Adda, Ticino, Dora Baltea. Other important rivers draining the Alps include the Var, Adige and Piave. The triple watershed Rhine-Rhone-Po is south of Furka Pass near the summit of the Witenwasserenstock, at ; the triple watershed Rhine-Po-Danube is at Lunghin Pass, Grisons (, 2645 m); the triple watershed Po-Danube-Adige is at the Swiss-Italian border, near the summit of Monte Forcola south of Val M√ºstair, at .

The area consists of low plain-land towards the Ayeyarwady River, and of undulating country inland rising higher and higher westwards towards the Arakan hills. Between the plain and the Arakan Yoma range is a distinct line of hills running north and south, and usually called the Nwa-Madaung hills. The submontane valleys are largely cultivated, but are deadly except to those born in them. The chief streams besides the Ayeyarwady are the Mon, the Maw, and the Salin, which are largely used for irrigation. At Minbu the Ayeyarwady is wide, with many islands and sandbanks. There are considerable fisheries along the Ayeyarwady and on the Paunglin Lake, which is a lagoon fed from the Ayeyarwady. Oil has been discovered near the mud volcanoes of Minbu, but it seems to lie at too great a depth to be profitably worked. There is a large area of reserved forest near Minbu. The chief crops raised are rice, gram, millet, beans, peas, sesamum and tobacco. The betel- vine is largely cultivated along the Mon River. The annual rainfall varies greatly in the area. It is very considerable on and under the Arakari Yomas, and very slight towards the Ayeyarwady. The temperature rises to over in the hot months, and the mean of minimum in December is about . Points of interest *Shinbin Sekkeinte Pagoda *Nagapwet Mountain *Man Shwe Settaw Pagoda =Minbu Shwe Settaw= Shwe Settaw Pagoda festival A pair of Buddha's footprints are located in Settawya, a forest retreat which is west of Minbu on the opposite bank of Magwe and is from Yangon by road. The footprints are well preserved and shrines have been constructed nearby. The place is known as the Pagoda site of the forest. The pilgrimage is combined with photography for young people, as the scenery is picturesque. One can go there also by Minbu- A Road following branches lane at post. The site is on the river Man. The festival is held on the fifth waxing moon of the Myanmar calendar month, Tabodwe (February and March) annually. Many people, from different parts of the country, gather there and make meritorious deeps singly or collectively. On the way from Minbu, visitors can pay homage to Sandalwood Monastery at Legging where the Lord Buddha had visited in his lifetime. The history of that Footprint Pagoda dated back to the time of Buddha. Once the Lord Buddha came to that site in the country of Sunapranta. He met the Orahat Sicca Vanda and Naga Nammada on his way and on their humble request, the lord granted their reverence. The footprints were enshrined ever since. The lower footprint on the slat is under water during the monsoon months as the river Man is flooded. Therefore, the festival is celebrated in the later winter months. Minbu is very hot in summer. There are series of stalls marketing different things for the pilgrims and villagers nearly. The souvenirs can be bought there also. Minbu new market is very cheap to buy things. Shops are sell with wholesale price. A lot of motorcycles are going around in Minbu. People use motorcycles for their transportation.

Together with her sister ship, , these were the first protected cruisers acquired by the Imperial Japanese Navy.Evans, Kaigun, p. 14. The name Naniwa comes from an ancient name for Osaka, which appears in the Nara period chronicle Nihon Shoki. She played a major role in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95. Background The revolutionary design of the \\"Elswick\\" protected cruiser, initially developed as a private-venture by Armstrong Whitworth in the mid-1880s, and implemented in the cruiser Esmeralda for the Chilean Navy (subsequently purchased by Japan as ) was of great interest to Japan because of its high speed, powerful armament, armor protection and relatively low cost, especially since the Imperial Japanese Navy lacked the resources at the time to purchase modern pre-dreadnought battleships.Brooke, Warships for Export page 58‚Äì60 Pioneering Japanese naval architect Sas≈ç Sach≈´ requested that Armstrong Whitworth make modifications to the Esmeralda design to customize it for Japanese requirements, and two vessels, Naniwa and Takachiho were ordered under the 1883 fiscal year budget. When completed, Naniwa was considered the most advanced and most powerful cruiser in the world.Evans, Kaigun, p. 15.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Design The design of Naniwa and Takachiho was based on a steel hull with high freeboard to increase seaworthiness. Compared with Izumi, the armor was stronger and the coal bunkers formed an additional shield around critical areas. The hull was split into multiple watertight compartments, with a double bottom. Both ships were equipped with naval rams as was standard for the time.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, p. 226‚Äì227. Propulsion was by two horizontal two-cylinder double expansion steam engines, with six cylindrical boilers, which provided for a design speed of . Left elevation and deck plan As built, her main armament initially consisted of two 260 mm (10.3 in) L/35 Krupp cannons mounted individually on rotating platforms in the bow and stern, with a supply of 200 rounds per gun. Secondary armament was initially six L/35 Krupp cannons mounted in semi-circular sponsons on the main deck, with 450 rounds per gun. Light armament included six QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss guns, ten 1-inch Nordenfelt guns and four 11 mm, 10-barrel Nordenfelt guns. In addition, there were four Whitehead torpedo tubes mounted on the main deck. After the First Sino-Japanese War, both Naniwa and Takachiho were re-armed with eight Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval guns in order to increase stability and standardize on ammunition for the fleet. Service record =Early years= Naniwa arrived at Shinagawa, Tokyo on 26 June 1886. She was the first warship purchased by Japan overseas to be brought to Japan with an entirely Japanese crew. Her chief equipping officer was future Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki, who oversaw final acceptance testing and was her first captain. During the naval review of February 1887, Emperor Meiji boarded Naniwa in Tokyo, and rode her to Yokohama. In 1887 In 1893, Naniwa and Takachiho made two voyages to Honolulu, Hawaii to provide protection for Japanese citizens and to indicate Japanese concern during the Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by American marines and colonists. During the second voyage, marines from Naniwa and the Royal Navy's cruiser were asked to land to defend their respective citizens during the \\"Black Week\\" hysteria, when the Provisional Government of Hawaii feared invasion by the United States to restore the legitimate government. During the confusion created by the revolution, a Japanese who had been convicted of murder escaped from prison in Honolulu, and sought refuge on Naniwa. Captain T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç's refused to hand the convict over to authorities from the Provisional Government, citing that his ship was Japanese territory and that the government of Japan did not recognize the authority of the new government nearly caused a diplomatic incident between Japan and the United States. =First Sino-Japanese War= Prior to the official declaration of war in First Sino-Japanese War, and under the command of Captain (later Fleet Admiral) T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, Naniwa sank the British transport ship Kowshing at the Battle of Pungdo. Kowshing was working under contract for the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet ferrying Chinese reinforcements towards Korea. The sinking caused a diplomatic incident between Japan and Great Britain, but it was recognized by British jurists as being in conformity with international law of the time.Paine, The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895: Perception, Power, and Primacy page 133-134 Later in the First Sino-Japanese War, Naniwa was in combat during the critical Battle of the Yalu River, where as part of Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki's \\"flying squadron\\" including , and , she assisted in sinking the Imperial Beiyang Fleet cruisers and . During the battle, Naniwa took a hit from a 210 mm shell, which did virtually no damage. Naniwa was subsequently used in patrols of the Bay of Bohai and in operations off of Port Arthur. During the Battle of Weihaiwei, she bombarded the coastal forts guarding the Beiyang Fleet navy base. Naniwa was among the Japanese fleet units that took part in the invasion of Taiwan in 1895, and saw action on 3 June and 13 October 1895, during the respective bombardments of the Chinese coastal forts at Keelung and Takow (Kaohsiung). Her captain at the time was future admiral Kataoka Shichir≈ç. =Interwar years= In 1898 Naniwa was again sent to Hawaii in a show of force from 20 April ‚Äì 26 September 1897, when the new Republic of Hawaii banned Japanese immigration and anti-Japanese sentiment appeared to endanger the Japanese population. Naniwa was re-designated as a 2nd-class cruiser on 21 March 1898, and was based in Taiwan, partly as a counterpoint to the build-up of American forces in Asia during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. From 1898‚Äì1900, her role was primarily to patrol the sea lanes between Taipei and Manila. She was subsequently assigned to help cover the landings of Japanese forces in China during the Boxer Rebellion at the end of 1900. Around 1900-1901, her main battery and secondary battery of Krupp guns was replaced with smaller Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval guns for stability, and for standardization of ammunition with other ships of the Japanese Navy. =Russo- Japanese War= During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05, Naniwa was based at Tsushima, and participated in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, against the forward deployed units of the Imperial Russian Navy in Korea. On 10 March 1904, Takachiho and Naniwa assisted in the blockade of the Russian Pacific Squadron within the confines of Port Arthur and subsequent naval Battle of Port Arthur. During the Battle off Ulsan, Naniwa assisted in the sinking of the Russian cruiser , and in the rescue of her survivors.Howarth, The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun Naniwa was subsequently assigned to the Fourth Division of the Combined Fleet, where she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Ury≈´ Sotokichi during the crucial Battle of Tsushima, where she took damage on both days of the battle. =Final years and loss= After the end of the Russo- Japanese War, Naniwa was assigned to patrol of the northern seas around Hokkaid≈ç. On 26 June 1912, while on a surveying mission mapping the coastline of the Kurile Islands, she ran aground on the coast of Urup at . Efforts to refloat her were abandoned on 12 July 1912.

The system was first noted on December 23, 2002 as a tropical depression that had developed, within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the east of Tuvalu. Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards and crossed the International Dateline early on December 25. After this the system became better organized and was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Zoe later that day. Zoe subsequently rapidly intensified in very favorable conditions as it continued to move west- southwest towards the Solomon Islands. The system subsequently became a Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale on December 27. The system subsequently affected the Solomon Islands Temotu Province during that day, before it peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . As the system peaked, it performed a small clockwise cyclonic loop within the vicinity of Tikopia island, as a result of the steering flow over the cyclone becoming weak and variable. The system subsequently started to move towards the southeast during December 29, in response to a strengthening steering flow, provided by an upper level trough of low pressure and a baroclinic system near New Caledonia. Over the next few days the system weakened and degenerated into a tropical depression during January 1, 2003. The system was subsequently last noted during January 4, while it was located to the southeast of New Caledonia. Cyclone Zoe severely affected areas of Rotuma, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Heavy rainfall and strong winds were particularly disastrous to the Solomon Islands, especially on the islands of Anuta and Tikopia. There, numerous crops and fruit‚Äìbearing trees were destroyed. Beaches were also heavily eroded due to the high waves generated by the cyclone. Although effects were lesser in Vanuatu, the country's northernmost islands experienced heavy flooding and beaches destroyed by high waves. After this usage of the name Zoe, the name was retired. Meteorological history The origins of Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe can be traced back to a convective cloud cluster, that had developed by December 22, within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the north of the Samoan Islands. The system subsequently emerged out of the South Pacific Convergence Zone and was classified as Tropical Depression 04F, while it was located to the east of Funafuti in Tuvalu. Over the next couple of days the system was steered towards the west-southwest, under the influence of a mid-level subtropical ridge of high pressure. After the depression had crossed the International Dateline early on December 25, atmospheric convection surrounding 04F increased and the system became better organized. At this time vertical wind shear over the system rapidly decreased, while the systems outflow significantly improved. As a result, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, before they initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Later that day at 21:00 UTC (08:00 December 26 SIT) the FMS reported that the depression had become a Category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Zoe. At this time the system was located about to the northwest of the Fijian Dependency; Rotuma and moving westwards at about . After being named, Zoe intensified very rapidly in very favorable conditions and became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone by 12:00 UTC (23:00 SIT) on December 26. Zoe's eye subsequently became obvious on both visible and infrared satellite imagery, while the system continued to intensify and became a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone during December 27. During December 27, the JTWC reported that Zoe had become equivalent to a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale as it peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 285 km/h (180 mph) and passed about to the southeast of the Solomon Island: Anuta. Zoe subsequently turned towards the southwest and passed in between the Solomon Islands of Anuta and Fataka, as the subtropical ridge weakened in response to an upper level trough of low pressure over the Tasman Sea. Early on December 28, the FMS estimated that the system had peaked as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and a minimum pressure of . By this time the steering flow over the cyclone had become weak and variable, as the system passed within of the island of Tikopia. As a result, Zoe virtually stalled and performed a small clockwise cyclonic loop, within the vicinity of Tikopia, however, the eye of the system did not pass over the island. During December 29, after the system had stalled, Zoe started to move towards the southeast in response to the strengthening steering flow, provided by an upper level trough of low pressure and a baroclinic system near New Caledonia. Over the next couple of days the system rapidly weakened under the influence of: strengthening vertical wind shear, dry air and cooler sea surface temperatures. During December 31, as the system continued its southeastwards movement, it passed about to the southwest of Nadi, Fiji as a Category 2 tropical cyclone. By this time the system was transitioning into an extra tropical cyclone, while deep convection surrounding the system had significantly diminished. As a result of further weakening, the JTWC issued their final warning on Zoe during January 1, 2003, while the FMS reported that Zoe had weakened into a tropical depression. The system was subsequently recurved and started to move towards the southwest during January 2, before it was declared extratropical as it interacted with an extratropical low which was located over the Tasman Sea. Zoe was subsequently last noted by the FMS during January 4, while it was located about to the southeast of Noumea, New Caledonia. =Intensity= At its peak intensity Zoe was estimated by the FMS to be a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and a minimum pressure of . Zoe was the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere until a 2017 reanalysis of Cyclone Winston estimated a minimum pressure of , surpassing Zoe. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 285 km/h (180 mph) and a minimum pressure of . Both of these intensity estimates were based on a subjective application of the Dvorak technique, as there were no direct observations of the system's intensity. Preparations and impact Cyclone Zoe near Vanuatu on December 29 Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe primarily affected the Solomon Islands of Anuta, Tikopia, Vanikoro, Utupua and the uninhabited island of Fatutaka between December 27‚Äì30, 2002. The system and associated trough of low pressure, subsequently impacted Fiji and the northern islands of Vanuatu. However, there were no deaths reported, as a result of Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe. As a result of the impact of this system, the name Zoe was retired from the South Pacific tropical cyclone naming lists by the World Meteorological Organization. Early on December 26, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane started to issue warnings to support the meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. TCWC Brisbane cancelled their advisories for the Solomon Islands, late on December 29 while RSMC Nadi continued to issue advisories for Vanuatu until early the next day. Due to a number of problems with the Solomon Islands Weather Service, such as the rent not being paid on the offices they were working out of and the supply of electricity being unreliable, TCWC Brisbane sent the first advisory directly to the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC), so they could broadcast them through its network. These were broadcast in English only. After confirmation that the warnings were being received by the SIBC, TCWC Brisbane started to pass warnings to them every 3 hours. The next day Radio Australia was contacted so that arrangements could be made for them to receive and broadcast the warnings. Initial concerns that warning messages had not gotten through arose because there was no two-way radio communication with people on either Tikopia or Anuta, thus authorities had no way of knowing what information people had received and no other way of informing them. However, when communications were restored after the cyclone threat had passed it was discovered that some of the warnings had been received when a shortwave reception was available at various times, until late on December 27 when communications were cut. Those people who could not understand the warnings, were advised by runners who went from hut to hut and to churches to advise people about the oncoming storm, People started preparing straight away cutting Palm fronds and banana trunks in an attempt to support and strengthen roofs and walls. Celebrations to celebrate the new year were cancelled, or moved into communal huts with people sheltering indoors. There were no attempts to evacuate until Zoe had become so intense that dwellings were threatened with imminent inundation or had begun to break up. Although Zoe never met large land masses, it did affect several inhabited islands which had a total population of around 1700. The most severe damage wrought by Zoe took place on Tikopia which was completely decimated. Across Tikopia, no home was left standing after waves along with winds battered the small island. According to press reports, the island was faced with total devastation and all that remained was \\"just sand and debris.\\" Five days after the storm struck, there were fears of substantial loss of life as no contact had been made with the hardest hit islands. A photographer who took images of the devastation from the air, stated that it would be a miracle if there was not a large loss of life. On Anuta 90% of houses remained intact, and 70% of crops undamaged. Communication was lost with the island for a week. Vanuatu was inundated with seawater with villagers collecting fish from their village greens. =Fiji= During December 26, the FMS issued a strong wind warning for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma, where periods of heavy rain, squally thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to were expected. The strong wind warning was subsequently cancelled two days later, before further strong wind warnings were issued for the Fijian islands of Viti Levu, Yasawa, Mamanuca, Kadavu, Vatulele and nearby smaller islands as the system moved south-eastwards during December 30. During the following day, Zoe passed about to the west of Nadi on the island of Viti Levu, before the strong wind warnings were cancelled as 2003 opened. The system produced heavy rain over most of the Fijian islands, as well as strong to marginal gale-force winds, over western and southwestern parts of the island nation. People who lived along the southwestern coasts of Viti Levu reported seeing large waves out to sea, however, according to the FMS none of these waves inundated land areas. There was also no damage was recorded in Fiji from Zoe. Aftermath Within days of Zoe's passage, the government of the Solomon Islands declared the affected islands disaster zones. Relief supplies were sent from Honiara by January 5 and international aid followed shortly thereafter. Requests for assistance from New Zealand, Australia and France were made by the Solomon Islands. For nearly a week, residents on Tikopia survived without aid by drinking coconut milk and eating what remained of their food stocks. The first relief vessel finally arrived in the island on January 6, bringing medical supplies and food. Although the island's residents had no warning prior to Zoe's arrival, it was found that they took notice of natural warning signs and sought shelter in caves, resulting in no loss of life. Additional supplies were shipped to Anuta on January 6 by a local ship. Supplies were delayed for days by Solomon Island police as they requested further pay before shipping supplies to the islands. Against the millions of dollars pledged by Australia, only $270,000 had been provided by January 4.

It consists mainly of residential dwellings. History The suburb of Cooloongup, first named in 1974, is named after Lake Cooloongup. The name Lake Cooloongup was first recorded by Surveyor AC Gregory in 1843. While Landgate has noted that it is an Aboriginal name, it has also claimed that the meaning of the name is not known. An elder of the Nyungar people, the traditional Aboriginal occupants of the area, has said that Cooloongup means \\"place of children\\". It is also suggested that Cool moon lgup refers to the moon and its similarities to the white saltlakes of the same name. The Noongar word for moon was not known at the time of European settlement which led to the belief that cool moon look up was not known. Simply it could be known as the place of moon people.Walley T.

Geography Lake Cooloongup dominates the Eastern portion of Cooloongup. The lake and its immediate environment, together with Lake Walyungup and Lake Richmond, is incorporated into Rockingham Lakes Regional Park. The Park is managed by the Government of Western Australia via its Department of Environment and Conservation.Department of Environment and Conservation - Home The lake is shallow and water in the lake is saline. The lake is described as \\"seasonable\\" because the lake is dry of surface water the majority of the year. The dry white salt residue gives this lake, together with its neighbour Lake Walyungup, the title \\"White Lakes\\" which was the name used to refer to the locality before the lake was incorporated into Cooloongup. Transport Ennis Avenue (National Highway 1) bisects Cooloongup; this road provides vehicle access to Perth, Fremantle and Mandurah. The eastern part of Cooloongup, known as Woodbridge, currently has only one vehicle access point (Elanora Drive). The Rockingham Kwinana Development Office is progressing plans to construct a second access road to Woodbridge.RKDO Additional Access to Woodbridge Estate A number of Transperth bus routes service Cooloongup; all buses operate from Rockingham Train Station. Facilities Rockingham General Hospital, a major regional public hospital, is located on Elanora Drive. The hospital is owned and operated by the State Government of Western Australia via its Department of Health.Department of Health Rockingham Golf Club,Rockingham Golf Club (Inc) website first established in 1947, is located in Cooloongup at the East end of Elanora Drive. The club was re-located there in 1985 from its previous location on Patterson Road (Corner Read Street), Rockingham. The Rockingham site was redeveloped and sub-divided into residential lots. Hourglass Reserve, so named because of its shape, has been developed as a purpose built baseball park (north portion) and athletics field (south portion) servicing the local region.

Some wetlands have been absorbed into the Port Kennedy golf course and the remainder are protected in the Port Kennedy Scientific Park. The Threatened Ecological Community FCT19, Sedgelands in Holocene Dune Swales, is known to occur in these wetlands. History Port Kennedy is named after a feature in the southeastern corner of Warnbro Sound which was initially named by Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe in 1859 after the Governor of Western Australia (1855‚Äì1862), Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy. On 17 November 1953, a Townsite of Port Kennedy was declared. However, when the suburb was named in 1974, it was named Becher after Point Becher, located within its boundaries. On 1 June 1990, the suburb was renamed Port Kennedy. Education Port Kennedy Primary School opened in 1996 and is part of the Department of Education and Training's Peel District. Initially, with an enrollment of 300 students, the school has grown to about 670 (2009) with a staff of approximately 55.

Recreational attractions Because of its mild, child-safe, sheltered beach, Safety Bay became a popular family holiday venue early in the 20th century. Today, in addition, its boat-launching facilities are utilised by recreational sailors and anglers. An adjoining beach at Shoalwater is used by windsurfers and kitesurfers. The bay lies wholly within the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, a pristine habitat for a rich variety of birds and marine life centred on Penguin Island. Local boat cruise operators offer opportunities to see wildlife including dolphins, whales, sea lions and penguins. The district is well served by shops, pubs and restaurants and is close to numerous technical product and service outlets in the comprehensive light-industrial estates on and around Rockingham's Dixon Road. Transport Safety Bay is served by an excellent road network including the nearby Kwinana Freeway by which Perth (50 km to the NNE) can be reached in about 45 minutes by car. The port city of Fremantle is a 30-minute drive to the north and the resort city of Mandurah is 20 minutes to the south. Those destinations are also served by bus routes which connect with the Perth-Rockingham-Mandurah rail service. The rail journey to Perth from RockinghamTransperth information for Rockingham and Warnbro takes 33 minutes, with trains at 10-minute intervals in peak time.

In contrast, the other sense, touch, is a somatic sense which does not have a specialized organ but comes from all over the body, most noticeably the skin but also the internal organs (viscera). Touch includes mechanoreception (pressure, vibration and proprioception), pain (nociception) and heat (thermoception), and such information is carried in general somatic afferents and general visceral afferents.Drake et al. (2010), Gray's Anatomy for Students, 2nd Ed., Churchill Livingstone. Vision Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment. The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight, sight, or vision (adjectival form: visual, optical, or ocular). The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system. The visual system in animals allows individuals to assimilate information from their surroundings. The act of seeing starts when the cornea and then the lens of the eye focuses light from its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina is actually part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. Based on feedback from the visual system, the lens of the eye adjusts its thickness to focus light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, also known as the rods and cones, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed via complex feedforward and feedback processes by different parts of the brain, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain. Note that up until now much of the above paragraph could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and things more primitive; anything with a more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the superior colliculus. The perception of objects and the totality of the visual scene is accomplished by the visual association cortex. The visual association cortex combines all sensory information perceived by the striate cortex which contains thousands of modules that are part of modular neural networks. The neurons in the striate cortex send axons to the extrastriate cortex, a region in the visual association cortex that surrounds the striate cortex. The human visual system perceives visible light in the range of wavelengths between 370 and 730 nanometers (0.00000037 to 0.00000073 meters) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hearing Hearing, or auditory perception, is the ability to perceive sound by detecting vibrations,Schacter, Daniel L. et al.,[\\"Psychology\\"],\\"Worth Publishers\\",2011 changes in the pressure of the surrounding medium through time, through an organ such as the ear. Sound may be heard through solid, liquid, or gaseous matter. It is one of the traditional five senses; partial or total inability to hear is called hearing loss. In humans and other vertebrates, hearing is performed primarily by the auditory system: mechanical waves, known as vibrations are detected by the ear and transduced into nerve impulses that are perceived by the brain (primarily in the temporal lobe). Like touch, audition requires sensitivity to the movement of molecules in the world outside the organism. Both hearing and touch are types of mechanosensation. There are three main components of the human ear: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. Smell Smell, or olfaction, is a chemoreception that forms the sense of smell. Olfaction has many purposes, such as the detection of hazards, pheromones, and food. It integrates with other senses to form the sense of flavor. Olfaction occurs when odorants bind to specific sites on olfactory receptors located in the nasal cavity. Glomeruli aggregate signals from these receptors and transmit them to the olfactory bulb, where the sensory input will start to interact with parts of the brain responsible for smell identification, memory, and emotion. Often, land organisms will have separate olfaction systems for smell and taste (orthonasal smell and retronasal smell), but water-dwelling organisms usually have only one system. In vertebrates, smells are sensed by olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is made up of at least six morphologically and biochemically different cell types.Doty, R. L. (2001). Olfaction. 425. The proportion of olfactory epithelium compared to respiratory epithelium (not innervated, or supplied with nerves) gives an indication of the animal's olfactory sensitivity. Humans have about of olfactory epithelium, whereas some dogs have . A dog's olfactory epithelium is also considerably more densely innervated, with a hundred times more receptors per square centimeter. Molecules of odorants passing through the superior nasal concha of the nasal passages dissolve in the mucus that lines the superior portion of the cavity and are detected by olfactory receptors on the dendrites of the olfactory sensory neurons. This may occur by diffusion or by the binding of the odorant to odorant-binding proteins. The mucus overlying the epithelium contains mucopolysaccharides, salts, enzymes, and antibodies (these are highly important, as the olfactory neurons provide a direct passage for infection to pass to the brain). This mucus acts as a solvent for odor molecules, flows constantly, and is replaced approximately every ten minutes. Taste Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis.What Are Taste Buds? kidshealth.orgHuman biology (Page 201/464) Daniel D. Chiras. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2005. The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000Boron, W.F., E.L. Boulpaep. 2003. Medical Physiology. 1st ed. Elsevier Science USA. taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami. Scientific experiments have proven that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another. Taste buds are able to differentiate among different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, umami, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th Edition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354 The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth‚Äîother factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose;Smell - The Nose Knows washington.edu, Eric H.

As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.Why do two great tastes sometimes not taste great together? scientificamerican.com. Dr. Tim Jacob, Cardiff University. 22 May 2009. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons. Among humans, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. Humans can also have distortion of tastes through dysgeusia. Not all mammals share the same taste senses: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness but can taste ATP, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste senses.

Sarracenia purpurea, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, northern pitcher plant, turtle socks, or side-saddle flower, is a carnivorous plant in the family Sarraceniaceae. Distribution Its range includes the Eastern seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States, the Great Lakes region, all of Canada (except Nunavut and Yukon), Washington state, and Alaska. USDA Distribution map of Sarracenia purpurea That makes it the most common and broadly distributed pitcher plant, as well as the only member of the genus that inhabits cold temperate climates. The species is the floral emblem of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The species was introduced into bogs in parts of Ireland, where it has proliferated. It is an introduced and naturalized species in northern California. It is found in habitats of the native carnivorous species Darlingtonia californica, in the Klamath Mountains and northern Sierra Nevada. Jepson Manual eFlora (TJM2) treatment of Sarracenia purpurea ‚àí naturalized distribution in California Description Like other species of Sarracenia, S. purpurea obtains most of its nutrients through prey capture. However, prey acquisition is said to be inefficient, with less than 1% of the visiting prey captured within the pitcher. Even so, anecdotal evidence by growers often shows that pitchers quickly fill up with prey during the warm summer months. Prey fall into the pitcher and drown in the rainwater that collects in the base of each leaf. Prey items such as flies, ants, spiders, and even moths, are then digested by an invertebrate community, made up mostly by the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii and the midge Metriocnemus knabi. The relationship between W. smithii and S. purpurea is an example of commensalism.C. Michael Hogan. 2011. Commensalism. Topic Ed. M.Mcginley. Ed-in-chief C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth.

New pitcher leaves do produce digestive enzymes such as hydrolases and proteases, but as the individual leaves get older into their second year, digestion of prey material is aided by the community of bacteria that live within the pitchers.Rice, Barry. (2007). About Sarracenia purpurea, the purple pitcher plant. The Carnivorous Plant FAQ. Accessed online: 21 June 2008. Taxonomy The species is further divided into two subspecies, S. purpurea subsp. purpurea and S. purpurea subsp. venosa. The former is found from New Jersey north, while the latter is found from New Jersey south and tolerates warmer temperatures. In 1999, Sarracenia purpurea subsp. venosa var. burkii was described as a species of its own: Sarracenia rosea. This re-ranking has been debated among carnivorous plant enthusiasts since then, but further morphological evidence has supported the split.

The novel deals with questions of racial, linguistic and gender identity in interconnected ways. Plot introduction Breath, Eyes, Memory was Danticat's first novel, published when she was only twenty-five years old. As she has recounted in interviews, the book began as an essay of her childhood in Haiti and her move as a young girl to New York City. The novel is written in a first person narrative. The narrator, Sophie Caco, relates her direct experiences and impressions from age 12 until she is in her twenties. Sophie is the product of a violent rape and is raised by her loving aunt in a village near Port-au- Prince for 12 years. At this point, Sophie is unexpectedly summoned by her mother, who lives in Brooklyn having gained asylum and immigrated to the United States. Living with her mother in New York, Sophie discovers the trauma her mother endures inclusive of violent nightmares reminiscent of her experience prior to fleeing Haiti. The major conflict of the novel is the main character's battle with her inner self. Because she is a child of rape (her mother had been raped at the young age of 16 by an unknown man), she is a reminder to her mother of the wounds that had been inflicted on her. Her mother as a result of the rape remained this wounded but very resilient woman. Her mother came to resent her own self and body and constantly has nightmares about the rape. This, along with the fact that Sophie's mother practiced the act of testing (which is when she basically checks on her daughter to make sure that her daughter is still a virgin), causes Sophie to grow into the same type of woman as her mother. She grows into a woman who fights a battle with herself as a woman, wife, mother, as well as daughter. She is also in turn fighting the weight of her inheritance, as well as her mother's past experiences. The rising action of the story is when Sophie leaves Haiti at age twelve to join her mother in the United States in New York. Sophie, despite her mother's warnings to focus on school and no men, falls in love with Joseph, a musician who lives next door to them. Sophie is caught one night by her mother when she returns home late. Her mother in turn begins testing her constantly to make sure she is still a virgin. Depression causes Sophie to act irrationally. One night she decides to impale herself with her mother's spice pestle so she can fail the test. When she fails her mother's test, she is thrown out of the house. She then elopes with Joseph and they marry. The climax of the story comes after she marries Joseph. Sophie begins to feel frustrated and confused, both by anxieties and responsibilities. To get away from it all, she flees to Haiti along with her infant daughter, without a word to her husband, Joseph, who is away touring. The falling action is when her mother, Martine, also comes to Haiti. Sophie hadn't spoken to her mother since her mother had thrown her out the house when she had failed the virginity test. That was about two years earlier. It is during that trip to Haiti that both mother and daughter reconcile. They return to New York and all seems well, until Sophie's mother becomes pregnant by her fianc√©, Marc, and in turn commits suicide. Testing \\"Testing\\" has been a Haitian tradition for centuries. During earlier times, Haitians associated the idea of virtue with a woman's virginity. A young woman growing up in a Haitian household is encouraged to value her virtue and virginity. The novel describes how family values and virtue of women are very important to the Haitian culture. The main character, Sophie, is shattered throughout the novel, due to the traumatic experience of her mother's continuous tests. Her mother would often test her vagina to make sure she was still a virgin. These tests leave a dynamic scar on Sophie even after she marries Joseph. She has low self-esteem as a result of these tests. The tests also lead to a deterioration in the relationship between mother and daughter. When she marries Joseph, she is unable to have sex with him because she has a phobia of sex. The only way she is ever able to make love to him is through ‚Äúdoubling‚Äù: She must pretend she isn't really there because the very act of sex so repels her.

The full loop is approximately in circumference and has an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) twice, once on the north side of Marietta and once on the south side. The southern segment of the road is designated as a part of SR 120 and the northern segment forms SR 120 Alternate (SR 120 Alt.). SR 5 is concurrent with SR 120 Alt. until the intersection with SR 120, and then with SR 120 for a short distance before continuing south.  Route description   History  SR 120 Loop was built over an approximately 20-year span from 1967 to 1989. The first sections complete and open to traffic extended east of US 41 and included the interchanges with then-new I-75, and with mainline SR 120\\\\. While the northern part went through what is still farmland , the southern part went through existing neighborhoods, destroying several homes and cutting-off several streets, much like I-75 had done previously. Initially, mainline SR 120 followed what is now the northern part of the loop between Roswell Road and US 41: a move that resulted in the removal of the portion of SR 120 from US 41 at the Big Chicken to the eastern SR 120 Loop interchange. This was changed in the early 1970s to the configuration still known to locals today. The northern portion of the Loop is distinct in that it ended at a partial diamond interchange at US 41 (then SR 3E, now SR 3), with the roadway built-up for a future full interchange. Work did not commence again on the remainder of the highway until the late 1970s. Work to upgrade Clay Street from US 41 to SR 360 (Powder Springs Street) included a relocation of part of the street to an underpass beneath the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now CSX, originally Western and Atlantic Railroad). When work was completed, it finished the southern half of the route and the highway was extended. Clay Street would later be renamed South Marietta Parkway with exception to Old Clay Street, which remains as a residential street connecting the Loop to SR 5 (Atlanta Street). Northwest of Manget Street, the highway went diagonally through existing neighborhoods, again destroying several homes. Atlanta Street was severed, but Atlanta Road was built next to it on its west side, taking more homes. Part of Powder Springs Street was permanently torn out, leaving the rest of it north to the town square as Old Powder Springs Street. The relocated Powder Springs Street was angled off to the west to become the western section of the Loop, and was extended north just past Whitlock Avenue to Polk Street. SR 5 and SR 120 Loop concurrent in Marietta Work began again in the early 1980s to complete most of the northern quadrant when the roadway was extended from the previously- mentioned diamond interchange to connect to and take over Page Street. The planned overpass of US 41 was never built and an at-grade intersection was put there instead. However, the ramps still curiously remain, with the southern (eastbound) one actually used as an entrance ramp, and the northern (westbound) one connecting to Barnes Mill Road instead. Page Street had previously ended at Fairground Street, and the extension completed all parts of the loop except one final part. 1989 saw completion of the final leg of the loop at its northwestern corner, going west past Church Street (by then a one- way street which at the time was SR 5 southbound). This portion took out the Williams Brothers Lumber Company, and involved building an entrenched roadway with an overpass for Kennesaw Avenue (the original US 41 and SR 3) and the L&N; Railroad, with the roadway tying into the extension of the new Powder Springs Street, which previously ended at Polk Street. The completion of this final leg resulted in the completion of the loop. In addition, SR 5 was relocated out of downtown Marietta onto part of the new loop to the west; it was later rerouted through a completely different city, going down Austell Road instead of Powder Springs Road, and may be rerouted yet again off of the loop and completely away from Marietta onto Barrett Parkway. In October 2007, the portion of SR 120 along Roswell Street between US 41 and SR 5 and SR 120 Loop was downgraded to a local city street, along with portions of SR 5\\\\. Since SR 120 required a new routing, SR 120 mainline was moved to the southern part of SR 120 Loop, and SR 120 Alternate was created on the north loop. As a result, SR 120 Loop no longer exists, though only some of the signs have been changed, leaving a hodgepodge of confusing and contradictory information in different places, in addition to there being no public notice of the change by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). Compared to the northern route, the new routing takes mainline SR 120 around Marietta the indirect way, making it a longer distance by going out of the way to the south and back north, causing drivers to turn on a different road to stay on the same highway at a third point at Powder Springs Road (in addition to either end where it turns off to original route), and causing further driving delays with more traffic lights. In January 2008, GDOT crews began discreetly changing and removing signs along SR 120 Loop and the SR 120 mainline. The remaining state- maintained part of Roswell Road between the eastern intersection with the loop and US 41 was renumbered SR 3 Connector, the previous designation of a completely different road in Marietta. SR 5 currently shares the west end of the Loop, west from Cherokee Street (northbound only) to Church Street (southbound only), southwest to Whitlock Avenue, south to Powder Springs Road, and turning east at that intersection to Atlanta Road. This is a complete roundabout and unnecessary routing, since Atlanta Road turns into Cherokee Street via East Park Square (the street's name for one block along the town square), and since Church Street / West Park Square / Old Powder Springs Street connects to it at a one-way cross street.  Names  Along the north side from Whitlock Avenue (where SR 120 continues west, becoming Dallas Highway), northeast to Church Street, east to Roswell Road, and southeast to Lower Roswell Road, it is known as North Marietta Parkway. Much of this route used to be known as Page Street. Almost all of it is in the county's northeast quadrant for street addresses, except west of Church Street where it is northwest. Along the west side from Whitlock Avenue south to the \\"new\\" Powder Springs Street, then east to Atlanta Road, southeast to Manget Street, east to I-75, then northeast to Lower Roswell Road, it is known as South Marietta Parkway. Much of this route used to be known as Clay Street. Almost all of it is in the county's southeast quadrant for street addresses, except west of the railroad tracks where it is southwest.  Purpose  Its main purpose is as a bypass route around the central business district of Marietta, like most loop roads. However, it is also a common surface street for locals. The two main interchanges with I-75 in Marietta are along this road in the eastern part of Marietta.

It was first published in 1957, and received the Newbery Medal the following year. Set during the American Civil War, the plot revolves around the fictional sixteen-year-old Jefferson Davis Bussey, who is caught up in the events of history. Actual historical personages (e.g. Generals Stand Watie and James G. Blunt) and battles (e.g. Wilson's Creek and Prairie Grove) are seen from the viewpoint of an ordinary soldier, enabled by the choice of protagonist. Harold Keith spent many years interviewing Civil War veterans and visiting the sites depicted in the book, resulting in an authenticity that is rare for historical fiction that targets a young adult audience. The setting, west of the Mississippi, is also not typical of Civil War novels, so the reader gets a perspective on the war not generally available in other books, let alone one found in children's books. Plot summary Jefferson Davis Bussey marches off to Leavenworth from Linn County, Kansas in 1861, on his way to join the Union volunteers. He is off to fight for the North, his zeal having been fueled by reaction to the guerilla war of \\"bushwhackers\\" that was taking place in eastern Kansas. However, Stand Watie is on the side of the South. We meet many soldiers and civilians on both sides of the war, including Watie's raiding parties, itinerant printer Noah Babbitt and, in Tahlequah, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) the beautiful Cherokee girl, Lucy Washbourne. During an undercover mission, Jeff finds that Captain Asa Clardy of the Union Cavalry is smuggling new Spencer rifles to the Indian forces of Stand Watie. Jeff winds up fighting for both the North and the South (while on a special undercover mission) during the conflict while making friends on each side. The book is also notable for the detailed depiction of contemporary Cherokee life in Indian Territory, including various tribal political factions. Keith portrays the difficulties Jeff Bussey faces in choosing one side or the other in the midst of huge conflicts. Characters *Jefferson (Jeff) Davis Bussey - the protagonist.

Reception Kirkus Reviews said of the book: \\"Stirring, original and always credible, this is distinctly superior.\\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote of Rifles for Watie, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch, The Witch of Blackbird Pond and The Bronze Bow: \\"All have value, all are told skilfully. If they lack the qualities of greatness, it is largely because their style has a commercial sameness.\\" Awards and nominations * Winner, 1958 Newbery Medal * Notable Children's Books of 1957 (ALA) * 1964 James Carroll Shelf Award Sources References 1957 American novels Novels set during the American Civil War Children's historical novels Newbery Medal-winning works American children's novels 1957 children's books Novels set in Kansas ","title":"Rifles for Watie"},{"id":"2961718","text":"Perry Archangelo Bamonte (born 3 September 1960) is an Anglo-Italian musician best known for his work with the Cure.

The movie was initially supposed to be direct-to-video, but did get a limited theatrical release in the Midwestern United States.Variety Reviews - Dolly Dearest Variety Plot Elliot Wade (Sam Bottoms) obtains ownership of the Dolly Dearest factory in Mexico. Not far from the factory is the underground Mayan tomb of Sanzia, or Satan on Earth. An archaeologist breaks into the sarcophagus but is crushed by the stone slab that covers the entrance, releasing the malevolent spirit of Sanzia. Upon its escape, Sanzia takes refuge in the porcelain doll, Dolly Dearest. Despite the demise of the archaeologist, the sale is finalized and the Wade family travels to Mexico to see their new home. Upon arrival, the family meets their realtor, Mr. Estrella and housekeeper, Camilla (Lupe Ontiveros). Estrella takes Elliot, Jimmy, and Jessica to see the factory. The building, long abandoned, is structurally unstable to the consternation of Elliot, but Estrella hurriedly brushes his worries aside and discusses the history of the factory. During the conversation, Jessica goes exploring. On a shelf she discovers many well- preserved dolls covered by a sheet. She asks her father if she may have one and he acquiesces, allowing her to take Dolly. Outside, Jimmy finds the entrance to the cave which is blocked by a wire fence. Unaware of recent events, Jimmy inquires about that area, but his father warns him to never go back there again. That night, Marilyn (Denise Crosby) tucks Jessica into bed. As she falls asleep, Dolly slowly turns her head to stare at the child. The next day, Marilyn finds a disturbing drawing that she thinks Jessica drew. Jessica becomes progressively more violent and obsessive with Dolly. To not arouse her father's suspicion, Jessica acts normal when he is around, but resumes her evil and threatening behavior around her mother. Camilla believes the doll is controlling Jessica. When the daughter speaks harshly in Sanzian tongue, Camilla tries to warn Marilyn, but is killed by the spirit. Jimmy sneaks out of the house one night and breaks into the factory from an unlocked window. He finds the night watchman Luis, dead on the floor and flees. Marilyn comes to the realization that Jessica may truly be possessed and tries to take the doll from her daughter. Jessica warns her mother not to touch the doll, but when Marilyn persists, Sanzia momentarily possesses Jessica and yells, \\"I will kill you!\\" before adding \\"The kid's mine.\\" The next day, Marilyn visits the dig for the first time and talks with the archaeologist, Resnick (Rip Torn) about the purpose of their dig. Resnick tells Marilyn that they are searching for the remains of the Sanzia devil child inside the tomb, which has not been opened yet. Resnick continues to explain that the devil child, a true force of evil, fed on the warm blood of children. The tribe eventually killed the creature because its dietary needs almost wiped out the population of the tribe. Marilyn then explains that Jessica is being controlled by her doll and visits Camilla's sister, a nun, at a convent, informing her it is too late. At home, Marilyn looks for Jessica. She finds Jimmy hiding on the floor of the hallway closet, and he tells her that Jessica and Dolly are in Jessica's room. He also reveals that he saw Dolly talk and move. Jimmy hands her the key to Jessica's room, and Dolly reveals its true self to Marilyn. Marilyn goes back downstairs, loads ammo into the shotgun and tells Jimmy to call his father. At the factory, the dolls disconnect the phones from the hook. Marilyn returns to Jessica's room to find the doll gone. Jimmy continues to try to contact his father. When he is unable to get through, he attempts to call the operator, but is unable to communicate because he does not speak Spanish. When Jessica becomes separated from Dolly, her mother attempts to flee with her, only to be blocked by Dolly. Dolly calls to Jessica, and Jessica attacks her mother. As Marilyn and Jessica struggle, Dolly starts advancing towards them with a kitchen knife. Jimmy grabs the shotgun and, after figuring out how it works, fires it at Dolly. The impact of the bullets sends Dolly crashing through the door, and Jessica becomes herself again. Marilyn, Jessica and Jimmy get in the car and drive to the factory, where Elliot is being attacked by the dolls. Meanwhile, the professor enters the tomb and sees the remains of the devil child, which has the body of an infant and the head of a goat. Realizing the myth was true, the professor runs to the factory, where he saves Elliot from the dolls. They run outside and reunite with Elliot's family. The family plants dynamite around the factory. The dolls fail in stopping them; as a result, the factory explodes, killing the dolls. As the explosions continue, an agonizing demonic scream is heard, implying the evil Sanzia spirit is also destroyed. The film ends as the family watches the factory burn.

History In 1886, Gerlacus van den Elsen, one of the Norbertine monks, founded the seminary Gymnasium St. Norbertus. Around 1950 this school had 125 students, most of them boarders. A disadvantage was that the seminary could not issue any officially recognized diplomas. In order to receive such a certificate the students had to pass a state examination. In the 1950s it was decided this had to be changed but the limited size of the school was a problem. Hence it was decided to cooperate with another seminary. The combination of schools took the name ‚ÄòGymnasium Bernrode‚Äô and in 1961 received permission to issue official diplomas. Day students were also admitted so that the young people in the area could also profit from an education at a gymnasium: first boys only and later on girls were allowed as well. In the sixties the number of boarders diminished while the number of day students from the surrounding areas increased. This resulted in the closing down of both boarding schools at the beginning of the 1970s.

Fearing his wife may be institutionalized because of her delusional disorder, her husband goes along with this charade as though it is perfectly normal. The 10-year-old daughter assists her father in facilitating the delusion. The youngest child seems to really believe that he has a sister named \\"Maggie.\\" They hire a nanny who initially goes along with the family's unusual situation, but she becomes concerned about the effects on the real children and reports the family to child protective services. A legal battle ensues, ending in victory for the family. It is also revealed that the real children were not harmed by pretending about \\"Maggie.\\" In the middle of the movie, the husband explains that he tried to take his wife to the best psychologists in town, who told him that she was mentally ill and would have to go to an institution. He didn't want that to happen, so he went along with the ruse for five years. One night, his wife hears him carrying on a conversation with \\"Maggie,\\" and the next morning she states that \\"Maggie\\" has died. Apparently, hearing the aforementioned conversation helps the wife out of her mental illness and allows her to finally let go of her imaginary child.

In contrast to the USMLE Step 1, the focus is much more on clinical application of medical knowledge. It assesses the ability to apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision.Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) at usmle.org, by Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). Retrieved June 2012 The USMLE Step 2 is generally taken during the 4th year of medical school by medical students. From January 2010, to take the exam in North America the registration fee is $605 (as of December 2016) for students attending medical colleges in the United States and $850 for medical students from other countries. There are additional charges for applicants who choose a testing region outside the United States or Canada.The ECFMG(r) Reporter. Issue 148 - December 10, 2009  Format  The exam is a 9-hour single-day computer-based test composed of eight question sets with no more than 40 questions per set.USMLE 2013 bulletin of information page no. 14 Each section is one hour long. The test taker is permitted 45 minutes, in total for the whole day, for the purpose of breaks that can only be taken between sections. There is a 15-minute tutorial at the beginning of the exam, which the test- taker can choose to skip, and have the time added to the break time. If the taker finishes any section before the allotted 1 hour time limit, the remainder of the time is added to break time. The test is administered at the Prometric testing sites around the world. Topics Step 2 CK includes test items in the following content areas: internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, preventive medicine, psychiatry, surgery, other areas relevant to provision of care under supervision. Most Step 2 CK test items describe clinical situations and require that you provide one or more of the following: diagnosis, a prognosis, an indication of underlying mechanisms of disease, the next step in medical care, including preventive measures. Step 2 CK is a broadly based, integrated examination. It frequently requires interpretation of tables and laboratory data, imaging studies, photographs of gross and microscopic pathologic specimens, and results of other diagnostic studies. Step 2 CK classifies test items along two dimensions: disease category and physician task.  Scoring  Scoring is reported in 3 digit scores. Scores fall between 1 and 300, with the mean score of 240 and the standard deviation of 18 for first-time takers from accredited medical schools in the United States and Canada for the 2013/14 and 2014/15 academic years. Every three to four years the Step Committees are asked to complete an in- depth review of standards, and they may schedule more frequent reviews. At its May 2014 meeting, the Step 2 Committee conducted a review for USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK). As a result of its review, the Step 2 Committee decided to raise the Step 2 recommended minimum passing score to 209 for students taking the test after July 1, 2014. A more recent review in May 2018 maintained the passing score of 209. Effect on Residency Matching The USMLE Step 2 CK score is one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. Along with the USMLE Step 1, this test is a standardized measure of all applicants.

Its capital and largest city is Makeni, which is also the largest city in the north. Bombali District is one of the fourteen districts of Sierra Leone. Bombali is the second largest district in Sierra Leone by geographical area, after Koinadugu District, and is the second most populous district in the North, after Port Loko District. In the 2015 Sierra Leone national census, the population of Bombali district was 606,183. Other major towns in Bombali District include Kamabai, Karina and Binkolo. The district of Bombali occupies a total area of and comprises thirteen chiefdoms. The district borders the Republic of Guinea to the north, Port Loko District and Kambia Districts to the west, Tonkolili District to the south, and Koinadugu District to the east. The population of Bombali District is ethnically diverse, although the Temne and Limba form the largest ethnic groups. The population of Bombali District is predominantly Muslim, though with a large Christian minority. Bombali district is the birthplace and home district of the former president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, who was born and raised in the city of Makeni. The district is also the birthplace and home district of former president of Sierra Leone Joseph Saidu Momoh, who was born in the town of Binkolo. The University of Makeni is based in Bombali District's largest city, Makeni. Government and politics Bombali district is governed with a directly elected district council form of government, which is headed by a district council chairman, who is the highest local government official in the district. The chairman is responsible for the general management of the district. The current chairman is John Shangai Koruna of the All People's Congress (APC), following his victory in the 2018 Sierra Leone general elections. Bombali district is a political stronghold of the APC, the current ruling party in Sierra Leone; and one of the two major political parties in the country. Currently the APC holds all elected seats from Bombali district to the Parliament of Sierra Leone. The APC also controls the Bombali District Council local government and the Makeni city council. Two of the three Sierra Leone presidents from the APC party Joseph Saidu Momoh and Ernest Bai Koroma are natives of Bombali district. The APC has always been overwhelmingly popular in almost all parts of Bombali district since the party was founded; with the exception of the predominantly ethnic Mandingo town of Karina and its surrounding villages, located in part of Biriwa Chiefdom, which have traditionally supported the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), particularly under the government of president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who was overwhelmingly popular in Karina and its surrounding villages during his presidency. Members of Parliament The district of Bombali has eight Representatives in the Sierra Leonean Parliament, of which seven members were elected for a five- year term. The district is a stronghold of the former ruling government of the APC party. In the second round of the 2007 Sierra Leone presidential election, the incumbent vice president of Sierra Leone Solomon Berewa and candidate of the then ruling SLPP got 11 percent of the vote in Bombali District, while the leader of the main opposition party and current president of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Koroma of the All People's Congress (APC) got 89 percent in the second round in the district.

While progress has been made since the conflict, particularly in restoration of state authority, the level of social services and economic recovery remains unsatisfactory throughout the district. The provincial importance of Makeni is in contrast with the current lack of water and power supply in the township, and the bad road network and large distances in the district have meant that limited intervention has been made in chiefdoms outside of the Makeni area, particularly in the far north.  Health  Medical services are provided by a mix of government, private and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) shifted to a decentralized health system structure after the end of the civil in war in 2002, in an effort to increase coverage. Bombali has 16 community health centers (CHC), 18 community health posts (CHP), 48 maternal child health posts (MCHP), 1 government hospital, 1 military hospital, 1 community hospital, 3 mission Clinics, 3 mission hospitals and 3 private clinics. Traditional medicine forms part of the primary health care system in Sierra Leone. Diseases endemic to Bombali are Yellow Fever and Malaria.https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-bombali- district-profile-16-november-2015 Holy Spirit Hospital (Makeni), largest private hospital in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone, is located in Bombali District in the town of Makeni. In 2019, the First Responder Coalition of Sierra Leone (FRCSL) was created in Makeni, the largest city of Bombali District. The five founding members included the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, LFR International, the University of Makeni, Agency for Rural Community Transformation, and Holy Spirit Hospital. 1,000 community members from Bombali were trained to be first responders by the Coalition and equipped with first aid kits between June and July 2019.

The top deck carries Kentucky-bound traffic while the bottom deck carries Ohio-bound traffic. The Brent Spence Bridge is in the foreground viewed from the Kentucky side. View of the B & O Freight Terminal (Cincinnati, Ohio) and the Brent Spence Bridge History The bridge was named for Kentucky's longest serving congressman at the time, Brent Spence, who served in the U.S. Congress for over thirty years before retiring in 1962. The bridge, which opened a year after his retirement, was named in his honor by then Kentucky governor Bert T. Combs. Spence did not feel that he deserved the honor, and lobbied for the Bridge to be named for President Kennedy (who had been assassinated only three days before the bridge was supposed to open). Combs, however, resisted this effort as modesty by Spence and kept the name, though Combs would name the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge in Louisville, Kentucky (which opened two weeks after the Spence) after the late president just days after Kennedy's assassination. Replacement When the bridge opened in November 1963, it carried only three lanes of traffic each way across the Ohio River. In 1985, the emergency shoulders were eliminated, and the bridge was re-striped with four lanes in each direction, increasing the traffic capacity by 33%, earning the bridge the determination of being 'functionally obsolete' due to carrying more traffic for which it was originally designed.http://nationalbridges.com/guide-to-ratings The bridge was designed to carry 85,000 vehicles per day, but in 2006 it carried 150,000 vehicles per day. Recent reports show that contrary to previous traffic expectations, traffic on the Brent Spence Bridge has actually decreased by 9 percent between 2009 and 2015.http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/blog/2016/03/despite-decreasing- brent-spence-traffic-planners.html On September 15, 2011, chunks of concrete from the Ohio side ramp connected to the bridge fell onto a vehicle. This incident led to the belief that the Brent Spence Bridge was in immediate need of replacement and in danger of collapse, although this has been rebuked by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, and has continued to be declared safe. As of 2008, the Cincinnati City Council supported alternative #4, which involves building a new bridge to carry I-75 at the current location, and demolishing the Brent Spence Bridge. Alternative #4 would build a parallel bridge just west of the Brent Spence Bridge. It would again be a two deck bridge, except the top deck would carry all I-75 traffic and the bottom deck would carry south I-71 and local traffic. The I-75 deck would be a total of 6 lanes, with 3 lanes each for north and south traffic. The I-71 deck would be a total of 5 lanes, divided into 3 lanes for south local traffic, and 2 lanes of south 71 traffic. Additionally, Cincinnati City Council has expressed interest in using the bridge for a light rail system that would connect downtown Cincinnati to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. The Selected Alternative, as described in the Finding of No Significant Impact is Alternative I, which would build a new double deck bridge just west of the existing Brent Spence Bridge to carry three lanes each way for I-75, two lanes for southbound I-71, and three lanes for southbound local traffic. The existing Brent Spence Bridge would be rehabilitated to carry two lanes for northbound I-71 and three lanes for northbound local traffic. In popular culture The approach from the Brent Spence Bridge, with the picture of the downtown Cincinnati skyline representing the fictional city of Monticello, was featured on the daytime soap The Edge of Night (a program sponsored by the locally based Procter & Gamble) from 1967 to 1980.

Before and after the \\"Tour From Hell\\" to promote the Richard and Linda Thompson album Shoot Out the Lights, Richard played solo shows in the USA in 1982. Three of these shows were recorded for radio broadcasts. When Thompson left the ailing Hannibal Records label in 1984, the release of an album collated from the 1982 live recordings was negotiated as part of the amicable separation. Thompson was unhappy with the quality of the recordings and the performances and later persuaded Hannibal to delete Small Town Romance from their catalog. But the demand continued, and in the face of bootleg versions and high prices being paid for second-hand copies, the album was re- released, with Thompson's consent, in 1997. The album might be described as \\"warts and all\\". Thompson's vocals are sometimes shaky, especially on songs formerly sung by Linda Thompson, but for many years this was the only legitimate record available of Richard Thompson playing a solo, acoustic show - a live presentation which he has increasingly featured and which now makes up the majority of his live performances.

This square was the political centre in medieval Pisa. After the middle of 16th century the square became the headquarters of the Order of the Knights of St. Stephen. Now it is a centre of education, being the main house of the Scuola Normale di Pisa, a higher learning institution part of the University.

The square, known as Square of the seven streets (Piazza delle sette vie) was the political heart of the city, where the Pisans used to discuss their problems or celebrate their victories. After 1140, the square become the center of Pisa Comune, with construction of buildings belonging to several municipalities and magistrates, as well as several churches. After the victory of the People of Pisa (Popolo Pisano) in 1254, the Palace of the People and the Elders (Palazzo del Popolo e degli Anziani) was built on the square by joining some pre- existent buildings. The Captain of the People (Capitano del Popolo) was housed in the near Clock Palace (since 1357), which incorporated some previous existing towers. The southern part of the square was rebuilt with offices, law courts and the residence of the Podest√†. There was also the church of Saint Sebastian alle Fabbriche Maggiori, destroyed by Vasari. The church, that was standing there at least since 1074, took the name by the offices of the blacksmiths (fabbri in Italian), located in the area. =Renaissance= On this square the emissary of Florence proclaimed the end of the independence of Pisa in 1406. After the conquest of Pisa, the buildings remained the same, but changed public offices, a Florentine Commissioner and the Priors instead of the Elders, and a chief of custody instead of the Captain of the People. Later, in 1558, the square was rebuilt in Renaissance style by Giorgio Vasari, the famous architect of the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici of Florence. He designed the Church of the Knights of the Holy and Military Order of St. Stephen (1565‚Äì1569), but it was mainly built by other architects. It replaced the church of Saint Sebastian. This is the only church in Pisa in Renaissance style. It contains Turkish naval banners captured by the Knights of St. Stephen during the naval battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571. The main building on the square is Palazzo della Carovana, the palace of the Knights of St. Stephen, and formerly the Palace of the Elders. It was modernised in Renaissance style by Giorgio Vasari. The fa√ßade is decorated with sgraffiti, equally by Vasari, and contains six niches with busts of grand dukes of Tuscany. In front of the palace stands the large statue of Cosimo I de Medici by Pietro Francavilla, who also designed the Palace of the Priors in 1603. In the other corner of the square stands the Palazzo dell'Orologio, which is referred to in Dante's Inferno. =20th century= Nowadays the Palazzo della Carovana houses the main building of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, a university founded by Napoleon Bonaparte and modeled after the Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris. Italian poet Giosu√® Carducci and physicist Enrico Fermi are among some of the pupils who have studied here. There is also the house of the Confraternita della Misericordia, a Catholic ambulance service.

The Reds had the home field advantage due to a predetermined formula which awarded home field advantage to the Central Division champion or its playoff opponent. The two teams were victorious in the NL Division Series (NLDS), with the Braves defeating the wild card qualifier Colorado Rockies three games to one, and the Reds defeating the West Division champion Los Angeles Dodgers three games to none. The Braves won the series four games to none to become the National League champions, and defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series. This NLCS was notable as it matched up what had been the two easternmost teams in the National League West Division from 1969‚Äì1993, both teams having been placed there at the insistence of the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs (the former team wanted the Cubs' rivals St. Louis Cardinals, then the dominating power of the NL, in the National League East Division, and the Cubs wanted in the same division as St. Louis). It was also the first NLCS since 1989 not to feature either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. The two teams reigned exclusively as NL East champions from 1990 to 1993. The Braves would go on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series in six games. Summary =Cincinnati Reds vs. Atlanta Braves= Game summaries =Game 1= Tuesday, October 10, 1995, at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio The opening game of the 1995 NLCS would be well- pitched and decided in extra innings. The only run allowed by Tom Glavine, who would go seven innings, came on a Ron Gant single following a Barry Larkin triple in the fourth. Pete Schourek was lights out the entire game, but allowed back-to-back leadoff singles in the ninth before David Justice hit into a forceout at second to send the game to extra innings. In the 11th inning, bench player Mike Devereaux singled in Fred McGriff, who drew a leadoff walk off of Mike Jackson and moved to third on two groundouts, to give Atlanta a 2‚Äì1 lead. Manager Bobby Cox needed to use three pitchers in the bottom of the inning, but Greg McMichael induced a double play with runners on first and third that ended the game. =Game 2= Wednesday, October 11, 1995, at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio With John Smoltz on the mound, the Braves took an early 1‚Äì0 lead when Marquis Grissom hit a leadoff single in the first off of John Smiley, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Chipper Jones's single, then got a second run in the fourth when Fred McGriff hit a leadoff double and scored on a Mike Devereaux RBI double. In the fifth, Lenny Harris's two-out RBI single with two on put the Reds on the board, then Jeff Branson stole home to tie the game at two. That score held until the tenth inning, when the Braves scored four runs and took the game. Cincinnati reliever Mark Portugal's wild pitch with the bases loaded allowed Mark Lemke to scamper home with the go-ahead run. Javy L√≥pez followed with a three-run blast that blew the game open. This would be the final postseason game ever played in Riverfront Stadium. =Game 3= Friday, October 13, 1995, at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Greg Maddux went eight innings and only gave up one run in another strong start for an Atlanta starter. Lefty David Wells, acquired by Cincinnati in anticipation of facing the predominantly left-handed Braves lineup in the playoffs, matched Maddux with a scoreless first five innings. Later, right-handed Atlanta catcher Charlie O'Brien belted a three-run home run in the sixth off Wells. Rookie Chipper Jones hit a two-run shot in the seventh to make it 5‚Äì0. The Reds got on the board in the eighth on three straight one-out singles, the last of which to Hal Morris scoring a run. Mark Wohlers earned the save in the ninth despite allowing a leadoff double to Jeff Branson, who moved to third on a groundout and scored on Thomas Howard's sacrifice fly, as the Braves held on for a 5‚Äì2 victory. =Game 4= Saturday, October 14, 1995, at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Steve Avery, who was inconsistent all season, got the start for Atlanta and tossed six scoreless innings. Rafael Belliard hit a leadoff single off of Pete Schourek in the third, then moved to second on a fly out before Mark Lemke hit an RBI single to give Atlanta a 1‚Äì0 lead. The game remained close until the seventh, when Mike Jackson allowed a leadoff triple and one out walk before a passed ball allowed Marquis Grissom to score. After an intentional walk, series MVP Mike Devereaux hit a three-run home run to put the Braves up 5‚Äì0. After a double and intentional walk, Dave Burba relieved Jackson and Luis Polonia's RBI single made it 6‚Äì0 Braves. Bobby Cox took no chances and used closer Mark Wohlers to finish off the Reds in the ninth. The shutout victory completed a surprisingly easy sweep of Cincinnati and sent the Braves to their third World Series in five years. The Reds offense only managed to score five runs in four games off Atlanta's pitching staff, even with the fact that the first two contests went to extra-innings. This was the only NLCS to end in a four-game sweep until 2007, when the Colorado Rockies defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games. Former Brave Ron Gant would play against his former team with the Reds, then again the next year as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. To date, this is the Reds' most recent NLCS appearance.

A spatial reference system defines a specific map projection, as well as transformations between different spatial reference systems. Spatial reference systems are defined by the OGC's Simple Feature Access using well- known text representation of coordinate reference systems, and support has been implemented by several standards-based geographic information systems. Spatial reference systems can be referred to using a SRID integer, including EPSG codes defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. It is specified in ISO 19111:2007 Geographic information‚ÄîSpatial referencing by coordinates, prepared by ISO/TC 211, also published as OGC Abstract Specification, Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinate. Components In this Abstract Specification, a coordinate reference system shall be composed of one coordinate system and one datum. A coordinate system is a set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points, such as: affine, cylindrical, Cartesian, ellipsoidal, linear, polar, spherical, vertical, etc. A datum is a set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system. The main subtypes of coordinate reference system are: geodetic, vertical, engineering, and image; additional subtypes are: derived, projected, and compound. Examples Some systems are: *Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system *British national grid reference system *Chinese Global Navigation Grid Code *Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987 *Irish grid reference system *Irish Transverse Mercator *Israeli Transverse Mercator *Israeli Cassini Soldner *Jordan Transverse Mercator *Lambert conformal conic projection *International mapcode system *Military Grid Reference System *United States National Grid Identifiers A Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID) is a unique value used to unambiguously identify projected, unprojected, and local spatial coordinate system definitions. These coordinate systems form the heart of all GIS applications. Virtually all major spatial vendors have created their own SRID implementation or refer to those of an authority, such as the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset. SRIDs are the primary key for the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) spatial_ref_sys metadata table for the Simple Features for SQL Specification, Versions 1.1 and 1.2, which is defined as follows: CREATE TABLE SPATIAL_REF_SYS ( SRID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, AUTH_NAME CHARACTER VARYING(256), AUTH_SRID INTEGER, SRTEXT CHARACTER VARYING(2048) ) In spatially enabled databases (such as IBM DB2, IBM Informix, Ingres, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle RDBMS, Teradata, PostGIS, SQL Anywhere and Vertica), SRIDs are used to uniquely identify the coordinate systems used to define columns of spatial data or individual spatial objects in a spatial column (depending on the spatial implementation). SRIDs are typically associated with a well-known text (WKT) string definition of the coordinate system (SRTEXT, above). Here are two common coordinate systems with their EPSG SRID value followed by their WKT: UTM, Zone 17N, NAD27 ‚Äî SRID 2029: PROJCS[\\"NAD27(76) / UTM zone 17N\\", GEOGCS[\\"NAD27(76)\\", DATUM[\\"North_American_Datum_1927_1976\\", SPHEROID[\\"Clarke 1866\\",6378206.4,294.9786982138982, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"7008\\" , AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"6608\\" , PRIMEM[\\"Greenwich\\",0, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"8901\\" , UNIT[\\"degree\\",0.01745329251994328, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"9122\\" , AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"4608\\" , UNIT[\\"metre\\",1, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"9001\\" , PROJECTION[\\"Transverse_Mercator\\"], PARAMETER[\\"latitude_of_origin\\",0], PARAMETER[\\"central_meridian\\",-81], PARAMETER[\\"scale_factor\\",0.9996], PARAMETER[\\"false_easting\\",500000], PARAMETER[\\"false_northing\\",0], AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"2029\\"], AXIS[\\"Easting\\",EAST], AXIS[\\"Northing\\",NORTH WGS84 ‚Äî SRID 4326 GEOGCS[\\"WGS 84\\", DATUM[\\"WGS_1984\\", SPHEROID[\\"WGS 84\\",6378137,298.257223563, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"7030\\" , AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"6326\\" , PRIMEM[\\"Greenwich\\",0, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"8901\\" , UNIT[\\"degree\\",0.01745329251994328, AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"9122\\" , AUTHORITY[\\"EPSG\\",\\"4326\\" SRID values associated with spatial data can be used to constrain spatial operations ‚Äî for instance, spatial operations cannot be performed between spatial objects with differing SRIDs in some systems, or trigger coordinate system transformations between spatial objects in others.

It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring throughout the upper latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It is widespread in Eurasia. In North America it occurs from Alaska to Newfoundland and as far south as Nevada and New Mexico. This plant is variable in appearance. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a taproot and rhizome network topped with an underground caudex. The roots have nitrogen- fixing nodules. The aboveground stems are up to long and are mostly decumbent, forming a mat. The leaves are up to long and are made up of several pairs of leaflets each up to long. The inflorescence is a raceme of up to 30 flowers each about long. The flowers are purple or blue.J.M. Gillett, L.L. Consaul, S.G. Aiken and M.J. Dallwitz (1999 onwards). Fabaceae of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Descriptions, Illustrations, Identification, and Information Retrieval. Version: 15 November 2000. The fruit is a legume pod up to long which contains seeds. This plant grows in subalpine and alpine climates, often in moist areas, such as woodlands and meadows around streams and lakes. It also occurs on tundra and other cold, dry, exposed areas. It occurs on gravel bars and scree. It is sometimes a pioneer species, colonizing land in the primary phase of ecological succession, such as roads and bare land turned over during frost heave. It has been observed regrowing early in recently burned areas in Grand Teton National Park. It also grows in vegetated areas. Plants occurring in harsh conditions are smaller than those in more favorable sites.https://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/Blue%20Purple%20Enlarged%20Photo%20Pages/astragalus%20alpinus.htm This plant species provides food for caribou, Arctic hares, greater snow geese, small blue butterflies, and grizzly bears.

His performance in the title role of Hasenclever's The Son, which premiered on 8 October 1916, established him as an Expressionist actor; he also appeared in the play in 1918 and 1923. In 1917, Deutsch went to the Volksb√ºhne in Berlin. He appeared until 1933 on a number of stages in the city, gave guest performances in Hamburg, Munich and Vienna, and participated in a tour of South America. Beginning in 1916, Deutsch appeared in 42 silent films. In April 1933, he left Germany due to Nazi antisemitism. Deutsch returned to Vienna and Prague, gave guest performances in Zurich, Brussels and (in 1936) London where he appeared in Charles Bennett's play Page From a Diary in the West End. In 1938 he emigrated to New York City and played briefly on Broadway in 1939 before moving to Hollywood, where he became an American citizen. Beginning 1942 he appeared as Ernest Dorian in Hollywood films, primarily as Nazis and German officers. Ernst Deutsch Theater in Hamburg After a 1946 stay in Buenos Aires, Deutsch returned to Vienna via Paris the following year. In Vienna, he became a member of the Burgtheater. At the National Theatre Deutsch appeared in The Helpers of God, about Red Cross founder Henri Dunant, in 1948. Three years later he moved back to Berlin, appearing at the Schiller and Schlossparktheater. Deutsch also toured in Germany and abroad. Deutsch's film roles included Baron Kurtz in Carol Reed's film noir, The Third Man, starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. He received the Volpi Cup as Best Actor at the 9th Venice International Film Festival in 1948 Venice Film Festival for his performance in Der Proze√ü. Deutsch's performances in the title role of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Nathan the Wise and as Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice were critically praised. He played Nathan for more than 2,000 performances, and traveled with productions throughout Europe. Deutsch died on 22 March 1969 in Berlin, and is buried in the Jewish cemetery on the Berlin highway. For the fourth anniversary of his death in 1973, Friedrich Sch√ºtter's former Junge Theater in the Uhlenhorst quarter of Hamburg was renamed after Deutsch (who had staged a performance of Nathan The Wise there shortly before his death).

Marine surveyors also inspect equipment intended for new or existing vessels to ensure compliance with various standards or specifications. Marine surveys typically include the structure, machinery and equipment (navigational, safety, radio, etc.) and general condition of a vessel and/or cargo. It also includes judging materials on board and their condition. Because certifications and subsequently payments are processed only after the surveyor has expressed his or her satisfaction, a marine surveyor holds a prestigious position and is held with much regard in the shipbuilding industry. Marine Surveyors are highly qualified and technically sound and are usually selected after thorough evaluation procedures as vessels ranging from small ferries to enormous crude oil carriers and cruise liners are approved to sail into the high seas based purely on their judgment, competence and integrity. Marine surveying is often closely associated with marine insurance, damage and salvage, accident and fraud investigation as insurers generally lack the training and skills required to perform a detailed assessment of the condition of a vessel. Marine surveyors are hired on a fee basis by customers seeking insurance directly and maintain professional autonomy in order to provide an unbiased view. Independent marine surveyors are often employed by the clients of marine insurers to provide evidence in support of damage claims made against the insurer. Insurance companies cannot require customers to use specific marine surveyors and risk legal scrutiny and potential recourse if they impose surveyor requirements.https://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flmdce/2:2018cv00416/351247 Marine surveyors use many credentials, letters, and terms such as \\"accredited,\\" \\"certified,\\" \\"qualified,\\" \\"USSA,\\" \\"ACMS,\\" \\"AMS,\\" \\"CMS,\\" etc. There are many ways to train to become a marine surveyor including taking correspondence courses, apprenticing, and/or utilizing prior marine experience. Marine surveyors pursue their profession independently of required organizations, and there is currently no national or international licensing requirement for marine surveyors. The U.S. Coast Guard does not approve or certify marine surveyors; however it adopted Navtech USSA Marine Surveyor practices in the eighties for its inspection standards.https://www.edumaritime.net/florida/navtech-us-surveyors-association All association terms and initials represent training and certification by private organizations, and the end users of boating seeking to comply with their insurance company's underwriting process dictates surveyor demand. Qualities and qualifications Qualifications for a Marine Surveyor, though the list is long, can be summed up in the following: Working knowledge of ship's electrical & mechanical systems, fundamental understanding of boat design & construction. One of the most important things along with engineering certification is errors and omissions and Liability insurance to protect their clients from their mistakes or injury on private or government property. You should never hire a marine surveyor without errors and omissions insurance. If the insurance companies won't insure them, you are probably not getting a competent surveyor and most courts require a post-secondary marine graduate to be considered a marine expert. When it comes to defining the qualities and qualifications of a Marine Surveyor, a memorandum of 1834 has not been bettered: Brooklyn Museum - Eight Bells - Winslow Homer - overall General duties of a Classification Society marine surveyor A marine surveyor may perform the following tasks: *Conduct surveys throughout the ship's life (building new ship, annual survey, interim survey, special survey) to ensure standards are maintained; *Perform inspections required by domestic statutes and international conventions by the International Maritime Organization (IMO); *Witness tests and operation of emergency and safety machinery and equipment; *Measure ships for tonnage and survey them for load line assignment; *Attend court as an expert witness and assist in coroner's inquiries; *Investigate marine accidents. *Determine \\"Fair Market Value, \\"Damage Repair Costs\\", and Replacement Value\\". Types of marine surveyor =Government surveyor= A government surveyor performs ship registration surveys, surveys of foreign-going ships and local draft, and generally enforces ship safety standards to insure marine industrial safety. Government- appointed marine surveyors, also called marine inspectors in some countries, belong to two groups that are not mutually exclusive: Flag State surveyors report to the government with whom the vessel is registered, and Port State surveyors report to the government into whose territory the vessel has entered. The Port State surveyors usually have the authority to detain vessels considered to have defects that may result in adverse impacts on life or the environment. Based on their government's legal framework, Flag State surveyors can impose conditions on the vessel such that failure to comply will result in the registration of the vessel being suspended or withdrawn. In this event, the vessel will find it almost impossible to trade. =Cargo surveyor= A Cargo surveyor is normally appointed by the Cargo Owner, mostly for Bulk . Grain Cargo. His job is to perform the draft survey to determine the actual cargo loaded on board. He also confirms that the cargo loading is performed according to the law and is within the loadable limits The vessel safety is also ascertain which include momentum involves due to cargo shift which may render the vessel unsafe during the passage. Often high value commodities are witnessed during load out especially if they are contamination sensitive. =Classification surveyor= A classification surveyor inspects ships to make sure that the ship, its components and machinery are built and maintained according to the standards required for their class. Classification surveyors often have two roles: one is as a representative of the classification society; and the other as an inspector on behalf of the country with which the vessel is registered (the flag state). The classification role is to ensure that during construction the vessel initially complies with the classification society's rules for construction and outfitting, and thereafter is maintained fit to proceed trading. The Flag State role is based on a clear set of guidelines issued by the registering country. On satisfactory completion of any survey, the classification surveyor makes recommendations to the classification society and/or the flag state. These may be that the vessel has a clean bill of health, or that various defects must be corrected within a given time. Increasingly, both government and classification surveyors are becoming involved in confirming compliance with international treaties associated with such things as pollution, international security, and safety management schemes. They may also examine cargo gear to ensure that it meets various requirements or regulations. Government and classification surveyors are usually marine professionals mariners, such as a qualified ship's master, engineer, naval architect or radio officer. =Independent surveyor= A Independent marine surveyor may be asked to carry out a wide range of tasks, including examining ships' cargoes or onboard conditions such as fuel quality; investigating accidents at sea (e.g., oil spillages or failure of machinery or structures which are not considered to be critical); and preparing accident reports for insurance purposes, and conducting draught surveys to analyse how much cargo has been lost or gained. Independent surveyors also carry out condition surveys or pre-purchase surveys (also known as \\"Condition and valuation\\" survey (C&V;)) to determine the condition of the ship prior to charter or an acquisition. Many companies as P&I; clubs, ship-owners, brokers, etc. employ or contract the services of a private marine surveyor in order to determine the condition of the ship. =Yacht and small craft surveyor= Yacht and small craft (Y&SC;) surveyors specialize in inspecting smaller vessels that are most often used for pleasure boating (both power and sail). Y&SC; surveyors may be employed directly by larger marine insurance companies, but most often they are independent practitioners. Since using boats for pleasure (or \\"yachting\\") is a relatively recent phenomena, having only been widely practiced for the last century or so, Y&SC; surveying has many unique aspects that are not shared with the more traditional forms of marine surveying described above. In the UK the Yacht Designers and Surveyors' Association has a broad professional membership dealing with the range of craft below and above 24 metres (excluding ships and cargo/container ships) and provides a range of training events throughout the year which are generally open to non-members, including a one-day Report Writing training. YDSA.co.uk. The International Institute of Marine Surveying provides regular face to face and online training seminars for both members and non members at various UK and overseas locations. Marine surveyor training There are very few institutions providing education and training in this specialist but vitally important field. One is the International Institute of Marine Surveying (IIMS), a professional body that has been providing surveyor education courses for over 15 years. The IIMS provides Diploma Professional Qualification courses in both yacht and small craft as well as commercial ship surveying. The IIMS membership consists of marine surveyors, cargo surveyors, yacht and small craft surveyors and other professionals in the field. Suny Maritime College provides online survey classes in Cargo, Hull and Yacht and small craft. In Australia The Australasian Institute of Marine surveyors has the first accredited course under the Mar 13 training package which meets the requirements for AMSA Accreditation. The offer Certificate 4 to Diploma level qualifications. Lloyd's Maritime Academy offers a Diploma and MSc in Marine Surveying by distance learning since 1998 with the UK National Maritime Training Centre at the North Kent College in Gravesend and Middlesex University. Maritime Training Academy offers a large number of industry recognised vocational distance learning diplomas to students within the marine industry including ship surveying.

It is endemic to Guangxi, China. In literature prior to 2011, this species may have been confused with Paramesotriton chinensis, Pachytriton granulosus, or Paramesotriton ermizhaoi (the last now in synonymy). This species has several vernacular names, including Unterstein's newt, spotless stout newt, spotless smooth warty newt, Zhao Ermi's smooth warty newt, and paddletail newt.  Description  The paddle-tail newt is characterized by a flat body and a long, paddle-like tail. They range from black to brown to pale brown. They have orange markings along the bottom of their bodies and may have some orange dots lining their backs. Their skin is very smooth with a secretion of mucus, and their limbs are relatively short. The morphology and size of this species are similar to, if not larger than, Pachytriton brevipes.Amphibiaweb.org They use their senses of sight and smell to locate food. Since food is scarce for them in their natural environments, they can go for weeks without eating, but should be fed regularly when kept in captivity. Paddle-tail newt longevity in the wild is currently unknown, but in captivity it usually ranges from 10‚Äì20 years. Paddle-tail newts, uniquely, are known for their communication. They fan their tails when they are trying to attract the attention of another newt, when they are startled or frightened, or when approached by a conspecific. Paddle-tail newts are sometimes confused with the Japanese fire belly newts and sold as such, but are much larger and more aggressive and will eat smaller firebelly newts if given the opportunity. They have a similar relation named the spotted paddle-tail newt.

Ermoldus was a cultured man with a knowledge of the Latin poets, and his poem, In honorem Hludovici imperatoris (\\"In honour of Emperor Louis\\"), has some historical value. It consists of four books and deals with the life and exploits of Louis from 781 to 826. He also wrote two poems in imitation of Ovid, which were addressed to Pippin.  Biography  Very little is known about Nigellus' life aside from what he writes about himself in his poetry. Although many scholars have thought that he was a monk or member of the Christian clergy, since we only have his own works as evidence about him, this affiliation as a monk cannot be proven. More recent scholarship on Nigellus, therefore, leans away from asserting his vocation as a monk The only other known fact about Nigellus is that some time in the 820s he was sent into exile for an undisclosed offence against Pippin and Louis. His poetic works were meant to appease Louis and Pippin for his crimes against them but were also meant to be used as proof that he was ready to be reinstated at court in Aquitaine. Career and identity Although we do not know where Nigellus was from, the name Ermoldus is Germanic and his moniker, Nigellus (which means \\"Little black\\" in Latin), suggests that he was either \\"short in stature, dark haired or with a dark complexion\\". Many scholars assume that because Nigellus was so passionate about being recalled from exile to return specifically to Aquitaine, that he was in fact Aquitainian but this is speculation. In fact, in his poem to Emperor Louis the Pious he actually avoids describing much of Aquitaine saying that readers should \\"go to Aquitaine\\" and see it for themselves. This has led some to suggest that he wasn't actually from Aquitaine but was simply interested in returning to courtly life at King Pippin's side. In this same poem Nigellus notes that he was an \\"integral part\\" of King Pippin's court and also says that King Pippin appreciated Nigellus' company as well as his poetics. From this it seems likely that in reality Nigellus' main desire when writing to King Louis was more about returning to the excitement and importance of court life more than returning to his homeland of Aquitaine. Many earlier scholars believed Nigellus was a monk because he was able to read and write, but once again this is just an educated assumption. Another explanation for his ability to \\"compos[e] complicated poetry\\" could be because of the schools that Charlemagne had set up for children of nobility, therefore he may have simply been a member of the educated nobility. McKitterick explains that it is a mistake to assume that \\"education and learning were confined to clerics\\" as it was common for laymen and middle class boys were also sent to schools. Fleiner explains that Nigellus could have been misidentified with many other figures from the same time period, especially an abbot named Hermoldus who Louis went to Pippin's court in 834, as well as a chancellor at Pippin's court named Hermoldus. Ermoldus Nigellus' association with these two contemporaries has led the false interpretation that he was a clergyman as well as Pippin's chancellor. For all we know he may very well have actually been the same person as these other two Hermoldus', but other evidence in his poetry suggests otherwise. Another fact about himself that Nigellus discloses in his poetry was that he was a soldier in King Pippin's army during his second Brittany campaign. Although he was a soldier, Ermoldus admits he wasn't a very good one, and he quotes King Pippin as telling him to stick to writing rather than pursuing his swordplay, which was useless against the Bretons. This fact is problematic for scholars who believe that Ermoldus was a monk as monks did not typically bear arms or fight. He could have been an abbot as they were expected to do military service but it seems more likely that he was part of the \\"court literati\\" (educated men who served in court as military leaders, envoys and teachers). Exile Since we know Ermoldus Nigellus campaigned in Brittany in 824 and wrote In Honorem Hludowici between 826 and 828 during his exile, it is often assumed that he was sent into exile between these years. Nigellus never explains the reason for his exile but admits that he committed \\"foul deeds of [his] own fault\\". Ermoldus admits that his crime was not serious but rather he was guilty of associating himself with the wrong group of people at court, perhaps people associated with Emperor Louis' rebellious sons. After he committed said foul deeds towards Louis, he was sent to exile at the church of St. Mary in Strasbourg. Being exiled at a church was commonly a punishment doled out to \\"criminal clerics\\" which is another reason many scholars are led to believe his status as a monk or priest. Nigellus describes his time in Strasbourg as an unhappy one, but it seems that his exile was actually rather pleasant and as some evidence shows Nigellus may not have even been under house arrest but actually under protective custody. Fleiner believes that Nigellus was placed under protective custody because he was placed in territory belonging to Emperor Louis' wife Judith who Nigellus admired very much. If the associates who had gotten Ermoldus exiled were planning treason against the royal family, then the emperor may well have been simply removing Ermoldus from the situation. On the other hand, Boutelle believes that Ermoldus may have been exiled for letting his men plunder a church during Pippin's Brittany campaign against Louis' orders as quoted in In Honorem Hludowici: \\"Save the churches, men, and do not touch the sacred buildings\\". Overall the reason for his exile remains an unresolved mystery to scholars since we do not have any other primary sources that refer to Ermoldus Nigellus except what is written in his own works. Return to court The ending of Ermoldus' story is ultimately unknown, he could have been reinstated at court but we have little evidence to conclude that. The only suggestion of Ermoldus' return to court is the possibility that he could have been one of Pippin's chancellors (Hermoldus) as documented in three of Pippin's charters issued in the mid-830s. He produced no other surviving works and there are no references of him in any other literature of the time period. Poetry =Epistolae= After Ermoldus Nigellus was exiled by Emperor Louis, he wrote two poems for King Pippin whose court he had been living at and whom he had fought for in Brittany in 824. It is still unclear when Nigellus' epistles, or letters, to King Pippin were written, but Peter Godman argues that the first letter (Ad Pippinum regem) was written before In honorem Hludowici, and the second letter (Ad eundem Pippinum) was written afterwards in an attempt by Nigellus to form a \\"series of complementary appeals to the patronage of the emperor and his son\\". He wrote these letters in a style that imitates Ovid and therefore attempts to reproduce the \\"literary atmosphere of early Carolingian courts\\" that was associated with \\"patronage and favour\\". This approach would have helped to dignify his plea for recall at court. =In Honorem Hludowici= Nigellus' most famous work, Carmina in honorem Hludowici Caesaris, was written some time between 826 and February of 828 while Nigellus was in exile at Strasbourg. It is about 2650 lines of verse and has been divided into four books. Its primary purposes were to praise the successful exploits of Emperor Louis and also to persuade Louis to allow Nigellus to return to King Pippin's court. Ermoldus also explains that In honorem Hludowici should be used by King Pippin as a guide on how to rule a kingdom as Nigellus describes Emperor Louis as the perfect role model for kingship. This poem is often called into question for its historical reliability as it is intended to win Emperor Louis' favour, not report history. In honorem Hludowici is blatantly panegyric and is completely narrative. =Other works= Scholars assume that these three pieces of literature were not the only pieces that Ermoldus wrote as he does mention in his works that he often amused King Pippin with his poetry during the Breton campaign in 824 and he also seems to be a very skilled writer. Unfortunately none of these works survive today. Some scholars have argued Nigellus' authorship of a poem about Walter of Aquitaine, Waltharius, as there are similarities between it and In honorem Hludowici. But other scholars like Godman remain firm in their belief that Ermoldus did not write Waltharius as its poetic style is poorer than Ermoldus' is in his odes to Pippin and Louis.

The police strikes of 1918 and 1919 in the United Kingdom resulted in the British government putting before Parliament its proposals for a Police Act, which established the Police Federation of England and Wales as the representative body for the police. The Act barred police from belonging to a trade union or affiliating with any other trade union body. This Act, drafted and passed into law, was passed in response to the formation of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers (NUPPO). A successful police strike in 1918 and another strike in June 1919 led to the suppression of the union by the government. On 1 August 1919, the Police Act of 1919 passed into law. Only token opposition from a minority of Labour Members of Parliament was voiced in Parliament.Taaffe, P. and Mulhearn, T.

Union formation grew in the early 20th-century and an anonymous letter in the September 1913 issue of the Police Review announced that a police union was being formed. Rank-and-file officers began secretly joining the union. The police immediately dismissed anyone found to be a member. But the fledgling union appealed to the rank and file, and membership increased. On the eve of the 1918 strike, NUPPO claimed a membership of 10,000 out of an overall strength of 12,000 in the Metropolitan Police. Commissioner Sir Edward Henry responded by issuing an official police order banning the union and promising instant dismissal to anyone found to be associated with it. The national government also announced its opposition. The Home Secretary and the Commissioner believed that the threats of dismissal from the force and loss of pension rights would be an adequate deterrent. But, by August 1918 the Metropolitan Police went on strike. =Dismissal of Police Constable Thiel= The police dismissed Police Constable Thiel, a prominent member of the force and a union organiser, for union activities. This action was a catalyst for the 1918 strike, a spark for many grievances over pay and conditions. The authorities grossly underestimated the strength of rank-and-file support for positive action to address their grievances and to defend Constable Thiel. The day before the strike began, Police superintendents reported at their weekly meeting with the commissioner that all was quiet in the force. The 1918 strike The executive of NUPPO demanded a pay increase, improved war bonuses, extension of pension rights to include policemen's widows, a shortening of the pension entitlement period, and an allowance for school-aged children. The most significant issue was that NUPPO be officially recognised as the representative of the police workers. NUPPO informed the authorities that unless their demands were met by midnight on the 29 August, they would call a strike. The strike of 1918 caught the government off guard at a time of domestic and international labour unrest. The swiftness of the strike and the solidarity of the men shocked the government. By the next day, 30 August, 12,000 men were on strike, virtually the entire complement of men in the Metropolitan Force. The government deployed troops at key points across the capital in response and its priority was to end the strike. Prime Minister Lloyd George, who had been in France when the strike started, called a meeting on the 31st with the executive of NUPPO, and the strike was settled that same day. The terms of the settlement included an increase for all ranks of 13 shillings [65p] per week in pensionable pay, raising the minimum to 43 shillings [¬£2.15]. The right to a pension was reduced from 30 years' service to 26 years' service, and widows were awarded a pension of 10 shillings [50p]. A war bonus of 12 shillings [60p] per week was granted, and a grant of 2 shillings and sixpence [p] for each child of school age was given. Constable Thiel was reinstated. All NUPPO's demands had been met except official recognition of the union. Outside London there had been no strikes. But policemen in Manchester threatened to strike; they were offered and accepted the same terms given to the Metropolitan Police. By October, several other police forces around the country had been given pay increases. An immediate consequence of the strike was the increase in union membership, which jumped from 10,000 in August to 50,000 by November 1918. As far as union recognition was concerned, Lloyd George stated that this could not be granted in time of war. The fact that Lloyd George had met, and settled the dispute, with the union leaders was viewed by union president James Marston as de facto recognition of the union. As a consequence of the 1918 strike, Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned and was replaced by a serving soldier, General Sir Nevil Macready. Macready immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had the comforting knowledge that, given the circumstances in which his appointment was made, he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance that was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with. In an attempt to circumnavigate the union, Macready established representative boards for police officers. In instituting the boards, Macready had neither consulted the government nor the Union. These boards would consist of one delegate from each of the twenty-six divisions within the Metropolitan force ‚Äì all of whom were to be elected by secret ballot. The NUPPO executive demanded once again that NUPPO be officially recognised. With the approval of the Home Office, Macready lifted Police Orders ban barring police from joining NUPPO, but added an addendum forbidding union members from interfering with police discipline or imploring police to withdraw from duty. Desborough Committee and 1919 strike The government announced that a committee be convened under Lord Desborough that would look at all aspects of police forces in England, Wales, and Scotland. One of the things the committee highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay. At the time, there was no uniform pay structure for the police. Local Watch Committees were the sole arbiters of police pay. The pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had outstripped that of the police. The Desborough Committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with two children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings [¬£2.75], including all their allowances such as rent and a child allowance. The Desborough Committee cited examples that a street sweeper in Newcastle-on- Tyne was on the same rate of pay as a constable in the provincial force. Ten other examples cited by the committee also showed police were paid less than menial labour occupations, six of which paid higher than the Metropolitan Police. Lord Desborough was therefore quite sympathetic to the plight of the ordinary policeman regarding pay, and consequently recommended comparatively generous increases. By the end of 1918 and into 1919 it seemed that all the unions, large and small, were active in disputes throughout Britain. By mid-1919 there were strikes or the threat of strikes on the docks and among railway and other transport workers. There was a nationwide bakers' strike and a rent strike by council tenants in Glasgow. The press, meanwhile, was reporting that a Bolshevik revolution had arrived in Britain. The government could not afford the possibility of the police aligning with another union or the TUC. The government interpreted labour discontent, including the police, as a sign of disloyalty. It was determined that it would not be caught napping a second time. The Police Act of 1919 was the death knell of NUPPO. It established the Police Federation of England and Wales, a public sector version of a company union, to replace NUPPO. Under the Act, NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police and forbade police from belonging to a trade union. NUPPO had no options but to fight or fold; unsurprisingly, it chose to fight. This time, however, it was the union that misread the mood of the men when it called for another strike. Out of a force of 18,200 men in the Metropolitan Police, only 1,156 participated in the strike in 1919. =Liverpool= Liverpool City Police, however, supported the 1919 strike. Of the 1,874 members of the Liverpool City Police, 954 went on strike. The Bootle police union claimed that 69 out of 70 officers had joined the strike. The grievances of police in Liverpool were for many years ignored by a local Watch Committee noted for its disciplinarian attitude, which helped foster the propensity for collective action. The poor conditions in the Liverpool Police were well known amongst other forces in England. On the day the strike started in Liverpool, strikers formed into ranks and marched on police stations around the city in an attempt to persuade those not on strike to join them. Police strikers confronted fellow officers who had not joined the strike, some of whom were union members. The consequences for the people of Liverpool were far greater than those in the capital. Left without an effective police presence, public order in some areas broke down and resulted in what the Liverpool Daily Post (4 August 1919) called \\"an orgy of looting and rioting\\". This continued for three or four days before the military, aided by non-striking police, brought the situation under control, but at the cost of several lives and more than 200 arrests for looting. The final outcome of the strike was that every man who had gone on strike throughout the country was dismissed from his respective force. Not one striker was reinstated anywhere. All those men lost their pension entitlements.Jones, O. \\"The 'Spirit of Petrograd'? The 1918 Police Strike\\". What Next? Journal. Retrieved 30 August 2007. =Outcome= The eventual outcome of the strikes of 1918 and 1919 benefited police workers. They received a pay increase that doubled their wages, and the government was forced to take notice of their issues, establishing the Police Federation in the process. The two strikes also increased the government's awareness of the importance of the police in terms of the government's own stability. After 1919, the police were never again taken quite as for granted, as they had been in the years before.

It is located three nautical miles (6 km) southwest of the central business district of Pahokee, Florida. The airport is owned by Palm Beach County and operated by the Palm Beach County Airports Department. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.  History  In 2004, Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne destroyed the airport's main building, causing operations to be conducted from a trailer. In 2009, new buildings were dedicated, including a office/lobby, a main hangar, and a building containing 10 rental hangars.  Facilities and aircraft  Palm Beach County Glades Airport covers an area of 243 acres (98 ha) at an elevation of 16 feet (5 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 17/35 with an asphalt surface measuring 4,116 by 75 feet (1,255 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending January 14, 2010, the airport had 36,750 aircraft operations, an average of 100 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% air taxi. At that time there were 26 aircraft based at this airport: 19% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, 15% helicopter, and 58% ultralight. The airport, commonly referred to as \\"Pahokee\\", does not have a control tower. Pilots landing at Pahokee use self-announce procedures to notify other aircraft of take-offs and landings. The airport can handle aircraft with a single-wheel weight of up to 20,000 pounds (9,071 kg) although local regulations restrict aircraft to 12,500 pounds (5,670 kg) and under. Because of the VOR/DME systems and relatively low traffic, this airport is one of five South Florida airports that is used for instrument training by student pilots. The airport's fixed-base operator (FBO) is Landmark Aviation. The former FBO was Pahokee Aviation, Inc.  Environmental concerns  Due to environmental considerations of the Florida everglades ecosystem, water drainage is strictly regulated by the East Shore Water Control District. Excess water drains from the Airport onto Closter Farms, located adjacent to the airport. The County compensates Closter Farms for drainage services that Closter's provides to take care of the excess drainage. Accidents and incidents * On March 8, 2019, a Piper PA-23 aircraft crashed into Lake Okeechobee while on approach to the airport. Five people were killed.

Champion is a well-established and experienced commentator who has also worked for the BBC and ITV over the last 20 years.He has commentated on four FA Cup Finals and six League Cup Finals, as well as numerous games across the Premier League, Champions League and Football League. Champion currently covers international football and Major League Soccer for ESPN. His broadcast partner for international matches is Stewart Robson, while he works with Taylor Twellman for MLS. His late father David Champion was the deputy headmaster of the independent school Bootham School, York. Jon's commentaries can also be heard on the worldwide feed of many Premier League and League Cup matches around the globe. Early life Jonathan Martin Champion was born on 23 May 1965 in Harrogate, West Riding of Yorkshire. BBC Sport Champion joined BBC Sport in the late 1980s and worked as a football commentator on BBC Radio Five Live between 1992 and 1996. He worked alongside Alan Green, Mike Ingham, Ron Jones, Rob Hawthorne and Jonathan Legard covering Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Football League matches for the network. During this time Champion commentated on the 1994 and 1996 Division One Play-Off Finals, and the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final between Juventus and Ajax. His fellow commentator on that evening was future ITV colleague Peter Drury. In 1995 an opportunity arose to further Champion's career at the BBC. John Motson took a three-month break from his role as a commentator on Match of the Day, allowing Champion to be drafted in to cover. Champion spent the whole of the 1995‚Äì1996 season combining his Five Live duties with appearances as a commentator on Match of the Day. He was successful enough to move across to TV permanently the following season, after Clive Tyldesley left the BBC and rejoined ITV. Champion spent five seasons between 1996 and 2001 as a full-time member of the BBC's commentary team, covering edited highlights of the Premier League and the FA Cup, in addition to occasional matches from the UEFA Cup. At the 1998 World Cup, Champion commentated on highlights of England's 2nd Round exit at the hands of Argentina. ITV Sport In the summer of 2000 ITV surprised the BBC with a successful bid for Premier League highlights. This kicked in from 2001, and left the BBC without any regular week-by-week football. Champion therefore moved to join ITV in 2001, and was a regular part of ITV's commentary team for the Premier League, League Cup, Football League and the UEFA Champions League. Setanta and ESPN In 2007, ambitious new-boys Setanta Sports UK signed up Champion as their number one FA Premier League commentator. Champion remained contracted to ITV, but was loaned out to Setanta. For two seasons he thus managed to combine his ITV duties with 'live' matches on Setanta. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Champion was increasingly heard more on Setanta who had also secured rights to the FA Cup. In May 2009, Champion commentated on his first FA Cup Final. Within a month, Setanta had gone into administration and were forced to relinquish their football rights. These were scooped up by the Disney-owned sports broadcaster ESPN, who rapidly established a brand new sports channel ESPN UK for the UK and Ireland and starting broadcasting Premier League football in August 2009. Champion was the natural choice as their number one commentator, and moved across from ITV permanently. However Champion was loaned back to ITV for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, working alongside his ESPN colleague Craig Burley. As well as being ESPN's lead Premier League commentator, Champion also commentates on the Europa League and the FA Cup. On 14 May 2011 he commentated alongside Chris Waddle on the FA Cup Final between Manchester City and Stoke City. In 2012, he was a commentator for ITV's coverage of Euro 2012 usually alongside Craig Burley. Champion then was loaned back to ESPN for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016 alongside former footballer Stewart Robson. Champion now part- time commentates for U.S. soccer men's friendlies alongside Kasey Keller when #1 commentator Ian Darke is not available. Champion returned to ITV for the 2018 FIFA World Cup where he paired with Ally McCoist. For the 2019 Major League Soccer season, Champion was named MLS on ESPN lead play-by-play commentator. In December 2019, Champion was part of a team of commentators for Prime Video Sport's UK Premier League coverage where he paired with his ITV co-comm Ally McCoist.

It was designed between 1966 and 1971 by the Auto Mag Corporation to make a semi- automatic pistol chambered in .44 AMP. The pistol's reputation and looks have made it popular in cinema and novels and several versions are listed as \\"Curios and Relics\\" by the ATF.  Function  The short-recoil operated Auto Mag pistol featured a rotary bolt with locking lugs located at the front similar to the M16/AR-15 rifle. The Auto Mag is a modest weight pistol designed to give handgun owners .44 Magnum power in a semi-automatic pistol. The .44 Auto Mag was designed to shoot .429-inch, 240-grain bullets at about the same velocity as the .44 Magnum revolver.  History  In 1970, Auto Mag Corporation president Harry Sanford opened a factory in Pasadena, California. The first pistol was shipped on August 8, 1971, and the factory declared bankruptcy on May 3, 1972, after making fewer than 3,000 pistols. The company opened and closed several times from 1973 through 1982 under several different names: TDE (Trade Deed Estates), OMC, Thomas Oil Company, High Standard, and AMT (Arcadia Machine & Tool). An additional 6,000 pistols were produced and sold during this period for a total of about 9,000. Sanford continued to sell spare parts until his death in 1996. His son Walter continued to sell the remaining parts online through automagparts.com. Production guns were made in .44 AMP. Experimental pistols were made in .45 ACP, .30 AMP, .357 AMP and .41 JMP. Changing calibers usually required only exchanging the barrel - the frame, magazine and bolt could be used with all calibers except .45 ACP. Auto Mag Corporation was short-lived for several reasons. The design team, headed by Mark Lovendale, took the AutoMag pistol from a fully functional machined chrome-moly steel prototype designed by Harry Sanford & Max Gera and created a more complicate and less reliable cast stainless steel version. The new design team was convinced the Auto Mag pistol was not ready for production and could not be produced at a profit. The design team believed that even with the correct finished design, the wholesale price of the pistol had to be greatly increased or the company would go bankrupt. The design team was unable to convince Sanford, and they all resigned. The pistol was then refined by the remaining staff, and put into production. Unfortunately the expensive manufacturing processes and materials, and need for many parts to be produced by sub-contractors made the gun unprofitable resulting in bankruptcy of the original company. Under-pricing of the Auto Mag pistol made ultimate success impossible. One analysis claimed that the Auto Mag Corporation lost more than $1,000 on each pistol; each pistol sold wholesale for around $170. The pistols originally retailed for $217.50 in the 1970s. Used Auto Mag pistols now sell for much more. In August 2015 Walter Sanford sold all the assets of the company including the name, trademark, and all rights to AutoMag Ltd. Corp., a South Carolina-based corporation. Auto Mag is currently producing the first 77 Founders' Edition pistols with an 8.5\\" barrel, selling for $3,995 each.

Lee Jurras of Super Vel Ammunition commissioned a limited run of Auto Mags to be given the \\"LEJ\\" prefix on their serial numbers. They were to be custom-made to his specifications and were chambered in .44AMP, .357AMP and in Jurras' wildcat .41 JMP. Some of Jurras's custom Auto Mags had custom leather holsters and magazine pouches, shoulder stocks, high polish finish, engraving, and other features. =Ammunition= A .44 AMP next to a .44 Remington Magnum cartridge. The .44 Auto Mag Pistol cartridge was introduced in 1971. Its rimless, straight wall case was originally formed by trimming the .308 Winchester or .30-06 case to 1.30 inches (33 mm). Loaded ammunition was once available from the Mexican firm of Cartuchos Deportivos Mexico and from Norma (a Swedish firm), which produced empty cases. The .357 AMP round went into production in 1972 with the North Hollywood guns. It is similar to the .44 AMP, but is necked down to accept the smaller diameter bullet. The same is true for the .41JMP, .30, .25 and .22LMP. Presently, loaded ammunition is available from Cor-Bon as well as SBR Ammunition, and new .44 AMP brass is available from Starline Brass. The dedicated handloader can form AMP cases from .30-06 or .308 Winchester brass, using a series of forming dies and an inside neck reamer. The Auto Mag design gave birth to three new cartridges: the .44 AutoMag (.44 AMP), .357 AutoMag (.357 AMP) and the lesser-known .41 JMP. There were barrels made to shoot other cartridges: :Harry Sanford * .44 AMP (uses the .44 Magnum bullet) * .357 AMP (uses the .357 Magnum bullet) * .300 AMP [uses the .30 Carbine bullet; necked down at a different shoulder angle than the .30 LMP) * .45 Win Mag * .45 ACP (experimental only) * .475 Auto Mag (experimental only, uses the .475 Wildey Magnum bullet) :Lee Jurras * .41 JMP (Uses the .41 Magnum bullet) :Kent Lomont * .30 LMP (Lomont Magnum Pistol) (uses the .30 Carbine bullet; necked down at a different shoulder angle than the .30 AMP) * .25 LMP (uses the .25 ACP bullet) * .22 LMP (uses the .22 WMR bullet) * .45 ACP Magnum (experimental only, uses the .45 ACP bullet) :Eric Kincel and Brian Maynard Kincel was an editor for Gun World magazine and Maynard was a technician who worked at AMT's service department. * .40 KMP (Kincel-Maynard Pistol) (experimental only, .45 Winchester Magnum case necked down to accept a .40 S&W; bullet), created in October 1990 * 8mm KMP (experimental only, based on an unmodified 7.92x33 (8mm Kurz) rifle case to accept a .323 inch diameter pistol-style projectile), created in 2010, introduced in June 2012  AMT AutoMag  AMT (Arcadia Machine and Tool) manufactured several firearms under the AutoMag name, including the AMT AutoMag II in .22 WMR, AMT AutoMag III in .30 Carbine, AMT AutoMag IV in .45 Winchester Magnum and AMT AutoMag V in .50 Action Express. In popular culture * In 1983, the Auto Mag was featured in the fourth Dirty Harry movie, Sudden Impact. Clint Eastwood's character Harry Callahan uses his .44 Auto Mag to kill Mick after Harry loses his Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver in a fist fight.

The announcer was \\"Uncle\\" Fred Scott. Taped at the studios of WNEW-TV in New York City, the show involved two teams, each composed of a celebrity and a civilian contestant. The format both predated the board game Pictionary (introduced in 1985) and was the game show predecessor to Win, Lose or Draw (which debuted in 1987). Main Game The first round would start with the two civilian contestants standing behind a drawing board that was about waist-high. They would be given 10 seconds each to draw a picture that would allow the celebrities to identify the person, place, thing, or event that was assigned to them. After 10 seconds passed for the first player, the second one would immediately start drawing (accompanied by Gilbert's call to \\"Draw!\\") When a celebrity thought he or she knew the identity of the subject, they would hit a buzzer. The contestant would then stop drawing and the celebrity would give his/her guess (usually accompanied with a brief explanation/interpretation of what they saw on the board). If he or she was right, the team was awarded one point for each second left on the clock (the clock started at 60 seconds). If no one guessed the identity of the subject after 60 seconds, the subject was thrown out and they would start again. There were three rounds in a game; after each round, the celebs and the contestants would switch places. After three rounds, the team with the highest score won the game and got to play the bonus round. In the bonus round, the winning team was given the opportunity to play one final game. The guest star would guess and the contestant would do the drawing. The contestant of the team was awarded $100 for winning the main game. Bonus Round In the bonus round, the celebrity had 30 seconds to communicate a \\"potluck\\" subject to the contestant (who was not told the category of the subject). The contestant could yell out as many guesses as he or she wanted without having to buzz in or explain it, and if the subject was successfully guessed, he/she was awarded a 13\\" color television set. Episode status The series is presumed to be lost, as is the case with many game show series from the late 1950s through the early 1980s.

However, both manufacturers and dealers can still be held liable for damages resulting from defective products, breach of contract, criminal misconduct, and other actions for which they are directly responsible in much the same manner that any U.S.-based manufacturer of consumer products is held responsible. They may also be held liable for negligent entrustment when they have reason to know a gun is intended for use in a crime. The PLCAA is codified at 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 7901‚Äì7903. Background In the years before passage of the act, victims of firearms violence in the United States had successfully sued manufacturers and dealers for negligence on the grounds that they should have foreseen that their products would be diverted to criminal use.Munoz, S. Why Isn't The Media Discussing The Unprecedented Law Giving Gun Makers And Dealers Immunity? Media Matters, December 19, 2012. In 1998, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley sued gun makers and dealers, saying: \\"You can't expect the status quo on businesses which make money and then have no responsibility to us as citizens.\\" The city of Bridgeport, Connecticut, also sued several gun companies. Mayor Joseph Ganim said that the city's action aimed at \\"creating law with litigation.... That's the route that we're going because [the industry has] always very effectively, with big money, lobbied the legislature and kept laws from being passed.\\"Fred Musante, After Tobacco, Handgun Lawsuits, The New York Times (January 31, 1999). In 2000, Smith & Wesson, facing several state and federal lawsuits, signed an agreement brokered by President Bill Clinton, in which the company voluntarily agreed to implementing various measures in order to settle the suits. The agreement required Smith & Wesson to sell guns only through dealers that complied with the restrictions on all guns sold regardless of manufacturer, thus potentially having a much wider potential impact than just Smith & Wesson. HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo was quoted as saying that gun manufacturers that did not comply would suffer \\"death by a thousand cuts\\", and Eliott Spitzer said that those who didn't cooperate would have bankruptcy lawyers \\"knocking at your door\\". In January 2005, New York City passed a law allowing lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers that did not voluntarily implement certain gun control measures. Legislative history A similar measure had been rejected by the Senate on March 2, 2004, after it had been combined with an extension to the assault weapons ban into a single piece of legislation. The act was passed by the U.S. Senate on July 29, 2005, by a vote of 65‚Äì31.\\"Roll Call Vote - 109th Congress, Vote 209\\", U.S. Senate. Retrieved March 7, 2016.

It was signed into law on October 26, 2005, by President George W. Bush and became Public Law 109‚Äì92.

In the first, a jury found in favor of a gun store in Alaska after a gun purchased by Jason Coday was used in a murder. The second resulted in a six million dollar verdict against Badger Guns after guns negligently sold there were used to shoot police officers. In 2016, a Missouri gun store settled for $2.2 million, for selling a gun to a schizophrenic woman who later killed her father, after the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the sale was \\"negligent entrustment\\" and therefore was not protected by the PLCAA.https://www.thetrace.org/2016/04/lawsuit-against- missouri-gun-seller-plcaa/http://www.newsweek.com/missouri-gun-shop-agrees- pay-22-million-settle-wrongful-death-lawsuit-524167 The store had previously been warned by the woman's parents that she was mentally unstable, and asked that she not be sold a gun. In October 2016, a Connecticut Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the families of some victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting against the manufacturer (Remington), the wholesale distributor, and the retailer of the semi-automatic rifle used in the shooting. Judge Barbara Bellis ruled that the suit \\"falls squarely within the broad immunity\\" provided to gun manufacturers and dealers by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. However, on March 14, 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed the lower court's ruling, allowing plaintiffs to continue their suit against Remington. The US Supreme Court declined to intervene in ongoing litigation that had not been decided. A lawsuit by victims of the Sutherland Springs shooting against the gun shop that sold the gun has been allowed to proceed because the shooter used a Colorado driver's license as identification to purchase the gun with a 30-round magazine (a 30-round magazine is standard on the gun). In sales of firearms to the resident of another state, the sale must comply with the laws of both the seller's and the purchaser's states. Colorado law prohibits the sale of magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds. =Dismissed suits= In 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in Ileto v. Glock, ending a lawsuit against Glock by the family of victims in the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting. The Brady Center and families of victims of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting sued Lucky Gunner, the online store where some of the ammunition was purchased. Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch dismissed the charges. He ordered the plaintiffs to pay Lucky Gunner's legal fees under a separate Colorado law, HB 000‚Äì208. Renewed interest After the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook, Connecticut, shooting incidents, a renewed effort has been mounted to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to make it possible for victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers on a broader array of grounds.Bissell, H.J. Rolling Back Legal Immunity for the Gun Industry. Daily Kos, Jan 14, 2013. =2016 election= During the 2016 United States presidential election, the act became a campaign issue, particularly within the Democratic Party primaries. Hillary Clinton stated that she would repeal the law if elected, saying: \\"They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences.\\"Carroll, Lauren (October 16, 2015). \\"Clinton: Gun industry Is 'Wholly Protected' from All Lawsuits\\", PolitiFact. Retrieved March 10, 2016. Shortly after Clinton made this claim, fact checker Politifact rated the statement false, noting that other businesses and entities in America have similar or greater levels of protection against liability, and that firearms dealers and manufacturers are still susceptible to lawsuits and liability. Bernie Sanders, who as a congressman voted for the law in 2005, defended the law in October 2015, saying: \\"If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\\" He changed his position somewhat in January 2016, saying that he would favor a partial repeal of the law.Zorn, Eric (January 20, 2016). \\"Bernie Sanders Misfires on Gun Law Repeal\\", Chicago Tribune. Retrieved March 10, 2016. = 2020 election = In 2020, Bernie Sanders was again attacked for voting in favor of the law, especially by Joe Biden. Criticism While gun violence continues as a major sociopolitical issue in the United States, the firearms industry has negated civil action lawsuits from gun violence victims due to protection from liability that federal law grants the business. According to the Center for American Progress, the PLCAA prevents \\"victims of gun violence from pursuing well-established legal claims against irresponsible gun manufacturers and sellers‚Äîwithout presenting an alternative means for the victims to be compensated.\\" Exceptions within the law that allow lawsuits to go forward fall under \\"negligent entrustment\\" and \\"predicate exception\\" actions, which target negligent retailers or manufacturers who violated local statutes applicable to the sale of firearms, but these cases are difficult to prove and rarely clear the PLCAA threshold in court. A 2007 report in the American Journal of Public Health states that the PLCAA is potentially dangerous to the public health because it removes both regulation and ligitation as incentives for firearm companies to make their products safer. This viewpoint is contended by certain circles, including the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, which noted that the \\"PLCAA‚Äôs purpose was to curb efforts by gun‚Äê‚Äãcontrol advocates to circumvent state legislatures and attack Second Amendment rights through a never‚Äê‚Äãending series of lawsuits against manufacturers and retailers of firearms to hold them financially responsible for crimes committed using the weapons they make and sell.\\" However, legal scholars have observed that advocates of the PLCAA failed to note any changes in financial implication for the firearms industry. A law review by the Southern Methodist University of Dallas, Texas noted that: > ‚ÄúPLCAA opponents... argue that the so-called \\"tidal wave of litigation\\" used > to justify PLCAA's passage is exaggerated in terms of both scale and cost. > They point to Congressional debates examining the SEC filings of gun giants > like Smith & Wesson & Ruger. Rather than revealing the hundreds of millions > of dollars in litigation costs purported to exist by PLCAA supporters, they > expose multi-million dollar sales figures, but only de minimis legal > expenses. Also de minimis, according to such opponents, are the number of > suits faced by the gun industry, accounting for only fifty-seven out of the > ten million torts suits filed between 1993 and 2003... many seek injunctive > relief only and therefore could not possibly have the economically crippling > effects which PLCAA backers fear.‚Äú See also *Gun control *Gun law in the United States *Gun politics in the United States References External links * PLCAA text * PLCAA house hearings * Govtrack.us Status report on S 397 Acts of the 109th United States Congress Gun politics in the United States United States federal firearms legislation ","title":"Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act"},{"id":"2961952","text":"Th√©odore Lacordaire or Jean Th√©odore Lacordaire (1 February 1801 ‚Äì 18 July 1870) was a Belgian entomologist of French extraction.

Born in Amritsar in the Punjab Province of the colonial India in 1878, he was awarded the Indian version of the World Heavyweight Championship on 15 October 1910, and went on to defeat free style wrestling champions across the world. Undefeated in a career spanning more than 52 years, he is considered one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. During the partition of India, the Great Gama saved the lives of many Hindus and then spent the rest of his days until his death on May 23, 1960 in Lahore, which became a part of the newly created state of Pakistan. Early life Ghulam Mohammad Baksh Butt was born in Amritsar into a Kashmiri Muslim family of wrestlers in the Punjab region of Northern India. He came from a wrestling family which was known to produce world-class wrestlers. The Butt family is believed by historians to originally have been Kashmiri Brahmins (Butta) who converted to Islam during Muslim rule in Kashmir. Gama had two wives: one in Punjab and the other in Baroda, Gujarat, India. After the death of his father Muhammad Aziz Baksh when he was six, Gama was put under the care of his maternal grandfather Nun Pahalwan. Following his death, Gama was taken care of by his uncle Ida, another wrestler, who also began training Gama in wrestling. He was first noticed at the age of ten, in 1888, when he entered a strongman competition held in Jodhpur, which included many grueling exercises such as squats. The contest was attended by more than four hundred wrestlers and Gama was among the last fifteen and was named the winner by the Maharaja of Jodhpur due to his young age. Gama was subsequently taken into training by the Maharaja of Datia. Training and diet baithak dand Gama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada (court). He did a minimum of five thousand baithaks (Hindustani word for squats) (avg. speed 100-200 squats per minute) and three thousand dands (Hindustani word for pushups) (avg. speed 50-100 pushups per minute) in a day and even sometimes more within 30 to 45 minutes each by wearing a doughnut-shaped wrestling apparatus called a Hasli of 1 Quintal (approx. 100 kilos). Gama's everyday diet included # 10 litres of milk # 1.5 pounds of desi Chicken Karhai # Half litre of lassi # six pounds of butter # three buckets of fruit chaat # Two kilo pakoray # Six samosay # along with fruit juices and other ingredients to promote his digestive system and muscular health. Career =First encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultaniwala= Fame came to Gama in 1895, at the age of 17 when he challenged then-Indian Wrestling Champion, middle-aged Raheem Bakhsh Sultaniwala, another ethnic Kashmiri wrestler from Gujranwala, now in Punjab, Pakistan. At about 7 feet tall, with a very impressive win-loss record, Raheem was expected to easily defeat the 5'7\\" Gama. Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career. The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw. The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career. After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the Indian Wrestling Championship. In the first bout Gama remained defensive, but in the second bout, Gama went on the offensive. Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal out a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh. By 1910, Gama had defeated all the prominent Indian wrestlers who faced him except the champion, Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala (the Rustam-e-Hind or the lineal champion of India). At this time, he focused his attention on the rest of the world. Accompanied by his younger brother Imam Bakhsh, Gama sailed to England to compete with the Western wrestlers but could not gain instant entry, because of his lower height. =Tournament in London= In London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers in thirty minutes of any weight class. This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R. B. Benjamin. For a long time no one came forward to accept the challenge. To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers. He challenged Stanislaus Zbyszko and Frank Gotch, either he would beat them or pay them the prize money and go home. The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American Benjamin Roller. In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other. On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to official tournament. =Match with Stanislaus Zbyszko= He was pitted against world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko and the date of bout was set as 10 September 1910. Zbyszko was then regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London. The match was ¬£250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama's greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko's lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. Nevertheless, Zbyszko still became one of the few wrestlers to ever meet the Great Gama without going down in defeat; The two men were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910. On that date, Zbyszko failed to show up and Gama was announced the winner by default. He was awarded the prize and the John Bull Belt. Receiving this belt entitled Gama to be called Rustam-e-Zamana or World Champion but not the lineal champion of the world as he hadn't defeated Zbyszko in the ring. =Bouts against American and European champions= During this tour Gama defeated some of the most respected grapplers in the world, \\"Doc\\" Benjamin Roller of the United States, Maurice Deriaz of Switzerland, Johann Lemm (the European Champion) of Switzerland, and Jesse Peterson (World Champion) from Sweden. In the match against Roller, Gama threw \\"Doc\\" 13 times in the 15-minute match. Gama now issued a challenge to the rest of those who laid claim to the World Champion's Title, including Japanese Judo champion Taro Miyake, George Hackenschmidt of Russia and Frank Gotch of the United States ‚Äì each declined his invitation to enter the ring to face him. At one point, to face some type of competition, Gama offered to fight twenty English wrestlers, one after another. He announced that he would defeat all of them or pay out prize money, but still no one would take up his challenge. =Final encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala= Shortly after his return from England, Gama faced Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala in Allahabad. This bout eventually ended the long struggle between the two pillars of Indian wrestling of that time in favour of Gama and he won the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the lineal Champion of India. Later in his life when asked about who was his strongest opponent, Gama replied, \\"Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala\\". =Rematch with Zbyszko= After beating Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, Gama faced Pandit Biddu, who was one of the best wrestlers in India of that time (1916), and beat him. In 1922, during a visit to India, the Prince of Wales presented Gama with a silver mace. Gama did not have any opponents until 1927, when it was announced that Gama and Zbyszko would face each other again. They met in Patiala in January 1928. Entering the bout, Zbyszko \\"showed a strong build of body and muscle\\" and Gama, it was reported \\"looked much thinner than usual\\". However, he managed to overpower the former easily and won the bout inside a minute, winning the Indian version of the lineal World Wrestling Championship. Following the bout, Zbyszko praised him, calling him a \\"tiger\\". At forty-eight years old he was now known as the \\"Great wrestler\\" of India. =Fight with Balram Heeraman Singh Yadav= After defeating Zbyszko, Gama beat Jesse Petersen in February 1929. The bout lasted only one and a half minutes. This was the last bout that Gama fought during his career. In the 1940s he was invited by the Nizam of Hyderabad and defeated all his fighters. The Nizam then sent him to face the wrestler Balram Heeraman Singh Yadav, who was never defeated in his life. The fight was very long. Gama was unable to defeat Heeraman and eventually neither wrestler won. Heeraman was one of the toughest wrestlers for Gama to face. After the independence and partition of India in 1947, Gama moved to Pakistan. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out at the time of partition, the Muslim Gama saved hundreds of Hindus from mobs in Lahore. Although Gama did not retire until 1952, he failed to find any other opponents. Some other sources say he wrestled until 1955. After his retirement, he trained his nephew Bholu Pahalwan, who held the Pakistani wrestling championship for almost 20 years. Death He died in Lahore, Pakistan on 23 May 1960 after a period of illness. He was given land and monthly pension by the government and supported his medical expenses until his death.https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/here-s-the-story-of-gama-the- undefeated-pehalwan-and-how-he-saved-hindus-during-1947-riots-321745.html Kulsoom Nawaz, Pakistan‚Äôs first lady and wife of Nawaz Sharif who remained the Prime Minister of Pakistan, was the granddaughter of The Great Gama Legacy Bruce Lee was an avid follower of Gama's training routine.

He studied with Arnold Sch√∂nberg and was his assistant. Teaching at the Sorbonne and the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris, he influenced notable students such as Philippe Capdenat, Donald Harris, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g and Philippe Manoury.  Career  Born in Vienna, Deutsch was a pupil of and assistant to Arnold Schoenberg. He studied under him in Vienna before the First World War; and followed Sch√∂nberg as his assistant to Amsterdam in 1921. Deutsch was a Fellow and taught at UNESCO, and taught at the Sorbonne (Paris IV) from 1970 to 1971, and finally, from 1972 to the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris. He founded in Paris the theater ' (The Jewish Mirror), where many works of composers such as Sch√∂nberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg were first performed. Konstantin Stanislavsky commissioned a work which was to become the opera ' (Chess). His \\"film symphony\\" ' (The Treasure) came from a commission from German film director Georg Wilhelm Pabst to provide an original musical score for his 1923 film. In structure, ' was crafted in two formats: a film score and a stand-alone symphonic work. The five act symphony survived because the manuscript in the latter form was donated to the Deutsches Filminstitut in 1982, shortly before Deutsch died. A score of years later, DeutschlandRadio Berlin collaborated with the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, conducted by Frank Strobel, to produce a record of \\"this extremely rare and totally unknown symphonic work\\". The recording became the foundation of a \\"synchronized restoration\\" of the film. As film music the \\"piece is scored for a theater orchestra of the kind typically found in European cinemas of the day\\". It brings to mind the work of Kurt Weill and Stefan Wolpe, and foreshadows Max Steiner's modernist film scores, adopting expressionist atonal twelve tone leitmotifs. Mood setting and character are developed; pianos appear throughout. From 1940 to 1945, Deutsch served in the French Foreign Legion. He formed long lasting friendships with Georges Bernanos and Jean Cassou. He was close to Tristan Tzara, Jean Cocteau and Vladimir Jankelevitch. Max Deutsch was a friend of Ferruccio Busoni. He died in Paris. After the Second World War, he devoted himself mainly to teaching music, chiefly following the principles of Sch√∂nberg. In Paris, among his hundreds of students, there were composers: Jorge Arriagada, Girolamo Arrigo, Colette Bailly, Sylvano Bussotti, Philippe Capdenat, G√©rard Cond√©, Ahmed Essyad, Jacqueline Fontyn, Sylvia Hallett, Donald Harris, F√©lix Ibarrondo, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Philippe Manoury, Patrick Marcland, Luis de Pablo, Yves-Marie Pasquet, Kyriakos Sfetsas, Raymond Vaillant; American composers David Chaitkin, Eugene Kurtz, Allen Shearer, and Dean C. Taylor; British composer Nicholas Maw; Canadian-born Srul Irving Glick; Italian Sylvano Bussotti; the conductor Alexandre Myrat; and music critic Heinz-Klaus Metzger. Family A love of music and music theory ran in the family. His brother was Frederick Dorian (1902-1991). Frederick's name metamorphosed from Friederich Deutsch before he became a naturalized American. Both Deutsch brothers studied under Sch√∂nberg in Vienna. Frederick too was a master of music and learned the subject from a number of other sources. Frederick was taught musicology by Guido Adler. He earned a PhD in 1924 with his thesis, \\"Fugue in the works of Beethoven\\" (\\"\\"). Eduard Steuermann taught him piano. Anton Webern taught him how to conduct and music theory. He spent a four-year stint, beginning in 1930, as a music critic which was capped by a year as a correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung in Paris. Thereafter he became a Carnegie-Mellon University music professor. Legacy Before he died, Deutsch attempted to destroy all of his compositions, so that his only surviving legacy would be his students. However, some of his work survived. In late 2013, a recording of Deutsch conducting the Suisse Romande Orchestra in a performance of three \\"master works\\" by Arnold Schoenberg was released. It includes short lectures by Deutsch on each of the pieces.

The project is a joint collaboration between the Astrophysics Group of the University of Exeter and the Astrophysics Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University. The project was led by Alasdair Allan and Tim Naylor at the University of Exeter, and Iain Steele at Liverpool John Moores University. The eSTAR Project was affiliated with the RoboNet Consortium, and the global Heterogeneous Telescope Networks Consortium. Begun in 2001, the project was part of the virtual observatory. By 2006 the project was running autonomous software agent for observations of variable stars implementing the optimal sampling techniques of Saunders et al. (2006), and the prototype was successfully tested on the RoboNet network of telescopes which includes: the Liverpool Telescope, the Faulkes Telescope North and the Faulkes Telescope South. By 2007 the eSTAR Project was \\"live\\" supporting two real-time observing projects. The first was automated follow-up observations of gamma-ray bursts performed using the 3.8m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) operated by Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii (JACH). The first ground based observations of GRB 090423 were triggered via the eSTAR Project, with initial observations by the Swift Gamma- Ray Burst Mission automatically followed by UKIRT just a few minutes after the initial observation by the SWIFT satellite. The observations autonomously triggered by the eSTAR software were reported in Tanvir et al. This gamma-ray burst was, at the time of discovery, the most distant object then known in the Universe. The second project was the search for extra-solar planets by placing observations on the RoboNet system of telescopes on behalf of the PLANET collaboration. The technique of gravitational microlensing is used to monitor large numbers of stars in the galactic bulge looking for the tell-tale signature of cool planets orbiting those stars. The project also operated the heaviest used of the initial generation of Virtual Observatory VOEvent brokers, exposing its real-time alert system to other collaborators, like the TALONS Project.

It was developed by Beyond Games and published by Accolade. In Europe, the game is known as Redline - Gang Warfare: 2066. It is a spiritual successor to the Atari Lynx video game BattleWheels. The game was noted for its ability to enter or exit vehicles during combat at anytime; thus, combining the genres of car combat and first-person shooting. This was the last game Accolade published before being acquired by Infogrames. History In early 1995, a new version of the 1993 Atari Lynx handheld video game BattleWheels was announced. It was intended to be released on both PC and the Atari Jaguar in late 1995; however, developer Beyond Games was busy with the fighting game Ultra Vortek, and eventually the Atari Jaguar became a commercial failure, being discontinued in early 1996. Beyond Games shifted its BattleWheels project to be primarily a PC game, and also decided to change the name of the game to Redline in 1997. It was initially going to be released at the end of 1997; however, the date got pushed back numerous times. The game was finally released in March of 1999. The game blended the two genres also found in its predecessor, car combat and first-person shooting. It contained a linear single-player storyline, which consisted of the aftermath of an apocalypse, caused by wealthy corporations (Insiders) that were angered and financially damaged by the general public's (Outsiders) use of free orgone energy. The protagonist was an unnamed silent Outsider, whom would battle both Insiders and other gangs while increasing his reputation in a like-minded gang called The Company. Redline included support to be played online using the MPlayer.com and Heat.net online services. It was available for play on their demo version even before the game was released. After those companies shut down, servers were moved to Gamespy Arcade. Shortly after release, the publisher, Accolade, had been bought out by Infogrames. Due to the previous delays and also the new internal mergers, post-release support for Redline ceased after only one small official patch was released; thus, there was no way to edit or mod the game. Due to this, unlike other '90s PC games, only a small fan community has existed for the title. A PlayStation version of the game was planned to be radically reworked from the Windows version to be more action-intensive, but was cancelled. Afterwards, a sequel/spinoff named Redline Arena was planned for the Dreamcast, but that too was cancelled. Elements from that project got worked into the PlayStation 2 game Motor Mayhem. Tommo purchased the rights to Redline and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015; thus, the game was re-released on Steam and GOG.com, albeit unchanged from the original release. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Most reviewers praised the graphics and premise; however, were divided on the gameplay itself (the blending of car combat and first-person shooting). Next Generation rated the game two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Combining two different types of gameplay into one game is a terrific idea, but someone should have mentioned that welding a mediocre first-person shooter onto a mediocre car-combat game is not the way to make the whole better than the sum of its parts.\\" In contrast, Computer Gaming World rated the game three and a half stars out of five, and stated that \\"While other games have tried to mix vehicular and on-foot combat and done it badly (think Necrodome), Redline does a better job of blending the two into a flashy, fast- paced package.\\" References External links * 1999 video games Accolade games Beyond Games games Cancelled PlayStation (console) games Cancelled Dreamcast games First- person shooters Vehicular combat games Post-apocalyptic video games Video games developed in the United States Video games set in the 2060s Windows games Windows-only games ","title":"Redline (1999 video game)"},{"id":"2962076","text":"Jacqueline Saburido (; 20 December 1978 ‚Äì 20 April 2019) was a Venezuelan activist and burn survivor who campaigned against drunk driving. After a car crash in 1999 Saburido received burns on 60% of her body; she went on to appear in drunk-driving ads and was twice a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show. She also unsuccessfully tried to become Britain's first face transplant patient. Early life and accident The only child of Rosalia and Amadeo Saburido, she lived in Caracas, Venezuela, for all of her childhood. Living with her father after her parents divorced, she studied engineering in the hope of taking over the family air conditioning business. On 19 September 1999, Saburido attended a birthday party near Austin, Texas. She and her friends left after a few hours, and accepted a ride home from a classmate. A short while into the drive, their car was hit by a large pickup truck driven by Reginald Stephey, who had been drinking beforehand. The driver and one passenger were killed, with the other passengers injured; of the three survivors, Saburido was the only one trapped in the car when it caught fire, and was unable to escape the flames. Passing paramedics extinguished the fire and tried to remove people from the car, but the fire reignited before they could rescue Saburido; they also lacked suitable equipment to cut her out. 45 seconds later a fire truck arrived and fully extinguished the fire, after which Saburido was airlifted to the burn unit in Galveston. Saburido suffered second and third degree burns to more than 60% of her body, but survived despite her doctor's expectations. Her fingers had to be amputated, but there was enough bone left on her thumb to construct an opposable thumb. She lost her hair, ears, nose, lips, left eyelid, and much of her vision. Saburido subsequently underwent more than 120 reconstructive operations, including cornea transplants to restore her left eye. In June 2001, Stephey was convicted on two counts of intoxicated manslaughter. Saburido and Stephey met for the first time after his trial and conviction in 2001.

After being convicted in that case, Hunt was tried in 1987 for the 1983 murder of Arthur Wilson, a 57-year-old black man of Winston-Salem. Both convictions were overturned on appeal in 1989. Hunt was tried again in the Wilson case in 1990; he was acquitted by an all-white jury. He was tried again on the Sykes charges in 1991; he was convicted. In 1994, the defense gained DNA testing of physical evidence in the Sykes case; this test was not available at the time of Hunt's trial in 1984. It showed that he could not have committed the rape. But a Forsyth County judge ruled that the DNA would not have been sufficient evidence to gain an acquittal, as he could still have been involved in the murder. Hunt was held in prison until 2004, when he was fully exonerated of the murder and released after serving 19 1/2 years. His exoneration followed the confession by Willard E. Brown to the crimes. In 2003 a review of the state database found that Brown's DNA matched that in the Sykes case, and in 2004 Hunt was formally exonerated.Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt , Winston-Salem Journal, 2007 Becoming a modern cause c√©l√®bre, Hunt's case was said to have \\"helped define race relations in Winston-Salem for 20 years.\\"\\"Introduction\\", Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt, About the series, Winston-Salem Journal, 2007 It resulted in an internal review and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation making its own inquiry in 1986. Incumbent District Attorney Tisdale lost his bid for re-election in the Democratic primary that same year. The Winston-Salem Journal published articles on the case in a 2003 series as a result of its six-month investigation into how the police and prosecution had investigated and shaped the discussion of the murder; they tried to reconcile the new DNA evidence with other facts to keep Hunt in jail. The newspaper published an \\"Epilogue\\" with the series in 2007 after Hunt was exonerated and freed in 2004. \\"In 2006 the chief justice of the N.C. Supreme Court appointed a group of prosecutors, police, defense attorneys and crime victims to the N.C. Actual Innocence Commission to look at what leads to wrongful convictions and to propose reforms.\\" In particular, the commission recommended changes to the procedure of gaining eyewitness testimony,Phoebe Zerwick, Part 8: \\"Closed Doors\\", Winston-Salem Journal, 23 November 2007; accessed 7 June 2017 resulting in changes to state law. That year the state also established the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission, to review cases post-conviction in which defendants and their attorneys believe they were wrongfully convicted. While in prison, Darryl Hunt became a Muslim and worked as a volunteer with the national Innocence Project. After being released, he was given settlements by the city and state. He founded The Darryl Hunt Project for Freedom and Justice, devoted to \\"educating the public about flaws in the criminal justice system, advocating for those wrongfully incarcerated as a result of those flaws, and providing resources and support for those trying to rebuild their lives.\\" He spoke widely on wrongful convictions and worked for reforms to criminal laws of North Carolina. Darryl Hunt died in 2016 in Winston-Salem from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Friends had been worried about his mental health and possible depression. Background Hunt was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1965. He had an older brother Willie and a younger sister; the children were mostly raised by their maternal grandparents, William Stroud and his wife. Stroud was a foreman for the city's street department. For years the children were told their mother Jean, who visited, was their aunt. She was killed when Hunt was nine and he said that as a teenager, he was haunted by her death. The children attended local schools for a time; Hunt dropped out of high school. He went to Monterey, California with a cousin but returned to his hometown at age 18.Phoebe Kerwick, Part 2: \\"The Search Begins: Who Saw What\\", Winston-Salem Journal, 2003, reprinted 17 November 2007 online; accessed 27 May 2017 His grandfather had bequeathed him some money that Hunt used to get an apartment with a girlfriend and her young daughter. He worked in construction but within a year, he was no longer working, had split with the girlfriend and lost the apartment. He started hanging out or running with Sammy Mitchell, an older friend whom he had known for years. History of the Wilson case In 1983, Arthur Wilson, a 57-year- old African-American man, was beaten and killed about 2 am outside a juke joint in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Juke joints or apartments were common in poor, black and white neighborhoods, serving as a ready place for people to drink at most times of day or night. The police pursued some leads but did not arrest any suspects. They reopened the Wilson case in 1986 after receiving new information.Phoebe Zerwick, Part Five: \\"New Look, New Trial\\", Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt, in Winston-Salem Journal, 20 November 2007; accessed 25 May 2017 History of the Sykes case In August 1984, Deborah Sykes, a young, white, married copy editor, was raped and murdered by stabbing in the early morning about 6 am on her way to work at The Sentinel newspaper in Winston-Salem. She had recently started working there, having returned to her home state in July from the Chattanooga News-Free Press in Tennessee. Experts describe the crime as \\"an unusually vicious rape and murder\\", in which she was also sodomized and stabbed 16 times.Phoebe Zerwick, Part 3: \\"Arrest and Protest\\", Winston-Salem Journal, 2003, posted 18 November 2017; accessed 28 May 2017 A witness placed Sammy Mitchell and Darryl Hunt, two young African-American men, near the scene of the crime, but was not positive about the identification. Experts have criticized the way the line-up was conducted in which Hunt was identified, noting that the police officer who conducted the line-up knew Hunt was a suspect and could have influenced the witness. Secondly, in one lineup, Hunt's photo had a different background than those of other men. Police talked to Margaret Crawford, Hunt's underage girlfriend who was working as a prostitute, who changed her account several times. No physical evidence linked either man to the crime. But on September 14, the police charged Hunt with first-degree murder. The next day his arrest photo was published in the newspaper, associating him with the vicious murder. \\"Hunt had no record of violent crime or sexual offense at the time he became a suspect.\\" Former FBI agent Greg McCrary, \\"who specializes in developing psychological profiles of sex offenders,\\" said that usually such a violent crime as Sykes was committed by someone with a history of violence against women. In 1985 Hunt was convicted of the rape and first-degree murder of Sykes; the jury had eleven whites and one black man. (The three alternates were also white; the county's population was 25% black.) According to a later discussion by the jury foreman, members had a difficult time with the case, initially voting 7-5 in favor of guilt. Ultimately they did vote unanimously that he was guilty of first-degree murder.Part 4: \\"Uneasy DA Wins a Conviction\\", Winston-Salem Journal, 2003, reposted 19 November 2007; accessed 28 May 2017 In the separate vote for sentencing, Hunt was spared the death penalty because none of the jurors voted for the capital sentence.The Darryl Hunt Project for Freedom and Justice, He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was indicted again in 1990 for the crimes against Sykes, under a new county district attorney. Mitchell was also indicted that year in Sykes' death but was never brought to trial. Warren Sparrow had defeated incumbent Donald K. Tisdale in the 1986 Democratic primary for District Attorney, largely due to a backlash by the black community over the latter's handling of Hunt's trial. Hunt's defense attorney gained a change in venue for his client's trial, as the case had been widely publicized in the Winston-Salem and Forsyth County areas. \\"Faced with a retrial in rural Catawba County, prosecutors offered a plea bargain to Hunt that would have set him free. Rather that admit guilt, Hunt turned down the deal.\\" The same eyewitnesses testified, as did two jailhouse informants. The trial took four weeks. The defense tried to show that the eyewitnesses were unreliable. Hunt was tried in 1990 by an all-white jury from the rural county; it convicted him of Syke's rape and murder. He was sentenced to life and returned to prison. By the late 1980s, new forms of forensic testing had become available, including DNA analysis. Hunt sought to have his DNA tested and compared to material collected in the Sykes crime. In 1994, Hunt's DNA was tested, as was that from semen and other case evidence. Hunt did not have a match to the DNA in the semen collected from Syke's body, showing that he could not have committed the rape. In addition, the prosecution tested the DNA of Mitchell, Gray (each of whom had been implicated to some extent), and Sykes' husband. The DNA in the semen matched none of them. But the prosecution still contended that Hunt was involved in the murder by a now unknown assailant. Neither Forsyth County judge Melzer Morgan nor the appellate court granted Hunt a new trial based on this evidence. Hunt's supporters believed strongly that because the assault was at the heart of the case, the related murder charges were in question. But the prosecution suggested that Hunt could have been involved in the murder, even if not the rape, and that a third man might have been involved with him and another. \\"The state changed its theory of the crime to fit the new DNA evidence rather than reinvestigate the case.\\"Phoebe Zerwick, Stories: 1, \\"Room for Doubt\\", Winston- Salem Journal, 2003/reprint 16 November 2007; accessed 25 May 2017 Hunt's attorney filed a series of appeals. In December 2003, Hunt's defense prevailed in getting the DNA collected from the rape-murder to be run for the first time against the state database; a match was found with the DNA of Willard E. Brown, also a resident of Winston-Salem. He had been a suspect in a 1985 rape and slashing of a young white woman that had circumstances similar to that of Sykes. He was never prosecuted.Paul Garber, \\"Man charged in Sykes case\\", Winston-Salem Journal, 23 December 2003; accessed 4 June 2017 According to Regina Lane, who had gone to the police in 1985 about the attack on her, especially because of similarities to the Sykes case, officers discouraged her from pressing charges. Michael Hewlett, \\"Writing book helped woman find closure\\", Winston-Salem Journal, April 2012; accessed 4 June 2017 \\"The Sykes Administrative Review Committee concluded that Winston-Salem police investigators made numerous mistakes in not connecting Lane's rape with Sykes' murder.\\" Based on this review and that by the State Bureau of Investigation, the city put into place new procedures to prevent police officers from having such tunnel vision about cases. When questioned by police after the DNA match to the Sykes case, Brown confessed to the 1984 rape and stabbing death of Sykes.\\"Epilogue\\" , Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt, Winston- Salem Journal, 2007 Brown's confession ultimately resulted in the full exoneration and release of Darryl Hunt in 2004, who by then had served more than 19 years of a life sentence for crimes which he denied committing. On February 6, 2004, Superior Court Judge Anderson Cromer held a release hearing on Hunt. Sykes' mother Evelyn Jefferson took the stand and criticized the judge for proposing to release a man she still believed was guilty.Max Blau, \\"Tragedy of Darryl Hunt: how exonerated man came to take his own life\\", The Guardian, 19 March 2016; accessed 24 May 2017 When given a chance to speak, Hunt offered her and the Sykes family his condolences for their loss, and forgave everyone for the years he spent in prison. Judge Cromer vacated Hunt's murder conviction in the case. The case against Hunt was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that Hunt could not be tried again in the murder. Post- prison: Working for reform \\"Starting that day, Hunt devoted his life to reforming a criminal justice system that had stripped him of nearly two decades of his life, becoming a globally known advocate for the wrongfully convicted with a similar kind of grace he showed Jefferson.\\" He founded The Darryl Hunt Project for Freedom and Justice, seeking to educate the public about criminal justice cases, to gain counsel for the wrongfully convicted, and to help released prisoners rebuild their lives after exoneration and release. A community activist, Hunt became an award-winning speaker, and acted frequently as a mentor. He spoke at hundreds of conferences, to students at schools, audiences at film festivals, and congregations of religious groups in an effort to spread his message of reform in the criminal justice system. He urged compassion and help to those trying to rebuild lives after serving in prison. He played a pivotal role in North Carolina‚Äôs statewide effort to pass a Death Penalty Moratorium Bill. Due to various appeals and challenges, including over lethal injection as a method of execution, for nearly ten years the state did not execute any prisoners. Earlier it had the fifth-highest execution rate in the nation. Aftermath Citizens of Winston-Salem collaborated on creating the Deborah Sykes Administrative Review Committee to investigate the city's handling of this case. \\"Over the course of its inquiry from 2005-2007, a citizens committee revealed mistakes made by law-enforcement officers in the handling of the Sykes case and three other rape cases that occurred in the same time frame.\\" They released a 103-page report with a 9000-page appendix in February 2007.City of Winston-Salem, Sykes Administrative Review Committee Report, February 2007 The city issued a formal apology to Darryl Hunt and made a settlement for his wrongful conviction and years in jail.Bertrand M. Gutierrez and Dan Galindo, Epilogue: \\"Council agrees to pay $1.65 million to Hunt\\", Winston-Salem Journal, February 20, 2007; accessed June 4, 2017 Stephen Dear, executive director of People of Faith Against the Death Penalty, credited Hunt with contributing to the passage of the legislature of a law establishing the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission, to investigate cases of wrongful convictions. It was the first such independent commission in the United States. From 2007 through March 2017, it has exonerated ten inmates. Hunt also testified before a US Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the death penalty appeals process. Hunt's and similar cases contributed to the legislature's passage of the North Carolina Racial Justice Act of 2009, which \\"allowed death-row inmates to have their sentences reduced to life in prison if they could prove racial bias influenced the outcome of their cases.\\"Amanda Lamb and Kelly Parker, \\"NC death penalty cases in limbo after Racial Justice Act's repeal\\", WRAL, June 20, 2013; accessed May 24, 2017 After the act was passed, most of the 153 persons on death row filed appeals. From 2009 to June 2013, four persons received amended sentences to life imprisonment. (State lawmakers repealed the act in 2013, but many appeal cases are pending.) In 2016, both candidates for North Carolina State Attorney General campaigned on the basis of retaining the death penalty in the state. Settlement After Hunt was released, his attorneys began negotiation with the city of Winston-Salem over his wrongful conviction and damages. This was during the period when the Sykes Committee was investigating how the city had responded to his case. After the committee made its report, on February 19, 2007, Winston-Salem settled with Hunt, awarding him $1,650,000. He used much of the money to support his effort to help others. In 2004 Hunt had received a settlement of $358,545 under a state law that provides $20,000 for every year of wrongful imprisonment. Death Hunt died on March 13, 2016. Friends had been worried that he was not taking good care of himself and suffering from depression. Hunt had told friends he was terminally ill with cancer, however his autopsy report from the medical examiner found no evidence of this, nor did his medical records mention any diagnosis of cancer. This may have been to cover up his weight loss from suspected drug use. He fatally shot himself.

Through his commercial activities he acquired several large plantations in Jamaica and Guyana, worked initially by enslaved Africans. A massive slave revolt centred on his estates was brutally crushed by the military. The extent of his ownership of slaves was such that after slavery was abolished in 1833, he received the largest of all compensation payments made by the Slave Compensation Commission.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b062nqpd After the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, Gladstone expelled most African workers from his estates and imported large numbers of indebted Indian indentured-servants, through false promises of providing them schools and medical attention. However, upon arrival they were paid no wages, the repayment of their debts being deemed sufficient, and worked under conditions that continued to resemble slavery in everything except name.  Early life  Born on King Street in Leith north of Edinburgh, John Gladstones was the eldest son of the merchant Thomas Gladstones, and his wife, Helen Neilson. They lived on Coalhill, at the south end of the Shore, Leith. John was the second of the family's sixteen children. John Gladstones left school in 1777 at the age of 13, later describing his education as \\"a very plain one ‚Äì to read English, a little Latin, writing and figures comprehending the whole.\\"Sydney Checkland, The Gladstones: A Family Biography, 1764‚Äì1851 (Cambridge University Press, 1971), pp. 10‚Äì11. John was apprenticed to Alexander Ogilvy, manager of the Edinburgh Roperie and Sailcloth Company ropeworks in Leith. On completing his apprenticeship in 1781, he entered his father's corn and grain trading and provisioning business.Checkland, p. 11. Thomas Gladstones was aware of the limitations of Leith, especially compared with the opportunities then opening up in Glasgow and in Liverpool. In 1784, he sent John to the German Baltic ports to buy grain, transacting his business through an interpreter. In 1786, he travelled to Liverpool, Manchester and London to sell his father's corn and sulphuric acid.Checkland, p. 13. But the following year, with his father's financial support, John Gladstones was determined to move to Liverpool. Once he had settled in Liverpool, Gladstones dropped the final \\"s\\" from his surname (although this was not formally changed by royal licence until 1835). Almost immediately he went into partnership with grain merchants Edgar Corrie and Jackson Bradshaw. The business of Corrie, Gladstone & Bradshaw, and the wealth of its members, soon grew very large.Checkland, p. 14. John Gladstone spent a year in the United States, travelling to New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland to purchase wheat, maize, flax-seed, hemp, tobacco, timber, leather, turpentine and tar.Checkland, p. 24. John Gladstone lived on Bold Street from the time he moved to Liverpool until after his first marriage in 1790 to Jane Hall, daughter of a lesser Liverpool merchant. John never travelled abroad again: but the new couple settled into Rodney Street. Jane had no children, and their marriage lasted barely six years. Although he was a devout Presbyterian, there was no Scottish church in Liverpool and Gladstone and the other Scots resident in Liverpool worshipped at Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel. In 1792, Gladstone, William Ewart and some other Scots built a Scottish chapel on Oldham Street and the Caledonian School opposite it for the education of their children. Gladstone also had a new home built for himself at 62 Rodney Street, Liverpool, at the cost of ¬£1,570 (equivalent of ¬£229,320 in 2019). It was finished in September 1793.Checkland, pp. 31, 33.  Marriage and family  In 1792, John Gladstone married Jane Hall (1765‚Äì1798), the daughter of Joseph Hall, a Liverpool merchant. Her health was never good and she died in 1798. On 29 April 1800, he married Anne MacKenzie Robertson (1772‚Äì1835) at St Peter's Parish Church in Liverpool. She was the daughter of Andrew Robertson, a solicitor and Justice of the Peace and the Provost of Dingwall in Ross- shire.ThePeerage.com: Anne MacKenzie Robertson They had six children together: # Anne MacKenzie Gladstone (1802‚Äì1829) # Sir Thomas Gladstone, 2nd Baronet (1804‚Äì1889) # Robertson Gladstone (1805‚Äì1875) # John Neilson Gladstone (1807‚Äì1863) # William Ewart Gladstone (1809‚Äì1898) # Helen Jane Gladstone (1814‚Äì1880) Around 1804, John Gladstone ceased to attend the Presbyterian church, attending the Church of England St Mark's Church from then on with his family. The Church of Scotland had also never been to Mrs Gladstone's liking because of the Episcopalian tradition of the Robertson family and her own strong evangelicalism.Checkland, p. 46. Gladstone decided that he wanted to move his young family away from the city centre, and in 1813 the Gladstone family finally settled at Seaforth House, two years after construction had begun. A mansion on of Litherland marsh, four miles (6 km) north-northwest of Liverpool, the Seaforth estate combined the mansion, a home farm and a village of cottages, and here John Gladstone could live as a landed gentleman. In 1815 he built St Thomas's Anglican Church at Seaforth, the rector of which, the Reverend William Rawson, established a school in the parsonage for educating the sons of local gentlemen, including the Gladstone boys. He also built St Andrew's Episcopal Church in Renshaw Street, with a school attached to it for educating poor children.Checkland, p. 79.  Business  Portrait of Gladstone by Thomas Gladstones, circa 1830. After sixteen years of operations, the partnership of Corrie, Gladstone & Bradshaw was dissolved in 1801 and its business was continued by John Gladstone under the name of John Gladstone & Company. He took his brother Robert into partnership with him in 1801, and eventually all six of his brothers moved to Liverpool to work in various mercantile businesses. John Gladstone's business became very extensive, having a large trade with Russia, and as sugar importers and West India merchants. In 1814, when the monopoly of the British East India Company was broken and trade with India was opened to competition, Gladstone's firm was the first to send a private ship (), to Calcutta. He also invested in property, constructing a number of houses in Liverpool and purchasing an estate just outside the city. He made a fortune trading in corn with the United States and cotton with Brazil. Slave owner Gladstone acquired large sugar plantations in Jamaica and Demerara, and was Chairman of the West India Association. A massive slave revolt in 1823 was based on his plantation and was brutally crushed by the army and militia.Michael Craton, \\"Proto-peasant revolts? The late slave rebellions in the British West Indies 1816-1832.\\" Past & Present 85 (1979): 99-125 online. Later, trying to recruit indentured labourers, he wrote that the work in the sugar plantations was light and conditions generally good, including schools and medical attention.Letter from John Gladstone, Esq. to Messrs. Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co., Liverpool, 4 January 1836. http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/etext/scoble/JANU1836.HTM accessed 24 November 2015 This was a picture he had derived from information given by plantation managers, who did not communicate the routine abuse of slaves nor their miserable conditions of malnutrition, overcrowding, and overwork. It ignored the comprehensive and damning evidence on the reality of slavery in the British and French Caribbean, provided by many writers of the time such as missionaries and other returning Britons. With help from his son William, Gladstone was awarded a payment as a slave owner in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837.Roland Quinault, \\"Gladstone and slavery.\\" Historical Journal 52.2 (2009) 369. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in based on inflation, and ¬£76.5 billion in based on share of GDP ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Gladstone was associated with eleven different claims, he owned 2,508 slaves in British Guiana and Jamaica and received a ¬£106,769 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in based on inflation, and ¬£544.5 million in 2020 based on share of GDP). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Gladstone's claim was the single largest of any recipient made by the Slave Compensation Commission and he had the largest number of slaves. His fellow Lowland Scot, James Blair made the single biggest claim for one plantation, but Gladstone's claims were spread out over multiple plantations and were worth far more. After the abolition of slavery, John Gladstone sought indentured servants from India to work in his sugar plantations. Knowing that a number of Indians had been sent to Mauritius as indentured labour,History of the South Asian Diaspora. wesleyan.edu Gladstone expressed a desire to obtain free labour from India for his plantations in the West Indies in a letter dated 4 January 1836 to Messrs Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co. of Calcutta.  Politics  Gladstone was also interested in politics. At first he had been a Whig, but from 1812 onwards his political outlook appears to have changed due to a number of factors. In religion he had long ceased to have any sympathy with Unitarianism or Presbyterianism. He had become alienated from the Whig and Radical circles in Liverpool, and feared the disorder caused by the Napoleonic Wars.Checkland, p. 51. The friendships he formed with Tories George Canning and Kirkman Finlay also had a great influence on his changing political outlook, and he became a Tory. In 1812 he presided over a meeting at Liverpool which was called to invite George Canning to represent Liverpool in the House of Commons.Checkland, p. 61. In 1817 John Gladstone decided to enter parliament. Although he wanted to stand for election in Liverpool, there was no vacancy, and he was obliged to explore other possibilities, including Ross- shire and Stafford, before deciding to stand for Lancaster in the general election of 1818.Checkland, p. 102. At the general election of 1818, Gladstone chose to stand for Woodstock, due to the heavy financial cost of the Lancaster constituency.Checkland, p. 104. He made few speeches in the House of Commons, but he was regarded as having done good work in committees and was known as one of the most informed MPs when it came to commerce. He was in favour of a qualified reform of the franchise and of Greek independence during the 1820s.Checkland, p. 106. When George Canning left his Liverpool seat in 1822, Gladstone sought to be elected as his successor. However, William Huskisson was chosen instead, and this rejection by Liverpool soured Gladstone's relationship with the city.Checkland, p. 162. He finally served as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1826 to 1827.  Later life  Gladstone's plaque in Leith In around 1820 John Gladstone began searching for an estate in Scotland, and in December 1829 he purchased the Fasque Estate in Kincardineshire from Sir Alexander Ramsay for ¬£80,000 (equivalent to ¬£8,848,932 in 2019). He decided to return, with his family, to Scotland. Only Robertson would remain in Liverpool to look after the business.Checkland, p. 222. In a sense the decision to leave Liverpool was easy, with the family attachment to Liverpool and Seaforth now much weakened following the death of Gladstone's eldest child, Anne, in 1829. Mrs Gladstone had never made any real connection with Liverpool, because of her shyness, her frequent illnesses and her involvement with her children. Gladstone and his family left Seaforth in 1830, spending the next few years living in Royal Leamington Spa and Torquay seeking health for Mrs Gladstone and their daughter, Helen, before taking up residence at Fasque House in the summer of 1833. The family spent their winters in Edinburgh at their townhouse at 11 Atholl CrescentCheckland, p. 282. In 1838, using the wealth he had amassed from trading slaves, John Gladstone paid for several philanthropic works in his home town of Leith, including St Thomas's Church, an adjacent manse, a free school for boys, a free school for girls, a \\"house for female incurables\\", and a public rose garden. In 1846 Gladstone was created a baronet by the outgoing Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel. Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet, of Fasque and Balfour in the County of Kincardine, died at Fasque House in December 1851, aged 86, and was buried at St Andrew's Episcopal Church at Fasque. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Thomas Gladstone, 2nd Baronet. He has been described by Checkland as \\"a strong, vigorous and overpowering man, whose life was strewn with quarrels, great and small.\\"Checkland, p. 311. A plaque was erected in 1909 at the corner of Great Junction Street and King Street in Leith commemorating the site of the birthplace of John Gladstone.

Leadership and supporters Salaheddine Bahaaeddin cofounded the Kurdistan Islamic Union on February 6, 1994. In the first General Conference he was elected as the Secretary General of the party. Later, in the second, the third, and the fourth Conferences he was also elected as the Secretary General. Later succeeded by Hadi Ali, and Mohammed Faraj, in 2016 he was again elected Secretary-General. KIU professes non- violence, and supports the Islamic Kurdish League, which provides services to the poor. It is also represented on the Iraqi Governing Council. The party is chiefly active among students (reportedly winning nearly 40% of the vote in Dahuk University student elections), but also has a base of adult political supporters, particularly in the city of Erbil. It also enjoys good relations with both the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. 2005 elections In the January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election, the Kurdistan Islamic Union was part of a broad coalition of Kurdish parties, the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan. However, in November 2005, the KIU withdrew from this coalition and announced that it would run separately from the other major Kurdish groups in the December 2005 Iraqi legislative election. Running independently on an agenda of \\"reform and services\\", the KIU declared that pluralism in Kurdistan is not practiced, and that voters should vote for the political party of their choice In response to the KIU pulling out from the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Islamic Union office was the target of riots and protest by 3,000‚Äì5,000 people, mainly members of Kurdistan Democratic Party organizations. During the protest, the phrase \\"Long Live 730\\" was written on the office's walls. 730 is the \\"numerical ballot designation for the political alliance led by Iraq's two largest Kurdish parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.\\" The riots resulted in the deaths of 4 members of KIU, including one member of the KIU leadership, after their offices in Duhok, Zakho and several other areas were exposed to gunfire after police and security forces supported the protesters instead of protecting KIU offices. In the December 2005 elections, the party won 1.3% of the vote and 5 out of 275 seats. December 2011 violence On December 2, 2011, after Friday prayers, unknown persons rampaged through the city of Zakho attacking liquor stores, beauty salons, a Chinese massage parlor, and several hotels. The sale of alcohol in Iraq is often the preserve of Christians and Yezidis, who were disproportionate victims of the arson attacks. The violence quickly spread throughout the Bahdinan area of Iraqi Kurdistan, to nearby Dohuk, and eventually as far as way as the south-eastern Sorani city of Sulaymaniyah. At least 30 people were injured. Government spokesmen for the Kurdistan Democratic Party blamed the violence on a cleric associated with the Kurdistan Islamic Union. But the KIU and the cleric himself refuted these allegations. The KIU has a strong support base in the region - although not as strong as the KDP. Subsequent to the attacks, KDP supporters set fire to more than four KIU political and media offices throughout the Bahdinan area of Kurdistan Region.

As a result of both leagues realigning into three divisions in 1994, it marked the first time in major league history that a team could qualify for postseason play without finishing in first place in its league or division. The teams were: *(1) Atlanta Braves (Eastern Division champion, 90‚Äì54) vs. (4) Colorado Rockies (Wild Card, 77‚Äì67): Braves win series, 3‚Äì1. *(2) Cincinnati Reds (Central Division champion, 85‚Äì59) vs. (3) Los Angeles Dodgers (Western Division champion, 78‚Äì66): Reds win series, 3‚Äì0.The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was not tied to playing record but was predetermined. Also, the team with home field advantage played the first two games on the road, with potentially the last three at home, in order to reduce travel. Had the 1995 NLDS been played under the 1998-2011 arrangement, then Atlanta (1) would've still played against Colorado (4) and Cincinnati (2) would have likewise still faced Los Angeles (3). Under the 2012-present format, which removed the prohibition against teams from the same division meeting in the Division Series, the matchups also would have been Atlanta- Colorado and Cincinnati-Los Angeles. Every participant in this year‚Äôs NLDS was a member of the old NL West in 1993 (Colorado‚Äôs inaugural season). The Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds went on to meet in the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Braves became the National League champion and defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series. Matchups =Atlanta Braves vs. Colorado Rockies= =Cincinnati Reds vs. Los Angeles Dodgers= Atlanta vs. Colorado =Game 1= Coors Field in Denver, Colorado Game 1 was a match-up between aces: Greg Maddux for the Atlanta Braves and Kevin Ritz for the Colorado Rockies. Ritz and Maddux worked their way out of minor trouble early on, but, in the top of the third, Marquis Grissom broke the scoreless tie with a shot to make it 1‚Äì0. However, the Rockies soon answered in the bottom of the fourth. After Maddux got Dante Bichette to ground out, he walked Larry Walker. Then a single by Andr√©s Galarraga moved Walker to third. Ellis Burks's sac fly brought Walker home. The next batter, Vinny Castilla, would hit a two-run homer to give Colorado its first lead of the night, but In the top of the sixth, Chipper Jones led off with a home run to make it a one-run game. David Justice then walked just before a single by Ryan Klesko. An error during the play by Burks moved Justice to third. Steve Reed relieved Ritz and Luis Polonia reached on a fielder's choice, bringing Justice home to tie the game. The Braves would load the bases, but Maddux struck out to end the inning. In the top of the eighth, Mike Munoz took the mound for Colorado. He got two quick outs, but surrendered a single to Klesko. Darren Holmes came in and gave up a single to Javy L√≥pez. Dwight Smith followed with a pinch-hit RBI single to center to give the Braves a 4‚Äì3 lead. In the bottom of the inning, Bichette walked off Greg McMichael, then moved to third on a single by Walker and an error by Justice on the play. Galarraga would then reach on a fielder's choice (on a diving stop by Chipper Jones robbing the Big Cat of extra bases), with Walker out at second. Alejandro Pe√±a came on to face Burks with one out. Burks doubled to tie the game at four apiece, but Pena got the next two outs. Curt Leskanic came on in the top of the ninth and got two outs, but gave up a home run to Chipper Jones. The Braves now had a 5‚Äì4 lead, but the Rockies tried to mount a rally in the bottom half off Mark Wohlers. With one out, Mike Kingery singled and was followed by another single by Bichette. Walker was then walked, loading the bases with only one out. That put the winning run in scoring position. Wohlers, however, was able to get Galarraga and pitcher Lance Painter (Rockies skipper Don Baylor had run out of position players in his first postseason game as manager) to strike out to end the game and give the Braves a well- earned victory. =Game 2= Coors Field in Denver, Colorado Game 2 matched Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine against the man who made the final out in Game 1, Lance Painter. Marquis Grissom gave the Braves the lead with a lead off home run in the top of the first. Glavine then held the Rockies to one hit in the first two innings. In the top of the third, the Braves struck again when Mark Lemke singled and Chipper Jones had a bunt single. After Fred McGriff struck out, David Justice walked to load the bases with only one out. Javy L√≥pez's sac fly made it 2‚Äì0, but the Braves could muster no more runs as Ryan Klesko struck out to end the inning. In the top of the fourth, Grissom again went deep with two outs to make it 3‚Äì0 Braves. All was silent until the bottom of the sixth. With one man out, Ellis Burks reached on an error by Jeff Blauser. Dante Bichette then singled to center to put runners on the corners. Then, Larry Walker hit a mammoth three-run home run to tie the game at three. In the bottom of the eighth, the Rockies took the lead when Andr√©s Galarraga drove home Bichette with a double off Alejandro Pena after Bichette had reached with a double of his own off Steve Avery. The Rockies were now three outs away from tying the series at one game apiece, but the Braves would not give in. Jones doubled to left to lead off the top of the ninth off Curt Leskanic, then came home on a single by McGriff off Mike Munoz to tie the game. With two outs now, Mike Devereaux singled off Darren Holmes, then Mike Mordecai followed with another single that drove home McGriff to give the Braves the lead. An errant throw to first by Eric Young, his second error of the game, allowed two more runs to score to give the Braves a 7‚Äì4 lead. Mark Wohlers saved the game in the bottom half to give the Braves a two-games-to-none lead going home. =Game 3= Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia The potential clincher pitted Bill Swift against John Smoltz. A wild pitch by Smoltz allowed Eric Young, who walked and moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, to score to make it 1‚Äì0 Rockies. Then Young made it 3‚Äì0 when he homered with one man on in the third. But the Braves put together three runs in the fourth thanks to an RBI double by Ryan Klesko after a single and walk followed by a two-run single by Javy L√≥pez. During the final play of the inning, Jeff Blauser struck out and sprained his ankle in doing so, putting him on the bench for the rest of the postseason. The Rockies quickly responded with a two-run homer by Vinny Castilla in the sixth. But the Braves would chip away at the score in the seventh when Mike Mordecai doubled home Klesko, who singled to lead off Bill Swift, off Mike Munoz. Then in the ninth, the Braves would tie the game thanks to a two-out, pinch hit RBI single by Luis Polonia off Darren Holmes, the run charged to Bruce Ruffin. With Mark Wohlers on the mound in the tenth, after a two-out double and intentional walk, the Rockies would put together back-to- back RBI singles by Andres Galarraga and Castilla to make it 7‚Äì5. Mark Thompson retired the Braves in order in the bottom half to give the Rockies their first ever postseason win. =Game 4= Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Greg Maddux was matched against Bret Saberhagen, who was hoping to keep Colorado's momentum intact. The game was scoreless into the third when Dante Bichette launched a three-run homer with one out after back- to-back singles in the top of the third. But the Braves responded in the bottom of the inning. After back-to-back two-out singles, Chipper Jones's two- run double cut the Rockies' lead to one before Fred McGriff's home run put the Braves up 4‚Äì3. Next inning, after a single and walk, Eric Young's errant throw to first, his third error in the series, on Rafael Belliard's fielder's choice allowed Ryan Klesko to score from, then Marquis Grissom's RBI double made it 6‚Äì3. McGriff's second home run of the game in the fifth off Kevin Ritz made it 7‚Äì3. The Rockies got that run back in the sixth on Vinny Castilla's home run, but in the bottom of the inning, Mark Lemke followed back-to-back two-out singles with an RBI double. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, Mike Munoz relieved Ritz and allowed a two-run single to McGriff. Alejandro Pena pitched two scoreless innings of relief as the Braves would advance to the 1995 National League Championship Series with a 10‚Äì4 win. =Composite box= 1995 NLDS (3‚Äì1): Atlanta Braves over Colorado Rockies Cincinnati vs. Los Angeles =Game 1= Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California Pete Schourek of the Reds faced Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez of the Dodgers in Game 1. Back-to-back singles with one out got the rally started in the top of the first for the Reds. After Reggie Sanders popped out, Hal Morris struck the game's first blow by doubling home the two runners on base. Then Benito Santiago hit a two-run home run to make it 4‚Äì0 Reds. In the top of the fifth, after a leadoff double and single, Benito Santiago's sacrifice fly made it 5‚Äì0 Reds. After a double, John Cummings relieved Martinez and allowed a two-run double to Jeff Branson. The Dodgers scored their first run of the game in the bottom of the fifth on Brett Butler's RBI single with two on, then added another run next inning on Mike Piazza's home run, but could not score again off Schourek, Mike Jackson or Jeff Brantley as the Reds took a 1‚Äì0 series lead with a 7‚Äì2 win. =Game 2= Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California Former 20-game winner John Smiley of the Reds faced Ismael Valdez of the Dodgers in Game 2. Eric Karros, who would drive in all the Dodgers runs, got them on the board with an RBI double in the first to score Brett Butler, who singled to leadoff and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt. Reggie Sanders put the Reds up 2‚Äì1 with a two-run home run in the top of the fourth, but Karros responded with a leadoff homer in the bottom of the inning to tie the game at two. Ra√∫l Mondes√≠ was ejected from the game in between innings in the eighth on his way to right field, when he badmouthed umpire Bob Davidson for a play at home in the seventh that went the Reds' way. In the eighth, the Reds took the lead on a Barry Larkin single that scored Mariano Duncan, who singled with one out and stole second off Antonio Osuna. In the ninth, the Reds loaded the bases on three walks with one out off Kevin Tapani, then Mark Lewis's fielder's choice off Mark Guthrie and Duncan's RBI single off Pedro Astacio made it 5‚Äì2 Reds. In the bottom half, a leadoff single off Jeff Brantley gave the Dodgers life. With one out, Karros hit his second home run of the game to make it 5‚Äì4 Reds. However, Brantley got the next two men out to save Game 2 and give the Reds a two-game lead going to Cincinnati. =Game 3= Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio Soon-to-be- named National League Rookie of the Year Hideo Nomo of the Dodgers faced playoff-savvy David Wells of the Reds. A two-run home run by Ron Gant got the scoring started for the Reds in the third. The Dodgers would cut the lead in half when Eric Karros reached second due to right fielder Reggie Sanders dropping his fly ball, then scored on an RBI single by Ra√∫l Mondes√≠ in the fourth, but Bret Boone's home run in the bottom of the fourth gave the Reds that run back. Then, in the sixth, Nomo began to lose his control, giving up two singles, a walk, and wild pitch. Then pinch hitter Mark Lewis came up and socked a grand slam off Mark Guthrie to make it 7‚Äì1 Reds. Next inning, the Reds loaded the bases on a single and two walks off John Cummings when Mike Jackson cleared them to make it 10‚Äì1 Reds. The Dodgers changed pitchers five times as the Reds advanced to the 1995 National League Championship Series with a series sweep. As of 2019, this is the Reds' most recent playoff game victory at home, and the 1995 NLDS remains the most recent playoff round won by the Reds. =Composite box= 1995 NLDS (3‚Äì0): Cincinnati Reds over Los Angeles Dodgers References External links *ATL vs. COL at Baseball- Reference *CIN vs. LAD at Baseball-Reference National League Division Series National League Division Series Atlanta Braves postseason Cincinnati Reds postseason Colorado Rockies postseason Los Angeles Dodgers postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series 1995 in Atlanta 1990s in Cincinnati 1990s in Denver 1995 in Los Angeles October 1995 sports events in the United States Sports competitions in Atlanta Sports competitions in Cincinnati Sports competitions in Denver Sports competitions in Los Angeles ","title":"1995 National League Division Series"},{"id":"2962143","text":"Justin A.

The constitutional convention that framed the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February 1858, during the pendency of the Lecompton Constitution in Congress. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858, and by the people at an election held May 18, 1858.

Sealift is a term used predominantly in military logistics and refers to the use of cargo ships for the deployment of military assets, such as weaponry, vehicles, military personnel, and supplies. It complements other means of transport, such as strategic airlifters, in order to enhance a state's ability to project power. Sealift shipping falls into three broad categories: dry cargo freighters, liquid tankers, and passenger or troop ships. During joint operations, dry cargo ships may transport equipment and supplies required to conduct and sustain the operation; tankers carry fuel; while passenger and troop ships carry personnel to the theater and allow the evacuation of noncombatants or those in need of medical aid. Sealift can also be divided into strategic and tactical sealift. Strategic sealift is the transportation of vehicles and equipment to a staging area equipped with port facilities, with personnel arriving by other methods. Tactical sealift occurs when a ship is carrying personnel along with vehicles and equipment, and is able to deploy them directly and operationally, like in an amphibious assault. While ships are slower than their airborne counterparts and may require port facilities to unload their cargo, their larger capacity allows them to transport heavy armoured forces or bulky supplies that only the largest strategic airlifters (such as the C-5 Galaxy) could normally handle, and in much greater quantities. A state's sealift capabilities may include civilian-operated ships that normally operate by contract, but which can be chartered or commandeered during times of military necessity to supplement government-owned naval fleets. Some smaller navies have built multi-role vessels that combine sealift with other capabilities, such as those of a patrol frigate or a command-and- control vessel. The Royal Danish Navy's and the Royal New Zealand Navy's multi-role vessel being two examples. Civilian use Sealift refers to the re-supply of isolated communities with fuel, building materials, foodstuffs, vehicles and other goods. This is the most common method used for the coastal communities of northern Canada due to the lower cost and the larger capacity of ships and barges over aircraft. An annual occurrence in the Arctic, the sealift is usually performed between July and October, when the sea is ice free. Typically two types of ships are used, the older, less-seen cargo ship and the more usual tugboat. While both types also haul barges, the cargo ship also carries cargo on deck. Most Arctic communities do not have a port and cranes to unload the supplies but may have a simple dock. Where the community does not have a dock, the ship either must ground itself or the barges. Supplies are then removed by forklift truck which is also carried on board. The interior of the barges are used to carry fuel and other supplies are carried in containers on deck.

Stramm's radically experimental verse and his major influence on all subsequent German poetry has caused him to be compared to Ezra Pound, Guillaume Apollinaire, James Joyce, and T.S. Eliot. A reserve officer in the Imperial German Army, Stramm was called up to active service at the outbreak of World War I and was killed in action on the Eastern Front. Jeremy Adler has called August Stramm one of, \\"the most innovative poets of the First World War.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. Life =Early life= August Stramm was born in M√ºnster, Westphalia, in 1874. His father had served in the Prussian Army and had been decorated for bravery during the Franco-Prussian War. According to Patrick Bridgwater, his father's legacy caused the younger Stramm to go through life \\"with a sense of duty.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. Stramm gave \\"a middling performance at school\\" and later had to gain his abitur through part-time study. Against the wishes of his mother, who wanted her son to become a Roman Catholic priest, Stramm joined the German Post Office Ministry in 1893 was rapidly promoted. Between 1896 and 1897, despite being near-sighted, Stramm served his year of compulsory military service in the Imperial German Army.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. After being demobilized, Stramm returned to working at the Post Office and was granted a coveted position as a postal worker on luxury ocean liners making the Bremen-Hamburg-New York run. This led to Stramm making several long stays in the United States.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. After returning from America, Stramm married the romance novelist Else Kraft, with whom he would have two children, in 1902. They lived in Bremen until 1905, when they settled in Berlin.Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. =First of the Expressionists= According to Bridgwater, \\"His early work (romantic poetry, painting rather ordinary landscapes, still-lifes, a naturalistic play) was basically unoriginal and derivative.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. Stramm's daughter Inge later wrote that, \\"around the year 1912, literature overtook him like a sickness... A Demon awoke in him.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. Stramm began writing plays and poems \\"in a strange new style that could find no publisher.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. According to Jeremy Adler, \\"Stramm's plays, too, became concentrated and brief, distilling situations into a few characteristics and increasingly ambiguous words and gestures. Characters are types like 'He' and 'She', and the surroundings merge into action: sound, word, gesture, and decor blend into a symbolic whole. The first mature plays are complementary opposites: the Symbolistic Sancta Susanna (1912-13),\\" portrays a Roman Catholic nun who violates her vow of chastity, \\"while the Naturalistic Rudiment√§r (1912-14) shows the glimmerings of reason awakening in a Berlin semi-literate.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 126. Stramm, however, was soon, \\"driven to near despair by his lack of success as a writer.\\" By 1913, he was on the verge of destroying all his manuscripts when Else Stramm, whose novels had had no such troubles with publication, urged her husband to contact Herwarth Walden, the editor of the avant-garde magazine Der Sturm.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. According to Jeremy Adler, Herwarth Walden, \\"stood at the forefront of the avante-garde movement in Berlin.\\" He was receiving submissions from countless international artists, including Oskar Kokoschka, Pablo Picasso, Franz Marc, and Wassily Kandinsky. Walden was also in contact with Italian Futurist poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and with French poet Guillaume Apollinaire. In Der Sturm, Walden had published German translations of Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism and Apollinaire's Modern Painting.Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. According to Adler, \\"For Walden, Cubism, Futurism, and Expressionism were essentially the same, and he sought to unite them in his own all-embracing Sturm-Kunst.\\" What Walden had lacked, however, before August Stramm contacted him in 1914, was a German poet \\"whose work could stand comparison with the international elite who figured in Der Sturm.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. From the time of their first meeting, a close friendship developed between Walden and Stramm. Personally and artistically, \\"they became indispensable to each other and it can be inferred that Stramm's style now became fully mature through Walden's encouragement. In the next sixteen months, Stramm produced the sixty two shorter poems on which his reputation mainly rests. During this period, hardly an issue of Der Sturm appeared that did not contain a play by Stramm or a group of his poems.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 125. =War service= Stramm was a reserve officer in the Imperial German Army and had achieved the rank of Captain, the highest available to reservists. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Stramm \\"was called up immediately\\" and was, \\"posted as a company commander to Landwehrregiment 110, with which he saw action on the Western Front, in the Vosges, and in Alsace.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. According to Jeremy Adler, \\"From the start, Stramm had few illusions and never joined in the so- called Hurrah-Patriotismus.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 126. In mid-January 1915, Stramm was reassigned, again as a company commander, to the newly formed Infantry Regiment 272, which was stationed at Oise, near the Somme River in northern France. By the end of the month, Stramm had been awarded the Iron Cross (Second Class) for courage under fire.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. In a letter on February 14, 1915, Stramm wrote, \\"But there is horror in me, there is horror around me, bubbling, surging around, throttling, ensnaring. There's no way out anymore.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 126. On February 23, 1915, he wrote, \\"Germany needs brave soldiers. Nothing else will do. We have to go through with it, however much we condemn the war.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. According to Patrick Bridgwater, \\"While Stramm is known to have enjoyed his peacetime role of reserve officer, he was too sensitive to have any illusions about the war, which he hated (for all the unholy fascination it held for him). On 12 January 1915 he wrote to Walden from the Western Front, 'I stand like a cramp, unsteady, without a foundation, without a brace, anchored, and numb in the grimace of my will and stubbornness,' and a few months later he wrote to his wife from Galicia that everything was so dreadful, so unspeakably dreadful. Thus while he was always absolutely sure where his duty lay, he did not write a single chauvinistic war poem even at the time when nearly everybody else in Germany - or so it seemed - was doing so. Nor did he write overtly anti-war poems, which his conscience would not have allowed him to do. In retrospect it seems extraordinary that the poem Feuertaufe (\\"Baptism by Fire\\") should have caused a scandal in the German press in 1915, for its only conceivable fault is its utter honesty, its attempt to convey the feeling of coming under enemy fire for the first time and its implicit refusal to pretend that the feeling in question was one of heroic excitement.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 42. According to Jeremy Adler, \\"Although the letters testify to profound inner turmoil, Stramm was a popular officer and a brave soldier.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, pages 126-127. At the end of April 1915, Stramm's regiment was transferred to the Eastern Front, in order to serve under the command of General August von Mackensen in the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive against the Russian-occupied Austro-Hungarian Crownland of Galicia.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. According to Patrick Bridgwater, \\"Stramm distinguished himself and was at one point acting Battalion Commander, in which role he was involved in the attack on the Russian positions at Ostrow. It was here that he won the Austrian Kriegsverdienstkreuz and was recommended for the Iron Cross (First Class).\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. After the recapture of Przemysl and Lviv, Stramm and his regiment continued to pursue the Imperial Russian Army during the Great Retreat of 1915. By July, Stramm's regiment had reached the Bug River.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. At the beginning of August 1915, Stramm was sent home on what would be his final furlough. His daughter Inge, who adored her father, later recalled how Stramm made her ten-year-old brother promise, \\"never to let himself down,\\" by being, \\"a Schweinhund before himself.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. His family would later learn that throughout his furlough, Stramm had carried a letter in his pocket which he needed only to countersign in order to be released from all future military service at his publisher's request. By this time, Stramm had come to detest the war and believed that his death in combat was imminent. His mind was also filled with projects that he longed to write down. In the end, however, Stramm was, according to Patrick Bridgwater, \\"unable to accept the alibi of a higher duty to literature,\\" and left the letter unsigned.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. After returning to his company following a week's journey, Stramm found that they had been reduced to only 25 men. It was the time of a Russian counteroffensive led by General Aleksei Brusilov and Stramm, with the remnants of his company, were involved in, \\"the giant-battle for Brest-Litovsk\\", which fell to Stramm's regiment on August 25, 1915.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. Death On September 1, 1915, August Stramm led an attack against the Imperial Russian Army in the Rokitno Marshes. The attack degenerated into brutal hand-to-hand combat and Stramm, who had been in action 70 times in all, was shot in the head by a Russian soldier. He was the last member of his company to fall during the attack.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. According to Jeremy Adler, Stramm was about to be awarded the Iron Cross (First Class) at the time of his death.Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 127. According to Patrick Bridgwater, \\"What is quite extraordinary is that he appears to have found in the hell-on-earth of total warfare around Brest-Litovsk in 1915 the sense of harmony he had sought for so long.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 41. A few weeks before his death, Stramm had written to Herwarth Walden, \\"Singularly, life and death are one... Both are one... Battle and the night and death and the nightingale are all one. One! And fighting and sleeping and dreaming and acting are all one! There is no separation! All goes together and swims and shimmers like sun and whirlpool. Only time goes forward, time this. So do fighting, hungering, singing, dying. All! Soldier and officer! Day and night! Sorrowing and bleeding! And a hand shines over me! I swim through everything. Am everything! I!\\".Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 42. A blood-stained copy of the 1904 German translation of the book \\"In Tune with the Infinite\\" (In Harmonie mit dem Unendlichen), by American philosopher Ralph Waldo Trine, was found in Stramm's pocket after his death. Stramm's enthusiasm for Trine is believed to have been a legacy of the time he spent living in the United States.Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38, 42. August Stramm's body was buried with full military honors at Gorodets, in the Kobryn District of modern Belarus, on October 2, 1915.Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 126. Literary career Jeremy Adler has written that August Stramm was, \\"along with Guillaume Apollinaire, among the most innovative poets of the First World War.\\" Stramm, Adler writes, treated, \\"language like a physical material\\" and, \\"honed down syntax to its bare essentials.\\" Citing Stramm's fondness for \\"fashioning new words out of old,\\" Adler has also written that, \\"what James Joyce did on a grand scale for English, Stramm achieved more modestly for German.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 124. Between April 1914 and the outbreak of the Great War, Stramm wrote the poems contained in his first collection, which was titled Du. Liebesgedichte (You. Love Poems\\"). According to Jeremy Adler, the poems contained in Du explore, \\"the changing and often tense relationship between the poet's self Ich (I), and an often undefined Du (You). This Du, more than a single woman, is extended to include womankind, humanity, and God. This the 'love' recorded ranges from debased sexuality in Freudenhaus (\\"House of Pleasures\\") to the love of God in Allmacht (\\"Almighty\\"). Love is seen as essentially ambiguous; or, rather, it cannot be separated from, and always involves it own opposite, strife. Appropriately, the collection begins with a poem that announces this duality: Liebeskampf (Love-Fight\\").\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 125. Du. Liebesgedichte was published whilst Stramm was at the front in 1915. Stramm's war poetry was published in Der Sturm during his lifetime and later appeared in the collection Tropfenblut (\\"Dripping Blood\\"), which was posthumously published in 1919. According to Patrick Bridgwater, \\"Stramm's war poems are concerned with particulars, with the brute realities, the basic experiences of life at the front.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 49. According to Jeremy Adler, \\"Like no others in German, Stramm's war poems give an immediate impression of the front. By eschewing a self-conscious persona, and treating the poem itself as a reality, Stramm thrusts intense images of the war directly before the reader. Exploiting all his newly perfected techniques, he precisely conveys the exact moments, the various horrors of war: the terror of being under fire in Im Feuer, shelling in Granaten, hesitation in Zagen, the difficult advance in Signal, combat in Haidekampf, or single combat in Urtod (\\"Primal Death\\"). But there are also rare moments of beauty, as in the evening atmosphere of Abend, when the poet glimpses a higher being, the distant Du.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 127. Legacy Adler has also written that August Stramm's \\"essential innovation (still too little recognized in Germany) was to create a new, non-representational kind of poetry,\\" which is, \\"comparable,\\" to Pablo Picasso's creation of abstract art and to Arnold Sch√∂nberg's revolution in the writing of Classical music.Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 125. In his 1985 book, The German Poets of the First World War, Patrick Bridgwater dubbed the literary movement inspired by Stramm's poetry, \\"the German variety of Imagism.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 39. Shortly before the outbreak of war in 1914, T.E. Hulme heard the kind of poetry that Stramm created and inspired being read aloud at the Cabaret Gnu in Berlin. Hulme later wrote, \\"Very short sentences are used, sometimes so terse and elliptical as to produce a blunt and jerky effect ... It is clear that a definite attempt is being made to use the language in a new way, an attempt to cure it of certain vices.\\"Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. Even though, according to Jeremy Adler, \\"Stramm's rigorous, demanding style,\\" never gained him the popular appeal of Georg Trakl, Stramm, \\"has had a significant influence on German poetry.\\" First his verse was a model for the poets of the Sturm-Kreis (\\"Sturm-Circle\\") which included Kurt Heynicke, Otto Nebel, and Franz Behrens. Then, Dadaism and Kurt Schwitters took Stramm as their starting point. After the Second World War, Stramm's poetry inspired experimental writers like Gerhard R√ºhm and Paul Celan. Writing in 1988, Adler commented that, \\"several younger writers openly acknowledge,\\" that they have been influenced by August Stramm and that his, \\"place as a modern classic seems to be assured.\\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 127. In 1921, Paul Hindemith, a German composer of Classical music and fellow veteran of the Great War, turned Stramm's play Sancta Susanna, about a nun who breaks her vow of chastity, into an opera with the same name. The premiere, however, was not without controversy among members of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany, to whom the subject matter was understandingly very offensive. English translations of poems by Stramm were published by Patrick Bridgwater (August Stramm, 22 Poems, 1969) and Jeremy Adler (Tim Cross, The Lost Voices of World War I, 1988).

Many significant events took place there, including the Bloody Sunday massacre and parts of the October Revolution of 1917. Between 1918 and 1944, it was known as Uritsky Square (), in memory of the assassinated leader of the city's Cheka branch, Moisei Uritsky. The earliest and most celebrated building on the square, the Baroque white-and-turquoise Winter Palace (as re-built between 1754 and 1762) of the Russian tsars, gives the square its name. Although the adjacent buildings are designed in the Neoclassical style, they perfectly match the palace in their scale, rhythm, and monumentality. The opposite, southern side of the square was designed in the shape of an arc by George von Velten in the late 18th century. These plans came to fruition half a century later, when Alexander I of Russia (reigned 1801‚Äì1825) envisaged the square as a vast monument to the 1812‚Äì1814 Russian victories over Napoleon and commissioned Carlo Rossi to design the bow-shaped Empire-style Building of the General Staff (1819‚Äì1829), which centers on a double triumphal arch crowned with a Roman quadriga. In the centre of the square stands the Alexander Column (1830‚Äì1834), designed by Auguste de Montferrand. This red granite column (the tallest of its kind in the world) is 47.5 metres high and weighs some 500 tons. It is set so well that it requires no attachment to the base. The eastern side of the square comprises Alexander Brullov's building of the Guards Corps Headquarters (1837‚Äì1843). The western side, however, opens towards Admiralty Square, thus making the Palace Square a vital part of the grand suite of St Petersburg squares.

The first Thompson album to be recorded in the USA, Daring Adventures is a marked departure from its predecessors with a slicker, more commercial sound and backing provided by American session players. It marked the start of a controversial five-album collaboration between Thompson and new producer Mitchell Froom that was regarded, in some quarters, to have \\"Americanised\\" and commercialised Thompson's style and sound. The album is variously seen as a sell-out under pressure from a record company, or as an attempt to reach a wider audience.

The main character is a Swedish teenager called Bert Ljung, living in √ñreskoga, a fictional town in Sweden, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first book came out in 1987. Bert and his friends also have a pop/rock band, the Heman Hunters. A TV series was made in 1994, directed by Tomas Alfredson and Svante Kettner. It was followed by a feature film in 1995, also directed by Alfredson. In late-July 2016 the recording of a new Bert film was announced. Between 1993 and 2002, a comic book, FF med Bert, was publishedSeriesamlarna and between 1992 and 1999, comic albums were published. Main characters =Bert Ljung= Bert Ljung is the main character. Bert starts as a 12-year-old child in the spring term of the 5th grade but later becomes a mischievous teenager discovering his own sexuality. From the book Berts f√∂rsta betraktelser, the readers can learn that Bert Ljung was born on February 21, 1976, but there are a lot of anachronisms, with the later books largely following a floating timeline. His family is also depicted in the books. Bert plays the electric bass, sings and writes songs in the amateur rock band Heman Hunters, and plays soccer for the amateur team √ñreskoga-Kamraternas Idrottsf√∂rening. =√Öke Nordin= √Öke Nordin is Bert's best friend. His mother died in cancer when he was 7 years old. While Bert is interested in girls, √Öke is more interested in science, carrying out dangerous experiments with chemicals on his little sister Doris. √Öke is the Heman Hunters' electrician and overall technician. =Torleif Andersson= Torleif comes from a family depicted as \\"intellectual\\". Thorleif likes classical music, and plays the flute and the keyboards in the Heman Hunters. =Erik \\"Lill-Erik\\" Linstett= Lill-Erik is the weak guy. He plays the accordion or the drums in the Heman Hunters. Before his arrival from Sundsvall, rumors make everybody think he is the strong \\"Stor-Erik\\" or \\"Erik the Great\\" who is able to beat up Klimpen. =Rebecka Molin= Rebecka Molin is the first girl Bert is in love with, which occurs in the mid 5th grade when the book series start. =Nadja Nilsson= Nadja Nilsson is a girl born in the autumn in V√§rmland, and lives with her mother in a cottage. She plays the violin. Her brothers are raggare (basically greasers). Bert falls in love with Nadja in May in the 5th grade, and they come together in June. On 1 March in the 6th grade, Bert breaks up with Nadja. =Paulina Hlinka= Paulina Hlinka is a girl from what was then Czechoslovakia. When her cousin Pavel visits Sweden in Berts vidare betraktelser, Bert is scared that secret US agents will spot them, and prevent him visiting his uncle Janne in New York City due to the poor relationship between the USA and the USSR, as Czechoslovakia was a USSR-allied state. Bert is in love with Paulina from mid-late 6th grade to early 7th grade. =Emilia Ridderfjell= Emilia Ridderfjell is a girl who Bert falls in love with in October in the 7th grade. She's interested in horses and schools, and takes singing classes. Her parents are medical doctors. On 1 March in the 8th grade, Emilia breaks up with Bert. While Emilia has been a classmate of Bert since starting the 1st grade, Bert doesn't discover her until he falls in love with her, almost 6 and half year later. Before, she has just been a name on a paper, and a schooldesk in the classroom, except when Bert says \\"‚ÄìSorry\\" to her in the 3rd grade for accidentally smashing a table tennis ball hitting her dental braces, knocking them out. In Berts bravader, Bert states that liking her is not without social risk (something Bert is always very keenly aware of), since most guys in his class consider her being a wimpish type for having good grades, fine manners and ironed clothes. She also appears in the Bert comics, where she has a quicker temper, and two cousins, one is named Lovisa from Gothenburg who Bert doesn't know when she arrives by train making Bert confused, and another cousin named Antonia Ridderfjell. =Klas \\"Klimpen\\" Svensson= Klimpen is a stereotypical tough guy, who fights, and no one wants to be a friend with. He moves to Motala after the 5th grade.

It was released on November 29, 2002 in Germany, and in North America on October 28, 2003. The game was published by JoWooD Productions and Atari, Inc. Gothic II was a commercial success in Germany, and became JoWood's biggest hit at the time of its release. By 2004, it had sold over 300,000 units when combined with its expansion pack, Night of the Raven. Sales of Gothic II alone ultimately surpassed 400,000 units by 2007, following its re-release as a budget title in Germany.  Synopsis  = Setting = Like Gothic, Gothic II is set on the medieval styled isle Khorinis. Places include the City of Khorinis, the monastery of the fire mages, farms and woods. The mine valley of part I is also in the game, though it has changed. Of the old camp only the castle remains, the new camp has turned into a region of ice, and the swamp camp is made inaccessible by a fence built by the orcs. The final place visited in the game is Irdorath, a dungeon similar to the temple in Gothic. Khorinis is a rich area with beautiful farms and dense forests. The main trade resource of Khorinis is the magic ore delivered from its prison colony to the King, who is fighting the orcs on the mainland. Most of the farms in Khorinis are owned by one landowner who has hired mercenaries to protect him and his farms from the militia when they try to collect taxes from the farms. This has caused Khorinis to be on the edge of a civil war. The city is low on food and relies on travelling merchants as the ships from the mainland have stopped coming because of the war. People in Khorinis believe in three gods. Adanos, the god of water and balance. Innos, the god of fire and good. Beliar, the god of evil and darkness. = Prologue = After the barrier around the prison colony was destroyed, ore supplies for the kingdom have stopped. The king decides to send Lord Hagen with 100 paladins to the island to secure ore. On Khorinis, prisoners that escaped the camp raided the country and seeing as the militia was unable to protect them; some farmers formed an alliance with the refugees and no longer paid allegiance to the king. Evil did not disappear with the Sleeper being banned as with his last cry the Sleeper summoned the most evil creatures. Xardas felt this and rescued the Nameless Hero from under the ruins of the Sleeper's temple, where he has laid for weeks, becoming weak.Gothic II manual = Plot = The Nameless Hero is instructed by Xardas on the new danger, an army of evil that has gathered in the mine valley, led by dragons. Xardas sends the Hero to Lord Hagen, leader of the paladins, to retrieve the Eye of Innos, an artifact which makes it possible to speak with the dragons and learn more about their motivation. The Nameless Hero starts to the City of Khorinis and after he found a way to enter the city, he learns he has to join one of the factions ‚Äì the militia, the fire mages or the mercenaries ‚Äì to be permitted entrance to Lord Hagen. When finally meeting the head of the paladins, the Nameless Hero is first sent into the mine valley, which is now overrun by Orcs, to bring back evidence of the dragons. In the castle, the former old camp, Garond heads the mission of the paladins. He also knows about the dragons, since the castle has already been attacked by them, but is only willing to write a notice on it for Lord Hagen, after the Nameless Hero has gathered information on the status in the mines. By the time the Hero exits the valley with the note about the dragons, the evil forces have become aware of his quest. Seekers are spread throughout the isle, with the goal to kill him. Presented with the note Lord Hagen is willing to give the Eye of Innos to the Hero and sends him to the monastery of the fire mages to retrieve it. But shortly before the Hero arrives there, the eye was stolen. The Hero chases after the thief, but just arrives in time to witness Seekers destroy the Eye of Innos. A smith can repair the amulet, but for the magical power to be restored, a ritual with high mages representing the three gods is necessary. Vatras, the water mage, prepares the ritual and represents Adanos. With former fire mage Xardas representing Beliar, Pyrokar, head of the fire mages, joins the ritual reluctantly to represent Innos. The mages manage to restore the power of the Eye of Innos and so the Hero can head back to the valley to destroy the four dragons that live there. After all of the dragons are killed, the Hero travels to Xardas' tower to report to him, but the mage is gone. The Hero is given a note from Xardas by Lester, telling him he was to find more information in the fire mages' monastery, in the book 'The Halls of Irdorath'. The book contains a sea map, showing the way to the isle Irdorath, one of the ancient temples of Beliar that once disappeared. The hero assembles a crew and gets a ship and a captain for that ship to sail to Irdorath and confront the leader of the dragons, and avatar of Beliar ‚Äì the undead dragon. After the hero slays the dragon, Xardas teleports into the cave and absorbs its soul, making him an avatar of Beliar. After the hero returns to the ship, Xardas appears and tells him that they will see each other again. The game ends with the ship sailing into the distance toward Myrtana.  Development  The game engine is basically a modified version of the Gothic engine. The texture resolution has been improved by a factor 4 and the world is said to be three times as detailed as in the first game. While the graphics are less detailed than other engines of the time, there is almost no loading time.  Marketing and release  The German version of the game was published by JoWooD and released on November 29, 2002. In the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the game was released on June 13, 2003. The US release by Atari followed a few months later on October 28. However, according to Piranha Bytes, Atari did not officially confirm the US release to them, so they did not spread the word about this release for months. On October 17, 2005 publisher JoWood announced that Aspyr Media was going to publish four of their titles in North America, one of them being Gothic II Gold, which includes Gothic II as well as the expansion pack Gothic II - Night of the Raven. Aspyr Media released Gothic II Gold on November 29, 2005. In Germany, Gothic II is also available in a Collector's Edition, together with the add-on and Gothic. An English demo version of the game which contains the first part was released on March 17, 2005, when the game was released in several new territories.  Reception  =Sales= Following high sales projections, Gothic II became a commercial success and was JoWood's largest-ever hit by early 2003. In the German market, it debuted at #1 on GfK's weekly computer game sales charts in December, topping popular rivals like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Tobias Simon of Gameswelt noted that it shot \\"directly from zero to #1\\" upon release. After dropping to #3 in its second and third weeks, it finished the final calendar week of 2002 in second place, behind Anno 1503. German firm Media Control ultimately ranked Gothic II as the German market's second- biggest computer game seller of December, again behind Anno. Gothic II continued to hold position 2 on GfK's charts for the first two weeks of January 2003, before falling to places fifth, fourth and tenth over its following three weeks, respectively. Despite exiting the top 10 in the sixth week of 2003, Gothic II received a \\"Gold\\" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) by the end of January, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The game retained sixth place on Media Control's monthly chart for February, and by June had spent seven consecutive months in the firm's top 30, claiming 15th that month. After two 17th-place finishes in July and August, it climbed back to 14th in September 2003. By February 2004, Gothic II had sold 200,000 units, while its expansion pack had achieved 100,000 sales. In early 2005, Koch Media launched its \\"Hammerprice\\" line of budget games, which repackaged older titles at a ‚Ç¨10 price point. Gothic II was among the first games released on the label, alongside titles such as SpellForce: The Order of Dawn and Singles: Flirt Up Your Life. Selling around 200,000 units in this new form, Gothic II became one of Koch's most successful Hammerprice games by 2007. Throughout Europe, Gothic II sold 500,000 units by January 2005.https://web.archive.org/web/20051020174423/http://www.afjv.com/press0501/050103_gothic_ii_2.htm =Critical reviews= While Gothic II received very high reviews in the German press, it did not fare as well in North America, where the game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. One of the reasons for the overall worse reviews were the graphics. The translation of the script and the voice acting in the English version were also criticized, and were felt by critics to be out of place and poorer than in the German version. Much of the voice acting criticism falls upon the change in the voice for the character Diego. Douglas L. Erickson of Computer Games Magazine called Gothic II \\"a role-playing experience in the truest sense.\\" He summarized, \\"Rarely inconsistent, often frustrating, and always flexible, the world of Gothic II is, for lack of a more appropriate term, the most believable virtual place you can visit.\\" Gothic II won PC Gamer USs 2003 \\"Best Roleplaying Game\\" award. The editors called it \\"a return to the roots of classic fantasy roleplaying on the PC\\" and noted its \\"beautifully detailed nonlinear 3D world\\". It was also nominated for RPG Vault's \\"RPG of the Year\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Music\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound\\" awards, all of which went to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

The first woman to execute the entrechat quatre, Camargo was also allegedly responsible for two innovations in ballet as she was one of the first dancers to wear slippers instead of heeled shoes, and, while there is no evidence that she was the first woman to wear the short calf-length ballet skirt, the now standardized ballet tights she did help to popularize these. She is said to have been as strong as the male dancers.  Early life  Camargo was born on 15 April 1710, and baptised the same day, in Brussels, the daughter of Ferdinand Joseph de Cupis and Marie-Anne de Smet. She had two younger brothers, Jean-Baptiste who later became a composer and violinist, Fran√ßois Cupis de Renoussard a composer and cellist, and a sister, Madeleine. Her father, who was of Spanish ancestry, earned a meagre living as violinist and dancing-master, and from childhood she was trained for the stage. At ten years of age, she was given lessons by Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost (1680‚Äì1741), then the first dancer at the Paris Op√©ra, and at once obtained an engagement as premiere danseuse, first at Brussels and then at Rouen.  Career  La Camargo Dancing, by Nicolas Lancret, c.1730 She made her Paris debut on 5 May 1726 at the Paris Opera Ballet in Les Caract√®res de la Danse. The piece was choreographed by her teacher Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost to music by Jean Ferry Rebel. Pr√©vost herself originated the role, and subsequently taught her popular solo to both Camargo and her other student, Marie Sall√©. Camargo dazzled audiences with her stunning technique and spritely energy, performing entrechats and cabrioles with brilliant execution. She became the first woman to execute the entrechat quatre, and she at once became the rage. She popularized two innovations to ballet, changing from heeled shoes to slippers, and she was one of the first ballet-dancers to shorten the skirt to what afterwards became the regulation length. Every new fashion bore her name; her manner of doing her hair was copied by all at court; her shoemaker ‚Äî she had a tiny foot ‚Äî made his fortune. Her increasing popularity at the Paris Opera inspired jealousy in Pr√©vost, who demoted her to the corps de ballet. However, a later incident involving a missing male dancer saw Camargo unexpectedly step into his place and improvise a brilliant solo. This feat secured her status as a principal ballerina. She had many titled admirers whom she nearly ruined by her extravagances, among others Louis de Bourbon, Count of Clermont. At his wish she retired from the stage from 1736 to 1741, resuming her dancing career from 1741 to 1751. After finally retiring, she received a government pension. In her time she appeared in 78 ballets or operas, always to the delight of the public. Nicolas Lancret painted a famous portrait of her that exists in several versions including works now held at the Wallace Collection, London,Wallace Collection on-line:Mlle de Camargo Dancing and at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (shown right). In them she wears heeled shoes and is poised √† demi point. A ballet, Camargo, based on the incident when she and her sister Madeleine were abducted by the Comte de Melun in May 1728 was created by Marius Petipa and the composer L√©on Minkus for the Russian Imperial Ballet, premiering December 19, 1872 with the famous ballerina, Ad√®le Grantzow, as Marie Anne Camargo. The work was later revived in 1901 for the Russian Imperial Ballet by Lev Ivanov for Pierina Legnani. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, however, the ballet was never performed again.  Death  She died on 28 April 1770, thirteen days after her 60th birthday, in Paris.

Captain Richard Chenoweth, builder of Fort Nelson, was stationed with his family northeast of present-day Middletown when a large band of Native Americans (likely Shawnee) attacked from across the Ohio River. They killed three of Chenoweth's children, Levi, Margaret and Polly and two of the soldiers. Chenoweth's wife, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" nee McCarthy was pierced through the lungs by an arrow and seriously wounded. She faked death while an attacker took her scalp. She survived and wore a hat for the rest of her life to conceal the scars. Two soldiers were captured alive and were ritually burned at the stake near the springhouse.

It held the official Saturn magazine license for the UK, and as such some issues included a demo CD created by Sega, Sega Flash, which included playable games and game footage. In 1997 the magazine claimed a readership of 30,140. The last issue was Issue 37, November 1998. Sega Saturn Magazine was originally known as Sega Magazine which launched in 1994 and covered the Sega consoles available at the time, including the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Mega-CD, Sega 32X and Sega Game Gear. From November 1995 the magazine was relaunched as Sega Saturn Magazine and coverage of other Sega consoles were gradually reduced and withdrawn in favour of the Sega Saturn. In addition to reviews, previews, and demo discs, the magazine included interviews with developers about topics such as the development libraries that Sega was providing them with, and would routinely cover topics of interest only to hardcore gamers such as imported Japanese RPGs and beat 'em ups. The magazine retained its title even after its content became chiefly devoted to the Saturn's successor, the Dreamcast, as the Saturn had been discontinued in Europe.

Hume expounded his argument in Of the Balance of Trade, which he wrote to counter the Mercantilist idea that a nation should strive for a positive balance of trade (i.e., greater exports than imports). In short, the \\"increase in domestic prices due to the gold inflow would discourage exports and encourage imports, thus automatically limiting the amount by which exports would exceed imports\\". Hume first elaborated on the mechanism in a 1749 letter to Montesquieu.  Argument  Hume argued that when a country with a gold standard had a positive balance of trade, gold would flow into the country in the amount that the value of exports exceeds the value of imports. Conversely, when such a country had a negative balance of trade, gold would flow out of the country in the amount that the value of imports exceeds the value of exports. Consequently, in the absence of any offsetting actions by the central bank on the quantity of money in circulation (called sterilization), the money supply would rise in a country with a positive balance of trade and fall in a country with a negative balance of trade. Using a theory called the quantity theory of money, Hume argued that countries with an increasing money supply would see inflation as the prices of goods and services rose while countries with a decreasing money supply would experience deflation as the prices of goods and services fell. The higher prices would, in the countries with a positive balance of trade, cause exports to decrease and imports to increase, which will alter the balance of trade downwards towards a neutral balance. Inversely, in countries with a negative balance of trade, the lower prices would cause exports to increase and imports to decrease, which will heighten the balance of trade towards a neutral balance. These adjustments in the balance of trade will continue until the balance of trade equals zero in all countries involved in the exchange.Murray N. Rothbard, David Hume and the Theory of Money\\", Mises Daily Articles, 27 April 2011. The price‚Äìspecie flow mechanism can also be applied to a state's entire balance of payments, which accounts not only for the value of net exports and similar transactions (i.e., the current account), but also the financial account, which accounts for flows of financial assets across countries, and the capital account, which accounts for non-market and other international transactions. But under a gold standard, transactions in the financial account would be conducted in gold‚Äîor currency convertible into gold‚Äîwhich would also affect the quantity of money in circulation.  Criticisms  * Trading data from the era of the gold standard tends not to corroborate with the theory. * the theory ignores the effect of paper/bank/credit money, and assumes that all money is gold. In practice, bank money can more than compensate for shortages of specie, so price levels need not be affected by a shortage of specie.

He made his first appearance on 28 May 2002. It was announced in January 2008 that Gus would leave the show later in 2008, and he made his last appearance on 2 May 2008. Storylines Gus first arrives in Walford in May 2002, working for a bed company and meets Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy). Gus falls in love with Sonia and they get together after she splits up with Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder). When she and Jamie realise they still have feelings for each other, she breaks up with Gus and reconciles with Jamie. In July, Gus is joined in Walford by his troublesome brother Juley (Joseph Kpobie), taking over as local road sweeper, and is given Wellard the dog when his friend Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) leaves London for India. When friends Martin (James Alexandrou) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) break into the Minute Mart, Gus investigates, is caught by police and is left to take the blame. In December 2003, Gus goes on a trip to Scotland in a minibus with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella), Mickey Miller (Joe Swash), Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), Sonia, Martin, Vicki, Tariq Larousi (Nabil Elouahabi) and Ronny (Ray Panthaki) and Kareena Ferreira (Pooja Shah). When the bus crashes on a moor, nearly killing Zoe, Gus and Wellard manage to find help for his stranded friends. In 2004, Gus disposes of a handgun he found in Juley's bag. Juley's involvement in crime, including the theft of some charity money, leads to his departure from Walford in April 2005, though he returns in September for a trip to France with Gus, Mickey, Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) and Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi). While in France, Gus meets Mickey's sister and father Dawn and Mike Swann (Kara Tointon and Mark Wingett). Mike exposes Juley as a con man, despite Juley's claims that he is a reformed character. Gus persuades Juley to return to Walford permanently to turn over a new leaf. In late 2005, Wellard bites Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who decides he wants the dog put down. Wellard is imprisoned pending a trial, but is freed on 12 January 2006, after Ian's partner Jane Collins (Laurie Brett) and children Peter (James Martin) and Lucy (Melissa Suffield) give character witness statements. When Juley mugs his ex- girlfriend, Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton), Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) threatens to report Juley to the police. Gus helps Juley escape, despite being disgusted at Juley's actions, by stalling Jake and letting Juley out of the back door. Gus is briefly reunited with Sonia when she breaks up with girlfriend Naomi Julien (Petra Letang), but she leaves him to reconcile with her husband Martin. In April 2008, Gus meets and falls for a girl called Keisha (Suzie McGrath) but catches her in bed with Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), his lodger who is two months behind on his rent. Sean fools Keisha into thinking Gus is a womaniser. After announcing what Sean did to everyone in the pub, including Sean's girlfriend, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), Gus attempts to evict Sean but is kicked out himself. Sean threatens to kill him if he doesn't pay the rent, and keeps Wellard. Sean later claims to want to make amends with Gus, but tricks him into believing he has killed and eaten his dog. On 28 April he is tied to a chair and Sean is about to give him a beating when Sean's sister Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) walks through the door and stops him. Having been reunited with Keisha, Gus leaves on 1 May to travel with her band. However, he finally gets his revenge on Sean before leaving, by exposing him as a cocaine dealer. Development George originally auditioned for EastEnders as a member of the Trueman family, but was deemed by producers to be too young to play either Anthony Trueman or Paul Trueman. In 2007, George was suspended from the show for two months after he was cautioned by police over allegations that he caused actual bodily harm against his partner. On 18 January 2008, it was reported that Gus would leave the series, and that it was a mutual decision between George and the producers. A spokesperson for the show said, \\"As the character did not have any big plots coming up it was agreed Mohammed would leave. He is in talks with the BBC about other projects.\\" Of his departure, George said: \\"I've always been an EastEnders fan, so it has been an honour and pleasure being in the show. And I'm thankful that Gus wasn't overused on screen, as it means that I haven't been typecast. I definitely feel ready to step into the shoes of a new character.\\" In February 2010, George claimed that the decision for him to leave was not his, and said that the show's bosses had \\"believed\\" a tabloid newspaper's claims made in relation to his arrest, which later proved to be false. He said, \\"They said I'd be leaving by mutual agreement but, of course, it wasn't really like that. Instead of supporting me, they believed the bad press I'd got after all that bother with [my partner]. They just sold me down the river. It's been nearly two years since I left and I haven‚Äôt had one single acting job since. But I'm not going to give up.\\" Discussing his character's exit storyline from the soap, George commented at the time: \\"Gus is wishing he'd never put himself in the position of sharing a flat with this madman (Sean Slater). At this point, he's beside himself. Sean's crazy and looking for a target, and there's only one way this situation can end‚ÄîGus is convinced that Sean's going to do him in. [...] He goes so far as to barricade himself inside the flat‚ÄîI think he loses it a bit, to be honest. Gus hasn't really got any friends left in the Square, and all he wants is for somebody to rescue him and take him away from this awful situation.\\" The reappearance of the character's former girlfriend Keisha proves conflicting for Gus, on which George said, \\"I think Gus is the type of guy who desperately wants to settle down with the girl of his dreams. It's very hard for him when he sees Keisha, because she hurt him so badly with Sean, and that pain hasn't gone away. But Gus is a very forgiving person, so who knows what will happen...\\"  References   External links  * EastEnders characters Fictional Black British people Television characters introduced in 2002 Male characters in television ","title":"Gus Smith"},{"id":"2962286","text":"John Harrison (1693‚Äì1776) was a clockmaker who designed and built the world's first successful marine chronometers.

Its seat will be Vienna, Austria. The organization will be tasked with verifying the ban on nuclear tests and will operate therefore a worldwide monitoring system and may conduct on site inspections. The Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, and its Provisional Technical Secretariat, were established in 1997 and are headquartered in Vienna, Austria. Status The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will enter into force 180 days after the Treaty has been ratified by 44 States, listed in Annex 2 of the Treaty, which were designated to have a nuclear reactor or at least some advanced level of nuclear technology. As of March 2015, 41 of these Annex 2 states have signed the treaty and 36 have ratified. India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed or ratified the treaty; China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but have not ratified. The organization's scientific reporting claims 2.4 million persons will eventually die from cancers developed as a result of atmospheric atomic tests conducted between 1945 and 1980.Child, David. (10 December 2017). \\"Nuclear weapons: In conversation with ICAN\\". Al Jazeera website Retrieved 10 December 2017. Preparatory Commission The Preparatory Commission was established in 1997 and is tasked with making preparations for effective implementation of the Treaty, in particular by establishing its verification regime. The main task is establishing and provisionally operating the 337-facility International Monitoring System (IMS), including its International Data Centre (IDC) and Global Communications Infrastructure (GCI). The Commission is tasked also with the development of operational manuals, including a manual to guide conduct of on-site inspections. International Monitoring System (IMS) and Communications infrastructure Radionuclide station on Schauinsland in Germany The IMS, when completed, will consist of *50 primary and 120 auxiliary seismic monitoring stations. *11 hydro-acoustic stations detecting acoustic waves in the oceans. *60 infra-sound stations using microbarographs (acoustic pressure sensors) to detect very low-frequency sound waves. *80 radionuclide stations using air samplers to detect radioactive particles released from atmospheric explosions and/or vented from underground or under-water explosions. *16 radionuclide laboratories for analysis of samples from the radionuclide stations. Data from all stations are transmitted to the CTBTO International Data Centre (IDC) in Vienna through a global private data network known as GCI, which is largely based on satellite (VSAT) links. States Parties will have equal and direct access to all IMS data, raw or processed, for verification as well as civilian uses. The Preparatory Commission has started the building and verification of the system of which as of April 2011 about 80% was operational. Consultation and Clarification (C&C;) States Parties to the Treaty are encouraged to conduct a Consultation and Clarification process (C&C;) before requesting an on-site inspection. The state that has concerns about an ambiguous event should, whenever possible, make any effort to clarify it through consultations with the state in whose territory this event occurred, either directly or through the Organization. On Site Inspection (OSI) If an event detected by the IMS (or by other means) raises concerns about violation of the basic obligations of the CTBT, an OSI may be conducted to clarify whether a nuclear explosion has taken place. Such an inspection could take place only after entry into force of the Treaty, and would require agreement by at least 30 of the 51 members of the CTBTO's Executive Council. An inspection area of up to 1000 square kilometres would be searched by a team of inspectors (up to 40). Only State Parties to the Treaty may submit a request for an OSI. When conducting an OSI, a number of detection techniques can be used. These techniques include position finding, visual observation, passive seismic measurements and radioactivity measurements including gamma radiation and radioactive noble gases such as Argon-37 and isotopes of Xenon for an initial period of up to 25 days. Further, for a continuation period of up to 60 days, more intrusive measurements can be used on-site including active and resonance seismic measurements as well as ground penetrating radar, gravity, and electric and magnetic field mappings. Argon-37 field measurement is a unique technology specially developed for the purpose of OSI. Drilling to obtain radioactive samples from a suspected underground explosion site is also allowed. Data collected from various methods have to be fused and interpreted for decision making purposes. An important task of the CTBTO is to explore how recent scientific and technical advances in these technologies can be applied to an OSI.The Final Verification Measure Confidence-building measures In addition to the IMS, C&C; and OSI, the verification regime of the CTBT includes also the fourth element of Confidence-Building Measures. This requires States Parties to the treaty to notify the Organization, if possible in advance, of any chemical explosion using 300 tonnes or greater of TNT- equivalent blasting material to be detonated. This is required in order to contribute to the timely resolution of any compliance concerns and to assist in the calibration of IMS stations.

Originally known as the Kenya Coffee Company, they started distributing coffee to Britain in 1923. Shortly after, they opened a coffee shop in Sloane Square and then changed their name to Kenco in 1962. In 2008, the brand was relaunched with 75% of the beans for its instant range being sourced from Rainforest Alliance certified farms. The company sources their coffee beans from Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Indonesia.Kenco - Coffee Origins History Kenco was founded in 1923 by a co-operative of retired White Kenyan coffee growers who traded as \\"The Kenya Coffee Company Limited\\". Soon, L.C. Gibbs and C.S. Baines began selling coffee from a shop in Vere Street, Mayfair. The shop sold roast and ground coffee locally but most of its sales were by mail order, selling coffee to country houses using advertisements in publications such as Tatler, Country Life and The Times. As demand increased, the company moved to number 30 Sloane Street, London, next door to a food merchants called John Gardiner. Gardiner ran a food wholesale business, restaurants and provided outdoor catering at events such as the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. After World War II, Tom Kelly, a Gardiner employee, persuaded the company to buy the Kenya Coffee Company. On completion of the deal, Kelly was put in charge of the new business and he expanded the retail chain. As well as selling coffee by mail order and from the Sloane Street premises, Kelly diversified into catering and opened eleven coffee shops in locations such as Wimbledon, King‚Äôs Road and Golders Green. These Kenya Coffee Company shops may well have been the first branded high street coffee shops in the UK. In the 1960s, the caf√©s were thriving, selling not only coffee but all sorts of cakes as well. Besides the coffee shop activity, Kelly also acquired the rights to sell Gaggia machines, and so the company started to sell espresso machines to other coffee bars. In 1962, the Kenyan Coffee Company changed its name into the Kenco Coffee Company, to reflect the fact that the amount of coffee the company bought from Kenya was decreasing.

This species is highly threatened, and it is said that since the 1970s the breeding population has decreased significantly. By 2000 the estimated breeding population of the species was 350‚Äì500.  Taxonomy  Platalea pygmea was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It was moved to Eurynorhynchus by Sven Nilsson in 1821. It is now classified under the calidrid sandpipers.  Description  Head The most distinctive feature of this species is its spatulate bill. The breeding adult bird is 14‚Äì16 cm in length, and has a red- brown head, neck and breast with dark brown streaks. It has blackish upperparts with buff and pale rufous fringing. Non-breeding adults lack the reddish colouration, but have pale brownish-grey upperparts with whitish fringing to the wing-coverts. The underparts are white and the legs are black.BirdLife International (BLI) (2008a). Spoon-billed Sandpiper Species Factsheet. Retrieved 24 May 2008. Bill from the side and above The measurements are; wing 98‚Äì106 mm, bill 19‚Äì24 mm, bill tip breadth 10‚Äì12 mm, tarsus 19‚Äì22 mm and tail 37‚Äì39 mm.Hayman, Peter; Marchant, John & Prater, Tony (1986). Shorebirds: an identification guide to the waders of the world. Houghton Mifflin, Boston. The contact calls of the spoon-billed sandpiper include a quiet preep or a shrill wheer. The song, given during display, is an intermittent buzzing and descending trill preer-prr-prr. The display flight of the male includes brief hovers, circling and rapid diving while singing.  Distribution and habitat  A spoon-billed sandpiper The spoon-billed sandpiper's breeding habitat is sea coasts and adjacent hinterland on the Chukchi Peninsula and southwards along the isthmus of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It migrates down the Pacific coast through Japan, Korea and China, to its main wintering grounds in south and southeast Asia, where it has been recorded from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. Through phylogenetic analyses for the complete mitogenome sequence, South Korean and Chinese C. pygmaea groups were indicated to be closely related to Arenaria interpres because of the similarity in the series of protein-coding genes.  Behaviour and ecology  Its feeding style consists of a side-to-side movement of the bill as the bird walks forward with its head down. This species nests in June‚ÄìJuly on coastal areas in the tundra, choosing locations with grass close to freshwater pools. Spoon-billed sandpipers feed on the moss in tundras, as well as smaller animal species like mosquitoes, flies, beetles, and spiders. At certain points in time, they also feed on marine vertebrates such as shrimp and worms.  Conservation  This bird is critically endangered, with a current population of fewer than 2500 ‚Äì probably fewer than 1000 ‚Äì mature individuals. The main threats to its survival are habitat loss on its breeding grounds and loss of tidal flats through its migratory and wintering range. The important staging area at Saemangeum, South Korea, has already been partially reclaimed, and the remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future. Long-term remote sensing studies have shown that up to 65% of key spoon-billed sandpiper habitat in China, South Korea and North Korea has been destroyed by reclamation.Murray N. J., Clemens R. S., Phinn S. R., Possingham H. P. & Fuller R. A. (2014). Tracking the rapid loss of tidal wetlands in the Yellow Sea. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 12, 267‚Äì72. A 2010 study suggests that hunting in Burma by traditional bird trappers is a primary cause of the decline. Protected areas in its staging and wintering areas include Yancheng in China, Mai Po Marshes in Hong Kong and Point Calimere and Chilka lake in India,. As of 2016, the global spoon-billed sandpiper population was estimated at 240‚Äì456 mature individuals or at maximum 228 pairs. Formerly classified as an Endangered species by the IUCN, recent research shows that its numbers are decreasing more and more rapidly and that it is on the verge of extinction. It is consequently reclassified to Critically Endangered status in 2008.BirdLife International (BLI) (2008b). [2008 IUCN Redlist status changes]. Retrieved 23 May 2008. The population was estimated at only 120‚Äì200 pairs in 2009‚Äì2010, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002 equating to an annual rate of decline of 26%. Draining of the Saemangeum estuary in South Korea removed an important migration staging point, and hunting on the important wintering grounds in Burma has emerged as a serious threat. This species may become extinct in 10‚Äì20 years. The hunting in Burma and extinction prediction reported in BB was based on Wader Study Group Bulletin 117 (2010) In November 2011, thirteen spoon-billed sandpipers arrived at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom to start a breeding programme. The birds hatched from eggs collected in remote northeastern Russian tundra earlier and spent 60 days in Moscow Zoo in quarantine in preparation for the 8,000 km journey. Artificial incubation and captive rearing, termed headstarting, were expected to increase survival rates from less than 25% to over 75%, and the removal of eggs was expected to lead to a second clutch reared by the parents. In 2019, almost a decade since the rescue mission, the two birds were first to be born in a UK spoon-billed sandpiper ark. In 2013, conservationists hatched twenty chicks in Chukotka.

It lies at 2 50' North, 31 35' East, about 320 km (200 miles) in a direct line North-Northwest of Entebbe on Lake Victoria, and about 116 km (72 miles) by river below Butiaba on Lake Albert. The British built a government station there on a hill 50 to 60 metres (160 to 200 feet) above the Nile at a spot where the river narrows to 147 metres (482 feet) and attains a depth of 9 metres (30 feet). At this place was a gauge for measuring the discharge of the river. Wadelai was first visited by a European, Lieutenant H. Chippendall in 1875, and was named after a chieftain who, when visited by Gessi Pasha (on the occasion of that officer's circumnavigation of Lake Albert), ruled the surrounding district as a vassal of Kabarega, king of Bunyoro. The region was annexed to the Egyptian Sudan and Wadelai's village chosen as a government post. This post was on the western bank of the Nile, below the existing station.

Electromechanics After Maxwell proposed the differential equation model of the electromagnetic field in 1873, the mechanism of action of fields came into question, for instance in the Kelvin‚Äôs master class held at Johns Hopkins University in 1884 and commemorated a century later. The requirement that the equations remain consistent when viewed from various moving observers led to special relativity, a geometric theory of 4-space where intermediation is by light and radiation.What led me more or less directly to the special theory of relativity was the conviction that the electromotive force acting on a body in motion in a magnetic field was nothing else but an electric field. Albert Einstein (1953) The spacetime geometry provided a context for technical description of electric technology, especially generators, motors, and lighting at first. The Coulomb force was generalized to the Lorentz force. For example, with this model transmission lines and power grids were developed and radio frequency communication explored. An effort to mount a full-fledged electromechanics on a relativistic basis is seen in the work of Leigh Page, from the project outline in 1912 to his textbook Electrodynamics (1940) The interplay (according to the differential equations) of electric and magnetic field as viewed over moving observers is examined. What is charge density in electrostatics becomes proper charge density and generates a magnetic field for a moving observer. A revival of interest in this method for education and training of electrical and electronics engineers broke out in the 1960s after Richard Feynman‚Äôs textbook. Rosser‚Äôs book Classical Electromagnetism via Relativity was popular, as was Anthony French‚Äôs treatment in his textbook which illustrated diagrammatically the proper charge density. One author proclaimed, \\"Maxwell ‚Äî Out of Newton, Coulomb, and Einstein\\". The use of retarded potentials to describe electromagnetic fields from source-charges is an expression of relativistic electromagnetism.  Principle  The question of how an electric field in one inertial frame of reference looks in different reference frames moving with respect to the first is crucial to understanding fields created by moving sources. In the special case, the sources that create the field are at rest with respect to one of the reference frames. Given the electric field in the frame where the sources are at rest, one can ask: what is the electric field in some other frame? Knowing the electric field at some point (in space and time) in the rest frame of the sources, and knowing the relative velocity of the two frames provided all the information needed to calculate the electric field at the same point in the other frame. In other words, the electric field in the other frame does not depend on the particular distribution of the source charges, only on the local value of the electric field in the first frame at that point. Thus, the electric field is a complete representation of the influence of the far-away charges. Alternatively, introductory treatments of magnetism introduce the Biot‚ÄìSavart law, which describes the magnetic field associated with an electric current. An observer at rest with respect to a system of static, free charges will see no magnetic field. However, a moving observer looking at the same set of charges does perceive a current, and thus a magnetic field. That is, the magnetic field is simply the electric field, as seen in a moving coordinate system. Redundancy The title of this article is redundant since all mathematical theories of electromagnetism are relativistic. Indeed, as Einstein wrote, \\"The special theory of relativity ... was simply a systematic development of the electrodynamics of Clerk Maxwell and Lorentz\\".A. Einstein (1934)(Alan Harris translator) Essays in Science, page 57 via Internet Archive Combination of spatial and temporal variables in Maxwell's theory required admission of a four-manifold. Finite light speed and other constant motion lines were described with analytic geometry. Orthogonality of electric and magnetic vector fields in space was extended by hyperbolic orthogonality for the temporal factor. When Ludwik Silberstein published his textbook The Theory of Relativity (1914)L. Silberstein (1914) The Theory of Relativity via Internet Archive he related the new geometry to electromagnetism. Faraday's law of induction was suggestive to Einstein when he wrote in 1905 about the \\"reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor\\".A. Einstein (1905) s:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies_(1920_edition) Nevertheless, the aspiration, reflected in references for this article, is for an analytic geometry of spacetime and charges providing a deductive route to forces and currents in practice. Such a royal route to electromagnetic understanding may be lacking, but a path has been opened with differential geometry: The tangent space at an event in spacetime is a four-dimensional vector space, operable by linear transformations. Symmetries observed by electricians find expression in linear algebra and differential geometry. Using exterior algebra to construct a 2-form F from electric and magnetic fields, and the implied dual 2-form *F, the equations dF = 0 and d*F = J (current) express Maxwell's theory with a differential form approach.

Her trial in 1712 is commonly but erroneously regarded as the last witch trial in England. Background Wenham, a widow of Walkern, Hertfordshire, brought a charge of defamation against a farmer, in response to an accusation of witchcraft. The local Justice of the Peace, Sir Henry Chauncy referred the matter to the Rev Gardiner, the rector of Walkern. She was awarded with a shilling, though advised to be less quarrelsome. She was disappointed with this outcome, and it was reported that she had said she would have justice \\"some other way\\". She supposedly then bewitched Ann Thorne, a servant at the rectory. Trial A warrant for Wenham's arrest was issued by Sir Henry Chauncy, who gave instructions that she be searched for \\"witch marks\\". She requested that she undergo trials to avoid being detained, such as a swimming test, however, she was asked to repeat the Lord's Prayer. The accused was brought before Sir John Powell at the Assize Court at Hertford on 4 March 1712. A number of villagers gave evidence that Wenham practised witchcraft. The judge was clearly more sceptical than the jury of the evidence presented. When an accusation of flying was made, the judge remarked there was no law against doing so. Some historians such as Keith Thomas have suggested, taking this case is an example, that there was generally a difference in attitudes towards supposed witchcraft between educated and less educated people, the latter being more credulous. However, the Wenham case is arguably more complicated than this distinction might imply, as Henry Chauncy, for example, was well educated. Chauncy's motivation has been the subject of speculation. Ian Bostridge, one of Keith Thomas' students, has argued that political issues were involved in the case. Final years Title page of a book by Richard Boulton, an \\"answer\\" to Francis Hutchinson's essay. Wenham was removed from her village for her own safety. In her final years, she was visited by Bishop Francis Hutchinson (1660‚Äì1739), author of an Historical essay concerning witchcraft (1718) in which he applied a rational approach to the subject. Hutchinson, who had met other survivors of witch-hunts, regarded their persecution as Tory superstition.The political aspect of the case has been discussed by Ian Bostridge. Witchcraft and its transformations, c.1650‚Äì1750. Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1997. Other cases According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Jane Wenham was last person convicted of witchcraft in England. However, trials and executions for witchcraft continued in England after the Wenham case. One such case involved Mary Hickes and her nine-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who were condemned to death by the Assize Court and were hanged in Huntingdon on Saturday 28 July 1716. Contemporary accounts The trial caused a sensation in London, where publishers such as Edmund Curll sold material proclaiming Wenham's innocence or guilt. One of the witnesses at the trial, Francis Bragge, published three pamphlets about the case including, A full and impartial account of the discovery of sorcery and witchcraft practis'd by Jane Wenham of Walkerne in Hertfordshire.

During his tenure as chairman, Jaeckle enforced strict adherence to party discipline, which significantly bolstered the party's standing in the state. As chairman, Jaeckle exerted an outsized influence on the state's political landscape. In the 1944 book The Big Bosses, by Charles Van Devander, Jaeckle was portrayed as single-handedly controlling the state legislature and helping shape and execute the party's platform. According to the book, the Albany Legislative Correspondents' Association included in its annual satirical show a song with the refrain: \\"You've gotta get Jaeckle's O.K.\\" Charles W. Van Devander, The Big Bosses (N.Y.: Howell, Soskin 1944). Jaeckle also sometimes played kingmaker; for instance, he selected New York City District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey as the Republican candidate for the New York governorship. Dewey won the race and served three terms as governor; Jaeckle is credited with helping lift him onto the national stage.Jaeckle's New York Times obituary Dewey later lost two unsuccessful campaigns for the White House in the 1940s. Jaeckle was Dewey's campaign chairman during his first presidential run. \\"'I was not Dewey's man,' Mr. Jaeckle recalled in an interview. 'Nor was he mine. Events brought us together. We were a strong combination. There was mutual respect. I was like a trainer with a good horse.'\\" The New York Times, \\"Edwin Jaeckle, 97, Lawyer and Backer of Thomas Dewey<\\" May 15, 1992. Jaeckle attributed his success as Republican Party leader in New York to integrity, tight fiscal control and tight control of his office holders.Buffalo Magazine, January 1974 He also was a successful lawyer in private practice. His law firm, Jaeckle, Fleischmann & Mugel, which was perhaps the most stellar name in the Western New York legal firmament for decades, announced on September 30, 2015 that, as of January 1, 2016, it would cease to exist. The remnants of the partnership were joined into a Syracuse, N.Y.-based firm and, in a move that stunned observers of the legal profession, the iconic Jaeckle Fleischmann name was not retained.The Buffalo News, October 1, 2015. \\"The Legacy of Jaeckle, Fleischmann & Mugel: Firm Represents More than Iconic Name,\\" Buffalo Law Journal, December 28, 2015. http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/buffalo- law-journal/2015/12/firm-represents-more-than-iconic-name.html Early life Jaeckle was born in Buffalo of pioneer stock to Jacob Jaeckle and Mary Marx Jaeckle, who themselves were born in Buffalo in the 1850s. His grandparents were Germans who had arrived in Buffalo during the great migration of the 1840s. His father was a carpenter who eventually became a general building contractor. Among other projects, Jaeckle's father literally built the family church, St. Peter's United Evangelical, completed in 1877. For years the Jaeckles lived in the house Jacob built at 26 Lemon St. in the \\"Fruit Belt\\" of citrus-named streets in the German Near East Side of Buffalo. Mary Marx had grown up in that neighborhood, and her father had a grocery store on Mortimer Street. \\"They were just good hearty German-American people who worked like hell,\\" Jaeckle recalled in 1980 in a Buffalo News article.Buffalo News, March 2, 1980, \\"Ed Jaeckle at 85: A Lifetime in the Arena of Politics and Power.\\" Early political career Jaeckle was first exposed to politics while attending the University of Buffalo Law School. A neighborhood restaurateur, Leo J. Schmidt -- a family friend -- was running for state committeeman and needed help. Jaeckle, then 20, offered his services, primarily driving Schmidt around.\\"Man of the Year: Edwin F. Jaeckle,\\" Buffalo (The Sunday Magazine of The Buffalo Evening News), January 1974 Jaeckle graduated in 1915 and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1916. Shortly after, Schmidt suggested that he run for the Erie County Board of Supervisors in the 13th Ward. In 1917, at age 22, he ran for the nomination against a Republican incumbent. He won the general election, after a brutal primary campaign. After having served in the United States Navy during World War I, Jaeckle returned to New York to build his private law practice. In 1920, he became clerk of the County Board of Supervisors. In 1927 he became back tax collector for the county treasurer. During this time he cultivated his inside knowledge of the political game. Jaeckle was elected Erie County (Buffalo) Republican Chairman in 1935 and held the position with an iron fist until he resigned it in 1948, ostensibly to devote his full efforts to Dewey's 1948 presidential campaign. During his tenure, he made the county's political organization one of the most powerful in the nation and dominated local elections.  State chairman and beyond  In 1938, Jaeckle threw his support behind Dewey, a racket-busting New York City district attorney, to be the next New York governor. Jaeckle was the sole upstate chairman to push for Dewey's nomination behind the scenes; he also served as Dewey's floor manager at the state convention. Dewey lost the general election to the Democratic incumbent Governor Herbert Lehman; but the Jaeckle-Dewey partnership was now established and the two men would advance each other's interests off and on over at least the next decade. After the 1938 election, Jaeckle assumed the chair of the GOP State Executive Committee and, with it, de facto leadership of the state party organization. His election to the Republican state chairmanship came in 1940. He ran Dewey for governor again in 1942, this time successfully. Dewey would retain control of the office for twelve years. After Dewey's successful gubernatorial career, Jaeckle set to work helping campaign for the presidency in 1944, campaigning against Franklin D. Roosevelt. In analyzing Dewey's success in maneuvering for the Republican nomination that year, Time Magazine concluded it was due to the \\" . . . power and precision of the politicos who surround Dewey\\" -- \\"a group of political advisers perhaps unequalled since the first Roosevelt Brain Trust.\\" Time Magazine, May 29, 1944, Men Around Dewey. Preeminent among them, the article listed Jaeckle, describing him as a \\"bulky, well heeled Buffalo lawyer, who almost singlehanded turned Buffalo's meager Democratic majorities into Republican landslides.\\" However, during the campaign against Roosevelt, Dewey broke with Jaeckle over strategy. As Jaeckle recalled in a 1971 interview with The Buffalo Evening News, \\"I played the game until after the election, then I quit as state chairman.\\" The two men later reconciled, and Dewey asked Jaeckle to join his 1948 presidential run against incumbent Democrat Harry S. Truman. Jaeckle agreed and served as Dewey's floor manager at the 1948 Republican National Convention. During the general election campaign, Jaeckle rode the campaign train with Dewey and did most of his political work. With polls showing Dewey in the lead, the governor chose to adopt a restrained campaign strategy. Once again as in 1944, however, the two men saw strategy differently and Jaeckle cautioned Dewey against this laid- back approach. Dewey lost the election in one of the most surprising upsets in presidential campaign history.  Death and Retrospective  Jaeckle was a liberal Republican who established a tough political machine, ran it with an iron fist, insisted on integrity in party and government affairs, and fostered a progressive agenda. In his own dealings as party leader, he was attentive to his subordinates and fair but firm. As Van Devander noted: \\"Jaeckle spends half of each week at home and during the rest of the time shuttles back and forth to New York City [where his headquarters famously was the Hotel Roosevelt on Madison Avenue at 45th Street], to Albany when the legislature is in session [where his headquarters was the Ten Eyck Hotel], and to other parts of the state. He is in frequent touch will all of the county chairmen, and succeeds in giving them the double impression that he is devoted to their individual interests, and that he is quite capable of breaking any one of them, politically, who might attempt to put anything over on him.\\" Van Devander, The Big Bosses, supra. In Life magazine's profile of Jaeckle in its June 12, 1944 issue, Arthur Dennis summarized Jaeckle's political philosophy while describing the fund-raising prowess that enabled him to make the New York Republican Party a well-heeled, well-oiled machine: \\"In New York Jaeckle has had periodic meetings with Banker Winthrop Aldrich and others on party finances, but with the explicit understanding that their contributions do not give them any operational control over party management. This fits in with Jaeckle's theory and practice that the real strength of a political machine is at the party-worker level, and that the leader who forgets this and begins to take his ease among the political Brahmins and the big-money boys is lost.\\"Life, Vol. 16, No. 24 (June 12, 1944), \\"Dewey's Man Jaeckle,\\" pp. 16 - 20. He lived long enough to see the demise of party control of politics and government and to lament the rise of the cult of individual personality over party organization. He believed this phenomenon fostered a lack of accountability in government. As he told The Buffalo News toward the end of his life: \\"Politics no longer operates the way it should. There's no party responsibility; too many individuals are calling the shots. . . . Everybody is a victim of this system. In the old days, the party was responsible for the conduct of government. If you did the job right and served the people, they kept you in office. If not, you were gone. It's not like that anymore.\\" Buffalo News, \\"Warriors mourn death of party -- Personality cult overshadows politics,\\" by Anthony Violanti, Staff Reporter. In his political retirement, Jaeckle built a substantial law practice and a substantial personal fortune. After retirement from his law practice at the age of 93, he divided his time between Rochester, Minnesota and St. Petersburg, Florida.The Buffalo News, \\"Jaeckle Plans Minnesota Retirement After 72 years at the Practice of Law,\\" June 21, 1988, by Matt Gryta, Staff Reporter.

He was also the first Belgian professional player, when he obtained a transfer to Sparta Prague in 1930. Braine played in 54 matches for the Belgium national football team and scored 26 times, making him Belgium's 5th top all-time scorer. Career highlights His first club was Beerschot in Antwerp. Braine made his Belgian Championship debut on 11 February 1923 against Daring Club de Bruxelles (lost 3-0). He scored 4 times in 4 appearances that season and Beerschot finished second. Raymond's brother, Pierre, was also part of the team. The next year, Braine obtained his first trophy by earning a Championship title. Three more titles followed in 1925, 1926 and 1928. At the time, the Belgian football was not a professional club. However, certain players did receive money (unofficially) based on performance. Some other players supplemented their incomes by opening caf√©s. At one point the Belgian Football Association published a paper stating: \\"Considering it is important to stop the progression of player-caf√© owners, the executive Committee takes the decision that at this day, except for a player whose parents ran the caf√© for more than 5 years, the authorisation to open a caf√© will be subordinated to the condition that the player will not be a part of the first team.\\" Braine, who just opened a caf√© in December 1929, decided to go and play abroad. His first attempt was in England with London side Clapton Orient, but he could not obtain a work permit. He signed a lucrative contract in 1930 with Sparta Prague and subsequently became the first Belgian professional player. With Sparta, Braine won Czechoslovak First League titles in 1932 and 1936, as well as 1935's Mitropa Cup. He finished as top scorer twice with Sparta Prague. Before the 1934 World Cup, Braine had received an offer of 100,000 Koruna from the Czechoslovak FA to become a citizen of Czechoslovakia which he refused. Afterwards, Czechoslovakia lost the final game to Italy. He came back to Beerschot in 1937 and won the Championship twice again. This time, he played in the 1938 World Cup. In 1943, Braine was transferred to C.S. La Forestoise as a defender for one season, a team that had just been promoted the year before to the first division, because of the War.

Wirfs-Brock (born 1953 in Portland, Oregon) is an American software engineer and consultant in object-oriented programming and object-oriented design, the founder of the information technology consulting firm Wirfs-Brock Associates, and inventor of Responsibility-Driven Design, the first behavioral approach to object design. Wirfs-Brock holds a B.A. in computer and information science and psychology from the University of Oregon.Online C.V She worked at Tektronix for 15 years as a software engineer before moving on to Instantiations (founded by her husband Allen Wirfs-Brock), which was acquired by Digitalk which merged with Parc Place Systems to become ParcPlace- Digitalk in 1995. She was the Chief Technologist for the professional services organization of a Smalltalk language vendor. She holds a U.S. Patent #4,635,049 \\"Apparatus for Presenting Image Information for Display Graphically\\" together with Warren Dodge. Wirfs-Brock first coined the \\"-driven\\" meme in an OOPSLA 1989 paper she co-authored with Brian Wilkerson. Before that time, the most prevalent way of structuring objects was based on entity-relationship modeling ideas (popularized by James Rumbaugh, Steve Mellor and Sally Shlaer). She wrote about object role stereotypes in 1992 in a Smalltalk Report article and this influenced the UML notion of stereotypes. Her invention of the conversational (two-column) form of use cases was then popularized by Larry Constantine. Most of the more recent \\"driven\\" design approaches acknowledge their roots and the influence of RDD, of which class- responsibility-collaboration cards are one popular technique. She was the design columnist for IEEE Software until December 2009.

They are a kind of basket, woven and fitted to the shape of a foot. Bast shoes are an obsolete traditional footwear of the forest areas of Northern Europe, formerly worn by poorer members of the Finnic peoples, Balts, Russians and Belarussians. They were easy to manufacture, but not durable. Similar shoes have also been made of strings of birchbark in more northern areas where bast is not readily available. Bast shoes have been worn since prehistoric times.

The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time, the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region, before a new dose sends it higher again. The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum, although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant. It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour, the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body, so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping. In a medicine that is administered periodically, the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing.

Upon its completion in 1889, the large wooden structure boasted the second largest stage in the United States. The New York Opera House was the largest stage at the time. History The Louisville theater was built with materials from the nearby dismantled remains of the Southern Exposition building, which was located just a block away. It contained over 2,000 electric lights, could seat 3,072, and had a stage was 90 feet across and 60 feet deep. The theater opened on September 23, 1889.The Encyclopedia of Louisville (John E. Kleber) pages 31-32 The theater was operated by philanthropist William Norton, Jr., who went by the name Daniel Quilp, a villain in Charles Dickens' novel The Old Curiosity Shop. He promoted the auditorium with the phrase \\"Only for great attractions\\". Norton also used the theatre as a place for the poor to collect handouts once a week. Upon his death he willed that his theatre workers receive three months' salary. He also gave 900,000 dollars of his estate to the Louisville Baptists' Orphans' Home. On March 6, 1890, the highly acclaimed opera singer Adelina Patti gave her first performance of a three-day stop in Louisville during a six-city tour in the United States.The Atlanta Constitution February 7, 1890, page 5 Patti in Louisville The theater began having significant success following her performance. The summer season was the most productive. Many of the day's great actors and political figures performed there, including Edwin Booth, Lawrence Barrett, John Philip Sousa, Theodore Roosevelt, and Booker T. Washington. The theater was part of a large entertainment complex that included a bike riding park, a man-made lagoon, a promenade, and a ten- thousand-seat outdoor amphitheatre used for fireworks shows, including The Last Days of Pompei and Americus. After Norton's death in 1903, no buyers could be found for the Auditorium or surrounding attractions. The last event, the Children's Floral Ball, was held on April 30, 1904. Later, the site was purchased for $900 and razed on May 5, 1905, only 16 years after its completion.

They may previously have lived around Merowe but in recent centuries have settled in the Butana region between the Atbara River and the Blue Nile. Towns where the Shukria live include Halfa Aljadeeda, Kassala, Alfao, Khashm el Girba, and Tamboul. The Shukria are Sunni Muslims. They speak an Arabic dialect called Shukriyya. Ancestry They claim descent from the Quraysh tribe, and their ancestor is Abdullah Aljawad bin Jaafar Altayar. There is some indication that they are linked with the Arabian tribe of Yashkur, a branch of Qays  øAylƒÅn. All of the Shukria claim descent from a figure from the early seventeenth century called Tuaym, or his son Sha‚Äôa el Din walad Tuaym. The family name of the principal branch of the clan is Abu Sin, named after Awad el Kerim ‚ÄúAbu Sin‚Äù (Father of the Teeth), from his prominent large teeth. Gedaref city, in the centre of Shukria country, was formerly known as Suk Abu Sin. The main branches of the Shukriya are the Nailab (including the Abu Sin, descended from Nail, son of Sha'a el Din); the Nurab (descended from Nur, brother of Sha'a el Din); the Galahib (descended from Gilhayb, said to be Sha'a el Din's great grandfather); the Kadurab, Adlanab, Hasanab, (all descended from Awad el Kerim but separate from the Abu Sin); and various clans not descended from Sha'a el Din - the Aishab, Shadarna, Mihaydat, Ritamat, Ofasa, Nizawin and Noaima. Early expansion The Shukria had a blood feud with the Rikabia and Batahin tribes. In around 1779 the Rikabia suggested to Badi wad Rajab, regent of Sennar, that the Shukria should be made to pay tribute and offered to assist him in bringing them under his authority. Badi sent a Hamaj army with Rikabia reinforcements against the Shukria. According to their accounts, the Shukria only had twelve horses, and only seven of them armored, but still managed to defeat the Hamaj force, capturing over two hundred war horses and their riders‚Äô equipment. The men of the Rikabia tribe were all killed, and the women taken as wives by the Shukria. When Badi wad Rajab heard of this he was furious, but Sultan Adlan promised the Shukria royal pardon if they would come and swear fealty to him. The Shukria chiefs, led by Sheikh Abu Ali, came on his promise and were given gifts as a sign of royal favor. Badi then invited them to Abu Haraz, where they were treacherously murdered by members of the Abu el Kaylik family whose relatives had fallen in the battle. Sheikh Abu Ali and many of his sons were killed; Abu Sin was his surviving son. In 1784 Abu Sin allied with the Abdallabis to take Arbaji. In 1795, a battle took place between the Shukria under Abu Sin and the Batahin at Shambat. The Batahin were nearly wiped out, but Abu Sin was murdered after the battle by a Batahi prisoner. These battles assured the Shukria an important role in the political structures of the Sennar sultanate. They made marriage alliances with the Funj rulers and were given a large area of the Buttana to settle. Abu Sin encouraged his people to settle widely with grants of land, and increasing use of the camel promoted trade between settlements. After the Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820‚Äì1824) the Shukria, under Abu Sin's son Ahmad Bey ibn Awad became one of the government's most trusted allies. He was given the title Bey and controlled the Gezira and lands to the East. The Shukria were rewarded with extensive land grants and taxation privileges. The Mahdiya Awad al- Karim Pasha Ahmad abu Sin (died 1886), notable of the Shukriya Arabs; appointed nazir (head of a tribe) of the Shukriya in 1872 and 1882 and governor of Khartoum in 1884 During the Mahdist War the Shukria remained loyal to the Egyptians. Following the defeat of an Egyptian force by the Mahdi at Musallamia on 3 May 1882, Carl Christian Giegler Pasha assembled 2,500 Shukria fighters loyal to the Egyptians and led them into battle against the Mahdist commander Sheikh Taha and defeated him at Abu Haraz on 5 May. As the Mahdist state consolidated, the nazir (chief) of the Shukriya, Awad al-Karim Pasha Ahmad abu Sin, was sent to prison, where he died in 1886. The great outbreak of rinderpest affected eastern Sudan from 1889, and together with the harsh taxation and demands from the Mahdist Emir of Kassala, Hamed Wad Ali, this led to famine. The Shukria tribe was greatly reduced by starvation, and the areas around Kassala it had once cultivated returned to desert. Some of the Shukriya were displaced towards the south and the eastern borders of Sudan, while new people moved into the Butana. A number of West Africans settled around Gedarif. After 1900 During the period of Anglo-Egyptian rule the Shukria regained much of their land and social standing in the Butana. Various agreements were reached with other tribes about water and grazing rights and new water basins were dug. Most importantly, until after World War II only the Shukriya were allowed to dig new wells. The nomadic life has gradually declined since World War II. Today the Shukriya live primarily in rural villages and settlements situated along small waterways. These villages are of two different types: large villages, and the more common style of villages strung out along the Nile River in a continuous chain of closely adjacent huts.

W. Wilson Company of The Bronx, New York, a publisher of reference books, that appears every month except December. Current Biography contains profiles of people in the news and includes politicians, athletes, businessmen, and entertainers. Published since 1940, the articles are annually collected into bound volumes called Current Biography Yearbook. A December issue of the magazine is not published because the staff works on the final cumulative volume for the year. Articles in the bound volumes correct any mistakes that may have appeared in the magazine and may include additional relevant information about the subject that became available since publication of the original article. The work is a standard reference source in American libraries and the publisher keeps in print the older volumes. Wilson also issues cumulative indexes to the set, and an online version is available as a subscription database. Current Biography profiles are written by the Wilson Company's in-house staff. They are typically produced by consulting previously published press accounts and occasionally by conducting interviews with the subjects. Running from 2,000 to 5,000 words, articles usually are accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of the subject, a mailing address for the subject, and a short bibliography. Between 15 and 20 profiles are included in each monthly issue. Obituaries are regularly printed of those previously profiled. They briefly summarize the life of the subject and add details occurring subsequent to the original profile. The entire series is available through the company's WilsonWeb on-line service, which many public libraries subscribe to. Unlike other Wilson publications, when quoting, Current Biography cited authors, publication titles, and publication dates. These sources are not included in each entry's further reading section, which included page numbers but not authors. Current Biography was a standard biological reference work at accredited American library schools in 1979. Current Biography Yearbook provided short obituary notices from people of all nationalities. Its first cumulated index, in 1973, aggregated and replaced the decennial indexes contained in the 1950, 1960, and 1970 Current Biography Yearbooks. It listed names alphabetically with references to the relevant Current Biography issue or yearbook. In 2003, the H.W. Wilson Company began publishing an annual sister volume, Current Biography International Yearbook, which focuses on people living outside the United States. This series was discontinued after publication of the 2007 volume. Articles in Current Biography are often used and listed as supplemental material in obituaries that appear in major media outlets. Contributors Notable contributors who have written for Current Biography include Cullen Thomas, the author of the prison memoir, Brother One Cell (2007); Mike Batistick, the author of the play, Ponies, which was produced Off-Broadway in 2003; Albert Rolls, the author of the books, Stephen King: A Biography (2008) and \\"Thomas Pynchon: The Demon in the Text\\" (2019) among others; and Yongsoo Park, author of the novels, Boy Genius (2001) and Las Cucarachas (2003), and the memoir The Art of Eating Bitter (2018), and writer-director of the independent feature film, Free Country (1996). Charles Moritz served as editor-in-chief of Current Biography from 1957 until 1992. He was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Judith Graham and then Elizabeth A. Schick. From 1998 to 2011, the editor-in-chief was Clifford Thompson, winner of a 2013 Whiting Writers' Award for nonfiction for Love for Sale and Other Essays and author of Twin of Blackness: A Memoir as well as a novel, Signifying Nothing.

Brother Leo crouches to our right. :For the Swedish singer Ola Svensson also known as Brother Leo, see Ola Svensson Brother Leo (died c. 1270) was the favorite disciple, secretary and confessor of St Francis of Assisi. The dates of his birth and of his becoming a Franciscan are not known; a native of Assisi, he was one of the small group of most trusted companions of the saint during his last years.McCloskey ofm, Pat. \\"Helping Brother Leo\\", Franciscan Media Life Although not one of the original twelve companions of St Francis, Leo was one of the first to join him after the approbation of the first Rule of the Friars Minor (1209-1210) and perhaps was already a priest.

Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010 and secretary of the saint, and from about 1220 up to the time of Francis's death Leo was his constant companion. He was with the \\"Poverello\\" when the latter retired to Fonte Colombo near Rieti in 1223 to re-write the rule of the order and he accompanied him on his subsequent journey to Rome to seek its approval. The year following Leo was with the saint on Mount La Verna when Francis received the stigmata. Francis called him \\"Frate Pecorello di Dio\\" because of Leo's simplicity and tenderness. Leo nursed his master during his last illness.Robinson, Paschal. \\"Brother Leo.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 December 2019 Leo had entered deeply into the bitter disappointments experienced by the saint during the last few years of his life, and soon after Francis's death he came into conflict with those whom he considered traitors to the Poverello and his ideal of poverty. After Francis's death Leo took a leading part in the opposition to Elias of Cortona. Having protested against the collection of money for the erection of the Basilica of San Francesco, it was Leo who broke in pieces the marble box which Elias had set up for offertories for the completion of the basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this outrage on St Francis's dearest disciple consolidated the opposition to Elias. Leo was the leader in the early stages of the struggle in the order for the maintenance of St Francis's ideas on strict poverty. He thereupon retired to some hermitage of the order. Leo assisted at Saint Clara's deathbed, 1253; after suffering many persecutions from the dominant party in the order he died at the Porziuncola in extreme old age, and his remains are buried in the Basilica of St. Francis. Much that is known concerning him is collected by Paul Sabatier in the \\"Introduction\\" to the Speculum perfectionis (The Mirror of Perfection). It was likely compiled after his death based on stories that he told and on his writings.  Brother Leo in Literature  Brother Leo figures prominently in Nikos Kazantzakis' book Saint Francis, or God's Little Pauper. In this book, Leo is portrayed as Francis' constant companion. Leo is utterly faithful and steadfast, and yet struggles with his own shortcomings while following Francis.

The presence of high levels of fructose (a sugar) is normal in the semen and this comes almost entirely from the seminal vesicles. The seminal vesicles, major contributors to ejaculate volume, render semen pH basic. Thus, low fructose may indicate problems in the prostatic pathway, while low semen pH may indicate problems related to the seminal vesicles. Obstruction of the seminal vesicles results in low semen volumes since they normally produce 70% of the seminal plasma.

However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called at the behest of the Prime Minister before the five-year period elapses. The number of constituencies or electoral divisions is not permanently fixed by law, but is declared by the Prime Minister prior to each general election pursuant to the , which governs the conduct of elections to Parliament, taking into account recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee. For the 2020 general election, there are 93 seats in Parliament organised into 14 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 17 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each SMC returns one Member of Parliament while each GRC returns between three and six MPs, at least one of whom must be from the Malay, Indian or other minority communities. A group of persons wishing to stand for election in a GRC must all be members of the same political party, or a group of independent candidates. The voting age in Singapore is 21 years. The election process begins when the President, acting on Cabinet's advice, issues a writ of election addressed to the returning officer. On nomination day, the returning officer and his or her representatives will be present at designated nomination centres between 11:00 am and 12:00 noon to receive prospective candidates' nomination papers, and political donation certificates certifying that they have complied with the requirements of the . A person intending to contest in a GRC as a minority candidate must also submit a certificate confirming that he or she is a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. In addition, between the date of the writ of election and 12:00 noon on nomination day, candidates must lodge with the returning officer a deposit equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. For the 2015 general election, the amount of the deposit was $14,500. At the close of the nomination period, where there is only one candidate in an SMC or one group of candidates in a GRC standing nominated, the election is uncontested and the returning officer will declare that the candidate has or the group of candidates have been elected. Where there is more than one candidate in an SMC or more than one group of candidates in a GRC, the election is adjourned for a poll to be taken. The returning officer issues a notice of contested election which states when polling day will be; and information such as the names of the candidates, their proposers and seconders, the symbols allocated to candidates which will be printed on ballot papers, and the locations of polling stations. Candidates can only mount election campaigns from after the close of nomination up to the day before the eve of polling day. No campaigning is permitted on the eve of polling day itself, which is known as \\"cooling-off day\\". Candidates can advertise on the Internet, conduct house-to- house visits, distribute pamphlets, put up banners and posters, and hold election rallies. Political parties fielding at least six candidates are allocated airtime for two pre-recorded party political broadcasts on radio and television, one on the day following nomination day and the other on cooling- off day. The amount of airtime granted depends on the number of candidates each party is fielding. The maximum amount which a candidate or his or her election agent can pay or incur for an election campaign is $3.50 for each elector in an SMC, or $3.50 for each elector divided by the number of candidates in the group standing for election in a GRC. Polling day at a general election is a public holiday, and voting is compulsory. Unless the returning officer decides otherwise, polling stations are open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm Voters must go to the polling stations assigned to them. After the poll closes, the presiding officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may also affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be opened and the ballots counted. A candidate or his counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if the difference between the number of votes for the candidate or group of candidates with the most votes and the number of votes of any other candidate or group of candidate is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as president. If not, the returning officer states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted. The most recent general election was held on 10 July 2020. The People's Action Party was returned to power to form the Government with 83 seats, while the Workers' Party of Singapore secured ten seats by winning in Aljunied GRC, Hougang SMC and Sengkang GRC. Composition and term of Parliament The Parliament of Singapore is unicameral and consists of three types of Members of Parliament: elected Members of Parliament (MPs), Non- constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs), and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs)., Article 39(1). Of these, MPs are chosen by universal suffrage or popular election under a \\"first-past-the-post\\" system, while NCMPs are chosen from among the candidates of political parties not forming the Government. Demarcation of the boundaries of the various constituencies in the 2020 general election (click on the image for a larger version) The maximum duration of each Parliament is five years from the date of its first sitting. If Parliament has not been dissolved before that period has elapsed, it is automatically dissolved by operation of law.Constitution, Art. 65(4). However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called at the behest of the Prime Minister, who is entitled to advise the President to do so by a proclamation published in the Government Gazette. The President is not obliged to proclaim that Parliament is dissolved unless he is satisfied that the Prime Minister commands the confidence of a majority of MPs.Constitution, Art. 65(3). The President is required to dissolve Parliament if the office of Prime Minister is vacant and he is satisfied in his personal discretion that a reasonable period has elapsed since the office was vacated and there is no MP likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs: Art. 65(2). Once Parliament has been dissolved, a general election must be held within three months.Constitution, Art. 66.

After all claims and objections have been dealt with, the registers are certified as correct.PEA, ss. 13 and 17. Election procedure =Issuance of writ of election= The election process begins when the President, acting on Cabinet's advice, issues a writ of election addressed to the returning officer, who is the official responsible for overseeing the election.PEA, s. 24(1). The writ specifies the date when the nomination of candidates is to be taken (which must not be earlier than five days nor later than one month from the date of the writ), and the places of nomination.PEA, s. 24(2). The returning officer issues a notice stating that the writ of election has been issued by the President and stipulating the date, time and places for nomination of candidates, the documents that candidates must submit on nomination day, and the amount of the deposit that must be lodged. This notice must be issued at least four clear days before nomination day.PEA, s. 25. Where an act is required to be done a specified number of clear days before or after a specified date, at least that number of days must intervene between the day on which the act is done and that date: compare the , Order 3 rule 2(4). =Application for minority certificate= Any person who wishes to participate in an election as a minority candidate in a GRC must, after the date of notice of the writ of election and at least two clear days before nomination day, apply to the Malay Community Committee or the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee for a certificate stating that he or she is a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community.PEA, s. 27A(5).

Such certificates are conclusive as to the facts they certify: s. 27A(7). =Political donations= Under the Political Donations Act, (\\"PDA\\"). candidates for general elections may only receive political donations from Singapore citizens who are at least 21 years old, or Singapore-controlled companies which carry on business wholly or mainly in Singapore.PDA, s. 14(1)(a) read with s. 2(1) (definition of permissible donor). The receipt of anonymous donations is prohibited,PDA, s. 14(1)(b). except for anonymous donations totalling less than $5,000 received during a period starting with the date 12 months before the date when the candidate makes the declaration referred to below and ending with nomination day.PDA, ss. 14(2) and 14(4)(b). After the date of the writ of election and at least two clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence.PDA, ss. 18(1)(a), 18(2) and 18(6).

If this paperwork is in order, the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.PDA, s. 18(4). A political donation certificate is conclusive as to the facts it certifies: s. 18(5). =Nomination= A sign pointing to the nomination hall at Greenridge Secondary School in Bukit Panjang, the nomination centre for Bukit Panjang SMC and Holland‚ÄìBukit Timah GRC at the 2011 general election On nomination day, the returning officer and his or her representatives will be present at designated nomination centres between 11:00 am and 12:00 noon to receive prospective candidates' nomination papers, political donation certificates, and minority certificates (if required).PEA, ss. 27(3)(b), 27B(3) and 29(1). Each nomination paper must contain a statement signed by the prospective candidate that he or she consents to the nomination; must include a statutory declaration by the prospective candidate that he or she is qualified to be elected; and must be signed by a proposer, a seconder, and four or more persons as assentors, each of whom must be a person on the register of electors for the electoral division in which the person seeks election.PEA, ss. 27(2) and 27B(2). Since the 2011 Presidential election, candidates are also recommended to submit their recent passport photo with a size of no more than 2 MB and 400 x 514 pixels, to the Election Department as photographs are printed to the ballot paper for better identification. In addition, between the date of the writ of election and 12:00 noon on nomination day, candidates are required to lodge with the returning officer the election deposit equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500.PEA, s. 28(1). The exact amount of the deposit is specified in the notice of the writ of election issued by the returning officer. For the 2020 general election, the amount of the deposit was $13,500. A candidate who subsequently polls more than one- eighth of the total number of valid votes in the electoral division he or she contests but who is not elected will have the deposit returned; otherwise, the deposit is forfeited and paid into the Consolidated Fund (the Government's main bank account). For GRCs, the election deposit is multiplied by the number of candidates in a team; for Presidential election, the election deposit is tripled.PEA, s. 28(4A). Nomination papers and certificates must be personally delivered to the returning officer in duplicate by the person seeking nomination. The person's proposer, seconder and at least four assentors must also be present in person;PEA, s. 29(2). any authorized proxy representatives may also allow to represent candidates in-person if the candidate is unable to come on person such as illness. Each nomination paper is then posted outside the place of nomination;PEA, s. 29(3). and candidates, their proposers, seconders, assentors and one other person appointed by each candidate to be present may examine the nomination papers of other candidates which have been received for that electoral division.PEA, s. 29(4). Candidates may object to other candidates' nomination papers on the following grounds only:PEA, s. 30(1). *the description of the candidate is insufficient to identify him or her; *the nomination paper does not comply with or was not delivered in accordance with the requirements of the law; *it is apparent from the contents of the nomination paper that the candidate is not capable of being elected an MP; *the requirements for elections in a GRC have not been complied with (for instance, the candidates are not all from the same political party or there is no minority candidate);PEA, s. 30(2)(b). and/or *that a candidate has not lodged the required deposit. People's Action Party supporters at the Bukit Panjang SMC and Holland‚ÄìBukit Timah GRC nomination centre The returning officer may himself or herself lodge objections.PEA, s. 30(4). All objections must be made between 11:00 am and 12:30 pm on nomination day.PEA, s. 30(2)(a). The returning officer must then, with the least possible delay, decide on the validity of the objections made and inform candidates of his or her decision. If any objection is allowed, the grounds of the decision must be provided.PEA, s. 30(5). The rejection of any objection is final and cannot be challenged in court, but any objections that are allowed may be reversed on application to an election judge.PEA, s. 30(6). Each candidate may only be nominated in one electoral division at a general election, and only nominated once in an electoral division. Multiple nominations are void.PEA, s. 32A. At the close of the nomination period, where there is more than one candidate in an SMC or more than one group of candidates in a GRC, the election is adjourned for a poll to be taken,PEA, ss. 34(1)(a) and 34A(1)(a). otherwise, the election is uncontested and the returning officer will declare that the candidate has or the group of candidates have been elected.PEA, s. 33. The returning officer issues a notice of contested election which states when polling day will be (which must not be earlier than the 10th day nor later than the 56th day after publication of the notice); and information such as the names of the candidates, their proposers and seconders, the symbols allocated to candidates which will be printed on ballot papers, and the locations of polling stations.;PEA, ss. 34 and 34A. =Campaigning= Election agents On or before nomination day, every candidate must declare to the returning officer the name of one person who will act as his or her election agent.PEA, ss. 62(1) and (3).

Committing an act of bribery involves doing any one of a number of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him or her for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or procuring an office or employment. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his or her vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as an MP in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he or she will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement.PEA, s. 60. *False statements. It is an offence to make or publish, before or during an election for the purpose of affecting the return of a candidate, any false statement of fact relating to the personal character or conduct of the candidate;PEA, s. 61(1)(d). or, in order to promote or procure the election of a particular candidate, to make any false statement about the withdrawal of another candidate.PEA, s. 61(1)(e). *Personation. Personation is committed when a person applies for a ballot paper in the name of some other person, whether living, dead or fictitious; or, having already voted at an election, applies for another ballot paper to vote again.PEA, s. 57(1). *Treating.

Election advertising All election posters must bear the election department's stamp or chop if it is a legal poster approved by the election department. =Election surveys and exit polls= Between the day the writ of election is issued and the close of all polling stations on polling day, it is an offence to publish the results of any election survey, which is defined as an opinion survey of how electors will vote at an election, or of the preferences of electors concerning any candidate or group of candidates or any political party or issue with which an identifiable candidate or group of candidates is associated at an election.PEA, ss. 78C(1) and (4). It is also an offense to publish on polling day before all the polling stations have closed any exit poll, that is, \\"any statement relating to the way in which voters have voted at the election where that statement is (or might reasonably be taken to be) based on information given by voters after they have voted\\", or \\"any forecast as to the result of the election which is (or might reasonably be taken to be) based on information so given\\".PEA, s. 78D(1). The penalty for both of these offences is a fine of up to $1,500, imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.PEA, ss. 78C(2) and 78D(2). On 20 June 2013, the police, acting on directions of the Attorney-General's Chambers, gave Singapore Press Holdings (\\"SPH\\") and Warren Fernandez, respectively the publisher and editor of The Straits Times, a warning in lieu of prosecution for having published a voters' poll in the newspaper on 10 January. As this was the day after the writ of election for the 2013 by-election in Punggol East was issued, the publication of the poll contravened the ban against publishing election surveys during the blackout period. SPH accepted that an \\"internal lapse\\" had occurred.; . =Internet advertising= Two forms of political advertising on the Internet are permitted during election time. First, during the election period ‚Äì that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling dayPEA, s. 78A(3). ‚Äì political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications,Electronic media application is defined in reg. 2 of the Parliamentary Elections (Election Advertising) Regulations (Cap. 218, Rg. 3, 2011 Rev. Ed.), archived from the original on 10 May 2011 (\\"Election Advertising Regulations\\") and issued under the PEA, s. 78A, as including \\"(a) any banner, logo or small icon that is capable of being posted on any social networking service, micro-blog, website or other form of electronic media; or (b) any other software or programme used in connection with a computer or other electronic device and which may be used for communicating or transmitting election advertising among users in any format, such as but not limited to digital banners, RSS feed readers, widgets, mobile applications and other instant messaging software or programmes\\". and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook).Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 4(1). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.Election Advertising Regulations, regs. 4(3) and (3A). However, the Internet may not be used to publish the following:Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 4(4). *Election surveys. *Appeals for money or other property in association with a representation that it will be applied for the objects or activities of any political party or for the promotion of any candidate or group of candidates. *Any facility enabling members of the public to search for unlawful election advertising. *Party political films not permitted by the Films Act. (\\"FA\\"). Secondly, when candidates wish to publish election advertising on the Internet during the campaign period ‚Äì that is, the period from the closure of the place of nomination on nomination day after the election is adjourned to enable a poll to be taken, to the start of the eve of polling dayElection Advertising Regulations, reg. 2. ‚Äì they must provide to the returning officer, within 12 hours after the start of the period, declarations containing information on all the online platforms the advertising has appeared on in that time. Subsequently, a similar declaration must be provided before election advertising is published on such platforms.Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 6. Individuals who are Singapore citizens may publish on the Internet material that amounts to election advertising without having to comply with the above regulations so long as they do so personally and not at the direction of another person or on that person's behalf, and do not receive any benefit for doing so.Parliamentary Elections (Corrupt Practices ‚Äì Exempt Circumstances and Activities) Order 2011 (S 131/2011) dated 14 March 2011, archived from the original on 10 May 2011, made pursuant to the PEA, s. 61(6)(e). =Political films and broadcasts, and campaign recordings= The Films Act defines a party political film as a film \\"(a) which is an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore, or any branch of such party or body; or (b) which is made by any person and directed towards any political end in Singapore\\".FA, s. 2(1). A film is regarded as being \\"directed towards a political end in Singapore\\" if it:FA, s. 2(2). In general, it is an offence for importing, reproducing, distributing or exhibiting any party political film, with a penalty of up to $100,000 fine or imprisonment of up to two years or both.FA, s. 33.

In addition, during the period starting with the day when the writ of election is issued and ending with the start of the eve of polling day,Paragraph 2 (definition of election period) of the Films (Election Campaign Recordings ‚Äì Exemption) Notification 2011 (S 133/2011) dated 14 March 2011, archived from the original on 10 May 2011 (\\"Campaign Recordings Notification\\"), issued under the FA, s. 40(2). election campaign recordings are exempted from the requirement that films must be submitted to the Board of Film Censors for review,Campaign Recordings Notification, para. 4. and may be published on and distributed through the Internet.Campaign Recordings Notification, paras. 5 and 6. Such recordings are unmodified live recordings of lawful performances, assemblies or processions held in connection with election activities which do not depict the proceedings in a dramatic way or consist of unscripted or \\"reality\\" type programmes.Campaign Recordings Notification, para. 2 (definition of election campaign recording). Election activity is any activity \\"(a) that takes place within any election period; and (b) that is for the purpose of promoting or procuring the electoral success of one or more identifiable political parties, candidates or groups of candidates at any election or otherwise enhancing the standing of any such political parties, candidates or groups of candidates with the electorate in connection with any election\\": ibid. Posters of the People's Action Party (top) and Singapore Democratic Party hung from a lamppost on Clementi Road in Holland‚ÄìBukit Timah GRC during the 2011 general election Under content codes issued by the Media Development Authority, political advertising is not permitted on radio or television.Paragraph 31 of the Radio Advertising and Sponsorship Code dated 31 March 2011, archived from the original on 10 May 2011; and para. 27 of the TV Advertising Code dated 28 February 2011, archived from the original on 10 May 2011, which state: \\"[Unless permitted by law,] no advertisement may be inserted by or on behalf of any body whose objectives are wholly or mainly of a political nature, and no advertisements may be directed towards any political end.\\" (The phrase in brackets appears only in the radio code.) Instead the Authority arranges for pre-recorded party political broadcasts to be made on radio and TV, one on the day after nomination day and the other on the eve of polling day.Paragraph 3 of the General Election 2011 Party Political Broadcasts guideline dated 23 April 2011, archived from the original on 10 May 2011 (\\"Political Broadcasts guideline\\"). Only political parties fielding at least six candidates at an election are eligible to make a broadcast; independent candidates may not do so.Political Broadcasts guideline, paras. 1 and 2. Party political broadcasts must be delivered by candidates,Political Broadcasts guideline, para. 14. and each broadcast must consist of a single script in each of the four official languages of Singapore:Constitution, Art. 153A. Malay, Mandarin, Tamil and English.Political Broadcasts guideline, paras. 5 and 11. The duration of the permitted broadcast depends on the number of candidates each party is fielding, and ranges from two and a half minutes for a party fielding six or seven candidates, to 13 minutes for one fielding between 89 and 93 candidates.Political Broadcasts guideline, para. 4. The number of candidates fielded also determines the order of broadcasts, with the broadcast of the party fielding the smallest number of candidates on first and that of the party fielding the largest number last.Political Broadcasts guideline, paras. 16 and 17. If two or more political parties have an equal number of candidates, the broadcast order is decided by a draw carried out in the presence of the Chief Executive Officer of the Media Development Authority and the parties' authorized representatives: para. 18. The 2020 election introduced another \\"one-off specially arranged\\" televised series, \\"Constituency Political Broadcast\\", which are pre-recorded broadcasts featuring candidates airtime to persuade voters on television, as a replacement on physical rallies which was disallowed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Like Party Political Broadcasts, Constituency Political Broadcast allows the use of four official languages but can be used altogether instead of a single language, and any candidates are eligible, including independents. The duration for the broadcast was three minutes times the number of candidates and the alphabetical order of the constituencies determines the order of broadcast; each segment will feature either one GRC or two SMCs before commercials. =Banners and posters= Once nomination proceedings have ended on nomination day, the returning officer issues to each candidate, group of candidates or their election agents a permit authorising banners and posters to be displayed. The permit specifies the maximum number of banners and posters that may be displayed, any restrictions as to the places where or manner in which they must not be displayed, and the period after polling day within which they must be removed.Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 10. All banners and posters must have a stamp bearing the returning officer's official mark on the bottom right-hand corner.Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 12(1). They may not be displayed within of any polling station or any shorter distance as the returning officer may specify.Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 18. Among other things, it is an offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 monthsPEA, s. 78(4). to alter, deface, destroy, obliterate or remove any banner or poster,Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 23(a). or to display a banner or poster in such a way as to obscure any banner or poster already displayed.Election Advertising Regulations, reg. 23(b) read with reg. 17. =Printed documents= All election advertising contained in printed documents must bear on their face or, if there is more than one side of printed matter, on the first or last pages, the names and addresses of their printers, publishers, and the persons for whom the advertising was published. Failure to comply with this requirement amounts to a corrupt practice and is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, along with the election disqualification (see Election expenses, and illegal and corrupt practices).PEA, ss. 61(1)(c)(i), 61(1)(iii) and 61(2). Election meetings Workers' Party rally at the 2011 general election in Serangoon Stadium on 29 April 2011 For election meetings such as rallies to be held, permits must be applied for from the Commissioner of PolicePublic Order (Election Meetings) Regulations 2009 (S 486/2009), archived from the original on 9 August 2011, issued pursuant to the . at the Police Elections Liaison Office in the Police Cantonment Complex.. The dates and venues for the meetings are fixed by the police,The venues used for the 2011 general elections are set out in . and candidates may apply for permits on a first- come-first-served basis the day before each meeting date. Although meetings can normally be held at Speakers' Corner without applying for a police permit, this privilege does not apply during election periods.See the PEA, s. 80A(2), the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (Revocation) Order 2011 (S 207/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Revocation) Order 2011 (S 208/2011). Following the election, Speakers' Corner's status as a no-permit-required zone was restored by the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2011 (S 249/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2011 (S 250/2011). =Polling day= Cooling-off day Introduced in 2010, legal changes were assessed on the eve of polling day for elections where campaigning and election advertising is prohibited under the Presidential Elections Act and the Parliamentary Elections Act, though the following activities are exceptions:PEA, s. 78B, inserted by the . *distributing a book or promoting the sale of a book for not less than its commercial value if the book was planned to be published regardless of whether there was to be an election; *publishing news relating to an election in a licensed newspaper in any medium or in a licensed radio or television broadcast; *conveying one's own political views on a non-commercial basis to another individual by telephonic or electronic transmission; *election advertising lawfully published or displayed before the start of the eve of polling day on the Internet which is not changed after its publication or display; and *the continued lawful display of posters and banners already displayed before the start of the eve of polling day. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong justified the changes as enabling voters to think dispassionately about the candidates' stands on issues raised, and reducing the chance of public disorder;; see also Polling A poll card issued for the 2011 general election A form showing the layouts of the fronts of ballot papers used during general elections in SMCs (top) and GRCsPEA, 1st Sch., Form 12, read with s. 40(3A). Badges, favours, flags, rosettes, symbols, sets of colours, advertisements, handbills, placards, posters and replica voting papers may not be carried, worn, used or displayed by any person or on any vehicle as political propaganda,PEA, s. 77. The penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 or jail of up to 12 months: s. 77(4). although candidates may wear replicas of the symbols allotted to them for election purposes.PEA, s. 77(2). In addition, holding election meetingsPEA, s. 80A(1). and canvassing are not permitted on the day before polling day and polling day itself. Canvassing involves trying to persuade a person to vote or not to vote in a particular way, or visiting a voter for an election-related purpose at home or at his or her workplace.PEA, s. 80(1). A person is presumed to have been canvassing if he enters or is seen at more than two houses or workplaces of voters in the same polling district other than his own home or workplace, unless the contrary is proved: s. 80(5). The penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 and jail of up to 12 months: s. 80(2). It is also an offence to exercise undue influence on any person at or near a polling station, for instance, by trying to find out the identity of any person entering a polling station, recording voters' particulars, and waiting outside or loitering within of polling stations.PEA, s. 82(1). The penalty is a fine of up to $2,000 or jail of up to 12 months or both: s. 82(2). Voters receive poll cards informing them of the polling stations where they can cast their votes in person. Polling day at a general election is a public holiday,PEA, s. 35. and voting is compulsory.PEA, s. 43. Unless the returning officer decides otherwise, polling stations are open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm on polling day.PEA, s. 39(3). To vote, voters must go to the polling stations assigned to them.PEA, s. 39(1). Applying for a ballot paper or voting in the name of someone else, or attempting to vote more than once, amounts to the offence of personation.PEA, s. 57(1). The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or jail of up to three years or both: s. 61(1)(i). If a person claiming to be a voter named in the electoral register turns up at a polling station after someone also claiming to be that voter has already voted, the second person is permitted to cast what is called a \\"tendered vote\\" using a ballot paper of a different colour after taking an oath to confirm his identity.PEA, s. 46. Overseas voting Introduced in 2005 but not used until the 2006 elections, voters are also allowed to cast their votes aboard outside Singapore at any one of the ten designated overseas polling stations (those being Dubai, London, Tokyo, Beijing, Washington D.C., Hong Kong, Shanghai, San Francisco, New York and Canberra) in addition to the eligibilities as a local voter, an additional criteria for eligibility as an overseas voter is that the voter must provide both a recent contact address (Local Contact Address (LCA)) and an overseas address on the voter's residence registered with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), and has resided in Singapore for an aggregate of at least 30 days during the 3-year period before the cut-off date. Polling stations open based on the times from the Singapore time zone (UTC+08:00), from 8 am to 8 pm. Similar to votes cast locally, voting is also compulsory and can vote only once. After voting ended, the ballot boxes are sealed and are transported back to Singapore; the counting is conducted a few days after the election ended and once all the boxes are safely returned, though the counts of the votes do not affect the eventual outcome as the overseas electorate is much smaller, ranging from 558 during the debutPress Release: Certification of Registers of Electors, 2006 (PDF) ‚Äì Election Department, 17 February 2006. to 6,570 in the recent 2020 election. Results After the poll closes, the presiding officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may also affix their own seals to the ballot boxes.PEA, s. 48(2). The same process is applied to other documents used in the poll, namely, unused and spoilt ballot papers, marked copies of the register of electors, counterfoils of ballot papers and the tendered votes list: s. 48(1). The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be opened and the ballots counted.PEA, s. 48(3). A polling station may be designated a counting place as well: s. 48(4). According to the guidance issued to voters by the Elections Department, votes should be marked with a cross.PEA, 2nd Sch, para. 3, read with s. 42(7). However, even if this guidance is not followed, a vote is valid if the ballot paper clearly indicates the voter's intention and the candidate or group of candidates for whom he or she votes.PEA, s. 50(2). A vote will be rejected by the returning officer as invalid if it:PEA, s. 50(1). *does not bear a complete authentication mark or is not initialled by the presiding officer at a polling station; *contain votes for more than one candidate or group of candidates; *has been written upon or marked in a way that identifies the voter; *is blank; or *is void for uncertainty. The returning officer must show each ballot paper intended to be rejected to all candidates or their counting agents and hear their views, but makes the final decision as to whether the ballot paper should be rejected or not.PEA, ss. 50(3) and (4). Clementi Street 13 for the 2011 general election A candidate or his counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if the difference between the number of votes for the candidate or group of candidates with the most votes and the number of votes (excluding any rejected and tendered votes) of any other candidate or group of candidates is within a 2% margin.PEA, ss. 49B(1) and (4). A candidate is only permitted to make one application for a recount: s. 49B(3). After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as president. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.PEA, s. 49(7). Since the 2020 elections, recounts are now triggered automatically. All officers, clerks, interpreters, candidates and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, they must not communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has or has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register.PEA, s. 56(3). However, a presiding officer at a polling station may, at his discretion before the poll has closed, disclose to a candidate or his election agent the total number of voters who have voted at the station: s. 56(3A). They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed to try to find out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.PEA, ss. 56(3) to (6). The penalty for contravening these provisions is a fine of up to $1,500 or jail of up to nine months or both: s. 56(7). Sample counts Introduced during the 2015 elections, sample counts are also done during the vote counting process which prevent speculation and misinformation, while helping election officials check against the election result for that electoral division. 100 votes are selected at random and are weighed according to the size of ballots based on each polling station for the constituency. The counts are published by the assistant returning officer through broadcast and internet before vote counting is complete, which is always shown as an integer. Election Department announced that the results may differ from the actual results with error margins within a 4-5% range, and advised the public to refer to the returning officer for the actual results. =Declaration that election is void= A person claiming to have been a candidate at a general election or to have had a right to be elected, or a person who voted or had a right to vote at a general election,PEA, s. 93. may apply to an election judge for a candidate's election to be declared void on any of the following grounds:PEA, s. 90. *The majority of voters was or might have been prevented from electing their preferred candidate due to a general occurrence of bribery, treating, intimidation or some other form of misconduct or circumstances. *There was a failure to comply with the Parliamentary Elections Act and this affected the result of the election. *A corrupt or illegal practice in connection with the election was committed by the candidate, or by an agent of the candidate with his knowledge or consent. *The candidate personally hired someone as an election agent, canvasser or agent while aware that the person had been found guilty of a corrupt practice within the seven years before he was engaged. *At the time the candidate was elected, he was disqualified from standing for election. The Chief Justice or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him acts as the election judge.PEA, 92(1). The Supreme Court of Singapore. The validity of a general election is determined by an election judge, who is the Chief Justice or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him. The applicant for an election to be avoided may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny ‚Äì that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers ‚Äì if he or she alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes.PEA, s. 94. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorised to vote at the station;See the PEA, s. 39. if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; if the voter cast a vote at a general election in more than one electoral division; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicised or widely known.PEA, s. 99(1). During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added.PEA, s. 99(3). On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he was not qualified to be on the electoral register,PEA, s. 99(2). and the returning officer's decision as to whether or not a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.PEA, s. 101. The election judge is empowered to exempt from being an illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if it was done in good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like.PEA, s. 87. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorised excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his principal election agent shows that he acted in good faith and that there is a reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as his inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer.PEA, ss. 88(1) and (4). In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his principal election agent if he did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.PEA, s. 88(5). The election judge certifies his decision, which is final,PEA, s. 95(2). to the President.PEA, s. 95(1). The judge must also report to the President whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his agent.PEA, s. 96(1). The President must publish the report in the Government Gazette: s. 96(5). If a judge intends to report a person who was neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him.PEA, s. 96(2). However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his orders and without his or his election agents' sanction or connivance, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.PEA, s. 86. Depending on whether the judge has determined that the election was valid or void, the election return is confirmed or altered. If the election is declared void, the President is empowered to order that another election be held in the electoral division concerned within one month of the determination. If the election of one MP in a GRC is determined to be void, the election of the other MPs for that constituency is also void.PEA, s. 95(3). =Ballot secrecy= Election department ensure the privacy of all registered voters during an election and how the ballot boxes are treated. Prior to the opening hours, the boxes are checked to ensure the contents are empty and not tampered under the witness of candidates and their polling agents present at the polling station, before being sealed by Presiding Officers (except for opening slots) so that it can be used. After the polls closed, the boxes, along with the slots, are sealed and wrapped before being transported to the designated counting centre by bus under police escort. Upon arrival, the boxes are checked and accounted before it can be opened and emptied to begin vote counting. After the vote counting ended and results are released, the ballot papers and any other official documents used in the election are placed into separate boxes and sealed; these boxes are transported to the Supreme Court of Singapore where it was kept under safe custody for period of six months after election ended, after which the boxes are transported to the incineration plant for incineration, unless directed otherwise by order of the President. Under the protection act, the process is to ensure all of the voters' identity are not compromised, as contents inside each ballot paper have a unique serial number located on the counterfoil to ensure integrity of the democratic process and strict accounting to avoid infringement and personation. =Abstention= Under the constitution, voting in Singapore is compulsory as voting is exercising fundamental right of citizenship and democracy. After polls closed, any names (and along with the serial numbers) of registered voters who did not cast a vote that day are complied in a list to be sent to the Returning Officer, after which the names are delisted from the registrar of voters of the electoral divisions that they belong to. The consequence for abstention is the ineligibility to vote or participation in future elections of any kind. These voters are also called \\"non-voters\\"; any non-voter may reinstate their names by submitting an application, either through the online website or counter services at a nearby community centre, to the Registration Officer along with any reason for absence; the fee to restore a name is S$50, but it can be waived if their reasons are valid, such as: *working overseas (including being on a business trip) at the time of polling day; *studying overseas at the time of polling day; *living with their spouse who is working or studying overseas; *overseas vacation; *illness, or delivering a baby; or *any special circumstances that cause a voter unable to vote that day, such as a technical glitch. Restoration of names can be done anytime except on election periods, between the day the Writ of Election is issued and Polling day; if the voter is unable to vote due to unforeseen circumstances, he may pre-apply for his name to be restored to the registers by submitting an application online prior to polling day; however, such cases can still allow the voter to vote, but doing so voids the earlier application. Past elections and latest election Workers' Party rally at Serangoon Stadium on 29 April 2011 during the 2011 general election With effect from 3 June 1959, Singapore was granted full internal self- government by the British Government and became known as the State of Singapore. For the first time, Singapore had a fully elected Legislative Assembly. At the 1959 general election held on 30 May that year to give effect to the new constitution, the People's Action Party (PAP) led by Lee Kuan Yew swept into power with 43 out of 51 seats in the Assembly.. Since then, the PAP has retained power and formed the Government through successive elections, and Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963 and full independence in 1965. In the 1968 general election, the PAP was returned unopposed in all except seven of the 58 constituencies, and won the remaining seats with 84% of the popular vote.Turnbull, pp. 309‚Äì310. Thereafter, every seat in Parliament was held by a PAP MP until Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a 1981 by-election in the Anson constituency.Turnbull, p. 333. Jeyaretnam retained his seat at the following general election in 1984, at which Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party was also elected as representative of Potong Pasir.Turnbull, p. 335. Between 1984 and 2011, the number of elected parliamentary seats held by opposition parties fluctuated between one (after the 1988 election)As the Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme had been introduced in 1984, Lee Siew Choh of the Workers' Party became an NCMP following the 1988 general election: Turnbull, p. 340. and four (1991 election).Turnbull, p. 351. The latest general election in 2020 saw PAP's overall vote share dropped to 61.24% which was the lowest share since the 2011 elections and winning 83 out of 93 seats. For the first time, an opposition party ‚Äì the Workers' Party ‚Äì captured multiple GRCs with the newly formed four-seat Sengkang GRC (also the first time a newly formed constituency was won by the opposition on the first attempt) as well as retaining Hougang SMC and a five-seat Aljunied GRC, leaving the PAP with 83 out of 93 seats. By- elections By-elections are elections held to fill seats in Parliament that fall vacant in between general elections, known as casual vacancies. In the past, the Government took the position that the Prime Minister had discretion whether or not a by-election should be called to fill a casual vacancy in an SMC, and could leave a parliamentary seat unfilled until the next general election., citing . However, in the case of Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013), (\\"Vellama (C.A.)\\"). The abbreviation d/o means \\"daughter of\\". which arose from a vacancy in Hougang SMC, the Court of Appeal held that the Constitution obliges the Prime Minister to call a by-election unless a general election is going to be held in the near future. However, a by-election need only be called within a reasonable time, and the Prime Minister has discretion to determine when it should be held.Vellama (C.A.), pp. 36‚Äì37, paras. 84‚Äì85. The law provides that a by-election need only be called in a GRC if all the MPs in the constituency vacate their seats.PEA, s. 24(2A). It has been argued that the law should be amended, otherwise electors living in a GRC where a vacancy has arisen will lack parliamentary representation,See, for example, ; . and with a missing MP the remaining MPs may find it difficult to deal with constituency matters.Thio, \\"The Legislature and the Electoral System\\", p. 356, para. 06.180. Also, if the MP who vacates his or her seat is from a minority community and the seat is not filled, this would defeat the purpose of the GRC scheme which is to ensure a minimum level of minority representation in Parliament.Thio, \\"The Legislature and the Electoral System\\", p. 358, para. 06.189. In response, the Government has said that the other MPs of the GRC continue to represent the electors and should be able to handle constituency matters without any problems.. Moreover, the loss of one minority MP in a GRC should not make much difference in practice as there will be other minority MPs in Parliament.Lee, \\"Parliamentary Elections\\" (27 August 2008), col. 3403. NCMPs are only declared to be elected at general elections, and there is no provision for the seat of an NCMP to be filled if it falls vacant.Constitution, Art. 49(2)(b); Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General [2012] SGHC 155, [2012] 4 S.L.R. 698 at 725, para. 80, High Court (Singapore) (\\"Vellama (H.C.)\\"), archived from the original on 24 April 2014. On the other hand, if an NMP vacates his or her seat, a Special Select Committee of Parliament may nominate a replacement to be appointed by the President.Constitution, Art. 49(2)(a) and the Fourth Schedule, para. 4(2); Vellama (H.C.), p. 725, paras. 76‚Äì77.

Torino: UTET ; p. 1268  Object  The overall aim is to be the first to make a score of 21 points.Parlett, David Oxford Dictionary of Card Games. ; p. 314 In each deal, one person plays against the other two with the aim of capturing in tricks cards totalling at least 6 of the 11 points available for counters and the last trick. The soloist is determined by auction and each successive bid must be higher than the last. A player who has once passed may not come in again. The game moves to the right of the dealerTarocchi: Introducing Card Games for Tarot, Philebus ; p. 185 and the bids from low to high are: Calabresella is played with an Italian pack, consisting of a King (Re), Knight/Cavalier (Cavallo, literally meaning Horse), and a Knave (Fante, literally meaning Footsoldier) and the pip cards 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace in 4 suits of Batons (Bastoni), Swords (Spade), Cups (Coppe) and Coins (Danari). The rather unusual rank of the cards goes as follows: *3-2-A-R-C-F-7-6-5-4.  Rules  One player plays against the other two, paying to each or receiving from each the difference between the number of points that he and they hold. Each player receives twelve cards, dealt four at a time. The remainder form the stock, which is left face downwards. *Chiamo: The Soloist may demand any card he chooses, giving a card in exchange. If the three demanded is in the stock, no other card may be asked for before exchanging cards in the stock. *Solo: The Soloist exchanges cards with the stock but does not call a card. *Solissimo: In a normal Solissimo, no one sees the monte cards until they are won by the winner of the last trick at the end of the play. The soloist not only plays without the stock, or monte, but even allows the opponents to use it. He may choose to increase the stake by saying dividete or scegliete, which turns the game into a Solissimo aggravato. **Solissimo dividete: If he says \\"half each\\" the other players exchange exactly 2 cards each with the stock without showing them, and makes any two discards face down. **Solissimo scegliete: if he says \\"you choose\\" the other players turn the four cards face up on the table and may agree to split them 2-2, 3-1, or 4-0, and each discards face down as many as he took. The dealer has the last option. If one person announces the highest contract, the others combine against him. If all decline to play, the deal passes and the hands are abandoned.  The play  The player on the dealer's left leads first. The highest card wins the trick, there being no trumps. Players must follow suit if possible. The single player and the allies, respectively, collect all the tricks they win.  Scoring  The values of the cards are: *Each ace is worth 1 point. *3,2 and Court Cards are worth 1/3 of a point. Card points are used to calculate who won the game. If the soloist won at least 6 points, he is credited with the score for the games: #Chiamo (Call): 1 game point #Solo: 2 game points #Solissimo: 4 game points #Solissimo aggravato: *Solissimo dividete: 8 game points *Solissimo sceliete: 16 game points. The card points are not added to game points, but are only used to calculate who wins the game. *Cappotto: if the bidder wins or loses all the tricks, the amount won or lost is doubled. *Stramazzo: if the bidder wins all the points without winning all the tricks, or if he loses all the points without losing all the tricks, that is, if the tricks won by the losing side contain less than one point, the amount won or lost is then multiplied by three.

The film uses a form of cutout animation which the filmmakers called \\"Lumage\\", involving prefabricated cut-out plastic pieces that the animators moved on a light table. The film features improvised dialogue and a visual blend of live-action, traditional 2D-animation and stop motion. Plot In the eternally busy city of Din, the black-and-white Rushers constantly go about their business in a fast-paced way and stop only to sleep, due to their Cosmic Clock being wound too tightly. Din lies between two worlds that create dreams to deliver to the sleeping Rushers ‚Äì one is the bright and cheerful Frivoli, where Greensleeves and his Figmen of Imagination bring sweet dreams; and the other is the Murkworks, a dark and dingy factory home to vultures who drop nightmare bombs. The evil Botch, maniacal ruler of the Murkworks, wants to foil Greenie's efforts and subject the Rushers to non-stop waking nightmares. He uses his vultures to kidnap the Figs and Greensleeves, but not before Greensleeves writes an S.O.S. to Frivoli. Meanwhile, two misfits - known as Ralph, the All-Purpose Animal (named so for his somewhat unreliable shapeshifting abilities), and Mumford, a Chaplinesque mime - are put on trial for their incompetence at work. They are determined to prove themselves when they meet Flora Fauna, Greensleeves's niece, who found her uncle's S.O.S. and wants to rescue him. Botch spies on the three through Ibor, his robot gorilla, and uses Ralph and Mum's desire to be heroes to his advantage. Botch deceives the three, claiming to be a friend of Greenie and telling them that Greensleeves can be saved if they go into Din and take the main spring from the Cosmic Clock. Flora stays behind to act the part of the damsel in distress for Botch's nightmares. Mumford and Ralph release the spring which causes time to freeze. They chase the spring throughout Din, but Botch's vultures steal the spring and begin planting every nightmare bomb in the Murkworks' inventory all over Din. A Fairy Godmother (FGM) twinkles in to tell Mum and Ralph that they have been tricked and gives them three dimes to make a phone booth appear in case they need her help. FGM also recruits the help of the dim-witted but musclebound Rod Rescueman to aid them. Rod is more interested in rescuing Fauna, however, and abandons the boys to find her. Ralph and Mum find nightmare bombs scattered in an office, ready to be set off by Botch once starts time again. Mumford accidentally detonates a bomb and the two are trapped in a nightmare in which they are nearly killed by office supplies. When they are finally freed from the nightmare, the Fairy Godmother transports them back to Frivoli, suggests that they give up after all the mistakes they've made, and fires them from the hero business. This further strengthens Ralph and Mum's resolve to do right. Meanwhile, Rod \\"rescues\\" Flora from the Murkworks and attempts to get a kiss from her. She tries to escape from his floating apartment in the sky and falls, landing on a mechanical serpent that attempts to stop Ralph and Mum from reaching the Murkworks. The trio and Rod storm their way in with the help of Scuzzbopper, Botch's former nightmare screenwriter, who decides to aid them after Botch cruelly discards his recently completed Amurkian novel. Rod and Flora rescue Greenie and the Figs but have to contend with Ibor. Rod tries to save Flora again but fails, and Flora destroys the robot herself. At the same time, Botch has his head vulture Rudy fly the spring back to Din as the final phase of his plan. When Ralph, Mum, and Scuzzbopper enter Botch's office, he has his pet rat attack them but Scuzzbopper tricks it into chasing a bowling ball out a window. Botch retreats to a control room housing his master nightmare bomb button, \\"The Big Red One\\", with Ralph and Mum chasing after him. Ralph finally manages to control his shapeshifting to get through Botch's arsenal of booby traps and flies into the control room, while Mumford struggles through the traps and into the barrel of Botch's cannon. Ralph, in the form of a fly, tricks Botch into pressing The Big Red One, detonating all the nightmare bombs before Rudy could put the spring back in the Cosmic Clock, the still- immobilized Rushers being unaffected. An enraged Botch is about to kill Ralph for ruining his plans when one last nightmare bomb appears, about to blow. Terrified of being subjected to his own nightmare, Botch is knocked out the window. The bomb turns out to be Mumford, who had stretched his hat over himself and used a cigar to simulate nightmare smoke. Ralph and Mumford consider themselves heroes, while Botch is saved and carried away by his vultures (who may harbor ill-will toward Botch for his insults and cruel demands). Scuzzbopper, Flora, and Rod assume command of the Murkworks, with Flora giving a parting kiss to Ralph and Mumford for helping to save Greenie. As the two heroes leave, the Fairy Godmother congratulates them and allows them to keep their last dime as a symbol of good luck. The spring returns to the Cosmic Clock of its own will, and restarts the flow of time, but at a pace where the Rushers can enjoy their lives.

The Ladd Company decided to release Twice Upon a Time into a limited release and there were few early screenings of the film. Both this film and The Right Stuff failed at the box office, causing The Ladd Company to shut down. Alternate versions There were many different versions of this movie because the producers could only hire improvisational comedians. In one version, Greensleeves is not kidnapped at the beginning. Ralph and Mumford release and lose the spring, then stop by a bar where they meet Greensleeves, who urges the boys to get the spring. Later, the spring escapes the vultures and finds its way to Greenie, who is then asked to put the spring back in the cosmic clock. At this point, the vultures swoop in and capture Greensleeves and the spring. Another version of the movie included Synonamess Botch swearing throughout the film.\\"This week on TCM Underground: TWICE UPON A TIME (1983)\\", Streamline: The Official Filmstruck Blog From the outset, director John Korty did not want to use the dialogue of the original script, but actor Marshall Efron thought his lines were perfect and played up the raunchier aspects of his character. Some lines were selected by producer Bill Couturi√© as he felt it would help the film appeal to older audiences. Korty was unaware of this until opening night and was angry about how Marshall Efron's lines were delivered from the script.366 Weird Movies Most theaters that showed the film also played the version with the profanity instead of reprinting it with the family friendly cut. Although the censored version was not been rated, the version with the profanity was given a PG rating. TV and home video A few years later, Twice Upon a Time was shown by HBO. However, the version that HBO received and showed was the version with the profanity. When Korty found out, he immediately contacted HBO, threatening legal action if this version was aired again. After three showings, HBO suspended broadcasts of the film until supplied with a new family-friendly cut from Korty. This new cut filled-out the remaining showings of Twice Upon a Time scheduled that month, prompting complaints of \\"censored\\" movies being shown on HBO. Following these complaints, HBO chose to never air the film again on their service.Damsel in distress currently on fire (20 years later, Twice Upon a Time still burns), Taylor Jessen, Retrieved on April 10, 2008 Two months later, Showtime and over-the-air pay television service Spectrum acquired rights to show the film, but only the Korty-approved version. This version had the complete scene of \\"Out on My Own\\" as well as the uncut final reel of the film absent from the later home video version. In 1991, the film was released on videocassette and laserdisc. This release contains John Korty's intended family-friendly cut, with some scenes roughly trimmed short to remove profanity that was still present. Years later, Amazon made the film temporarily available for rental download via Amazon Unbox. Now the film is unavailable there, citing licensing restrictions. Its cult status boosted when the film began to be shared on viral video sites. Perhaps in response to the lack of official support for the film, several bootleg copies of the original, uncut version were available via torrents. The film aired on the Disney Channel as part of its \\"Magical World of Disney\\" movie block in 1997, it also aired as part of Cartoon Network's Cartoon Theatre on September 12, 1998. It has also been shown early mornings on Turner Classic Movies, first on February 1, 2015 as part of the channel's TCM Underground block, and again on May 20, 2019. The film was released on DVD on September 29, 2015, through the Warner Archive. The DVD contained both cuts, an audio commentary with John Korty and selected crew members (including Henry Selick), and the original trailer. Soundtrack The soundtrack features several songs performed by Maureen McDonald written by Tom Ferguson, Maureen McDonald, and her brother Michael. Also included is one song performed by Bruce Hornsby and written by Hornsby and his brother John, as well as one track performed by Lawrence Welk and His Orchestra.

Cross-matching is also used to determine compatibility between a donor and recipient in organ transplantation. Compatibility is determined through matching of different blood group systems, the most important of which are the ABO and Rh system, and/or by directly testing for the presence of antibodies against the antigens in a sample of donor blood or other tissue. Cross-matching is done by a certified laboratory technologist in a medical laboratory. It can be done electronically with a database if a patient has previously been tested, or serologically by physical testing if not. Simpler tests may be used to determine blood type only (known as blood typing), or to screen for antibodies only (see indirect Coombs test). Types =Abbreviated cross-matching= Immediate-spin cross-matching (ISCM) Immediate-spin cross-matching is an abbreviated form of cross-matching that is faster, less expensive but also less sensitive. It is an immediate test that combines the patient's serum and donor's red blood cells at room temperature. No agglutination indicates a negative test reaction, or compatible match. Indications for ISCM are dependent on the circumstances of the patient and it can be used in place of a full cross-match or performed as a preliminary test. Electronic cross-matching Electronic cross-matching is a computer- assisted analysis using data, from the donor unit (where a donor's blood is tested prior to donation) and testing done on blood samples from the intended recipient. This includes ABO/Rh typing of the unit and of the recipient, and an antibody screen of the recipient. Electronic cross-matching can only be used if a patient has a negative antibody screen, which means that they do not have any active red blood cell atypical antibodies, or they are below the detectable level of current testing methods. If all of the data entered is compatible, the computer will print a compatibility label stating that the unit is safe to transfuse. Cross-matching falls into two categories: * Major cross-match: Here the Recipient serum is tested against donor packed cells to determine if the recipient has preformed antibodies against any antigens on the donor's cells. This is the required cross-match prior to release of a unit of packed cell from blood bank. * Minor cross-match: Here the Recipient red cells are tested against donor serum to detect donor antibodies directed against a patient's antigens. This is no longer required. It is assumed that the small amount of donor serum and antibodies left in a unit of packed cells will be diluted in a recipient. Emergencies As the complete cross-matching process takes approximately 1 hour, it is not always used in emergencies. In the case of an emergency, a type-specific blood to which the recipient has no antibodies, can be requested. It is thought that this lifesaving measure is of more benefit than any risk of an antibody-mediated transfusion reaction. This type of blood has less risk of a serious transfusion reaction because it is both ABO compatible and Rhesus (Rh)-compatible. Universal donor blood, which is both type O and Rh negative, can be given if the recipient's blood group is not known, as may happen in an emergency. It is the policy of some institutions to reserve the releasing of O- blood only for female patients of childbearing age. This serves two purposes. First, it preserves the lower stock of O- blood and secondly, this eliminates the risk of O- negative mothers forming anti-D (Rh) antibodies from exposure to O+ blood. Anti-D (Rh) can cross the placenta during pregnancy and attack an unborn child's RBCs if they are D (Rh) positive causing haemolytic disease of the newborn. In an emergency, blood grouping can be done easily and quickly in 2 or 3 minutes in the laboratory on glass slides with appropriate reagents, by trained technical staff. This method depends on the presence or absence of agglutination (clumping of red blood cells), which can usually be visualized directly. Presence of agglutination indicates incompatibility. Occasionally a light microscope may be needed. If laboratory services are not available, the bedside card method of blood grouping may be used, where a drop of the intended recipients blood is added to dried reagents on a prepared card. This method may not be as reliable as laboratory methods, which are preferable.

Later he was forced to leave this post; he worked as a shop foreman at the metallurgical plant and worked as an engineer at various enterprises. His mother Alexandra Filippovna (n√©e Ivanova, 1869-1953) received a good education, graduating from the Kerch Institute for Noble Maidens. The couple had three other children, son Pavel and daughters Valentina and Militsa.

He studied at the same Gymnasium from which Andrei Zhelyabov, one of the chief organizers of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, graduated with a silver medal. Already in the gymnasium, Voykov thought about killing the Tsar. He was expelled from the sixth grade of the Kerch Gymnasium, but he managed to pass examinations for grade seven. His parents had to change their place of residence and work as a result of his underground activities. The family moved to Keukeneiz, where his father took on the position as a road master in the estate of the landowner Alchevsky. Thanks to the efforts of his mother, Pyotr was accepted into the eighth grade of the Yalta Alexandrovskaya Men's Gymnasium, but he was soon expelled from there too. The exact date of Voykov's accession to the RSDLP is not known, but a period between 1903-1905 is assumed. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia points out that he was a \\"Menshevik \\" since 1903. In 1905 Voykov was already a member of the Kerch Committee of the RSDLP and fought in the ranks of the self-defense squad. Voykov also was a member of the fighting squad of local social-democrats after moving to Yalta. =The explosion on July 20, 1906= Voykov was one of the five organizers and participants in the terrorist attack on July 20, 1906 against the local police chief, M. M. Gvozdevich. According to the official Soviet biography of Voykov, the initial purpose of the operation was not a terrorist act, but the transportation of bombs, prepared for self-defense, from a cache to a place outside the city, where they were planned to be discharged. According to this version, the decision to attack the police chief was taken impulsively by the two other participants in the operation. The terrorist act was a complete failure, the two persons most responsible for it were heavily wounded and soon died, and M. M. Gvozdevich was not injured. It is known that Mensheviks were the least extremist of any of the groups within the RSDLP and rejected terrorism as a method of a political struggle. But they prepared bombs for an armed uprising and the central leadership could not fully control the proliferation of weapons and the behavior of radical young people. Voykov fled first to Kekeneiz, to his father, and then to Sevastopol and St. Petersburg. Two other participants in the terrorist act, Dmitry Nashaburgsky and Pyotr Koren, did not mention Voykov's name. The fact of Voykov's participation was established only in 1907. =Assassination attempt on Dumbadze on February 26, 1907= From the autumn of 1906, the duties of the mayor in Yalta were performed by General Dumbadze. On February 26, 1907, a bomb was thrown from the balcony of Novikov's dacha at Dumbadze, who was passing by in a carriage. Dumbadze was bruised and scratched, while the driver and adjutant were injured. Even after the unfortunate terrorist shot himself, Dumbadze ordered his troops to burn down the dacha, and the soldiers additionally looted the adjacent house. Voykov (the militia fighter of the RSDLP) had no relation to the action on February 26, 1907, because it was organized by the one of the \\"flying combat units\\" of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In addition, he left Yalta shortly after the unsuccessful explosion on July 20, 1906 and from the autumn of 1906 studied in St. Petersburg University. However, a assassination attempt on Dumbadze revived the investigation into the case on July 20. As a result, Voykov was forced to leave Petersburg; in summer 1907 he was hiding in Kharkiv for several months, and then emigrated. Emigration In 1907 Voykov left Russia on the passport of his classmate. In March 1908 he arrived in Geneva, Switzerland. In September 1909 he entered the Physics and Mathematics Department of the University of Geneva. In Geneva he met Vladimir Lenin and, although he was not yet a Bolshevik, he remained a Menshevik- Internationalist during the First World War, actively spoke out against the \\"defencists\\", and was an active participant in the \\"1st Geneva Group of Assistance\\". In the spring of 1914 he married Adelaide Abramovna Belenkina, who studied medicine in Geneva. On April 24, 1915 their son Pavel was born. Following the February Revolution of 1917, he returned to Russia with his wife and son, though not in the same sealed carriage with Lenin, as it was often claimed, but together with Martov and Lunacharsky in the next group, which arrived in Russia on May 9, 1917.  Activities in the Urals  On returning to Russia, Voykov became a Commissar of the Ministry of Labor of the Provisional Government; he was responsible for resolving conflicts between workers and employers. After the July Days, when the Menshevik faction supported the repression against the rioters and Bolsheviks, Voykov left St. Petersburg for the Urals. There he soon joined the Bolshevik faction and was a member of Yekaterinburg Soviet and was engaged in trade union activities. After the October Revolution he joined the Yekaterinburg Military Revolutionary Committee. he was elected chairman of the Yekaterinburg City Duma. In January through December 1918 he was Commissar for Supply in the Ural Region Soviet. In this post, he directed transportation of precious metals from Yekaterinburg, successfully sought the supply of foodstuffs from the state reserves to the Urals and personally provided for its delivery. The Great War, two revolutions and the policy of nationalization of industrial plants led to the disintegration of normal economic ties. In order to supply the cities with food, the Soviets resorted to the brutal policy of prodrazvyorstka when armed prodotryads (food detachments) were sent to the villages. As a Commissar of Supply, Voykov also dealt with this. Soviet biographers also note that he managed to organize the exchange of Urals iron for Siberian grain and he dealt with the construction of a railroad between Yekaterinburg and Krasnoufimsk. Russian academic, publicist, and former Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky claimed that Voykov, in this position, was involved in repressions against the entrepreneurs of the Urals, stating:¬´Information about the activities of P.L. Voykov¬ª (in Russian)  Murder of the Romanovs  Informing the local Bolsheviks of the forthcoming arrival of Nicholas II and his family in Yekaterinburg, Sverdlov left it to them whether to imprison the family or offer them accommodations in a mansion. They chose a variant with a mansion turned into a prison. Voykov knew Nicholas Ipatiev, and had visited the Ipatiev House before it was selected as the final residence of Nicholas II of Russia and his family. It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called 'The House of Special Purpose'. During the Imperial Family's imprisonment in late June, they received letters written in French. Their author was allegedly a monarchist officer, planning to rescue the Tsar and his family. In fact, these letters were composed at the behest of the Cheka. These fabricated letters, along with the Romanov responses to them, written either on blank spaces or on the envelope, were ultimately used by the Ural Soviet, and likely the Central Executive Committee in Moscow, to justify murdering the Imperial Family.Helen Rappaport, p. 120 It appears that these letters were not written by Voykov himself, but by one of the Chekists. Later in memoirs and interviews in the 1960s, two Chekists claimed that Voykov, who for a long time lived abroad and graduated from Geneva University, translated these letters into French. The researchers note, that the letters contained obvious oddities, including an incorrect address to the monarch using vous (\\"you\\") instead of Votre Majest√© (\\"Your Majesty\\"). According to Richard Pipes, the letters were written by a man with a \\"poor knowledge of French\\". As a Commissar of Supply, Voykov signed orders for the distribution of sulfuric acid from the Yekaterinburg pharmacy. Yakov Yurovsky, the commandant of the Ipatiev House from 4 July and later chief executioner, was allegedly going to use sulfuric acid for the destruction of bodies. According to Yurovsky's memoirs of 1934, in addition to acid, he obtained gasoline (or kerosene) and shovels from Voykov.=–ò–∑ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞ –Ø. –ú. –Æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–µ–º—å–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–æ–≤–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—Ö –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≤–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –≥. –°–≤–µ—Ä–¥–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–µ In an earlier testimony Yurovsky does not mention Voykov at all. None of the numerous eyewitnesses mentions Voykov as a direct participant in the murder and the concealment of bodies. On 16 July, Voykov attended a special session of the Ural Soviet at the Amerikanskaya Hotel, where it was decided the executions would have to be carried out that night. According to the memoirs of Grigory Besedovsky, a Soviet Diplomat who defected to France, Voykov and his accomplices used bayonets and pierced the breasts of the still living daughters of Nicholas II, as bullets ricocheted off from their corsets. After the killings, Voykov allegedly removed a ring from a corpse with a large ruby. Voykov himself claimed that the ring was taken from the hand of one of the Grand Duchesses and liked to show it off, though such a ring is not mentioned in any official documents or testimony given by the other executioners. Besedovsky also claimed that Voykov was one of the primary orchestrators of the killing of the Imperial Family, and insisted particularly to the Ural Soviet that the entire family, including all five of the Tsar's children, must be killed. The reliability of Besedovsky testimony is now seriously questioned. The official investigation, conducted in Russia after the discovery of the remains of the Imperial Family, showed that the picture painted by Besedovsky was not reliable. Later, Besedovsky became known for his wild fantasy and for the publication of forged documents (for example, \\"Notebooks\\" of Stalin's non- existent nephew), as even his friends recognized. The role of Voykov in the regicide was fully investigated by the commission set up after Admiral Kolchak's White Army captured Yekaterinburg from the Bolsheviks. In the materials of the investigator Sokolov, Voykov was mentioned only as a person related to the distribution of sulfuric acid. The actual disposal of the remains was rather left under the supervision of Yurovsky and Goloshchekin. Activities in Moscow After the fall of Yekaterinburg on July 26, 1918 the Ural Soviet evacuated to Perm and Voykov continued his work there. Five months later, on December 25, the troops of admiral Kolchak captured Perm and drove the Soviet forces from there, too. Voykov was summoned to Moscow and worked in the distribution department of People's Commissariat for Food Supplies until July 1919, when he was sent to work in Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives (Tsentrosoyuz). October 26, 1920 Voykov was appointed a member of the board of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade. Together with Maxim Gorky, he drafted a work plan for the Export Commission. This commission was engaged in buying up and valuation of antiques and works of art and deciding whether they could be sold abroad. Contrary to the frequent claims, however, Voykov had nothing to do with sales from the Diamond Fund, the Kremlin Armoury or the Hermitage ‚Äî the task of the commission was, on the contrary, to provide museums with appraisals. Stalin's massive sales from museums took place in 1929-1934, long after Voykov left this post and died. The mass sale of 14 Faberg√© Eggs occurred in 1930-1933.  Soviet Diplomat  In October 1921, Voykov led the delegation of the Russian SFSR and the Ukrainian SSR, which was to coordinate with Poland on the implementation of the Peace of Riga. According to the fifth paragraph of Article X of the latter, Soviet Russia was to return \\"archives, libraries, art objects, military historical trophies, antiquities, etc., items of cultural heritage that were exported from Poland to Russia.\\" According to Kurlyandsky and Lobanov, it was Voykov who transferred the Russian art objects, archives, libraries and other materials of value to the Polish authorities. In August 1922, he was appointed diplomatic representative of the Russian SFSR in Canada, but was not permitted into the country due to his involvement in the execution of the Imperial family and prior terrorist activities, and because of his reputation as a professional revolutionary. The Foreign Office acknowledged Voykov, along with similar personalities, as persona non grata. A similar problem arose when Voykov was appointed as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Poland, but nevertheless he received this post in October 1924, and assumed office on November 8, 1924. The English ambassador in Warsaw reported to London in January 1925 that: Grigory Besedovsky, who worked with Voykov in the Warsaw Permanent Mission, characterized Voykov with the following:  Assassination  On 7 June 1927 9:00 A.M., the Ambassador Voykov, accompanied by an official of the Embassy, Yurij Grigorowicz, arrived at the main station in Warsaw to meet Arkady Rosengolts, who had recently been relieved of his post as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom and was returning from London via Berlin, having been summoned to Moscow. Having met Rosengolts, Voykov proceeded together with him to the railway restaurant to take some coffee, after which they went together out on the platform toward the express train scheduled to leave Warsaw at 9:55, from which Rosengolts was to continue his journey to Moscow. At the moment when Voykov and Rosengolts passed the sleeper of the train, a man fired a pistol shot at Voykov, who jumped aside and started to run. The assailant, who cried out, \\"Die for Russia!\\", pursued him with further shots, to which Voykov pulled a pistol out of his pocket and returned fire at his assailant, only to falter and collapse into the arms of a Polish policeman who had arrived on scene. The assailant, sighting the approaching police, surrendered himself voluntarily into police custody. The shooter identified himself as Boris Kowerda, and stated that he planned to kill Voykov in order to \\"Avenge Russia, to avenge millions of people\\".\\"Shot Down by Assassin ‚Äî Soviet Ambassador at Warsaw\\", Wellington Evening Post, 8 June 1927, p. 9 \\"RUSSIA: Nest of Murderers\\", Time Magazine, 20 June 1927 Voykov, having received emergency first aid at the station, was rushed to the nearby Hospital of the Child Jesus, where he died at 10:40 A.M. the same day. The autopsy performed on the same day by Professor Grchivo-Dombrowski revealed that Voykov had been shot twice: once fatally in the left side of the chest, and once in the left shoulder. The wound to the chest ruptured Voykov's left lung, causing an internal hemorrhage.\\"United States Congressional Serial Set\\", 27 February 1956 \\"Relief of John W Scholtes 1588 Relief of Boris Kowerda\\", U.S. Government Printing Office, 27 February 1956 Voykov died in the presence of the Polish Foreign Minister August Zaleski, who visited the hospital on behalf of the Polish government. Voykov's body was transported from the hospital to the Soviet mission, which used the occasion to organize communist demonstrations in Warsaw. The coffin was exhibited in the mission hall for two days. The Polish government expressed its condolences to his widow and the government of the USSR and performed all formal duties. On June 10, the coffin was transported to the Warsaw railway station and from there by train to Moscow. In the streets of Warsaw, the coffin was followed by all the local communists, representatives of the diplomatic corps of Russia and Poland, the Polish government, as well as a department of the Polish Army, which gave signs of military respect and so strictly guarded order that the procession walked through the empty streets.Nina Stuzhynskaya, Belarus Rebellious: From History of Armed Anti- Soviet Resistance: 1920s p. 293, 295 Despite the official remorse, almost all the newspapers expressed the sympathy of Polish society that Boris Kowerda evoked with his youth and patriotism, and he was even forgiven for the political difficulties caused by his actions. The killing was later justified as vengeance for Voykov's role in the killing of the Tsar and his family, and many people in Poland regarded Kowerda as a hero; public opinion was full of understanding, and even sympathy, for the assassin.Nina Stuzhynskaya, Belarus Rebellious: From History of Armed Anti-Soviet Resistance: 1920s p. 293, 295 A Polish court initially sentenced Kowerda to life imprisonment due to external pressure, but he was successful in petitioning President of the Republic Ignacy Mo≈õcicki to commute his sentence to 15 years. Kowerda was later amnestied and released after ten years on June 15, 1937. The incident further damaged Soviet-Polish relations, already soured by the Polish-Soviet War of 1921. The Soviets broke off negotiations about a non-aggression pact, accusing the Poles of supporting the anti-Soviet White resistance. They would be resumed in 1931. The Soviets likewise \\"responded\\" to the assassination in their own way, arbitrarily arresting and executing twenty former aristocrats, landowners, and monarchists without trial or a formal sentencing on June 9. On June 14 in Odessa, 111 people were sentenced to death for supposedly spying for Romania. Four Poles were shot in Minsk and Kharkiv, and 480 alleged monarchists were arrested in Ukraine. At the same time, the Soviet authorities organized a menacing demonstration in front of the Polish Embassy in Moscow, and in Kiev incited a riot that demolished almost all Polish-owned stores.  Legacy  The Soviet authorities cherished his memory, giving his name to the Voykovsky District, the Moscow Metro station Voikovskaya, several streets and plants, and a coal mine in Ukraine. After the canonization of the Imperial Family, the Russian Orthodox Church urged the authorities to erase the name of the \\"regicide and infanticide\\" from public objects. On July 17, 2007, the remembrance day of the Russian Royal Family, several Orthodox groups publicly prayed that the metro station in Moscow might be renamed.Moscow disputes over metro station named after Royal Family murderer :: Russia-InfoCentre at www.russia-ic.com In 2015, the investigator of the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia, Vladimir Solovyov, in an interview with the newspaper \\"Top Secret\\" stated: Some members of the Russian Orthodox Church criticized Solovyov for his statement and accused him of whitewashing Voykov's role in the murders. The Hieromonk Nikon (Belavenets), the leader of the monarchist organization For Faith and Fatherland, stated that even if Voykov did not personally take part in the shooting of the family, he was still guilty via his involvement in voting in favor of the executions and arranging for the disposal of the remains. Name Some sources claim Voykov's birth name as \\"Pinhus Lazarevich Wainer\\", alternatively sometimes translated as \\"Weiner\\", though this information is unreliable, and is most likely the result of erroneous reading of documents. Nevertheless, the name, perhaps due to the connected implication of Jewish heritage on the part of Voykov, saw frequent use by early investigators of the killings. The 1922 book by White Army General Mikhail Diterikhs, The Murder of the Tsar's Family and members of the House of Romanov in the Urals, sought to portray the murder of the family as a Jewish plot against Russia, and referred to Voykov as \\"Pinhus Wainer\\". It also referred to Sverdlov by his Jewish nickname \\"Yankel\\" and to Goloshchekin as \\"Isaac\\". This book in turn was based on an account by one Nikolai Sokolov, special investigator for the Omsk regional court, whom Diterikhs assigned with the task of investigating the disappearance of the Romanovs while serving as regional Governor under White rule during the Russian Civil War.

There are serious doubts as to whether or not he existed.Forbes: Great Art Thefts Of The 20th Century Theft of the Mona Lisa In 1932, journalist Karl Decker published a story in the Saturday Evening Post claiming Valfierno paid several men to steal the work of art from the Louvre, including museum employee Vincenzo Peruggia. On August 21, 1911 Peruggia hid the Mona Lisa under his coat and simply walked out the door. Before the heist took place, Valfierno allegedly commissioned French art restorer and forger Yves Chaudron to make six copies of the Mona Lisa.Crimes Against Mona The forgeries were then shipped to around the world, readying them for the buyers he had lined up. Valfierno knew once the Mona Lisa was stolen it would be harder to smuggle copies past customs. After the heist the copies were delivered to their buyers, each thinking they had the original which had been stolen for them.Reit, Seymour. The Day They Stole the Mona Lisa. New York: Summitt Books, 1981. Because Valfierno wanted to sell forgeries, he only needed the original Mona Lisa to disappear and never contacted Peruggia again after the crime. Eventually Peruggia was caught trying to sell the painting. It was returned to the Louvre in 1913. Peruggia denied he ever knew Valfierno other than a chance meeting at the Louvre. Decker's article is the only source for this story or even for the existence of Valfierno and Chaudron. He was famous for taking liberties with his articles, and many of the facts and details he provides in the article are incorrect, including the size and weight of the Mona Lisa and the type of wood it was painted on. That and the fact that a century later none of the alleged copies have been found casts serious doubts on the accuracy of the story and the existence of Eduardo de Valfierno.  In fiction  The notion of stealing the Mona Lisa and making six copies to sell to private collectors is similar to a plot element in the Doctor Who story \\"City of Death\\": Through time travel, Leonardo da Vinci is forced to make copies of his own work, which would then be sold in 1979. In the 1985 television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett, \\"The Final Problem\\" episode begins with the theft of the Mona Lisa, masterminded by Moriarty to sell prepared fakes to collectors. Holmes recovers the original painting just before Moriarty makes a sale to a \\"Mr. Morgan\\". Holmes's interference with his plans convinces Moriarty that the detective must be eliminated. This con was mentioned in Leverage episode \\"The Two Live Crew Job\\", where a rival crew steals a painting that the Leverage Crew was looking for. Parker claims that this \\"Mona Lisa Variant\\" was the first con she learned and explains it for the viewing audience. In the film St Trinian's (2007), the girls use a similar scheme with the painting Girl with a Pearl Earring: They make a copy, \\"borrow\\" the original, sell the copy for ¬£500 000, return the original (claiming to have found it in a Harvey Nichols changing room) and claim the ¬£50 000 reward. In a deleted scene, they mention the original 'Mona Lisa scam'. In the psychological heist film Inception, Hotel Valferno is where the characters meet and fight. In the USA Network show White Collar, an episode \\"Copycat Caffrey\\" was mainly about the same basic con that Valfierno pulled. One of the plot revelations of the 1978 novel The Perfect Thief by Ronald Bass is that the character Voleur used this con, stealing a Goya painting so he could sell 32 forgeries to various buyers. The novel does not reference the original con by name. The Argentine novelist Martin Caparros published in 2004 the novel Valfierno, in which he reconstructs in fictional form the biography of the con man, as well as those of his accomplices and the historical milieu. Valfierno is the main character of the 2011 novel Stealing Mona Lisa, which is a fictional account of the theft by Carson Morton. In the heist film The Art of the Steal the story of de Valfierno is a significant plot point in the story. Aaron Elkins‚Äô 2018 art-world mystery A Long Time Coming begins with a significant recounting of the Valfierno story.

He is supposed to have studied under Nardon P√©nicaud. He was certainly at the beginning of his career influenced by the German school indeed, his earliest authenticated work, signed L. L. and dated 1532, is a series of eighteen plaques of the Passion of the Lord, after Albrecht D√ºrer, but this influence was counterbalanced by that of the Italian masters of the school of Fontainebleau, Primaticcio, Rosso, Giulio Romano and Andrea Solari, from whom he acquired his taste for arabesque ornament and for mythological subjects. Nevertheless, the French tradition was sufficiently ingrained in him to save him from becoming an imitator and from losing his personal style. In 1530 he entered the service of Francis I as painter and varlet de chambre, a position which he retained under Henry II. For both these monarchs he executed many portraits in enamel‚Äîamong them quite a number of plaques depicting Diane de Poitiers in various characters, plates, vases, ewers, and cups, besides decorative works for the royal palaces, for, though he is best known as an enameller distinguished for rich color, and for graceful designs in grisaille on black or bright blue backgrounds, he also enjoyed a great reputation as an oil-painter. His last signed works bear the date 1574, but the date of his death is uncertain, though it could not have been later than the beginning of 1577. It is on record that he executed close upon two thousand enamels. He is best represented at the Louvre, which owns his two famous votive tablets for the Sainte Chapelle, each consisting of twenty-three plaques, signed L. L. and dated 1553; La Chasse, depicting Henry II on a white horse, Diane de Poitiers behind him on horseback; and many portraits, including the kings by whom he was employed, Marguerite de Valois, the duc de Guise, and the cardinal de Lorraine. Other representative examples are at the Cluny and Limoges museums. In England some magnificent examples of his work are to be found at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Wallace Collection. In the collection of Signor Rocchi, in Rome, is an exceptionally interesting plaque representing Frances I consulting a fortuneteller.

The type was a more powerful development of the earlier H3 (LNER K2) class and was notable at the time, as the boilers were the largest fitted to any British locomotive to that date. After formation of the London and North Eastern Railway, the type became known as class K3 and was adopted as an LNER standard design. They got the nickname \\"Jazzers\\" after the rhythm of their exhaust beat and the unbalanced gyratory movement. Construction thumb The first ten locomotives were built at the GNR's Doncaster Works in 1920, to the design of Nigel Gresley. Six further batches were built at Doncaster and Darlington Works, Armstrong Whitworth, Robert Stephenson and Company and the North British Locomotive Company. The last few of 193 examples were delivered in 1937. Use They were excellent mixed-traffic locomotives, although their large size restricted their route availability. In their latter years they were primarily employed on vacuum-fitted freight traffic. Accidents and incidents : *On 15 June 1936, locomotive No. 4009 was hauling an express passenger train which was in a rear-end collision at , Hertfordshire due to a signalman's error. Fourteen people were killed and 29 were injured. *In July 1936, locomotive No. 2764 was involved in a serious accident at , Lincolnshire. *On 8 March 1937, locomotive No. 126 was hauling a passenger train that was derailed at , Lincolnshire due to the condition of the track. *On 25 August 1956, locomotive No. 61846 was hauling an empty stock train which ran away and crashed through the buffers at station, Yorkshire. The accident was due to the failure to connect the brake pipe between the train and locomotive. Class K5 In 1945, Edward Thompson rebuilt K3 No. 206 into a two-cylinder engine forming the LNER Class K5. No more were so treated, although some later received K5 type boilers. Numbering The original ten locomotives were numbered 1000‚Äì1009 by the GNR, and became LNER 4000‚Äì4009. Those built for the LNER were numbered haphazardly, filling in gaps in the LNER's numbering scheme. In the LNER's 1946 renumbering programme, the K3s and K5 were renumbered 1800‚Äì1992, and they later became British Railways 61800‚Äì61992. Withdrawal All were withdrawn and scrapped between 1959 and 1962; the K5 went in 1960. None have survived into preservation. Three were kept as stationary boilers until 1965. Possible Revival No original K3's survived however it was announced in September 2018 that following on from the LNER Class V4 no 3403 & LNER Class V3 projects where new engines are planned to be built a new K3 is to be built after these are completed. The number of the engine has not yet been confirmed but is expected to be a replica of an original engine since the number 61993 was allocated to the LNER Class K4's.https://www.a1steam.com/2018/09/06/v4-design-reaches-pre-launch-stage/ K3 Project to be looked at  References  ;Sources  External links  * LNER encyclopedia H4 2-6-0 locomotives Armstrong Whitworth locomotives Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives NBL locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 1920 Scrapped locomotives Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"GNR Class H4"},{"id":"2962881","text":"Vienna International Centre (before construction of the M building and the DC Towers). The Austria Center Vienna can be seen at the far left in the middle distance. Kaiserm√ºhlen/VIC station of the Vienna U-Bahn can be seen in the foreground. Austria Center Vienna The Vienna International Centre (VIC) is the campus and building complex hosting the United Nations Office at Vienna (UNOV; in German: B√ºro der Vereinten Nationen in Wien). It is colloquially also known as UNO City. Overview The VIC, designed by Austrian architect Johann Staber, was built between 1973 and 1979 just north of the river Danube. The initial idea of setting up an international organization in Vienna came from the Chancellor of Austria Dr. Bruno Kreisky. Six Y-shaped office towers surround a cylindrical conference building for a total floor area of 230,000 square metres. The highest tower (\\"A Building\\") stands 127 metres tall, enclosing 28 floors. These office towers were among the first modern skyscrapers to be built in Austria. About 5,000 people work at the VIC, which also offers catering and shopping facilities (see Commissary below) and a post office (postal code 1400 Wien). Two banks (Bank Austria, Bawag PSK and United Nations Federal Credit Union offices), travel agents and other commercial services have offices on the premises. The VIC is an extraterritorial area, exempt from the jurisdiction of local law. Complementing the early 2000s asbestos removal works in the VIC, a new conference building, previously designated ‚ÄúC2‚Äù, now termed ‚ÄúM Building‚Äù, was constructed over the existing parking deck near the southern perimeter of the campus, and put into service in 2009. The M building hosted all conferences during the renovation of the C building (previously the main conference facility) from 2009-2013. Both M and C buildings are now being used for meetings. Very large conferences can be accommodated in the neighbouring Austria Center Vienna (ACV), a separate conference and exhibition centre with a capacity of 6,000, which is with the VIC campus part of the UNO-City. The ACV has an indoor link to the VIC buildings. It is guarded by United Nations security personnel, since the VIC has exterritorial status; the ACV does not. The VIC is served by Kaiserm√ºhlen/VIC station on line U1 of the Vienna U-Bahn (underground railway). Organizations A major UN site along with New York, Geneva and Nairobi, the VIC hosts several organizations: * Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO; German: Organisation des Vertrags √ºber das umfassende Verbot von Nuklearversuchen) * International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA; German: Internationale Atomenergieorganisation, IAEO) * United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL; German: Kommission der Vereinten Nationen f√ºr internationales Handelsrecht) * United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO; German: Organisation der Vereinten Nationen f√ºr industrielle Entwicklung) * United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC; German: B√ºro der Vereinten Nationen f√ºr Drogen- und Verbrechensbek√§mpfung) * United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR; German: Hoher Fl√ºchtlingskommissar der Vereinten Nationen) * United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA; German: B√ºro der Vereinten Nationen f√ºr Weltraumfragen) * International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR; German: Internationale Kommission zum Schutz der Donau) Five other notable international organizations headquartered in Vienna, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), occupy facilities outside the VIC.

She is also noted for her speculations that the U.S. government is working with aliens. Early life She was born Linda Ann Moulton in Boise, Idaho. \\"Miss Bacon is the fourth Boisean to win the state title in 25 years. Her predecessors have included . . .

Howe entered the 1963 Miss Boise pageant for college scholarships and went on to win the 1963 Miss Idaho crown and scholarships, and participated in the Miss America 1964 pageant that year in Atlantic City. Howe received her 1965 B.A. cum laude in English Literature from the University of Colorado. In 1966, Howe was awarded the Stanley Baubaire Scholarship for her Master's Degree work at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. She received her master's degree in Communication from Stanford University in 1968, where she produced a documentary film for the Stanford Medical Center and her Master's Thesis, \\"A Picture Calculus,\\" at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. Career Howe's early work focused on environmental issues. From 1978 to 1983, Howe was Director of Special Projects at KMGH-TV, Channel 7, Denver, Colorado. Her documentaries included Poison in the Wind and A Sun Kissed Poison which compared smog pollution in Los Angeles and Denver, Fire In The Water about hydrogen as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels, and A Radioactive Water about uranium contamination of public drinking water in a Denver suburb. Howe was on staff at WCVB-TV when the station won an Institutional Peabody Award for institutional excellence in 1975. paranormal radio show host Jimmy Church. 258x258px In 1980, Howe produced A Strange Harvest, a documentary that suggested unusual wounds found on cattle are the work of extraterrestrial beings who harvest body parts required for their survival or research, and that the U.S. government is complicit. The documentary received a Regional Emmy award in 1981. Howe became known as a \\"staunch advocate\\" for these ideas, and began to focus on UFO conspiracy theories and speculate about alleged connections between cattle mutilations, UFOs and supposed government conspiracies, saying \\"I am convinced that one or more alien intelligences are affecting this planet\\". Although Howe claimed she was shown secret documents after being taken into confidence by an agent of the government, author John Greer wrote that Howe presented no evidence for such claims other than \\"the very ambiguous evidence provided by rotting cow carcasses\\". One Idaho state director of Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) called her \\"the most preeminent UFO investigator in the world\\", and she's been named as one of \\"the gurus of American ufology\\", although Howe has said she regards herself as a television producer and investigative reporter. Much of Howe's work includes speculations about what she terms \\"unexplained\\" phenomena, such as cattle mutilations, crop circles, UFO sightings and alien abductions. Howe has produced numerous UFO related programming, including a two-hour special Earth Mysteries: Alien Life Forms in association with WATL-Fox, Atlanta, was Supervising Producer and Original Concept Creator for UFO Report: Sightings financed by Paramount Studios and the Fox network in Los Angeles that was first broadcast in October 1991 and became the Sightings series on Fox. Howe appeared on a panel at UFO Disclosure press event held at the National Press Club in 2013, saying she believed \\"alien technology appears so advanced\\" that \\"space and time could be bent by outer space travelers, therefore allowing extraterrestrials to visit Earth\\". Howe has proposed that some photographs of crop circles show evidence of mysterious energy she terms \\"visible light phenomena\\". Joe Nickell described Howe as a \\"credulous journalist\\" in a 2002 article in Skeptical Inquirer magazine, saying that photos Howe published purporting to show mysterious energy are simply misinterpretations of photographic accidents, such as a camera's wrist strap reflecting the flash, or circular artifacts caused by floating dust, errors that Nickell calls \\"the stock-in-trade of ghost hunters\\". Howe was a frequent guest on Coast to Coast AM for 28 years, dating back to 2003 with George Noory, and 1991 with Art Bell. In 2019, she ended her monthly appearances on the show.

He was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and died in Zurich, Switzerland. He is not to be confused with the dipterist Richard Karl Hjalmar Frey or with the early Pennsylvania pioneer, Heinrich Frey, who is considered one of the first two German immigrants to the American Colonies see Fry family. Biography Heinrich Frey attended the gymnasium in Frankfurt am Main until he was 16. Here he met Senator Carl Heinrich Georg von Heyden (1793‚Äì1866) who introduced him to entomology. He attended the University in Frankfurt am Main, then travelled to Bonn, Berlin, and G√∂ttingen. When he returned to Frankfurt am Main in 1839 von Heyden showed him Philipp Christoph Zeller's Attempt at a Classification of the Tineinae which had just appeared in Oken's Isis. Until this publication, this group of moths had been hopelessly confused and Frey was impressed by Zeller's orderly arrangement. Returning to G√∂ttingen in 1847 he first became a private tutor, then an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù professor at the University. (An extraordinary professorial chair is one created by a university because of an application from an outside organisation that feels that a certain field is not given enough attention). In 1849, he was offered a professorial post by the University of Zurich, which he accepted. In 1851, Frey became an ordinary professor in the Medical Faculty, soon after also becoming a Professor at the confederate Polytechnikum. He also became Director of the microscopical anatomical institute and from 1854 to 1856 Rector of the High School. Frey spent the rest of his life in Switzerland.

His name is simply a description of his blazonry. He owned land in Grosli√®re and had dealings with the Knights Templar, and received a gift from the future Louis VIII. These facts are known from documents from the time. The rest of his history has been extracted from his poetry. It has generally been asserted that he taught Thibaut of Champagne the art of verse, an assumption which is based on a statement in the Chroniques de Saint-Denis: \\"Si l'est entre lui [Thibaut] et Gace Brul√© les plus belles chan√ßons et les plus delitables et melodieuses qui onque fussent ales.\\" This has been taken as evidence of collaboration between the two poets. The passage will bear the interpretation that with those of Gace the songs of Thibaut were the best hitherto known. Paulin Paris, in the Histoire litt√©raire de la France (vol. xxiii.), quotes a number of facts that fix an earlier date for Gace's songs. Some scholars believe that Gace is the author of the earliest known jeu parti, although the early twentieth-century editor of the jeux partis, Arthur Langfors, considered this to be a misattribution, based on discrepancies between manuscripts.A. L√•ngfors, A. Jeanroy and L. Brandin, eds. Recueil g√©n√©ral des jeux-partis fran√ßais, (Paris: Champion, 1926), vol 1. p.7 The interlocutors are Gace and a count of Brittany who is identified with Geoffrey of Brittany, son of Henry II of England. Gace appears to have been banished from Champagne and to have found refuge in Brittany. A deed dated 1212 attests a contract between Gatho Brusl√© (Gace Ernie) and the Templars for a piece of land in Dreux. It seems most probable that Gace died before 1220, at the latest in 1225. See Gedeon Busken Huet, Chansons de Gace Brul√©, edited for the Soci√©t√© des anciens textes fran√ßais (1902), with an exhaustive introduction. Dante quotes a song by Gace, Ire d'amor qui en mon over repaire, which he attributes erroneously to Thibaut of Champagne (De vulgari eloquentia, p. 151, ed. P Rajna, Florence, 1895).

Moffett was born at Castleknock, County Dublin, on 3 June 1820. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he was a Berkeley Gold Medallist in Logic and Metaphysics, a gold medallist in Greek, and a prizeman in Divinity and Modern History. He graduated in 1843 as Senior Moderator in Ethics and Logic. He was awarded the degree of L.L.D. by the University of Dublin in 1852. From May 1848, he held the position of headmaster of the Classical Department and professor of logic and belles lettres at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. The first professors were appointed to the newly established Queen's Colleges at Belfast, Cork and Galway in 1849, and Moffett became the foundation professor of logic and metaphysics at the Galway College. In 1863, in addition to his original chair, Moffett took over the duties of Rev. Joseph O'Leary as professor of history and English literature, the offices being combined into a single chair of history, English literature and mental science. Moffett was to occupy this chair until his retirement from academia in 1897. In 1870, Moffett succeeded William Lupton as registrar of Queen's College Galway. On the death of Edward Berwick in 1877, Moffett was appointed to succeed him as president of the college. Moffett was noted for his skill and power as an orator, and his ability to quote at will long extracts from the poems and sagas of antiquity, as well as more modern verse. Believing as he did in well-rounded education, Moffett was instrumental in the incorporation of the existing Literary and Scientific Society of Galway into the Queen's College as a debating society between 1852 and 1856. Moffett drafted the first rules for the governance within the college, and presided at the first college meeting, of the society which subsequently became the Literary and Debating Society. Moffett never believed in the restriction of education and intellectual discourse to within the walls of a college. Between 1849 and 1856, he served as Barrington Lecturer for the Dublin Statistical Society (later known as the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland). The Barrington Lectures, endowed by the Dublin businessman John Barrington from 1834, had as their objective the teaching of the principles of political economy to the lower classes in Ireland. Moffett delivered popular lectures in Ardee, Armagh, Belturbet, Clonmel, Coleraine, Derry, Downpatrick, Dublin, Dundalk, Dungannon, Galway, Holywood, Kilkenny, Lisburn, Lurgan, Trim and Waterford. He was also a stalwart of the Royal Galway Institution, an organisation set up to promote intellectual discourse among the people of Galway; he frequently delivered lectures to the Institution, and served as its president for many years up to the time of his death. Moffett was knighted in 1896, in recognition of his many years of work for the cause of education in Ireland. He was awarded the degree of D.Litt. (honoris causa) by both the Queen's University and the University of Dublin. He was a member of the Senate of the Queen's University, and, on its foundation, he was appointed to the Senate of the Royal University of Ireland. In 1899, he was nominated the last High Sheriff of Galway Town. Sir Thomas retired in 1897, having served as president of the college for twenty years, and subsequently moved to Dublin. After an illness of several weeks' duration, during which he was attended by his old student and lifelong friend Sir William Thomson, he died at his home there on 6 July 1908.

The hydroxyl group in this compound is placed in an endo position. Being chiral, borneol exists as two enantiomers. Both (+)-borneol (older name d-borneol) and (‚àí)-borneol (l-borneol) are found in nature. Reactions  Borneol is easily oxidized to the ketone (camphor). One historical name for borneol is Borneo camphor which explains the name. Occurrence  The compound was named in 1842 by the French chemist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Gerhardt.C. Gerhardt (1842) \\"Sur la transformation de l'essence de val√©riane en camphre de Born√©o et en camphre des laurin√©es\\" (On the transformation of the essence of valerian into Borneo camphor and into laurel camphor), Comptes rendus, 14 : 832-835.

Dietland Muller- Schwarze, 2003, page 43 (book at google books) =Synthesis= Borneol can be synthesized by reduction of camphor by the Meerwein‚ÄìPonndorf‚ÄìVerley reduction (a reversible process). Reduction of camphor with sodium borohydride (fast and irreversible) gives instead the isomer isoborneol as the kinetically controlled reaction product. :Synthesis of the borneol isomer isoborneol via reduction of camphor.  Uses  Whereas d-borneol was the enantiomer that used to be the most readily available commercially, the more commercially available enantiomer now is l-borneol, which also occurs in nature. Borneol is used in traditional Chinese medicine. An early description is found in the Bencao Gangmu. Borneol is a component of many essential oilsPlants containing borneol (Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases)] and it is a natural insect repellent. Laevo-borneol is used as an aroma chemical in perfumery. It has a balsamic odour type with pine, woody and camphoraceous facets. = Use in organic chemistry = Derivatives of isoborneol are used as ligands in asymmetric synthesis: * (2S)-(‚àí)-3-exo-(morpholino)isoborneol or MIB with a morpholine substituent in the Œ±-hydroxyl position. * (2S)-(‚àí)-3-exo-(dimethylamino)isoborneol or DAIB with a dimethylamino substituent in the Œ±-hydroxyl position  Toxicology  Borneol may cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation; it is harmful if swallowed.Material Safety Data Sheet, Fisher Scientific = Skin Irritation = Borneol has been shown to have little to no irritation effect when applied to the human skin at a small dose. However, a long term exposure to borneol may cause mild irritation.HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE FACT SHEET = Phototoxicity and photoallergy = Since Borneol does not absorb UV light at 290 nm to 400 nm, it would not have to potential to evoke any phototoxicity or photoallergy. Derivatives The bornyl group is a univalent radical C10H17 derived from borneol by removal of hydroxyl and is also known as 2-bornyl. Isobornyl is the univalent radical C10H17 that is derived from isoborneol. The structural isomer fenchol is also a widely used compound derived from certain essential oils.

Early life and career Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Dick Jones was sixteen years old when he became involved in the fledgling film industry in his hometown with the Atlas film company. A technician, Jones worked in the film laboratory and other departments but his real interest lay behind the camera, creating the visual product. With the industry's shift to Hollywood, in 1915 he joined Mack Sennett at his Keystone Studios where he put together a few scripts and was given the opportunity to direct. Initially his directorial work was difficult but he dedicated himself to learning the job. Jones first came to prominence when Mabel Normand promoted him to co-direct the troubled feature Mickey (released 1918). The film was a major success and Normand always credited Jones with having rescued the project. He gained a solid reputation among his peers after directing Mabel Normand in Molly O' (1921). Unfortunately, the film came out after the murder of William Desmond Taylor and many movie-goers boycotted the film because of the negative publicity surrounding Normand's involvement in the matter. While at Keystone, Dick Jones met and married Irene Lentz, a young actress who would go on to become one of Hollywood's leading costume designers. In 1923 Dick Jones began producing films but after directing and/or producing forty-five films for Keystone, including feature-length productions, in 1925 he was lured away from Hal Roach Studios. Although he directed films for Roach, Dick Jones worked mainly as an executive coordinator, serving as a production supervisor and a supervising director. In 1926, Jones was responsible for signing Mabel Normand to a contract with Roach Studios after health and drug addiction problems had kept the star actress out of films for three years. He would direct or produce Normand in all five of her films made at Roach Studios until her permanent retirement in 1927. As well, during his time with Roach, Jones worked on nineteen different film projects with Stan Laurel. In later years, Laurel would state that it was Dick Jones who taught him everything about comedy filmmaking. Leaving Roach Studios at the end of 1927, Jones directed Douglas Fairbanks in the highly acclaimed adventure epic The Gaucho. Now much in demand for his skills and filmmaking versatility, in 1928 Jones signed on with Paramount Pictures where he directed three productions ‚Äì including The Water Hole (1928) with Nancy Carroll ‚Äì before accepting an offer from producer Samuel Goldwyn in 1929 to direct talking films. Dick Jones' first talkie was a mystery/thriller starring Ronald Colman and Joan Bennett titled Bulldog Drummond (1929). At a time when a number of prominent silent film directors could not make the transition to sound, Jones' first effort was heralded for its quality and his future looked bright. Illness and death However, Jones soon fell ill, possibly from tuberculosis that ravaged Los Angeles in the early 1930s and that would claim the lives of stars such as Normand and Ren√©e Ador√©e. F. Richard Jones died in 1930 at the age of thirty-seven. He left behind a widow, designer Irene Lentz, two former wives, Carol and Josephine, and a daughter, Dickey. He is interred in the Great Mausoleum, Florentine Columbarium, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Following the 1962 death of his wife Irene, she was interred next to him.

It is known for copper mining. Traditionally, the term Copperbelt includes the mining regions of Zambia's Copperbelt Province (notably the towns of Ndola, Kitwe, Chingola, Luanshya, and Mufulira in particular) and the Congo's Haut-Katanga and Lualaba provinces (notably Lubumbashi, Kolwezi, and Likasi). In some contexts the term may exclude the Congo entirely.  History  Rwandan migrant workers in a Congolese copper mine, 1920, during the Belgian colonial period Copperbelt mining centers Pre-colonial copper coin from the Katanga Province. These coins are no longer produced, but those remaining are used symbolically among traditional families for the payment of dowry (along with money and other goods). The Western discovery of copper in Zambia is partly due to American scout Frederick Russell Burnham. In 1895 he led the Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition, which determined that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa. Along the Kafue River in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered natives wearing copper bracelets. In his report to the British South Africa Company Burnham said about the region: > About 200 miles north of the Falls on the Incalla river, and twelve miles > from the Kafukwe (Ed: now known as the Kafue River) and still on the high > plateau is probably one of the greatest copper fields on the continent. The > natives have worked this ore for ages, as can be seen by their old dumps, > and they work it to-day. The field is very extensive, and reaches away to > Katanga... The natives inhabiting this part of the country are skilled > workmen, and have traded their handiwork with all comers, even as far afield > as the Portuguese of the West Coast and the Arabs of the East. These > natives, being miners and workers of copper and iron, and being permanently > located in the ground, would give the very element needed in developing > these fields. > The increasing use of copper bids fair to make it one of the most valuable > products a country can have.... The copper mines of Montana and Arizona have > proven of more value than the gold mines, regardless of the fact that the > copper had to be hauled two thousand miles by rail to the seaboard, and the > coal and coke to smelt it hauled hundreds of miles to the mines. So far as > natural difficulties are concerned, this northern field can be fed from the > coal deposits of the valley of the Zambezi (Ed: Burnham had previously > discovered the massive coal fields at Hwange), and the product shipped to > the East Coast at a less expense than the product of Montana and Arizona can > be laid on the dock at New York. Many years later, the British South Africa Company built towns along the river and a railroad to transport the copper through Mozambique.  Prehistory  The Copperbelt was inhabited by many prehistoric groups including the Chondwe Group whose pottery resembles that of Luangwa vessels found today in the Kalambo Falls region. Geology During the 1950s, this was the largest copper producing area in the world, and included the Roan Antelope Mine, Nkana Mine, the Nchanga Mines, the Mufulira Mine, and the Rokana Mine. Chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite are found in the metamorphosed calcareous shales and arkoses of the Lower Roan Formation in the Katanga System.

Its dramatic situation, atop a crag of Lady Hill, commands wide views over the surrounding countryside. The tower is located at grid reference , just west of Sandyknowe farm, and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. In June, 2007 it was awarded the maximum \\"five-star\\" status as a tourist attraction from VisitScotland, a rating bestowed on only eight other sites in Scotland. History The ruins of the west barmkin of the tower Smailholm Tower was originally built in the 15th century or early 16th century by the Pringle family.Lindsay (1986), and Salter (1994) suggest the early 16th century (1997) gives the construction date as 'mid 15th century'. This family, originally spelt Hoppringle, who were followers of the Earl of Douglas, held the lands of Smailholm from the early 15th century, and managed part of Ettrick Forest for their feudal superior. The suffix \\"-holm\\" stands for little island; and \\"Smail\\" might be Smale, Smail, Smaile, Small, Smalles, Smalls, and Smeal(l), derived from the Old English pre-7th Century \\"Smael\\" meaning \\"small, slender or thin\\", and was originally given as a nickname to one of slight stature. In December 1482 James Hoppringill of Smailholm, son of David Hoppingrill, was sued for 300 merks by Margaret Kerr.Acts of the Lords Auditors of Causes and Complaints (Edinburgh, 1839), p. 105. Smailholm Tower was designed, in common with all Scottish peel towers, to provide its occupants with protection from sporadic English raids. The tower was attacked by English soldiers in 1543, 1544 and again in 1546, when the garrison of Wark Castle sacked the tower and carried off prisoners and cattle. The castle was successfully defended against the English in 1640, by Sir Andrew Ker of Greenhead. Smailholm was obtained by the Scotts of Harden around this time.Salter states the Scotts obtained the property by marriage, while Coventry (2001) suggests the property was sold to the Scotts in 1645. The Scotts ‚Äì ancestors of Sir Walter ‚Äì rebuilt parts of the tower and barmkin. In the 18th century the tower decayed, following the family's move into nearby Sandyknowe. The last owner, the Earl of Ellesmere, handed the property into state care in 1950. It was restored in the 1980s, and now operates as a museum. The tower Smailholm was a relatively small tower house, offering around 200 m2 of floorspace, later extended by construction of a hall house and second kitchen within the barmkin, or courtyard. Smailholm Tower from the north-west The rectangular tower is of four storeys, situated on top of a rocky outcrop. The tower is approximately 12.1 m by 9.4 m, with basalt rubble walls 2.4 m thick. The vaulted basement was originally divided into two floors by a wooden √©ntresol reached by a ladder. The door is on the south side, in a large red sandstone arch, with the turnpike stair in the south-east corner. Above the vault is the hall, with a fireplace to the north featuring a carved human face. The top floor has an unusual elliptical stone vault which supports a stone flag roof. Parapet walks run along the longer north and south sides, although both are interrupted ‚Äì the north by a chimney and the south by a window. These upper parts of the tower, including a gunloop in the west gable covering the barmkin, were remodelled in the 17th century. The tower is surrounded by the remains of a stone barmkin wall, within which the ruins of outbuildings and a small chapel are still visible. The east part of the barmkin once contained a small garden, all of which is now gone. The western barmkin is more intact, with walls up to first floor level around the narrow entrance in the west wall. The courtyard, around 16 m by 19 m, contains the foundations of a single-storey hall house of the 17th century to the north, and a two-roomed kitchen block to the south. A ditch protects the western approach to the tower, the other three sides being naturally protected by the face of the outcrop. One hundred metres to the southeast, more earthworks mark the presence of a much older settlement, probably dating from the first millennium BC.NMRS Site Reference NT63SW 1 . Smailholm Tower is now used to display an extensive array of model people illustrating the history of Smailholm and the stories of Walter Scott, a display created by two local artists and employing high-quality embroidery and modelling techniques. From 2006, experiments were conducted on the roof to establish the most suitable damp-proofing method to apply to other such properties, including the planting of turf or mats of sedum plants. As a result of this, a restoration project in 2010/11 reinstated a turf roof over the entire structure. Sir Walter Scott The tower provided inspiration to Sir Walter Scott, who visited his paternal grandfather here when still a boy. Scott spent considerable time at the tower during his youth, reportedly for the benefit of his health. Smailholm provides the setting for Scott's ballad The Eve of St John, and also appears in Marmion. As a result of Scott's poetry, his uncle restored the tower, making it safe, around 1800. Turner visited Smailholm with Scott in the author's later years; his sketch of the tower was included in Scott's Poetical Works. Turner's journey with Scott traced scenes from Marmion, and not long after this, the pioneer of photography Fox Talbot repeated Turner's itinerary, publishing what is considered to be the first photographic travelogue or tourist coffee-table book, Sun Pictures in Scotland in homage to both Scott and Turner. In popular culture Smailholm Tower was the centerpiece of the children's adventure novel In the Keep of Time by Margaret J. Anderson, in which four English children staying with their aged Aunt Grace travel through time by means of a magical key, first to the time of James II, then to a future after the fall of civilization. It also features in the book Smailhom by C.L. Williams, in which thirteen-year-old Wynn discovers a miniature village hidden close to Smailholm Tower.

He was created by E. Nelson Bridwell and Ramona Fradon, first appearing in a cameo in Super Friends #12 (June‚ÄìJuly 1978). Nommo made his appearance in the 2014 television series Constantine by Charles Parnell. Publication history Doctor Mist has appeared in the pages of Super Friends, DC Comics Presents, Infinity, Inc., Justice League International, Justice League Quarterly, Blue Beetle and Primal Force. Fictional character biography =Origin= Nommo, the wizard-king of the African empire of Kor, stood in the Pillar of Life and was endowed with immortality. He later took the name Doctor Mist. =Global Guardians (Pre-Crisis)= Doctor Mist gathers a number of international heroes to help the Super Friends battle the Conqueror. Later, Superman teams with several international heroes at Doctor Mist's request. He is the one who first gives them the name The Global Guardians. Superman and several of the Guardians would team up to fight against the threat of Thaumar Dhai and the squad of powerful wizards who worship him. Dhai was defeated when his objects of power turned out to be Superman-created fakeries. The team later fights against the Shadow Demons in the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Most of the Pre-Crisis history of the Global Guardians is no longer in the mainstream continuity of the DC Comics universe. =Global Guardians (Post-Crisis)= In 1957, the newly formed European Economic Community established the Dome, a supra-national police organization. At some later point Doctor Mist formed the Global Guardians to serve as a task force for the Dome. Decades later, the Dome lost its funding when, in part because of the political machinations of Dr. Klaus Cornelius, the United Nations decided to close the Dome and instead fund the new Justice League International. The Global Guardians then fractured with Doctor Mist and his assistant Belphegor, disappearing. Queen Bee of Bialya rebuilt the Dome in her country. She then brainwashed the Global Guardians into her service also creating an android Doctor Mist to lead the team. Later on, Doctor Mist reappeared and helped Guardian members Jack O'Lantern and Owlwoman escape Bialya. Doctor Mist recruited a team to free the rest of the Guardians from Bialya mind control and then reformed the Global Guardians, building a new Dome headquarters somewhere in the Pacific. =Primal Force= An eternal, Mist's physical body was slain by an ancient force. Nonetheless, he did turn up alive and seemingly well after the Zero Hour crisis. At this time, calling himself Maltis, he formed a new team of heroes known as the Leymen. The group was short-lived. Maltis' time on the team even shorter as he had a heart attack soon after the team formed. Later, he was seemingly killed after being thrown into a pool of acid by the evil Mordru. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Steve Trevor first mentions Mist as a government operative, having a hand in watching the Black Room, a secretive government vault where mystical artifacts are stored.DC Comics: The New 52 Free Comic Book Day Special Trevor sends the Justice League Dark to rescue Mist after he is captured while infiltrating Felix Faust's cult in South America. Mist appears to have an existing friendship with Black Orchid, one of Trevor's other magical operatives.Justice League Dark #9 However it is then revealed that Mist has been working for Faust all along, as Mist sends a magical blast straight into John Constantine's brain.Justice League Dark #11 Mist had been a double agent all along, designed to get Faust into the Black Room. In the end, Faust had promised to return Mist's deceased wife back to him.Justice League Dark #12 (August 22, 2012) Powers and abilities As a result of his exposure to the Pillar of Life, Doctor Mist was endowed with immortality. He can also cast spells of illusion and enchantment, and according to one of his origins use to craft magical gems. In other media Doctor Mist, under his real name Nommo, appears in the Constantine episode \\"A Feast of Friends\\", portrayed by Charles Parnell. He is depicted as a shaman who helps John track a hunger demon by entering a hallucinogenic state using a drug called \\"mist\\". After the hunger demon Mnemoth began a rampage, John Constantine contacted Nommo to find a way to defeat it. They used the strong psychedelic drug The Mist to trace its origins, before Nommo gave Constantine and himself the Nectar of Nhialic to counteract the trip.

His father, William I de Cantilupe,British History Online Bishops of Worcester accessed on 3 November 2007 and his elder brother William II de Cantilupe were named by Roger of Wendover among the evil counsellors of King John of England, apparently for no better reason than that they were consistently loyal to an unpopular master. Cantilupe at first followed in his father's footsteps, entering the service of the Exchequer and acting as an itinerant Justice in the early years of Henry III. But Cantilupe also took minor holy orders, and, in 1236, although not yet a deacon, received the see of Worcester. He was elected on 30 August 1236 and was consecrated on 3 May 1237.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 279 He was ordained a deacon on 4 April 1237 and a priest on 18 April 1237. Bishop As bishop, Cantilupe identified himself with the party of ecclesiastical reform, which was then led by Edmund Rich and Robert Grosseteste. Like his leaders he was sorely divided between his theoretical belief in the papacy as a divine institution and his instinctive condemnation of the policy which Pope Gregory IX and Pope Innocent IV pursued in their dealings with the English church. At first a court favorite, Cantilupe came at length to the belief that the evils of the time arose from the unprincipled alliance of crown and papacy. In 1240 Cantilupe conducted the significant Synod of Worcester, advancing many reforms for the church. Cantilupe raised his voice against papal demands for money, and after the death of Grosseteste in 1253 was the chief spokesman of the nationalist clergy. At the parliament of Oxford in 1258 he was elected by the popular party as one of their representatives on the committee of twenty-four which undertook to reform the administration; from that time until the outbreak of civil war he was a man of mark in the councils of the baronial party. During the war he sided with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and, through his nephew, Thomas de Cantilupe, who was then Chancellor of Oxford University, brought over the university to the popular side. Cantilupe was present at the Battle of Lewes and blessed the Montfortians before they joined battle with the army of the king; he entertained de Montfort on the night before the final rout and defeat of the Battle of Evesham. During Montfort's rule Cantilupe appeared only as a mediating influence; in the triumvirate of electors who controlled the administration, the clergy were represented by the Bishop of Chichester. Death and legacy Cantilupe died on 12 February 1266. He was respected by all parties, and, though far inferior in versatility and force of will to Grosseteste, fully merits the admiration which his moral character inspired. He is one of the few constitutionalists of his day whom it is impossible to accuse of interested motives.

The mats give off a mild shock at a low electric current when stepped on, deterring animals from crossing over them. In October 2005, the municipal airport in Wasilla, Alaska, a town about 40 miles (65 km) north of Anchorage, installed mats around the airfield to prevent moose from walking onto the runway and colliding with aircraft. The government of Arizona installed electro-mats in combination with electric fences and ramps in Tijeras Canyon in 2007 in an effort to deter wildlife from crossing at unsafe locations along Interstate 40 and New Mexico State Road 333. In 2011, Parks Canada began a 5-year study to determine the feasibility of deploying electro-mats along the CP Rail lines inside Banff National Park. A large number of animals, including 12 grizzly bears, 30 black bears, 8 wolves, and over 300 ungulates were known to have died on the tracks between 2004-2013, and it was hoped that the use of the mats would be able to sufficiently deter wildlife and reduce those numbers.

He flourished during the sixth century, which is considered to be the \\"Golden Age\\" of Byzantine hymnography. Life The main source of information about the life of Romanos comes from the Menaion for October. Beyond this, his name is mentioned by only two other ancient sources. once in the eighth-century poet St. Germanos and once in the Souda (s. v. anaklomenon) where he is called \\"Romanos the melodist\\". From this scanty evidence we learn that he was born to a Jewish family in either Emesa (modern- day Homs) or Damascus in Syria. He was baptized as a young boy (though whether or not his parents also converted is uncertain). Having moved to Berytus (Beirut), he was ordained a deacon in the Church of the Resurrection there. He later moved to Constantinople during the reign of the emperor Anastasius‚Äîon the question whether Anastasius I (491-518) or Anastasius II (713-716) is meant, the renowned Byzantinologist Prof. Karl Krumbacher favours the earlier date.Krumbacher, Gesch. d. byz. Literatur, (Munich, 1897), pp. 312-18. There he served as sacristan in the \\"Great Church\\" (Hagia Sophia), residing to the end of his life at the Monastery of Kyros, where he was buried along with his disciple St. Ananias. If those scholars who believe that he lived during the reign of the earlier Anastasius are correct, then he may have continued writing during the reign of Emperor Justinian (527-65), who was himself a hymn-writer; this would make him a contemporary of two other famous Byzantine hymnographers, Anastasios and Kyriakos. Legend According to legend, Romanus was not at first considered to be either a talented reader or singer. He was, however, loved by the Patriarch of Constantinople because of his great humility. Once, around the year 518, while serving in the Church of the Panagia at Blachernae, during the All-Night Vigil for the Feast of the Nativity of Christ, he was assigned to read the kathisma verses from the Psalter. He read so poorly that another reader had to take his place. Some of the lesser clergy ridiculed Romanus for this, and being humiliated he sat down in one of the choir stalls. Overcome by weariness and sorrow, he soon fell asleep. As he slept, the Theotokos (Mother of God) appeared to him with a scroll in her hand. She commanded him to eat the scroll, and as soon as he did so, he awoke. He immediately received a blessing from the Patriarch, mounted the ambo (pulpit), and chanted extemporaneously his famous Kontakion of the Nativity, \\"Today the Virgin gives birth to Him Who is above all being‚Ä¶.\\" The emperor, the patriarch, the clergy, and the entire congregation were amazed at both the profound theology of the hymn and Romanos' clear, sonorous voice as he sang. According to tradition, this was the very first kontakion ever sung. The Greek word \\"kontakion\\" () refers to the shaft on which a scroll is wound, hence the significance of the Theotokos' command for him to swallow a scroll, indicating that his compositions were by divine inspiration. The scene of Romanos's first performance is often shown in the lower register of Pokrov icons (example above).Neil K. Moran; Singers in Late Byzantine and Slavonic Painting, p. 126ff, BRILL, 1986, Works Romanos and Virgin Mary, Miniature from the Menologion of Basil II Romanos wrote in an Atticized literary koine‚Äîi.e., he had a popular, but elevated style‚Äîand abundant Semiticisms support the view that he was of Jewish origin. Arresting imagery, sharp metaphors and similes, bold comparisons, antitheses, coining of successful maxims, and vivid dramatization characterize his style. He is said to have composed more than 1,000 hymns or kontakia celebrating various festivals of the ecclesiastical year, the lives of the saints and other sacred subjects, some 60 to 80 of which survive (though not all those attributed to him may be genuine). Today, usually only the first strophe of each kontakion is chanted during the divine services, the full hymn having been replaced by the canon. A full kontakion was a poetic sermon composed of from 18 to 30 verses or ikoi, each with a refrain, and united by an acrostic. When it was sung to an original melody, it was called an idiomelon. Originally, Saint Romanos' works were known simply as \\"psalms\\", \\"odes\\", or \\"poems\\". It was only in the ninth century that the term kontakion came into use. Among his known works are kontakia on: *The Nativity of Christ *The Martyrdom of St Stephen *The Death of a Monk *The Last Judgment *The Prodigal Son *The Raising of Lazarus (for Lazarus Saturday, the day before Palm Sunday) *Adam's Lament (for Palm Sunday) *The Treachery of Judas His Kontakion of the Nativity is still considered to be his masterpiece, and up until the twelfth century it was sung every year at the imperial banquet on that feast by the joint choirs of Hagia Sophia and of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Most of the poem takes the form of a dialogue between the Mother of God and the Magi, whose visit to the newborn Christ Child is celebrated in the Byzantine rite on 25 December, rather than on the 6th of January when Western Christians celebrate the visit (in the Orthodox Church, January 6, the Feast of the Theophany, celebrates the Baptism of Christ). Of his other Kontakia, one of the most well-known is the hymn, \\"My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...\\" which is chanted as part of the service of the \\"Great Canon\\" of St. Andrew of Crete on the fifth Thursday of Great Lent. Romanos is one of many persons who have been credited with composing the famous Akathist Hymn to the Theotokos, which is still sung during Great Lent. Most recent scholarship has asserted that he is not the author of the hymn, although there is significant dissent among scholars.See page 81, note 13 in Sarah Gador-Whyte, ‚ÄúChanging Conceptions of Mary in Sixth- Century Byzantium: The Kontakia of Romanos the Melodist,‚Äù in Questions of Gender in Byzantine Society, edited by Bronwen Neil and Lynda Garland, 77‚Äì92 (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013). Prof Krumbacher published in Munich several previously unpublished chants of Romanos and other hymnographers, from manuscripts discovered in the library of the Monastery of St John the Theologian in Patmos. There exists in the library of Moscow a Greek manuscript which contains kontakia and oikoi for the whole year, but does not include all compositions of Romanos. Professor Krumbacher says of his work: > In poetic talent, fire of inspiration, depth of feeling, and elevation of > language, he far surpasses all the other melodes. The literary history of > the future will perhaps acclaim Romanos for the greatest ecclesiastical poet > of all ages. Iconographic depiction :For further information, see the Attributes section of the infobox at the top of this page. Although in more recent icons Saint Romanos is depicted standing on the ambo (directly in front of the iconostasis) and wearing a deacon's sticharion, the famous Russian church musicologist, Johann von Gardner, points out that in the oldest icons he is portrayed wearing the shorter red tunic of a singer and standing on a raised platform in the middle of the church. In the Eastern Church, Saint Romanos is the patron saint of church singers. Editions and translations *Sancti Romani Melodi Cantica. Vol. 1: Cantica Genuina. ‚Äì Vol. 2: Cantica Dubia.

He wears the ring of Solomon that gives him wisdom and allows him to teleport short distances, and the mantle of Elijah that protects him from harm. The Staff of Moses can extend to whatever length he needed, and can transform into a serpent and manipulate water. Additionally, he sports long hair which he believes grants him super strength like Samson. He apparently can request spectacular miracles from \\"a higher power\\" as he needs them. For instance, in a Pre-Crisis adventure, he was battling villains who threatened to blow up a desalination plant while several children were being held hostage with the villains threatening to kill them. With no alternative, Seraph personally beseeched this higher power to temporarily stop the flow of time. Although the villains shot at their hostages just when that request was made, it was granted and all time stopped except for Seraph who disarmed the bomb and covered the children with his cloak to protect them from the weapons fire before allowing time to resume and defeat his enemies.

Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina has a long history, the first classifiable higher-education institution having been established a school of Sufi philosophy by Gazi Husrev-beg in 1531, with numerous other religious schools following suit over time. In 1887, under de facto Austro-Hungarian Empire control, a Sharia Law School began a five-year program.University of Sarajevo on Sarajevo official web site In the 1940s the University of Sarajevo became the city's first secular higher education institute. In the 1950s post-bachelaurate graduate degrees became available.History of University of Sarajevo Severely damaged during the war, it was recently rebuilt in partnership with more than 40 other universities. There are various other institutions of higher education, including: University of Banja Luka, University of Mostar, University of Tuzla, University of Zenica, University of East Sarajevo, University \\"D≈æemal Bijediƒá\\" of Mostar, University of Bihaƒá, American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region. The education system is made of up of three levels: * Primary school * Secondary levels * University education  Primary education  Primary education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is compulsory and free for all children from ages 6 through 15 and lasts for nine years in three three-year cycles (ages 6‚Äì9; 9‚Äì12 and 12‚Äì15). This system was firstly adopted in 2004, as a replacement for the old eight-year primary education system, offered to children from ages 6 through 14 in two four-year cycles (ages 6‚Äì10 and 10‚Äì14), which is however still valid for children who began education before 2004 and also in some regions after that date.  Secondary education  Secondary education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also free. It is provided by general and technical secondary schools, where studies begin at the age of 15 (or 14, as part of the old education system) and last for three or four years. Most children in Bosnia start school when they are six years old and finish high school when they are eighteen or nineteen. Students who have graduated from general secondary schools (Gimnazija) get the Matura and opt to enroll in any faculty or college after passing a qualification examination given by the institution while students who graduated from technical schools get a diploma.  Tertiary education  The University of Sarajevo dean's office building Bosnia Herzegovina's higher education system comprises ten universities (University of Sarajevo, University of Tuzla, University of Mostar, University of Banja Luka, University \\"D≈æemal Bijediƒá\\" of Mostar, University of East Sarajevo, University of Bihac, University of Modern Science-CKM and the University of Zenica) with some 90 faculties, which are treated as higher education establishments, and art academies. University degrees are acquired at the faculties and arts academies. There are 37 private higher education institutions and the law on higher education (passed in July 2007) treats private and public higher education institutions equally. Under the new law, university education is organized according to the system of transferable points and has three levels: * The undergraduate courses typically last for three to four years and bring 180 to 240 ECTS points. Upon the completion of the undergraduate courses, students are awarded the title of Bachelor of Arts or Science. * Postgraduate courses, which last for two years, carry 120 ECTS points and award the degree of Master of Art or Science. * PhD courses can be taken after completing a postgraduate university course. They typically last three years, and the academic title of Doctor of Science or Doctor of Arts is awarded upon completion. The university can also offer postgraduate specialist courses which last for one to two years, by which one can acquire the title of a specialist in a certain specialist field such as medicine. In accordance with laws and regulations, higher education institutions are funded by the corresponding RS or FBIH authorities. Higher education activities are thus governed by either RS or FBIH legislation, with the state level Ministry of Civil Affairs assuming the task of coordinating the higher education activities of the two entities. One of the main prerequisites for reform was the adoption of the higher education law in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following its adoption, many challenges such as the establishment of ENIC institutions and a financing council will need to be addressed. Reforms within universities themselves will represent a challenge -- for example, the introduction and implementation of the ECTS and diploma supplements, as well as other Bologna process initiatives.

Three other Canadian players also left the team as well, and the Canadian press at the time considered them \\"deserters\\". Hadfield blamed series promoter Alan Eagleson for not holding a press conference to come to their defense. Otherwise, there was no lasting animosity about the decision to leave, as Hadfield and the others had the full support and respect of the coaches and teammates, and the four are welcomed members at alumni events. Hadfield's LW position was filled by Dennis Hull of the Chicago Blackhawks. Breakup The line was broken up in 1974 when Vic Hadfield was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Nick Beverley. The following season Jean Ratelle was traded along with defenseman Brad Park and Joe Zanussi to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Carol Vadnais and Phil Esposito. At the time, this was considered the biggest blockbuster trade in NHL history. Ratelle finished his career as a Bruin, winning his second Lady Byng trophy and reaching the Stanley Cup finals in 1977 and 1978. Gilbert remained with the Rangers for the rest of his career. Throughout his career, he had been wearing the number '7', but so had Phil Esposito. As a result, a bitter disagreement ensued as to who would retain the number '7'. Gilbert was the winner of the argument, but the two remained in a discord that created many unpleasant moments, on and off the ice. Gilbert's number '7' was subsequently retired by the Rangers. Hadfield finished his career with the Penguins where he had two more 30 goal seasons. Presently, Rod Gilbert writes a weekly column for a New York publication and resides in the Hamptons' quaint village of Sag Harbor. On February 25, 2018, Ratelle's number '19' was retired by the Rangers. During the ceremony, Ratelle and Gilbert announced that Hadfield's '11' would be retired during the 2018-19 NHL season.

Fictional character biography =Jeremy Wakefield= Tuatara's first appearance took place in Super Friends #8 (November 1977), which is set outside the mainstream DC Comics continuity. Jeremy Wakefield is a young New Zealander who can see through time with the help of a third eye. He explained that with two eyes, we can see three dimensions and with three eyes through four dimensions. The fourth dimension is time. He thus named himself after the tuatara, a reptile with a parietal eye or \\"third eye\\". In his first mission he helped the Red Tornado dismantle a bomb in the Prehistoric Era. After aiding the Super Friends fight against a time menace, Tuatura becomes a member of the Global Guardians. Tuatara's first mainstream appearance was in Justice League International vol. 1, #12 (April 1988). A few years later, the Global Guardians are all brainwashed into service under the Queen Bee of Bialya. Tuatara, Rising Sun and Wild Huntsman are sent off on specific missions to attack Nazi strongholds and Justice League members. Tuatara is sent to attack a Neo-Nazi fringe group based in Dover, England. The Justice League members Metamorpho, Elongated Man and Flash were traveling to the site on a ferry when they encounter Tuatara. He had sneaked aboard the ferry itself. The battle, which takes place mostly underwater, is ended when he is wrapped up in the Elongated Man's body. He is taken to the surface, calls the League members 'Nazis' and soon falls into a coma. He is taken care of at an Australian medical facility, paid for by the Justice League. A little bit before he was to move to the Justice League International embassy medical ward, the Queen Bee sends a signal to awaken him. He vanishes, which angers his Australian friend, the Tasmanian Devil. He returns to Bialya, along with Rising Sun and Wild Huntsman, who had awakened at the same time as he. All three are duly brainwashed. Tuatara and his friends escape this brainwashing after several battles with the Justice League and with other Guardians. All is not well. The new ruler of Bialya, President Harjavti, is just as dangerous and deadly as the Queen Bee. Rising Sun has left for Japan and Owlwoman has vanished. Unknown to them, Tuatara and his remaining friends are in constant danger, as Harjavti struggles to keep control of the team. Owlwoman eventually hunts down Doctor Mist and the original Jack O'Lantern. With his assistance, the Guardians escape from under the thumb of Bialya. Tuatara's last appearance was in Justice League Quarterly #17 (winter 1994). The Guardians are now based out of a South Pacific island and Tuatara is not doing well at all. He comes to believe he is going insane as a result of losing control of his precognition powers. His friends, scattered across the world, are attacked by Fain Y'onia. Godiva and Impala lose their powers. Olympian is badly injured. Bushmaster is outright killed as a result of his confrontation. Those able to fight gather in the Arizona desert. When Fain attempts to attack Owlwoman, they ambush him. This attempt does not go well. Thunderlord is killed and Tuatara takes a blow to the face. The Wild Huntsman takes Fain out of this reality. Due to his injuries, Tuatara falls into a coma. His medical care is supervised by the former Guardians member Seraph. =Tuatara II= A second Tuatara appears as an associate of the Silicon Syndicate.Birds of Prey #117. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Tuatara is a mutant born with the three eyes. The third eye somehow gives Tuatara the ability to see into the past and into future, allowing him to prevent events before they occur. This power also assists him in hand-to-hand combat.

Variants with standard board and/or tiles  =Anagrab= Anagrab is a word game which is usually played with Scrabble tiles. The name is an amalgam of the words 'anagram' (the basic game mechanism) and 'grab' - because a player's words may at any time be 'grabbed' by opponents. The game was first described in 1976 in Richard Sharp's The Best Games People Play,Sharp, Richard, The Best Games People Play London: Ward Lock Limited. but his description suggests that he did not invent it. Game play Letter tiles are placed face down and turned over one at a time. At any point (there are no turns) any player may call out a word of at least four letters. This word can be made either entirely from the pool of letters, or by adding at least one new letter to an existing word. If the new word is acceptable the person who said the word first takes the letters and places them in front of him or her. When making a new word the root of the existing word must be changed - for example you may not add a D to the word LIVE to make LIVED. All the letters in an existing word must be included in the new one, plus at least one more. When a new letter is turned over, the first person to say a valid word takes it. If more than one is said at the same time the longer word takes it. If the two are the same length (or the same word) then that word(s) are banned for the rest of the game and nobody takes it. Scoring Sharp suggests that the score for each word is the face value of the tiles multiplied by the number of letters in that word. In practice any reasonable system, such as totaling the number of letters held, is acceptable. =Anagrams= A game of Snatch in progress Anagrams (also called Snatch or Snatch-words) is a fast-paced, non-turn-based Scrabble variant played without a board. The tiles are placed face-down in the middle of the table, and players take turns flipping a single tile, leaving it in clear view of all players. Otherwise the game is not turn-based, and the rules are very simple: any player who sees a Scrabble-valid word can call it out, take the letters, and lay the word out in front of herself. At the end of the game each player's collection of individual words is scored. To create the words, players can: * take whole words (of 3 or more letters) from the communal pool of exposed, unused letters; * add letters to an existing word on the table‚Äîwhether their own or any opponent's. (Therefore, even if a player has found a word and placed it in front of herself, it can be stolen at any time if someone can combine its tiles with any loose tiles to make a new valid word. For example, if Sally already has SATE in front of her and a G comes up in the pool, any player can steal it by calling out \\"GATES\\". Sally can prevent the theft by calling out the word herself.); * take multiple words from the table and combine them with a letter (or letters) from the pool to create a new word. (For example, a player may combine his own CART with his opponent's HER and the letter S from the pool to create CHARTERS. You cannot simply combine existing words without adding at least one extra letter.) A version of the game seems to be popular among tournament Scrabble players. Writers John Ciardi, James Merrill, John Malcolm Brinnin, and Richard Wilbur reputedly played together regularly in Key West, Florida, with novelist John Hersey also sometimes sitting in.Hills, Rust, \\"Wordplay\\" an article in Esquire; March 1996, Vol. 125, Issue 3 =Clabbers= Clabbers Clabbers is the best known variant to tournament Scrabble players. All of the rules are identical to Scrabble with one exception: words played only have to be anagrams of real words. For example, MPORCTEU is a valid play in Clabbers because it is an anagram of COMPUTER. The increased ability to play parallel to pre-existing words makes for much higher scores. A variant of this is Multi-Anagram Clabbers, in which players receive the basic score for any set of letters played multiplied by the number of valid anagrams for that set of letters. Opponents may \\"steal\\" points, once the initial player has declared their turn complete, by announcing other anagrams that the first player neglected to mention. In finding such anagrams, the blank must be declared as only one letter and may not change. For example, with a rack of AEILNS? (? = blank), a player announcing that the blank was a C and announcing the words SANICLE and INLACES would receive twice the base score; their opponent could steal the word SCALENI and score the base amount for himself. =Duplicate= Duplicate Scrabble is a form of organized tournament Scrabble popular in French-speaking countries, in which all players use the same tiles and words on their board and during each round, within a fixed time limit, have to find the highest scoring word. Players only receive points for their own words, and at the end, when there are no more consonants or no more vowels, the player with the most points wins the game. This form of Scrabble can often result in many players participating simultaneously; the official record for participation in France, where Duplicate Scrabble is the preferred form of the game, is 1485 at the 1998 tournament in Vichy. It is also the predominant format used in the French World Scrabble Championships. =Ecological Scrabble= So-called because in it the blank tiles are recycled. If a blank tile is played to represent a particular letter, a player before his turn can pick up the blank and replace it by the letter that it represents. For example, if the word STRETTa is on the board (with a blank A), the player may pick up the blank and replace it with an actual A. However, he cannot replace it with an E, I, or O to produce STRETTE, STRETTI, or STRETTO. =Solitaire Scrabble= Solitaire Scrabble follows the same rules and word acceptability as normal Scrabble, but there is only one player. Solitaire Scrabble can be played against a clock, trying to get the most points in a certain length of time or for highest maximum score. =Speed Scrabble= Speed Scrabble is simply Scrabble played with a considerably shorter clock limit (e.g. 5 minutes), than normal tournament Scrabble. =Tag Team= This variant is played with two teams of two players each, with each player possessing his/her own rack. On each team's turn, one of the players makes a play, followed immediately by a play by the teammate. Set-ups are quite common; a team set up a 302-point triple-triple MENAZo(N)S at the 2010 National Scrabble Championship's Tag Team Tournament. =Take Two= Take Two (also called Speed Scrabble and similar to Bananagrams) is a fast-paced, non-turn-based Scrabble variant played without a board. Tiles are placed face-down in the middle of the table in a communal pool and each player is given a small number of face-up starting tiles. From their starting tiles, each player tries to build his own valid Scrabble grid‚Äîplayers do not use each other's grid or tiles. When a player successfully uses all of his face-up tiles, he shouts \\"take two\\", and every player takes two more tiles. Play continues until there are no more tiles left to draw. In some variants, the person who creates the first complete grid when all the tiles run out is the winner. In others, a calculation based on word length is used to determine the winner. Some variants allow for the exchange of unwanted tiles. Local variants include Take One or Take Four; the banning of 2 letter words; having a dictionary on hand for any players to use (but since it is a game of speed, this doesn't get used much); a bonus of 50 points for building the word \\"chicken\\", a bonus for longest word (number of letters in word, not tile values; and only if a single player has longest word), etc. =Team Speed Scrabble= Team Speed Scrabble is when teams of 2, 3, or 4 race to play legal Scrabble words as quickly as possible. Scoring does not matter; all that matters is how quickly words are played. This can be a co-operative game where all players are simply trying to complete the game as fast as possible. =Trickster= A new variant on Scrabble introduced by Mattel on April 6, 2010.  Variants with non-standard equipment  = Super Scrabble = This game has the same rules and tiles as Scrabble, but the board is larger (21x21 vs. 15x15 in the original). With the larger board there are more premium squares, going up to quadruple letter and quadruple word scores. There are also twice as many tiles with a slightly different distribution.* = Scrabble Slam! = This game uses cards for tiles where players throw down a card with a letter to change a four-letter word to another four-letter word by placing the card on top of one of the four piles of cards that form the word. So if the word shown is LACE, one player can put the M on the L to make it MACE and the next player could put a Z on the C to make the word MAZE and so on. Scoring is based on how many words are formed. This variation is also used on Scrabble Showdown. =WildWords= This game has the same size board and nearly the same scoring system as Scrabble. The major differences are the inclusion of twelve wild tiles marked with an asterisk that may represent one letter or any series of letters and special board squares that convert a regular letter tile into a wild tile (the tile in question is placed upside down on such a square). The nature of these changes shifts the emphasis of the game from playing short words to playing words of any length. For example, QUA*IST, could be the word QUARTERFINALIST. Good players must find 7-tile bonus plays a majority of the time, and the short odd words that are a staple in Scrabble are of little use in WildWords. = Scarabeo = Scarabeo is an Italian variant of Scrabble that is much more popular in its native country than the original game. It features a 17√ó17 board, 8 tiles per rack instead of 7, and a 30-point bonus for using 7 tiles as well as the 50-point \\"bingo\\".http://cineclap.free.fr/?film=le-coucou-1980&page;=anecdotes = Scrabble Junior = This child-friendly version of Scrabble can pretty much grow with the age of the child. The double-sided game board incorporates a variant for children five to seven years of age on one side and a version for older children aged seven to ten on the other. Two to four players can take part in a game. In the simpler version, young players connect letters with words on the game board. The words have been preprinted on the playing field and only have to be covered by the letter tiles until a complete word has been constructed. If the board is flipped, words must be constructed independently, as they are in adult Scrabble. = Wordox = The Literaxx board This game is a cross between Othello and Scrabble played on a 13 x13 board. Each player has different coloured tiles. The rack is common and always contains 7 tiles. All tiles have the same value, one point. Points are scored for how many tiles are currently your own colour. The special squares are pink and orange. A word with a tile on a pink square clears the board. When this happens a bonus point is received for each tile you placed on an orange square on that board. = Literaxx = Literaxx is the English version of Literaki, a popular online Polish variant. Tiles are worth 1, 2, 3 or 5 points and are coloured according to their value. Double and triple word squares function in the same manner as standard Scrabble. However, the coloured triple letter squares are only active when the tile colour matches that of the square. Literaxx is available at PlayOK. = Anadrome = Anadrome is a web-based variant which (as the name implies) allows words to be played reading in any orthogonal direction, doubling traditional turn opportunities. With 39 different bonus tiles, many directly correlating to mathematical operators like * (multiplication), ^ (exponentiation), ! (factorial), ‚åà (ceiling and floor), and Œ† (product series) across over 500 boards, scores may require scientific notation, depending on the board. Points are calculated automatically and displayed next to definitions of words as they are placed. Anadrome has a tile-earning mechanic and board editor, allowing users to create publicly available boards for Scrabble, Words with Friends, and their own custom designs, making it a superset of crossword-style games. Scrabble Showdown On the game show Scrabble Showdown, two teams play various games in order to win prizes including a vacation to anywhere in the world. Number game variants =Gosum, or Equable= Gosum is similar to Numble. Users place sequences of numbers and equations, using the four main arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) and the equal sign in a Scrabble-like placement. A similar Scrabble-like arithmetic game was published in Australia, during the 1970s, under the name Equable. Number tiles were white, arithmetic operations and symbol tiles (including decimal point, fraction-dashes, and percentage) were grey, and players could freely take special equal-sign tiles when they made their move. Clearly the name was meant to evoke the conceptual link with Scrabble. The game-board also had bonus-squares. =Numble= One of the earlier number-based variants, Numble was a physical board game using numbers and basic mathematic equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Players form valid equations. =Triolet= Triolet uses pairs or triplets of numbers that sum up to less than, or exactly 15, respectively. The placement of the pairs or triplets is similar to Scrabble. Triolet means \\"triplet\\" in French. =Yushino= Yushino uses number sequences where every number is the last digit of the sum of the previous two. For two number sequences it requires that the numbers are adjacent. =Mixmath= Mixmath, a game developed by Wrebbit, also involves placing correct mathematical equations on a board with bonus squares similar to a scrabble board.Mixmath rules, Gameroom, archived from the original 2007-12-23.  Related games  =Bananagrams= A game of Bananagrams in progress Bananagrams is a commercial version of the variant Take Two. Players draw tiles and assemble arrangements of words without a board. =UpWords= Scrabble Upwords (originally just named UpWords) is played with 100 letter tiles on a special 10√ó10 board with no premium squares (originally 64 tiles on an 8√ó8 board). It has a Qu tile instead of Q and a different tile distribution than Scrabble. Words can be formed as in Scrabble as well as by playing on top of previously formed words. When playing over a word, at least one tile from the original word must be incorporated into the new word. All tiles, with the exception of the Qu tile in certain circumstances, are worth the same, with additional points scored for higher stacks of letters. Stacks can't go higher than five tiles and all words that are completely on the first level receive doubled points.

Shot in black and white to mimic old-time war movies, the film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May and clinched the Grand Prix. The film was initially not allowed to be shown in theaters in China for a certain period but was eventually made commercially available in China since. Inspired by the novel Survival by You Fengwei, Devils on the Doorstep is set in the last years of the Second Sino-Japanese War during World War II and tells the story of a Chinese villager who is forced by a mysterious figure to take custody of two prisoners from the Japanese Army (Teruyuki and Yuan). Fearing both the mystery man and the Japanese, the village falls into a dilemma over what to do with the two prisoners. Contrary to its title, Devils on the Doorstep is not at its core an anti-Japanese war film. In Jiang's own words, the film shows how Chinese literature and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression. Jiang hopes that the film illuminates this common human psychological trait of blaming others for disaster that goes beyond Chineseness. Plot In a small village named Rack-Armor Terrace in Hebei, at the foot of the Great Wall of China, a local peasant called Ma Dasan (played by Jiang Wen) is caught by surprise when a man bursts into his home one night and deposits two men in gunnysacks, instructing him at gunpoint to keep them captive but alive for the next few days and interrogate them. The man, identified only as \\"Me\\", leaves before Ma can catch a glimpse of him. One of the gunnysacks contains Kosaburo Hanaya (Kagawa Teruyuki), a belligerent Japanese sergeant; the other Dong Hanchen (Yuan Ding), an obsequious Chinese interpreter working for the Japanese Army. Ma hurriedly enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Fearing both the mysterious \\"Me\\" and the Japanese, the village decides to follow the instructions from \\"Me\\" and detains the prisoners in Ma's cellar. Hanaya repeatedly attempts to provoke the peasants into killing him, but Dong, fearing for his own life, alters Hanaya's words in translation to make him appear conciliatory. The mystery man fails to return by the eve of Chinese New Year as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of patience and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret to the rest of the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu (Chen Qiang), a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured. By this time, however, Hanaya has lost all his defiance and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain should he be released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that he was killed in battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka (Kenya Sawada), gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er (Jiang Hongbo) from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit harakiri before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the war is over. After the Chinese National Revolutionary Army takes back the area, Dong is publicly executed for collaborating with the enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a POW camp. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao (David Wu), commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma's act as too despicable to deserve death by the hands of a Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a katana to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma's head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as 'One Strike' Liu's victims were supposed to have done. Director's intention According to director Jiang Wen, Ma is initially very fearful but does not know the origins of his fear. The turning point comes when he sees his village in flames and his fellow villagers massacred. He then overcomes his own fear and begins longing for death. In the final scene, Ma dies a satisfying death as he has fulfilled his desire. Cast * Jiang Wen as Ma Dasan, a local peasant from the village of Rack-Armor Terrace * Kagawa Teruyuki as Kosaburo Hanaya, a captive Japanese Army sergeant * Yuan Ding as Dong Hanchen, a captive Chinese interpreter working for the Japanese Army * Jiang Hongbo as Yu'er, a widow from Rack-Armor Terrace, lover of Ma * Kenya Sawada as Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka, commander of a company of Japanese soldiers encamped near Rack-Armor Terrace * David Wu as Major Gao, commander of a National Revolutionary Army battalion administering the area after the Japanese surrender Production The film was inspired by and loosely based on a novella titled Survival by You Fengwei. However, the final screenplay was largely original, with only few similarities to You's novella. Director Jiang Wen and director of photography Gu Changwei made the choice of shooting the film in black and white in order to capture the details of the historical era depicted in the film. There were initial worries about the sales and distribution prospects for a black-and-white film, but the production eventually went ahead. The Japanese cast members in the film, two of whom came to know Jiang while on exchange in the Central Academy of Drama in the 1980s, initially expressed concerns with the Japanese war crimes depicted in the film. Jiang spent two weeks discussing the issue with them, and showed them documentaries about the war, including some made by Japanese filmmakers. According to Jiang, the Japanese cast members eventually came to trust him. Jiang also used many non-professional actors and actresses in the film, some of whom were also members of the crew. Jiang himself also played the leading role in the film, which he admitted was a tiring experience. He said he also came to distrust what most of the crew members said about his acting, especially when they were tired and wanting to finish for the day.Raynes, Tony. tr.

However, the film was subsequently banned in China by the Chinese Film Bureau. According to director Jiang Wen, both the Japanese producers of the film and the Chinese Film Bureau expressed similar concerns: \\"Don't let Japanese soldiers kill people; Chinese people shouldn't be so dumb; Japanese soldiers shouldn't be kept as prisoners.\\"Corliss, Richard (2000-06-05), \\"Asia Scores\\", Time Asia 156 (22) A report confirmed that the authorities complained that \\"Chinese civilians [in the movie] don't hate the Japanese [prisoner]\\", but instead are \\"as close as brothers\\" with the latter.Gries, P.H.

Time Asia reported that the Chinese Film Bureau was furious at Jiang for having entered the film in the Cannes Film Festival without its permission. The Film Bureau reportedly sent two officials to Cannes to try to dissuade the festival from screening Devils on the Doorstep and demanded that Jiang hand over the negative (which was brought to Australia for post- production). There were also reports from Asian film circles that the authorities planned to punish Jiang by forbidding him to work in China for seven years.Corliss, Richard (2000-07-24), \\"Devils on His Doorstep\\", Time Asia 156 (3) A representative from the Chinese Film Bureau confirmed that Jiang's status was \\"under review\\" and that China suspected Jiang was awarded his prize at Cannes for \\"political reasons\\".Rennie, David (2001-06-19), \\"China blacklists top film director\\", The Daily Telegraph It was not known publicly if the seven-year ban was eventually imposed, but Jiang did not produce any directorial work between Devils on the Doorstep and the 2007 production The Sun Also Rises. However, he did act in several films, including The Missing Gun (2002), which was a huge commercial success in China. He was also nominated for Best Actor in the official Huabiao Awards in 2004 for his role in Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003). The ban was eventually lifted and the film has been commercially available in China since. =Cannes release and cutting= The version shown at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival was three hours long. This was a working version that was later cut to 139 minutes with director Jiang Wen's full participation in order to enhance the film's commercial prospects and to tighten the storyline, which he did not have time to do before the Cannes premier.Werner, Michael (President of Fortissimo Films), \\"A note about this DVD edition\\" (attached with DVD) The film was booked for showing on 3 November 2014 at the Cornerhouse Manchester (UK) as part of Asia Triennial Manchester 14, and a 161-minute version arrived, somewhat to the organisers' surprise. The film was well received at this screening. =Japanese release= Devils on the Doorstep was commercially released in Japan on 27 April 2002, further delaying a possible lift of ban on the film in China.

All major newspapers in Japan gave the film mostly positive reviews. The liberal leaning Asahi Shimbun said the film \\"illustrates and examines the weakness of human nature\\". The Mainichi Shimbun called the film Jiang's \\"overarching question on human nature\\". The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun also complimented Jiang, Kagawa Teruyuki and Kenya Sawada, saying their acting was \\"colorful\\" and \\"believable\\". Inevitably, however, some reviewers voiced displeasure after viewing the film, saying that it \\"further estranges the Sino-Japanese friendship that was seriously damaged in the past war\\".

Many Japanese media reports on the film also mentioned Jiang's past visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where spirits of Japanese soldiers, including some convicted of war crimes, are housed. The news sparked a new round of debate in China, where criticism of famous actress Zhao Wei for appearing on the cover of Bazaar in a dress with a Japanese military flag design had newly subsided. Jiang responded that he visited the shrine several times to collect resources for Devils on the Doorstep.

In context targeting, advertising media are controlled on the basis of the content of a website using linguistic elements. The advertisements themselves are selected and served by automated systems based on the context of what a user is looking at.‚ÄòPersonalization diminished‚Äô: In the GDPR era, contextual targeting is making a comeback Published by digiday on June 7, 2018, retrieved on November 13, 2019 How it works A contextual advertising system scans the text of a website for keywords and returns advertisements to the webpage based on those keywords. The advertisements may be displayed on the webpage or as pop-up ads. For example, if the user is viewing a website pertaining to sports and that website uses contextual advertising, the user may see advertisements for sports-related companies, such as memorabilia dealers or ticket sellers. Contextual advertising is also used by search engines to display advertisements on their search results pages based on the keywords in the user's query. Contextual advertising is a form of targeted advertising in which the content of an ad is in direct correlation to the content of the web page the user is viewing. An example of contextual advertising is an ad offering a special price on a flight to Italy appearing on a website concerning travelling in Europe. Contextual advertising is also called \\"In-Text\\" advertising or \\"In-Context\\" technology. Apart from that when a visitor doesn't click on the ad in a go through time (a minimum time a user must click on the ad) the ad is automatically changed to next relevant ad showing the option below of going back to the previous ad. Contextual ads are less irritating than traditional advertising. That is why it influences user more effectively. It shows user area of interest thus increasing the chance of receiving a response. Service providers Google AdSense was the first major contextual advertising network. It works by providing webmasters with JavaScript code that, when inserted into webpages, displays relevant advertisements from the Google inventory of advertisers. The relevance is calculated by a separate Googlebot, that indexes the content of a webpage. Recent technology/service providers have emerged with more sophisticated systems that use language-independent proximity pattern matching algorithm to increase matching accuracy. Media.net is the other major contextual ad network competing with Google Adsense. Impact Contextual advertising has made a major impact on earnings of many websites. Because the advertisements are more targeted, they are more likely to be clicked, thus generating revenue for the owner of the website (and the server of the advertisement). Contextual advertising has attracted some controversy through the use of techniques such as third-party hyperlinking, where a third-party installs software onto a user's computer that interacts with the web browser.\\"Customers Now\\", David Szetela, 2009 Keywords on a webpage are displayed as hyperlinks that lead to advertisers. With advertisers and marketers focusing on Brand Safety and Suitability, contextual advertising plays a role in protecting a brand's value. Brand positioning and contextual advertising are directly correlated to user perceptions so it is important for marketers to protect their brands by using appropriate contexts. Agency roles There are several advertising agencies that help brands understand how contextual advertising options affect their advertising plans. There are three main components to online advertising: # creation‚Äîwhat the advertisement looks like # media planning‚Äîwhere the advertisements are to be run; also known as \\"placements\\" # media buying‚Äîhow the advertisements are paid for Contextual advertising replaces the media planning component. Instead of humans choosing placement options, that function is replaced with computers facilitating the placement across thousands of websites.

Early life Teresa was born in Revere, Massachusetts in 1930. He was the grandson of Sicilian Mafia member Vincenti Teresa, who moved to the United States in 1895 and became a bootlegger during Prohibition. The younger Vincent Teresa's uncle, Dominick \\"Sandy Mac\\" Teresa, was a driver for Joseph Lombardo, the underboss of Philippo \\"Don Pipino\\" Buccola who arrived from Italy with his cook and her husband to take the reins of the New England Mafia. Buccola met with Dan Carole and took control of the New England Mafia as instructed by his Sicilian partners. He worked as a Boxing Owner and trainer as his legitimate profession. After cementing control of Boston from the Irish and Jewish gangs, he returned to Italy in 1954. Returning in 1957 to send representatives to the meeting in upstate NY, which he smartly did not attend. Before he left for Italy he opened a restaurant for his Cook and her husband named \\"Mother Anna's\\" the name all of his boxers gave her as she cooked for them all. Her husband acted as Buccola's driver and one of his fighters, dubbed \\"the kid\\" by Phil and the boys, as he fought under the name of \\"kid Johnson\\" was Bodyguard. While he was still in primary school, Vincent Teresa developed a gambling addiction that led him to plan and execute around one dozen burglaries. He was caught by authorities while robbing a meat market, but did not serve any jail time. Due to several incidents of violence against teachers, Teresa was expelled from school after completing the ninth grade. He subsequently joined the United States Navy, where he worked as a cook. After an altercation with a superior officer, Teresa was court martialed and given a bad conduct discharge in February 1948. Teresa married his childhood sweetheart Blanche Bosselman in 1949. After his discharge from the Navy, he worked several odd jobs, all which he had to leave after stealing from his employers. During this time, he also partnered with a forger to pass forged checks at different New England banks and embarked on a bank robbery spree. Career in the Mafia Using the mob connections of his uncle, Teresa began working for Enrico Tameleo, the underboss of the Patriarca crime family. Teresa earned money by buying up businesses and burning them down for insurance money. He also opened a nightclub on Cape Cod to use as a front for his loan sharking and racketeering operations. In 1963, Teresa was detained by police in connection with a one-million-dollar heist of Ming dynasty jade. He was released due to lack of evidence. During the Irish Mob War, Teresa was once again detained by police, this time on suspicion of murdering Joseph Francione. He later stated that Joseph Barboza committed the murder. In the mid-1960s, Teresa moved on to two new criminal enterprises. The first was the outwardly legitimate business of gambling junkets. Teresa arranged for large groups of wealthy gamblers to be flown to Las Vegas, Europe and the Caribbean where they gambled at casinos. He used the junkets to convince patrons to subsidize his illegal money lending, promising them high interest rates. He would take their money and not pay the interest, threatening them if they protested. His second venture involved a foray into selling stolen and forged bonds. In 1969, one of his associates was caught selling stolen securities and revealed Teresa's role to the FBI. Teresa was indicted and sentenced to twenty years for conspiracy and transporting stolen securities. He served several months at the Lewisburg penitentiary, housed in a cell near John Gotti, Jimmy Hoffa and Carmine Galante. After Teresa discovered that other members of the Patriarca crime family had taken a $4 million stash meant for his family, he agreed to become an informant for the FBI. He testified in front of the US Senate in 1971 and was responsible for the indictments of over 50 mobsters. He entered the United States Federal Witness Protection Program and received a new identity as Charles Cantino. Later life After he entered witness protection, Teresa wrote three books: the 1973 My Life In The Mafia, co- written with Newsday writer Thomas C. Renner, which documented his Cosa Nostra career and the 1960s Boston Irish Mob Wars; the 1975 Vinnie Teresa's Mafia, also co-written with Thomas C. Renner, which documented his life during his time in the Federal Witness Protection Program and beyond; and the 1978 fictional novel Wiseguys, solely written by Teresa. My Life In The Mafia chronicles Teresa's path to a life in organized crime, his time as a lieutenant for Raymond Patriarca, his fall in the Patriarca crime family, and the circumstances that led to him to seek the protection of the Federal government and the Federal Witness Protection Program. Teresa's testimony put a large number of the Patriarca crime family in jail. Vinnie Teresa's Mafia chronicles Teresa's time as a government witness and subsequent life, with a number of anecdotes on his former life in the mob. Despite claimed government indifference, he does not succeed in making a life for himself and his family once out of witness protection. He was very bitter against the Federal government for his treatment in the Federal Witness Protection Program, feeling they used him with no regard to his safety, or an appreciation of his value. Thomas C. Renner implies this may have been more melodramatics than reality. Teresa's final book and fictional novel, Wiseguys, was written solely by Teresa. The story is of Johnny Forza, a thinly disguised doppelganger of Teresa. It chronicles Forza's life as a betrayed government witness, his battles with a former friend mob member \\"Butch\\" (again, a thinly disguised doppelganger for New Jersey mob member Frank \\"Butch\\" Miceli), his life on the lam with his girlfriend and his final confrontations with everyone who has done him wrong. Normally, to become a made member in an Italian mob, potential candidates have to first commit a murder at the direction of the mob. Teresa claimed that while he reached the position of lieutenant in the Patriarca crime family, this was mainly due to his prowess as a money maker for Raymond Patriarca, and that he never murdered anyone. The US government had no evidence to the contrary and as he was a very valuable witness, he was taken at his word. In 1982, Teresa was arrested in Washington where he was living under his new identity. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine. Death Although Teresa always lived in fear of being murdered by the Patriarca crime family, he died of natural causes. In February 1990, he died of kidney failure in Seattle.\\"Vincent Teresa, 61, Mafia Aide Became Informer and Author\\" by GLENN FOWLER New York Times February 26, 1990 His biographer Thomas C.
