The Network operated 64 schools that served over 5,000 middle school age boys and girls across 27 states. It closed in June 2012. Though the Nativity Miguel Network Central Office formally dissolved in June 2012, there are still over fifty former network schools in operation around the United States and Canada. Background In 1971, a group of Jesuits opened a middle school in the Lower East Side of Manhattan to serve the waves of Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants settling in the area. The Nativity Mission Center provided their middle school-aged boys with an educational program in which they could excel academically, socially, and spiritually. The extended school day almost doubled that of the local public school, a low student-to-teacher ratio ensured time for one-on-one instruction, and a summer academic program extended learning year round. They made a commitment to support their graduates through high school and guide them on to college. The Nativity Mission Center flourished, and by the 1980s had attracted the attention of Catholic educators nationwide. Replications followed creating the Nativity Network of Schools. In 1993, the Christian Brothers opened the first San Miguel School in Providence, Rhode Island. Its replication led to the formation of the Lasallian Association of Miguel Schools. In 2006, these two networks merged to form the NativityMiguel Network of Schools, allowing for a more efficient way to lead member schools to excellence in education for the underserved. Overview and Mission The Mission of the NativityMiguel Network was to empower middle schools to provide a unique, faith-based education that breaks the cycle of poverty in underserved communities across America. The NativityMiguel model included an extended day averaging 9.6 hours and an extended year of up to 11 months. The average total enrollment at a member school was 71 students with an average class size of 19 students.

The name was first used in 1935 on a 35mm Twin-lens reflex camera, the Contaflex TLR also by Zeiss Ikon, the -flex part in the name referring to integral mirror for the viewfinder. The first models, the Contaflex I and II have fixed lenses, while the later models have interchangeable lenses, and eventually the Contaflexes became a camera system with a wide variety of accessories. History The first Contaflex SLR was introduced in 1953 as one of the earliest 35mm SLR cameras equipped with a leaf shutter, but with a fixed lens. The Mecaflex was presented at photokina in 1951 and launched two years later with a leaf shutter behind the removable lens, while the Hasselblad 500C of 1957 has a leaf shutter in its interchangeable lens. This design, using a leaf shutter in an SLR, involves a complex sequence of events when the shutter is released, more looked upon as a challenge than a drawback at Zeiss Ikon, but no Contaflex model ever got a rapid return mirror. The advantages are low manufacturing costs, compactness and flash synchronization at all shutter speeds. However, only a very limited range of interchangeable lenses became available. For the models I and II, having a fixed lens, only three add-on converters were offered using a slide-on adapter, but from models III and IV onwards interchangeable lenses from 35mm to 115mm focal length were provided; at the time regarded as quite sufficient, as most would only be used with the standard lens anyway. Three years later, during 1956, the Kodak Retina Reflex was launched, followed by the Voigtl√§nder Bessamatic and the Ultramatic. The market soon flourished with leaf-shuttered SLR cameras. These mechanical complex cameras required precision assembly and high quality materials. More often than not many camera makes suffered from reliability issues, while the few better ones performed well, selling in quantity. Contaflex I and II The Contaflex I, launched in 1953, was equipped with a fixed Zeiss Tessar 45mm f:2.8 lens with front-cell focusing. The very first Contaflex I had a Synchro-Compur shutter with the old scale of shutter speeds (1-2-5-10-25-50-100-250-500), but very soon it adopted the new scale 1-2-4-8-15-30-60-125-250-500. The Contaflex II, introduced the following year, was the same camera with an uncoupled selenium meter added to one side of the front plate. Both had a fixed lens but to the front of which could be attached a supplementary lens, called the Teleskop 1.7x. Contaflex III and IV The Contaflex III, launched in 1956, was the same as the I, but equipped with a Zeiss Tessar 50mm f:2.8 with helical focusing. The front element of the lens was removable and could be replaced by supplementary lenses, discussed in the section Contaflex lenses. The Contaflex IV, introduced the same year, was the same camera with the uncoupled meter inherited from the Contaflex II. Contaflex IV Contaflex Alpha and Beta The Contaflex Alpha and Contaflex Beta, both introduced in 1957, were based on the same body but equipped with a Zeiss Pantar 45mm f:2.8 three-element lens and a Prontor Reflex shutter up to 1/300. They were the cheaper models of the line. The Alpha had no meter and the Beta had the selenium meter of the II and IV. The front element of the lens could be interchanged with others for 30mm f:4 and 75mm f:4. These could also be used on the Contina III 35mm viewfinder camera. Contaflex Rapid and Super The Contaflex Rapid was introduced in 1958 and had a slightly longer body, a built-in accessory shoe, a winding lever and a rewind crank. It was the meterless version. The Contaflex Super, launched the following year, was based on the Rapid and had a coupled selenium exposure meter on the front side of the prism. It is easily recognized by the wheel on the front plate for the setting of the film speed (DIN). The meter needle was visible in the finder as well as on the top plate from the outside. It is not to be confused with the Super (new) that will be discussed later. The Rapid and Super could take the same supplementary lenses as the III and IV. Contaflex Prima The Contaflex Prima, launched in 1959 and sold until 1965, was based on the body of the Rapid, but with the Pantar lenses and the Prontor shutter like the Alpha and Beta. The Prima had a coupled exposure meter placed on the side of the front plate, different from that of the Super. The Prima could take the Pantar supplementary lenses like the Alpha and Beta. Contaflex Super (new) and Super B Contaflex Super B film back Contaflex Super B Zeiss Ikon leather case The Contaflex Super (new) and Contaflex Super B are very similar cameras. Both have a new body design, being longer with added bulk. The information about which came first is a bit contradictory in some reference books, but it seems the Super (new) was launched in 1962, introducing the new body design and a new selenium exposure meter in a prominent rectangle marked Zeiss Ikon in front of the prism. The aperture wheel was replaced by a more traditional aperture command, and the meter read- out was visible both on the exterior and in the finder. The Super B was launched in 1963, and added a shutter-priority automatic aperture, and maybe some other small changes. The new body of the Super (new) and Super B allowed them to take magazine backs, interchangeable with a partly exposed film inside. (Magazine backs, rare among 35mm cameras, were also supplied for the Contarex of Zeiss Ikon.) From the Super (new) and Super B, the Zeiss Tessar 50mm f:2.8 lens was recomputed and supposedly performed better. They could still take the same supplementary lenses, with one exception discussed in the relevant section. Contaflex Super BC and S The Contaflex Super BC was introduced in 1965, and was a Super B with the selenium meter replaced by a CdS through-the-lens exposure meter. It still had a black rectangle marked Zeiss Ikon on the front of the prism, but it was only decorative. It had a battery compartment at the bottom front. The Contaflex S was the last variant, introduced in 1968, and was simply a renamed Super BC. It had a black rectangle marked Contaflex S on the front, and a different, newer Zeiss Ikon logo. It proudly sported the word Automatic on the front of the shutter. The Super BC and S could take the magazine backs, as well as the usual supplementary lenses. Both the Contaflex Super BC and S were, beside the Cassette type Contaflex 126, available in chrome or black finish. The former Zeiss-Ikon Chief designer, Hubert Nerwin, who designed the famous CONTAX 2 and 3 (beside other cameras for Zeiss-Ikon) later invented the 126 Film Cassette- after he emigrated to the United States, during his work for Kodak after the 2nd WW. The later Contaflex 126 was designed to use these 126 film cassettes and was also available in black finish. Contaflex lenses We have already seen that the Contaflex I and II could only take the Teleskop 1.7x supplementary lenses, and that the Alpha, Beta and Prima had their own limited range of Pantar supplementary lenses. The models III, IV, Rapid, Super, Super (new), Super B, Super BC and S all have a Zeiss Tessar 50mm f:2.8 lens (27mm screw-in or 28.5mm push-on filters) with interchangeable front element. All of them can take a small range of supplementary lenses: * Zeiss Pro-Tessar 35/4 (49mm filters), later replaced by the Pro-Tessar 35/3.2 (60mm screw-over filters) * Zeiss Pro-Tessar 85/4 (60mm screw-over filters), later replaced by the Pro-Tessar 85/3.2 (60mm filters) * Zeiss Pro-Tessar 115/4 (67mm filters) * Monocular 8x30B, equivalent to a 400mm lens (attaches to the 50mm f/2.8 Tessar lens). There was also a Zeiss Pro-Tessar M 1:1 supplementary lens, that kept the focal length of 50mm but allowed 1:1 reproduction. The effective speed of the M 1:1 lens is f/5.6. The 50mm standard front elements, as well as the Pro- Tessar M 1:1 elements, were different between the early models III, IV, Rapid and Super with the old model of Tessar, and the later models Super (new), Super B, Super BC and S with the recomputed Tessar. It appears that the mount was very slightly modified, and it seems physically impossible to mismatch the elements as the journal diameter above the bayonet mount had been reduced by approximately .006\\" There were also stereo attachments: * Steritar A for the Contaflex I and II * Steritar B for the other Tessar-equipped models * Near Steritar for close up stereo pictures .2 ‚Äì 2.5 meters (Normally interchangeable with the older Tessar line of Steritar B camera lenses) * Steritar D for the Pantar-equipped models A complete line of these Contaflex Steritar lenses can be seen at (https://www.flickr.com/photos/12670411@N02/) Zeiss Proxar for Contaflex: 1M,0.5M,0.3M,0.2M and 0.1M Contaflex 126 The Contaflex 126 is a completely different body. Its only relation to the rest of the Contaflex family is its name. It was introduced in 1967 to accept Kodak 126 (Instamatic) cartridges. It was one of the very few SLRs taking 126 film, and one of the very few ambitious cameras using that film. (Two other examples of 126 SLRs are the Rolleiflex SL26 and Kodak Instamatic Reflex.) The Contaflex 126 is an SLR with a focal-plane shutter and interchangeable lenses. It was available in chrome or black finish. The range of lenses was: * Zeiss Distagon 25/4 * Zeiss Distagon 32/2.8 * Zeiss Pantar 45/2.8, three-element, cheaper * Zeiss Tessar 45/2.8, four-element, better * Zeiss Sonnar 85/2.8 * Zeiss Tele-Tessar 135/4 * Zeiss Tele-Tessar 200/4 The Contaflex 126 lenses are often confused with other lenses by the sellers. They can only be used on the Contaflex 126 body, that can only take the obsolete 126 cartridge, so the value of these lenses is not very high, despite their famous names. The Weber SL75 When Zeiss Ikon stopped making cameras in 1972, they had prototypes in various stages of development. One of them was the SL725, which would be a successor to the Contaflex line with an electronic shutter. The prototype ended in the hands of a company named Weber, which presented the camera at a photokina show under the name Weber SL75, but could not afford to put it into production, and did not find a partner to do so. The lens mount was a modification of the Contarex camera lens mount. Carl Zeiss advertised a range of lenses for the Weber SL75, all with the T* multicoating:Source: Zeiss prospectus from 1974. * 18/4 Distagon * 25/2.8 Distagon * 35/2.8 Distagon * 50/1.4 Planar * 85/2.8 Sonnar * 135/2.8 Sonnar * 200/3.5 Tele-Tessar An eBay seller seems to have uncovered a small stock of the Planar lens, and has recently sold a couple of them. No SL75 body seems to have surfaced though, and the only picture found on the web is here.

Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology Clarkson, W.A. [2001], Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics 34(16): p. 2381-95 Thermal effects and their mitigation in end-pumped solid-state lasers. ETU involves two fundamental ideas: energy transfer and upconversion. The analysis below will discuss ETU in the context of an optically pumped [see optical pumping] solid-state laser. A solid-state laser [see also laser] has laser-active ions embedded in a host medium. Energy may be transferred between these by dipole-dipole interaction (over short distances) or by fluorescence and reabsorption (over longer distances). In the case of ETU it is primarily dipole-dipole energy transfer that is of interest. If a laser-active ion is in an excited state, it can decay to a lower state either radiatively (i.e. energy is conserved by the emission of a photon, as required for laser operation) or nonradiatively. Nonradiative emission may be via Auger decay or via energy transfer to another laser-active ion. If this occurs, the ion receiving the energy will be excited to a higher energy state than that already achieved by absorption of a pump photon. This process of further exciting an already excited laser-active ion is known as photon upconversion. ETU is normally an unwanted effect when building lasers. Nonradiative decay is itself an inefficiency (in a perfect laser every downward transition would be a stimulated emission event), whilst the excitation of the energy-receiving ion can result in heating of the gain medium. When ETU occurs due to a clustering of ions within the host medium, it is sometimes termed concentration quenching.

Daniel Genius is the vocalist and also a guitarist, J.J. Galea plays the guitar and Kenneth Vella plays the drums. Career Official Bitterside logo Since releasing their debut album Somehow Different in 2004, Bitterside have carved out quite a profile for themselves in Europe from winning awards in the Mediterranean and topping the radio charts to playing the Planet venue in Vienna. Then, in true Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll style things took a turn for the worse and tension ripped through the band as their future musical direction caused an epic fallout. It spelled the end for Bitterside, who had begun to take their band name literally, but remarkably all was saved by a song penned by frontman Daniel. The track was called \\"Shutters\\" and displayed a much matured emotional side to Daniel‚Äôs songwriting that inspired the band to once again pull together and concentrate on producing the music the best they could. This marked a new era for Bitterside, and the emotional drive behind Shutters became the basis of their new sound. Described as anthemic by a growing fan base, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon at this stage in the band‚Äôs career for them to play the song up to three times in one show to satisfy the crowd‚Äôs demands which included playing major events like the P1 Power Boat Grand Prix, the XFM Music festival and the Fete de la Musique Festival. Fast forward to now and the Bitterside sound has evolved into something altogether more polished. The band signed a contract with the label Hyperphonica in 2009. The debut UK release of single ‚ÄòStart Again‚Äô in January 2010 still clearly displays the guitar based backbone of the band whilst the production and arrangement gives it all the studio sheen it needs to sit comfortably in today‚Äôs charts. In the words of Daniel, ‚ÄòStart Again‚Äô is a lament about not getting what you deserve, being close to losing the person you love, difficult situations - all part of a melancholic, sad mood. The album is like a journey in different aspects of a particular mood and ‚ÄòStart Again‚Äô contains these bitter words that are sweetened by a sing-along melody. If their track record is anything to go by the slick vocal melodies and instant hooks of Start Again will soon be taking the UK by storm, and this is just the beginning. Unfortunately, by late 2010, things were not going very well in the Bitterside camp. Partly, the label had failed to reach the goals it had in mind even though the band was putting a lot of demos on the table. This time it was really tension. The band went into a hiatus in December 2010. ‚ÄòSatisfying Spin‚Äô - AudioScribbler ‚ÄòWe sure hope to see these guys in the our charts in the near future!‚Äô - Storm FM ‚ÄúLove it!

There was limited production during the rest of the war. After the war, the East German Zeiss Ikon company continued the model. At the beginning the shutter was a Compur to 1/300\\" or a Compur-Rapid to 1/500\\", then it became the East German Tempor to 1/300\\". The lens could be the same Zeiss Novar 35mm f/3.5, or a Carl Zeiss Jena 37.5mm f/3.5 Tessar. The body code number was 111/23 with the Novar and 111/24 with the Tessar. The Tenax was modified in 1953 with a fixed viewfinder integrated in a higher top plate with the exposure counter inside it, and a revised advance lever. Soon after it was renamed Taxona, because the East German company had lost the rights to use the traditional Zeiss Ikon names, property of the Western Zeiss Ikon company. At the same time, the Novar name became Novonar. The tip of the advance lever became black in 1954. Production ended in 1959.

The origin is most commonly thought to be introduced from the Turks by way of Bosnia between the 14th and 16th century. Although, others believe that the tambura was introduced by the Persians. It was not until the 19th century that tamburitza gained popularity during several nationalist movements against the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Many societies such as Croatian, Slovak and Czech, used national folk songs and dance as an \\"expression of their national identity\\". During this time, the first Croatian tamburitza ensemble was created by Pajo Kolariƒá in 1847. Also, during early 20th century ethnomusicologist Professor Vinko ≈Ωganec, began to write down Croatian folk songs which in the past were not written, but passed down from generation to generation. The popularity of Croatian tamburitza continued to grow and even developed into professional working ensembles throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. Tamburitza became so popular that newsletters began to circulate Croatia and neighbouring countries that shared interest in the instrument. Then in 1941, the first radio station in Croatia (located in Zagreb) whose basis was tamburitza was created and named the Croatian Radio-Television Tamburitza Orchestra.

There are also groups who foster engagement among traditionally non-involved youth by working to foster more significant youth participation outside of the program or organization itself. Other points in this spectrum can include: * Youth- serving: The program targets youth as consumers of service * Youth input: Youth evaluate or provide feedback on the program * Youth-engaged: Youth are involved in program development and/or delivery and * Youth-led: The program concept and/or organization came from youth * Youth-connecting: The activity facilitates youth interaction and builds connections through social mediums Each has value, and where a program or groups sits depends on the degree to which youth are engaged in the program with meaningful participation, and the degree to which the organization offering the program has policies and infrastructures to support youth involvement in a meaningful way.Ilkiw, V.

The activities that promote youth development and social change movements are now shifting to the World Wide Web, fostering online communities based on interests, causes, and purpose. Young people are promoting ideas, vocalizing their goals, organizing community groups, engaging in political discussions, reclaiming identities, creating identities, connecting with others, and taking over these networks full force as their own personal environments. The engagement over social networks ‚Äúforms and maintains social capital, a dimension that assesses one‚Äôs ability to stay connected with members of a community.‚Äù Ellison, N.

The organization worked to strengthen respect for Human Rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Chinese Constitution.  Aims  The group was founded by Hou Wenzhuo. Hou studied human rights at Oxford and Harvard, and founded the group based on her education at those schools. The group defended the land rights of farmers in Guangdong. The group documented 12 cases of illegal land confiscations in 2005. Hou was chosen to meet with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour in August 2005, but a government raid prevented this from happening. ERI was funded largely by the National Endowment for Democracy. The group frequently faces harassment from the Chinese government. Hou was detained for a short time in 2005 by Chinese authorities for the group's activities. She also notes that the members were frequently followed, their phones were bugged, and members frequently were detained. In August 2005, the ERI offices were raided by the Chinese government. The police searched the office and copied computer files. At the same time, police also raided the home of the group's founder, Hou Wenzhuo. The office was shut down by the government and Hou was placed under house arrest. She was also told that any visitors must be registered with the Chinese government.

It carries U.S. Highway 41 (US 41, locally known as Cleveland Avenue) over the Caloosahatchee River, which is where its name comes from. The bridge has four lanes and is tall. History Caloosahatchee Bridge as seen from Centennial Park Caloosahatchee Bridge as seen from North Fort Myers The Caloosahatchee Bridge was built in 1962 but it did not open for traffic until 1964. The bridge's opening was delayed due to difficult negotiations with landowners at the south side over land needed to connect the bridge to Cleveland Avenue. The opening of the bridge changed the routing of US 41 to bypass downtown Fort Myers. Originally, US 41 went through downtown Fort Myers, and crossed the Caloosahatchee River on the Edison Bridge, which at the time was a two-lane drawbridge. The old route was then designated as the US 41 Business. The south side of the bridge passes over Centennial Park, as well as First Street, the main road through downtown Fort Myers. A loop ramp connects the southbound lanes of the bridge to First Street. Directly south of the bridge is US 41's intersection with McGregor Boulevard, SR 80, and SR 82. Each of these highways terminate at this intersection. A two-lane overpass constructed with the Caloosahatchee Bridge crosses this intersection, which is historically known as the Five Points interchange, since it is a five-way interchange. The overpass originally carried both northbound and southbound traffic from the bridge, but was changed to have both lanes carry northbound traffic in the early 1990s.  Honorary designation  As part of the adoption of HB 7149 in the 2014 Florida Senate session (Chapter 2014-228), the bridge, effective July 1, 2014, received the honorary designation of Henry Ford Bridge. However, per the adopted bill, the designation does not change its official name (Caloosahatchee Bridge) and the local government is not required to change signage to the honorary designation. The City of Fort Myers opted to not rename the bridge.

He rose to serve as Secretary to the Treasury under his brother-in- law, the Earl of Danby, from 1673 until 1679 but did not wield significant political power thereafter. He did, however, twice enjoy the office of Treasurer of the Ordnance before his death in 1711. Early life and travels abroad Bertie was the fifth son of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey by his first wife, Martha Cokayne. He was educated first at a school of Charles Croke at Amersham and then probably at Westminster School. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 25 October 1658, he did not, however, take up a career as a barrister but went abroad in France and Switzerland for the next several years. Determined upon a diplomatic career, Bertie served as attach√© at Madrid from 1664 to 1665 under Sir Richard Fanshawe, who wrote favorably of him to the King. He graduated M.A. from the University of Oxford in 1665 and was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1667. He was subsequently commissioned both as a second lieutenant in the Royal Navy and as a captain in the Coldstream Guards in 1668. Bertie traveled through Scandinavia and possibly Prussia and Poland in 1670, and was named envoy-extraordinary to Denmark in March 1671. He left the following month for Denmark, by way of Hamburg, and returned home in February 1672 after the completion of his negotiations. Secretary of the Treasury Thomas Murray) In 1673, Bertie's brother-in- law, the then Viscount Latimer, was appointed Lord High Treasurer, providing Bertie with a new route for advancement. He was appointed Secretary to the Treasury and served as his brother-in-law's administrator there until 1679. He also purchased an estate at Uffington, Lincolnshire in 1673, and in the following year married Mary (d. 13 January 1679), daughter of Peter Tryon and widow of Sir Samuel Jones. Bertie was eager to secure additional treasury offices and obtained a reversion to the office of Treasurer of the Ordnance in 1675 and the office of Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer the following year. He also attempted to enter the House of Commons at a by-election at Grimsby in April 1675 but was defeated. However, in February 1678, he was returned for Stamford in another by-election. Storm clouds had, however, begun to gather around his brother-in-law and patron, now Earl of Danby. As Lord High Treasurer, Danby, though personally anti-French, had been deeply involved in Charles II's collection of a subsidy from Louis XIV, in exchange for English neutrality. With the rupture of Anglo-French relations in 1678, Louis, through the agency of the disaffected Ralph Montagu, attempted by releasing several of his letters to make Danby the scapegoat for the policy. Bertie opposed Danby's impeachment, but to no avail, and his support for Danby cost him his seat in January 1679. Bertie himself became embroiled in the controversy over the distribution of secret service money, and in May, upon refusing to testify without the King's command, was placed in the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms of the British House of Commons, where he remained until Parliament was dissolved in July. Later career Appointed envoy- extraordinary to Germany in summer 1680, Bertie was thus out of the country when a new Parliament was convened in October. He traveled through many of the German states before being recalled after the dissolution of the Oxford Parliament in March 1681. Returning to England in June, he succeeded that August as Treasurer of the Ordnance. With the accession of James II, Bertie was again returned as Member of Parliament for Stamford. Around this time, he also built a new country house in Uffington and was appointed to local posts in Boston and Stamford. Bertie kept the favour of James throughout his change of policy and the issue of the Declaration of Indulgence and was a court candidate for the abortive 1688 elections. However, he was in Yorkshire with Danby when the latter was preparing to bring in William of Orange. He went down to London in October to allay James' fears and was considered as a mediator between James and Danby. His connection with Danby allowed him to retain influence after the Glorious Revolution and he continued to hold his seat in Parliament. He supported Danby's proposal to declare the throne vacant and settle it upon Mary. Although Danby, now Marquess of Carmarthen, had returned to eminence, Bertie was unable to achieve significant political power, being passed over as Secretary to the Treasury in 1691. He held several minor posts, including secretary to the Justice in Eyre south of the Trent from 1693 to 1697, while the office was held by his half-brother James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. While he signed the Association in 1696, he remained a reliable Tory, opposing the attainder of Sir John Fenwick that year. With the final fall of Carmarthen, now Duke of Leeds, in 1699, Bertie lost his office as Treasurer of the Ordnance to Harry Mordaunt but regained it in 1702 with the accession of Anne. His support for an Occasional Conformity Bill in 1704 was probably the cause of his dismissal in 1705. Bertie opposed the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell in 1710. Death and legacy Bertie suffered from a \\"bad stomach\\" for much of 1710, and died on 22 March 1711. He was buried at Uffington where his monument referred to his 'unspotted reputation' wserving Stamford for over 30 years. He and his wife had two children. *Charles Bertie (aft. 1674‚Äì1730) who replaced him as Member of Parliament for Stamford. *Elizabeth Bertie (24 July 1675 ‚Äì 20 December 1730), married on 8 June 1693 Charles Mildmay, 18th Baron FitzWalter.

He served as secretary to the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention and drafted much of the constitution for its proposed Native American state, but Congress rejected the proposal.

(retrieved 20 March 2011) The Creek have a matrilineal kinship system, by which Posey and his siblings were considered born into his mother's Wind Clan of the tribal town of Tuskegee. They took their status from her, and property and hereditary positions were passed through her line. Posey's father Lewis H. Posey was born to Scots/Irish/Creek family, but he identified as Creek.Oklahoma and Indian Territory Dawes Census 1898-1914 He had been orphaned at an early age and raised in the Creek Nation; he spoke the Muscogee language fluently; and he was made a member of the Broken Arrow tribal town. Young Alexander and his siblings spoke Muscogee as their first language. As they grew older, their father insisted they speak English as well; when Posey was fourteen, his father would punish him if he spoke Muscogee. From that time, Posey received a formal education, including three years at Bacone Indian University in Muskogee, Oklahoma. In 1896 at the age of 23, Posey married Minnie Harris, a schoolteacher. Together they had three children, Yahola Irving, Pachina Kipling, and Wynema Torrans, each with a middle name drawn from one of the couple's literary heroes. Career Posey studied writing at Bacone. He read naturalists such as John Burroughs and Henry David Thoreau, who inspired him to write about the landscape of his childhood. After college he worked at Indian Journal, where he published poems. In 1895, he represented the Wind Clan as a member of the Creek National Council. He was also the director of a Creek orphanage. In 1901, Posey edited the journal Eufaula Indian Journal. He gained national recognition for founding the first Indian-published daily newspaper. In 1906, Posey was secretary for the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, called to draft a constitution for a state to be majority Native American. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma, he is credited with having written most of that constitution.Mullins, Jonita. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Muskogee County.\\" Retrieved April 22, 2013. The Native Americans hoped to gain a state of their own, in the period when whites were pushing for the Oklahoma and Indian territories to be admitted as a state to the Union. The Native Americans were not successful. Their tribal structures were dissolved as part of extinguishing Native American land title in what became the state of Oklahoma. Fus Fixico letters As Posey honed his satirical skills, he created a fictional persona, Fus Fixico (Muscogee Creek for \\"Heartless Bird\\"), whose editorial letters were published in the Indian Journal. Fus Fixico was represented as a full-blood Muscogee traditionalist, whose chatty letters were about his everyday life or detailed accounts that he had heard the fictional Muscogee medicine man Hotgun share with an audience of Creek elders: Kono Harjo, Tookpafka Micco, and Wolf Warrior. These monologues are written in Creek dialect.Schneider 191 The Fus Fixico Letters have aspects of nostalgia but are primarily sharp political commentary about Muscogee Nation, Indian Territory, and United States politics. This was a time of political upheaval because Creek and other tribes' communal lands were being broken up into individual household allotments under the Dawes Act, to extinguish land title in preparation for statehood. The Curtis Act of 1898 dismantled tribal governments and institutions, also in preparation for Indian Territory to become part of the state of Oklahoma. Experienced politicians from the Five Civilized Tribes met to draft a constitution to establish an indigenous-controlled State of Sequoyah, but their proposals were rejected by the US Federal Government. Posey served as secretary for the 1906 State of Sequoyah convention. His Fus Fixico letters from 1902 to 1908 poked fun as statehood was debated. Various US newspapers proposed syndicating the Fus Fixico letters nationwide, but Posey refused. His readership was within Indian Territory, and he did not believe a non-Native audience would understand the humor. So-called dialect literature was extremely popular at the dawn of the 20th century. Usually dialect literature was based on African-American dialect. The Posey family had also avidly read Robert Burns, who wrote poetry in the Scots language. Posey's father read such dialect writers as Max Adler, Josh Billings, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and James Whitcomb Riley. Alexander Posey saw dialects as a means of expressing Muscogee oratory styles in English; he did not care for dialect writers who tried to adopt it as part of a popular trend: \\"Those cigar store Indian dialect stories...will fool no one who has lived 'six months in the precinct.' Like the wooden aborigine, they are the product of a white man's factory, and bear no resemblance to the real article.\\" Death and legacy On April 28, 1908, Posey was swept away while trying to cross the flooded North Canadian River with a friend.DAWES ROLL INDEX notes #1 on CREEK BY BLOOD CARD#1132 (Dawes Roll#3671) died April 28th 1908 His body was recovered a week later, and buried at Greenhill Cemetery in Muskogee.

Route =Nottingham to Eastwood= The road starts in Nottingham at a roundabout which Maid Marian Way and Upper Parliament Street spur (A6008). From here road ascends, passing Nottingham Cathedral. At Canning Circus, it meets the A6200 (former A52) for Derby and A608 for Ilkeston. The A610 becomes Alfreton Road as it passes through Hyson Green, where it meets the A6130 Radford Boulevard and Gregory Boulevard, further on is a KFC and Tesco Express. At Bobbers Mill it becomes Nuthall Road, near a McDonald's and the Bobbers Mill Transport Cafe, then crossing the Nottingham Ring Road (A6514 or Western Boulevard). The road then passes through Aspley, with the speed limit being enforced by SPECS average speed cameras, with the Esso Nuthall Rd garage next to a Greggs. At a Sainsbury's Local at Aspley, nearby to the north is Ellis Guilford School. It crosses the B6004 Broxtowe Lane at NCN Basford Hall, with an Iceland slightly further, with a KFC and Tesco Express (Cinderhill Express) with a service station. The B6008 is at the large Cinderhill Roundabout. To the north is the Phoenix park terminus of the NET Line 2 (tram) at Phoenix Business Park or Phoenix Centre, built on the site of Babbington Colliery which closed in 1986, with a large site of E.ON UK and the Premier Inn Nottingham West.Premier Inn At the Cinderhill Roundabout, the road enters Nottinghamshire and Broxtowe. At this point, the road detours from its original route through Nuthall, the new route (built after the M1 arrived in 1966) becomes a dual carriageway, passing the Millers Barn NottinghamMillers Barn Beefeater on the right opposite the BP St Mary\`s Service Station, and Nuthall Pub & KitchenNuthall Pub & Kitchen further on the left; the 0.75-mile ¬£260,000 Nuthall Bypass opened in 1967. The road ascends out of the city of Nottingham towards the large Nuthall Island (also known as Nuthall Roundabout) with the A6002 and B600; this ¬£90,000 half-mile section of dual-carriageway, the Nuthall by-pass (western section), opened on Thursday 25 August 1966 when the ¬£6m M1 section reached Nuthall; construction had begun in April 1964. The former route follows what is now the B600, the former A613 to Alfreton. Shortly afterwards, the route then meets the Nuthall Interchange (junction 26) of the M1 motorway at a large roundabout. On 24 May 1967, Barbara Castle opened the section of the M1 from here to junction 27 at Annesley Woodhouse, built by George Wimpey; it was started in December 1964 and was to be finished by January 1967. High Speed 2 will cross the A610 at the junction, on the eastern side of the M1. After the M1, the route enters a four mile long stretch of dual carriageway, passing Nuthall, Kimberley, Giltbrook and Eastwood to the north, and Awsworth to the south. The ¬£3.05m Eastwood-Kimberley By-pass opened on 6 July 1974, and followed a former railway line of the Great Northern Railway; the bypass was opened 16 months ahead of schedule.Eastwood BypassEastwood Bypass 1974Eastwood Bypass Knowle Hill 1973 The grade-separated Giltbrook Interchange is with the A6096, for Ilkeston, and the large Giltbrook Retail Park,Giltbrook Shopping and IKEA.IKEA =Eastwood to Ambergate= The road partly or fully follows the former Erewash Valley line The road then reverts to a single carriageway at the Derbyshire border, going underneath the junction with the A608, entering Amber Valley. The road then bypasses Langley Mill to the south, and passes the junction 26 industrial park due to open summer 2019. The A610 then enters Woodlinkin, this particular stretch of the A610 has gained notoriety in the past for road accidents due to the road being particularly windy. The single carriageway Langley Mill By-Pass opened in the early 1980s. The road then ascends into Codnor, passing the Thorn Tree InnThorn Tree Inn at Woodlinkin. At Codnor, the route turns right at a T-Junction with the A6007 near the French Horn and is relatively straight for around half a mile with the Kingfisher Fish Bar and a Tesco Express on the left, then descends and turns sharply left. There have been plans since the 1970s for a Codnor Bypass, followed by another section called the Ripley-Codnor Link. The road then ascends for a mile, into Ripley until it reaches a roundabout near the Sainsbury's supermarket, with the B6441. Here, the route goes right at the roundabout, left at another roundabout shortly after, with a possible exit southwards for the proposed Ripley-Codnor link. The bypass heads straight, passing a McDonald's restaurant on the left, and the Derbyshire Constabulary and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service headquarters on the right. After the roundabout, the Butterley ParkBrewers Fayre Brewers Fayre and RipleyRipley Premier Inn are on the left. Bypassing Ripley completely, the route reaches the Hartshay Interchange with the A38. The Ripley Bypass was built in the early 1980s by Henry Boot Civil Engineering. Nearby to the north, off the B6179, is Midland Railway ‚Äì Butterley, known for its annual Indietracks festival. After the A38 junction, the road carries on for a mile, passing through Buckland Hollow and Sawmills, with Bullbridge on the right. The Ripley - Buckland Hollow section (West of Ripley) was constructed when the A38 (former A61) Ripley and Swanwick Bypass was built, which opened on 21 October 1977. The single-carriageway road has adjacent land for making into a dual carriageway, along a former railway line. The former route passed through Lower Hartshay, to the south. At the exit for the B6013 to the south, there is the Excavator at Buckland Hollow. Finally, the road straddles the River Amber before meeting the A6 at Ambergate. At Bullbridge (Sawmills), there is an exit to the south for Lockwood Group,Lockwood Group who make mushy peas. The road follows adjacent to the Midland Main Line. Coats Viyella Clothing had a main dyeing factory to the north. The road passes under the Midland Main Line at a low () bridge, after which National Grid plc have one of their Pipelines Maintenance Centres (PMC Ambergate) on the right. A few metres before the A6 T-junction, it passes under the Derwent Valley line next to Ambergate railway station, and the Hurt Arms on the A6.

Danaher was born in Missouri but shortly afterwards his family moved to south Texas. He played high school football at Harlingen High School, graduated in 1967 and received a football scholarship from Angelo State University. Danaher received his Bachelor of Science in physical education in August 1971. He then became assistant coach at 5A Edison High School in San Antonio. In 1974 Danaher got his first head coaching job in Dilley, Texas, a class 2A school.

This process, while not new to the Information Age, has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, Yahoo! Answers, and other web resources that rely on collective human knowledge.Baase, Sara (2007). A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3rd edition. Prentice Hall. pp. 351‚Äì357. . An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise. Trial by jury can be understood as at least partly relying on wisdom of the crowd, compared to bench trial which relies on one or a few experts. In politics, sometimes sortition is held as an example of what wisdom of the crowd would look like. Decision-making would happen by a diverse group instead of by a fairly homogenous political group or party. Research within cognitive science has sought to model the relationship between wisdom of the crowd effects and individual cognition. A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. Examples Aristotle is credited as the first person to write about the \\"wisdom of the crowd\\" in his work titled Politics. According to Aristotle, \\"it is possible that the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come together may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are so, just as public dinners to which many contribute are better than those supplied at one man's cost\\".Aristotle: Politics III.1281b. Translated by H. Rackham, Loeb Classical Library Sir Francis Galton by Charles Wellington Furse, given to the National Portrait Gallery, London in 1954 The classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of a continuous quantity. At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds. This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd's individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of responses with the median centered near the true value of the quantity to be estimated.Surowiecki, James. The Wisdom of Crowds. Doubleday, 2004. . In recent years, the \\"wisdom of the crowd\\" phenomenon has been leveraged in business strategy and advertising spaces. Firms such as Napkin Labs aggregate consumer feedback and brand impressions for clients. Meanwhile, companies such as Trada invoke crowds to design advertisements based on clients' requirements. Non-human examples are prevalent. For example, the Golden Shiner is a fish that prefers shady areas. The single Shiner has a very difficult time finding shady regions in a body of water whereas a large group is much more efficient at finding the shade. Higher-dimensional problems and modeling Although classic wisdom-of-the-crowds findings center on point estimates of single continuous quantities, the phenomenon also scales up to higher-dimensional problems that do not lend themselves to aggregation methods such as taking the mean. More complex models have been developed for these purposes. A few examples of higher-dimensional problems that exhibit wisdom- of-the-crowds effects include: * Combinatorial problems such as minimum spanning trees and the traveling salesman problem, in which participants must find the shortest route between an array of points. Models of these problems either break the problem into common pieces (the local decomposition method of aggregation) or find solutions that are most similar to the individual human solutions (the global similarity aggregation method).Yi, S.K.M., Steyvers, M., Lee, M.D., and Dry, M. (2010). Wisdom of Crowds in Minimum Spanning Tree Problems. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. * Ordering problems such as the order of the U.S. presidents or world cities by population. A useful approach in this situation is Thurstonian modeling, which each participant has access to the ground truth ordering but with varying degrees of stochastic noise, leading to variance in the final ordering given by different individuals.Steyvers, M., Lee, M.D., Miller, B., and Hemmer, P.

New developments =Surprisingly popular= In further exploring the ways to improve the results, a new technique called the \\"surprisingly popular\\" was developed by scientists at MIT's Sloan Neuroeconomics Lab in collaboration with Princeton University. For a given question, people are asked to give two responses: What they think the right answer is, and what they think popular opinion will be. The averaged difference between the two indicates the correct answer. It was found that the \\"surprisingly popular\\" algorithm reduces errors by 21.3 percent in comparison to simple majority votes, and by 24.2 percent in comparison to basic confidence-weighted votes where people express how confident they are of their answers and 22.2 percent compared to advanced confidence-weighted votes, where one only uses the answers with the highest average. Definition of crowd In the context of wisdom of the crowd, the term \\"crowd\\" takes on a broad meaning. One definition characterizes a crowd as a group of people amassed by an open call for participation. While crowds are often leveraged in online applications, they can also be utilized in offline contexts. In some cases, members of a crowd may be offered monetary incentives for participation. Certain applications of \\"wisdom of the crowd\\", such as jury duty in the United States, mandate crowd participation. Analogues with individual cognition: the \\"crowd within\\" The insight that crowd responses to an estimation task can be modeled as a sample from a probability distribution invites comparisons with individual cognition. In particular, it is possible that individual cognition is probabilistic in the sense that individual estimates are drawn from an \\"internal probability distribution.\\" If this is the case, then two or more estimates of the same quantity from the same person should average to a value closer to ground truth than either of the individual judgments, since the effect of statistical noise within each of these judgments is reduced. This of course rests on the assumption that the noise associated with each judgment is (at least somewhat) statistically independent. Another caveat is that individual probability judgments are often biased toward extreme values (e.g., 0 or 1). Thus any beneficial effect of multiple judgments from the same person is likely to be limited to samples from an unbiased distribution. Vul and Pashler (2008) asked participants for point estimates of continuous quantities associated with general world knowledge, such as \\"What percentage of the world's airports are in the United States?\\" Without being alerted to the procedure in advance, half of the participants were immediately asked to make a second, different guess in response to the same question, and the other half were asked to do this three weeks later. The average of a participant's two guesses was more accurate than either individual guess. Furthermore, the averages of guesses made in the three-week delay condition were more accurate than guesses made in immediate succession. One explanation of this effect is that guesses in the immediate condition were less independent of each other (an anchoring effect) and were thus subject to (some of) the same kind of noise. In general, these results suggest that individual cognition may indeed be subject to an internal probability distribution characterized by stochastic noise, rather than consistently producing the best answer based on all the knowledge a person has. These results were mostly confirmed in a high-powered pre-registered replication. The only result that was not fully replicated was that a delay in the second guess generates a better estimate. Hourihan and Benjamin (2010) tested the hypothesis that the estimate improvements observed by Vul and Pashler in the delayed responding condition were the result of increased independence of the estimates. To do this Hourihan and Benjamin capitalized on variations in memory span among their participants. In support they found that averaging repeated estimates of those with lower memory spans showed greater estimate improvements than the averaging the repeated estimates of those with larger memory spans. Rauhut and Lorenz (2011) expanded on this research by again asking participants to make estimates of continuous quantities related to real world knowledge ‚Äì however, in this case participants were informed that they would make five consecutive estimates. This approach allowed the researchers to determine, firstly, the number of times one needs to ask oneself in order to match the accuracy of asking others and then, the rate at which estimates made by oneself improve estimates compared to asking others. The authors concluded that asking oneself an infinite number of times does not surpass the accuracy of asking just one other individual. Overall, they found little support for a so-called ‚Äúmental distribution‚Äù from which individuals draw their estimates; in fact, they found that in some cases asking oneself multiple times actually reduces accuracy. Ultimately, they argue that the results of Vul and Pashler (2008) overestimate the wisdom of the ‚Äúcrowd within‚Äù ‚Äì as their results show that asking oneself more than three times actually reduces accuracy to levels below that reported by Vul and Pashler (who only asked participants to make two estimates). M√ºller-Trede (2011) attempted to investigate the types of questions in which utilizing the ‚Äúcrowd within‚Äù is most effective. He found that while accuracy gains were smaller than would be expected from averaging ones‚Äô estimates with another individual, repeated judgments lead to increases in accuracy for both year estimation questions (e.g., when was the thermometer invented?) and questions about estimated percentages (e.g., what percentage of internet users connect from China?). General numerical questions (e.g., what is the speed of sound, in kilometers per hour?), however, did not show improvement with repeated judgments, while averaging individual judgments with those of a random other did improve accuracy. This, M√ºller-Trede argues, is the result of the bounds implied by year and percentage questions. Van Dolder and Van den Assem (2018) studied the \\"crowd within\\" using a large database from three estimation competitions organised by Holland Casino. For each of these competitions, they find that within-person aggregation indeed improves accuracy of estimates. Furthermore, they also confirm that this method works better if there is a time delay between subsequent judgments. However, even when there is considerable delay between estimates, the benefit pales against that of between-person aggregation: the average of a large number of judgements from the same person is barely better than the average of two judgements from different people. =Dialectical Bootstrapping: Improving the estimates of the ‚Äúcrowd within‚Äù= Herzog and Hertwig (2009) attempted to improve on the ‚Äúwisdom of many in one mind‚Äù (i.e., the ‚Äúcrowd within‚Äù) by asking participants to use dialectical bootstrapping. Dialectical bootstrapping involves the use of dialectic (reasoned discussion that takes place between two or more parties with opposing views, in an attempt to determine the best answer) and bootstrapping (advancing oneself without the assistance of external forces). They posited that people should be able to make greater improvements on their original estimates by basing the second estimate on antithetical information. Therefore, these second estimates, based on different assumptions and knowledge than that used to generate the first estimate would also have a different error (both systematic and random) than the first estimate ‚Äì increasing the accuracy of the average judgment. From an analytical perspective dialectical bootstrapping should increase accuracy so long as the dialectical estimate is not too far off and the errors of the first and dialectical estimates are different. To test this, Herzog and Hertwig asked participants to make a series of date estimations regarding historical events (e.g., when electricity was discovered), without knowledge that they would be asked to provide a second estimate. Next, half of the participants were simply asked to make a second estimate. The other half were asked to use a consider- the-opposite strategy to make dialectical estimates (using their initial estimates as a reference point). Specifically, participants were asked to imagine that their initial estimate was off, consider what information may have been wrong, what this alternative information would suggest, if that would have made their estimate an overestimate or an underestimate, and finally, based on this perspective what their new estimate would be. Results of this study revealed that while dialectical bootstrapping did not outperform the wisdom of the crowd (averaging each participants‚Äô first estimate with that of a random other participant), it did render better estimates than simply asking individuals to make two estimates. Hirt and Markman (1995) found that participants need not be limited to a consider-the-opposite strategy in order to improve judgments. Researchers asked participants to consider-an- alternative ‚Äì operationalized as any plausible alternative (rather than simply focusing on the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù alternative) ‚Äì finding that simply considering an alternative improved judgments. Not all studies have shown support for the ‚Äúcrowd within‚Äù improving judgments. Ariely and colleagues asked participants to provide responses based on their answers to true-false items and their confidence in those answers. They found that while averaging judgment estimates between individuals significantly improved estimates, averaging repeated judgment estimates made by the same individuals did not significantly improve estimates. Problems Wisdom-of-the-crowds research routinely attributes the superiority of crowd averages over individual judgments to the elimination of individual noise, an explanation that assumes independence of the individual judgments from each other. Thus the crowd tends to make its best decisions if it is made up of diverse opinions and ideologies. Averaging can eliminate random errors that affect each person's answer in a different way, but not systematic errors that affect the opinions of the entire crowd in the same away. So for instance, a wisdom-of-the-crowd technique would not be expected to compensate for cognitive biases. Scott E. Page introduced the diversity prediction theorem: \\"The squared error of the collective prediction equals the average squared error minus the predictive diversity\\". Therefore, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small. Miller and Stevyers reduced the independence of individual responses in a wisdom-of-the-crowds experiment by allowing limited communication between participants. Participants were asked to answer ordering questions for general knowledge questions such as the order of U.S. presidents. For half of the questions, each participant started with the ordering submitted by another participant (and alerted to this fact), and for the other half, they started with a random ordering, and in both cases were asked to rearrange them (if necessary) to the correct order. Answers where participants started with another participant's ranking were on average more accurate than those from the random starting condition. Miller and Steyvers conclude that different item-level knowledge among participants is responsible for this phenomenon, and that participants integrated and augmented previous participants' knowledge with their own knowledge.Miller, B., and Steyvers, M. (in press). \\"The Wisdom of Crowds with Communication\\". In L. Carlson, C. H√∂lscher, & T.F. Shipley (Eds.), Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society. Crowds tend to work best when there is a correct answer to the question being posed, such as a question about geography or mathematics. When there is not a precise answer crowds can come to arbitrary conclusions. The wisdom of the crowd effect is easily undermined. Social influence can cause the average of the crowd answers to be wildly inaccurate, while the geometric mean and the median are far more robust.\\"How Social Influence can Undermine the Wisdom of Crowd Effect\\". Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2011. Experiments run by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology found that when a group of people were asked to answer a question together they would attempt to come to a consensus which would frequently cause the accuracy of the answer to decrease. i.e. what is the length of a border between two countries? One suggestion to counter this effect is to ensure that the group contains a population with diverse backgrounds.

It was made in 908 in the Castle of Gauz√≥n (Raices Viejo, Castrill√≥n, Asturias). At the core is an oakwood cross, in legend identified with a cross carried by King Pelagius of Asturias at the Battle of Covadonga. Since December 1990, the flag of modern Principality of Asturias bears the Victory Cross offset towards the hoist.  History  Display of the Cross in the C√°mara Santa of Oviedo. The coat of arms of Asturias is the official heraldic emblem of the Principality of Asturias. It was adopted as such on 27 April 1984. According to legend, the primitive, undecorated wooden core of this cross was carried against the Muslims of al-Andalus by King Pelagius of Asturias at the Battle of Covadonga, later kept by his son Favila of Asturias in the Church of Santa Cruz de Cangas de On√≠s, erected by Favila and his wife Froiluba in 737, and dedicated to the True Cross in Cangas de On√≠s, the first capital of the Kingdom of Asturias. However, a 2010 study has radiocarbon dated the cross to the late 9th century, roughly contemporary to the ornate casing. \\"Dudas sobre la Cruz de la Victoria\\" La Nueva Espa√±a 14 April 2010. The ornate casing contains 152 gems and imitation gems. An inscription tells us that this casing was made at the Castle of Gauz√≥n in Asturias in 908. Alfonso III donated this important Pre-Romanesque gold artifact to Cathedral of Oviedo to commemorate a hundred years of the Asturian kingdom's victories and conquests. During the Spanish Civil War, the Cross, like the rest of the artifacts in the C√°mara Sancta, suffered serious damages which required its restoration.See historic picture on Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinocefalo/3261696810/ The Victoria Cross recovered its gems from 1942 on, thanks to popular donations for the acquisition and restoration of the relic. However, the work of goldsmiths Horacio Rivero Alvarez and Luis Aguilar did not consider the original design, altering the position of the medallion on both fronts.Official website of the Ayuntamiento of Oviedo In 1971 new enamels were placed by German goldsmith Werner Henneberger, but here again the original design was not taken sufficiently into account. On 9 August 1977, the Cross, together with Agate box and the Cross of the Angels, were stolen and suffered serious damage after the thieves tore their precious stones and gold plating. Its current appearance is the result of careful reconstruction carried out in 1978.  Description  The Latin cross is . The core is made of two thick pieces of oak with circular ends finished in three foils, and joined in the centre by a circular disk. The whole cross is covered with gold leaf and filigree, and richly decorated especially the anverse, covered with coloured enamel, pearls, precious stones and gold thread.

Biography After having studied at a college in Poligny and in Lons- le-Saunier, Lecourbe enlisted in the Regiment of Aquitaine where he served for eight years as an enlisted man. Having been promoted to corporal when the French Revolution started he became commandant of the National Guard of Ruffey-sur-Seille in 1789. He was then given command of the 7th volunteer battalion of the Jura, with which he served in the armies of the Rhine and the Nord. Having been promoted to colonel in 1791 Lecourbe distinguished himself in the battle of Fleurus. Having been promoted to general of brigade in 1794 and to general of division in 1798, he fought against Alexander Suvorov in Switzerland and distinguished himself in the Second Battle of Zurich under Andr√© Mass√©na. Lecourbe's friendship with Jean-Victor Moreau and his vocal defense of Moreau in the process Georges Cadoudal brought on the enmity of Napoleon Bonaparte which forced his retirement in 1805. After Napoleon's abdication he was made a count by Louis XVIII of France. The count of Artois recalled Lecourbe to active duty in February 1815 and made him inspector- general of the 6th military Division with headquarters in Besan√ßon. Upon Napoleon's return from exile on Elba, Lecourbe offered him his services and during the Hundred Days he commanded the Army of the Jura (I Corps of Observation), operating in the Jura against Archduke Ferdinand. With an army of only 8,000 he held the city of Belfort for 15 days against the 40,000 Austrian troops of General Colloredo-Mansfeld, only agreeing a ceasefire on 11 July 1815, a feat which earned him a place of honour in French schoolbooks. After Louis's second return to the throne, Lecourbe retired and on 22 October 1815 he died in Belfort after a long illness. Legacy A statue commemorating him stands in the Place de la Libert√© in Lons-le-Saunier, where a street is also named after him. Streets named in his honour can also be found in Paris and in Besan√ßon. In Belfort a statue commemorates him as \\"The glorious defender of the city\\". Notes References *Baradel, Y., et al. (1985).

Some of the beliefs of Ayyavazhi are shared with that of Hinduism, and others are unique to Ayyavazhi.  Belief in the return of Ayya Vaikundar  After the death of Ayya Vaikundar, a palm-leaf text, the Akilattirattu Ammanai, was opened, and it revealed instructions and concepts of Ayyavazhi faith and practice. The section known as Nadutheervai Ula in the Arul Nool predicts that Ayya Vaikundar will return during the final judgement. Another verse in the Pathiram of Arul Nool states: \\"Breaking the earth, I will come to give you counsel\\", and yet another verse in the Thinkalppatham of Arul Nool states: \\"From out of the earthen cell, I will come out\\". Profundity upon profundity.  Kali or Kalimayai  Belief in Kali Yuga is one of the beliefs that permeate the religious ethos of the followers of Ayyavazhi. Though the belief in kali was in vogue in the sanskritic Hindu religious tradition as well, it operates in a different way in Ayyavazhi because of the reinterpretation. Taking the basic premise of this extant belief that the present age is a Kali Yukam, an age filled with the evil force of kali (not the Hindu deity), Ayyavazhi assigned a new meaning to it. As per the interpretation of Ayyavazhi, Kali entered into this world as a consequence of the birth of Kalineesan, the last fragment of the primordial Kroni, a mythical being. Kalineesan, who settled on earth to reign over the age of Kali as the king of Thiruvithankur, became the visible representation of the evil force of Kali, oppressing the people because of this Kalimayai. People, groaning under the oppressive measures of Kalineesan, believe in Ayya Vaikundar as the God- incarnate who had come to destroy the Kali (not the Hindu deity) and put an end to the Kali Yukam.  Belief in fate and curse  Belief in 'fate' has a great influence on the day-to-day living of the followers of Ayyavazhi. An oft-repeated refrain in Akilattirattu is that \\"such and such a thing happened according to the 'Oolivithi' (fate accruing from the past)\\". Belief in 'sabam' (curses), an associate of fate, is also part of the ethos of Ayyavazhi. A fitting example of a curse, the oppression that the Chanars have undergone in history, is given in Akilattirattu which attributes it to a curse invoked by one of the kings of Thiruvithankur at his deathbed.  Belief in final judgement  One of the constant refrains found in Akilattirattu is that Ayya Vaikundar had come to judge the Kalineesan and all those living under the illusion of kali. It portrays Ayya Vaikundar as the interrogator of the Kalineesan on the day of judgement. This episode points to the familiarity of the belief in Judgement among the followers of Ayyavazhi. A verse from Arul Nool, stating that \\"when I interrogate you during the Judgement, be prepared to respond\\", points to the existence of this belief. The subsection entitled Nadutheervai Ula (literally meaning 'The Journey to Final Judgement') found in Arul Nool, giving a number of signs to discern the time of the Judgement, confirms the existence of this belief.  Belief in attaining Vaikundam  Another belief of Ayyavazhi is that Ayya Vaikundar did not end his life here on earth but only attained vaikundam, the heaven for the worshippers of Ayya Vaikundar. Akilattirattu states that not only did Ayya Vaikundar attained Vaikundam, it is possible for everyone to attain it. The followers buried, and even now still bury, their dead in a sitting posture facing the northern direction, a symbolic gesture of performing Tavam. Their belief is that the deceased person had only embarked upon a penance and that he or she would eventually reach vaikundam.  Belief in the dawn of Dharma Yukam  A belief in the dawn of Dharma Yukam (a futuristic aeon characterized by the ideal of Dharmam, as explained below) seems to have influenced the tradition of Ayyavazhi from its earlier days. Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the accounts contained in it is the \\"story of God coming into this Kali Yukam to transform it into Dharma Yukam and rule over it.\\" The concept of Dharma Yukam becomes one of the root typologies around which the writing of Akilattirattu revolves. This belief seems to be echoed as a 'Slogan for a New World'. People that gathered around Ayya Vaikundar were familiarized with the slogan that 'Ayya Vaikundar was going to end things that were old and create things anew'. Akilattirattu says that \\"he was going to make the old Sasthrankal and traditions go awry\\". It continues to say that with the advent of Ayya Vaikundaras avatar of Narayana, \\"the old Puranas, Agamas and Vedas had lost their substance\\". In the place of all that had been decadent, it was proclaimed that \\"a new age, new earth, new humanity, new thought, etc., had been unfolding\\". As part of the process of unfolding the New World, people were enjoined to serve as catalysts for the destruction of kali. They were instructed to do so by transforming themselves so as to acquire a new character and be a 'people of Dharma Yukam'. Indicators as to the new identity of the people of Dharma Yukam were proposed. Akilattirattu speaks of these indicators summarily in the following words: > \\"O great sage, listen to the identity of my people, > no rituals and pucaikal, > they would not erect temples and have pucai with priests, > would not worship cows or idols of clay, > would not kill goats, bulls and roosters as sacrifice, > they are those who treat the ones coming in my name, > with love\\".

The two applicants sued the Ontario Minister responsible for the issuing of marriage licenses and the federal government on the grounds that the acknowledged common law prohibition of same-sex couples from marriage violated their rights under the Charter at section 15 which prohibits discrimination based on \\"sex\\".1 In a 2-1 decision, judges of the Ontario Divisional Court dismissed the application for an order requiring the issue of a marriage licence, ruling \\"that under the common law of Canada applicable to Ontario a valid marriage can take place only between a man and a woman.\\" In the 2002 decision of the same Divisional Court, one judge referenced this previous decision, arguing it wasn't persuasive and was non-binding on the Court: [116] In Layland, the court described the position of the province and the Attorney General of Canada as follows at p. 224: The respondent Minister opposes the application on the ground that the applicants lack the capacity at common law to marry one another for the reason given by the City Clerk's Office. The Minister takes no position on the alleged Charter violation, because capacity to marry is a matter within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under Class 26 of s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Attorney General of Canada (the \\"Attorney General\\") opposes the application on the ground that the concept of marriage at common law is limited to persons of opposite sex and denies that such limitation violates s. 15 of the Charter. The majority ruled that \\"persons of the same sex do not have the capacity to marry one another\\". With respect, the decisions to which I have referred assumed, without analysis, that the inability of persons of the same sex to marry was a question of capacity. The decisions are not binding on this court and, with respect, I do not find them persuasive. In my opinion, the fact that persons of the same sex may not legally marry is not a question of capacity. Rather the inability of same-sex couples to marry results from the fact that, by its legal nature, marriage is a relationship which only persons of opposite sex may formalize. The requirement that parties to a legal marriage be of opposite sex goes to the core of the relationship and has nothing to do with capacity.\\" Section Fifteen Charter case law 1993 in Canadian case law Canadian law articles needing infoboxes Canadian LGBT rights case law Ontario case law 1993 in Ontario ","title":"Layland v Ontario (Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations)"},{"id":"13233319","text":"Semi-solid metal casting (SSM) is a near net shape variant of die casting. The process is used today with non-ferrous metals, such as aluminium, copper,Young, p. 1. and magnesium, but also can work with higher temperature alloys for which no currently suitable die materials are available. The process combines the advantages of casting and forging. The process is named after the fluid property thixotropy, which is the phenomenon that allows this process to work. Simply, thixotropic fluids flow when sheared, but thicken when standing. The potential for this type of process was first recognized in the early 1970s.. There are three different processes: thixocasting, rheocasting, thixomolding. SIMA refers to a specialized process to prepare aluminum alloys for thixocasting using hot and cold working . SSM is done at a temperature that puts the metal between its liquidus and solidus temperature. Ideally, the metal should be 30 to 65% solid. The semi-solid mixture must have a low viscosity to be usable, and to reach this low viscosity the material needs a globular primary surrounded by the liquid phase. The temperature range possible depends on the material and for aluminum alloys can be as much as 50 ¬∞C, but for narrow melting range copper alloys can be only several tenths of a degree. Semi-solid casting is typically used for high-end applications. For aluminum alloys, typical parts include structural medical and aerospace parts, pressure containing parts, defense parts, engine mounts, air manifold sensor harnesses, engine blocks, and oil pump filter housings.P. Kapranos, Proc. 10th Inter. Conf. Semi-Solid Processing of Alloys and Composites, Aachen, Germany & Liege, Belgium, 2008 Processes There are a number of different techniques to produce semi-solid castings. For aluminum alloys the more common processes are thixocasting and rheocasting. With magnesium alloys, the most common process is molding.S. LeBeau & R Decker, \\"Microstructural Design of Thixomolded Magnesium Alloys\\", Proc. 5th Inter. Conf. Semi-Solid Processing of Alloys and Composites, Golden, Colorado, 1998 =Thixocasting= Thixocasting utilizes a pre-cast billet with a non-dendritic microstructure that is normally produced by vigorously stirring the melt as the bar is being cast. Induction heating is normally used to re-heat the billets to the semi-solid temperature range, and die casting machines are used to inject the semi-solid material into hardened steel dies. Thixocasting is being performed commercially in North America, Europe and Asia. Thixocasting has the ability to produce extremely high quality components due to the product consistency that results from using pre-cast billet that is manufactured under the same ideal continuous processing conditions that are employed to make forging or rolling stock.Stephen P. Midson, Semi-Solid Casting of Aluminum Alloys: An Update, Die Casting Engineer, Sept. 2008 The main disadvantage is that it is expensive due to the special billets that must be used. Other disadvantages include a limited number of alloys, and scrap cannot be directly reused. =Rheocasting= Unlike thixocasting, which re-heats a billet, rheocasting develops the semi-solid slurry from the molten metal produced in a typical die casting furnace. This is a big advantage over thixocasting because it results in less expensive feedstock, in the form of typical die casting alloys, and allows for direct recycling.. However, rheocasting also poses process control issues such that after an initial surge of activity, very little material is processed via rheocasting. =Thixomolding= For magnesium alloys, thixomolding uses a machine similar to injection molding. In a single step process, room temperature magnesium alloy chips are fed into the back end of a heated barrel through a volumetric feeder. The barrel is maintained under an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the magnesium chips. A screw conveyor located inside the barrel feeds the magnesium chips forward as they are heated into the semi-solid temperature range. The screw rotation provides the necessary shearing force to generate the globular structure needed for semi- solid casting. Once enough slurry has accumulated, the screw moves forward to inject the slurry into a steel die.Stephen P. Midson, Robert K. Kilbert, Stephen E. Le Beau & Raymond Decker, \\"Guidelines for Producing Magnesium Thixomolded Semi-Solid Components used in Structural Applications\\", Proc. 8th Inter. Conf. Semi-Solid Processing of Alloys and Composites, Limasol, Cyprus, 2004 =Strain-induced melt-activated (SIMA)= In the SIMA method the material is first heated to the SMM temperature. As it nears the solidus temperature the grains recrystallize to form a fine grain structure. After the solidus temperature is passed the grain boundaries melt to form the SSM microstructure. For this method to work the material should be extruded or cold rolled in the half-hard tempered state. This method is limited in size to bar diameters smaller than ; because of this only smaller parts can be cast.Young, p. 2. Advantages The advantages of semi-solid casting are as follows:Stephen P. Midson, NADCA Semi-Solid & Squeeze Casting Conference, Rosemont, Illinois, 1996 *Complex parts produced net shape *Porosity free *Reduced shrinkage *Excellent mechanical performance *Pressure tightness *Tight tolerances *Thin walls *Heat treatable (T4/T5/T6) *Good surface finish High consolidation pressures are used to produce high integrity parts and temperatures required to die cast semi-solid metal are lower than normal casting, conventional tool steel materials are typically used in production applications. The lack of suitable high temperature die materials limits the casting of high melting point metals, such as tool steel and stellite only to experimantal applications. Other advantages include: easily automated, consistent, production rates are equal to or better than die casting rates, no air entrapment, low shrinkage rates, and uniform microstructure. Disadvantages Because thixotropy (semi-solid state) is a middle state in physical or rheological sense, this process is very sensitive to conditions like ambient temperature. Thus production facilities require a higher degree of control over process conditions, demanding more expensive equipment and better operator training.

When growing in soil, C. tetani is rod-shaped and up to 2.5 Œºm long. However, when forming spores, C. tetani becomes substantially enlarged at one end, resembling a tennis racket or drumstick. C. tetani spores are extremely hardy and can be found globally in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. If inoculated into a wound, C. tetani can grow and produce a potent toxin, tetanospasmin, which interferes with motor neurons, causing tetanus. The toxin's action can be prevented with tetanus toxoid vaccines, which are often administered to children worldwide. Characteristics A diagram of C. tetani showing the bacterium alone, with a spore being produced, and the spore alone C. tetani is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium, typically up to 0.5 Œºm wide and 2.5 Œºm long. It is motile by way of various flagella that surround its body. C. tetani cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. It grows best at temperatures ranging from 33 to 37¬∞C. Upon exposure to various conditions, C. tetani can shed its flagella and form a spore. Each cell can form a single spore, generally at one end of the cell, giving the cell a distinctive drumstick shape. C. tetani spores are extremely hardy and are resistant to heat, various antiseptics, and boiling for several minutes. The spores are long-lived and are distributed worldwide in soils as well as in the intestines of various livestock and companion animals. Evolution C. tetani is classified within the genus Clostridium, a broad group of over 150 species of Gram-positive bacteria. C. tetani falls within a cluster of nearly 100 species that are more closely related to each other than they are to any other genus. This cluster includes other pathogenic Clostridium species such as C. botulinum and C. perfringens. The closest relative to C. tetani is C. cochlearium. Other Clostridium species can be divided into a number of genetically related groups, many of which are more closely related to members of other genera than they are to C. tetani. Examples of this include the human pathogen C. difficile, which is more closely related to members of genus Peptostreptococcus than to C. tetani. Role in disease A man suffering muscle spasms from tetanus, painted by Charles Bell in 1809 While C. tetani is frequently benign in the soil or in the intestinal tracts of animals, it can sometimes cause the severe disease tetanus. Disease generally begins with spores entering the body through a wound. In deep wounds, such as those from a puncture or contaminated needle injection the combination of tissue death and limited exposure to surface air can result in a very low-oxygen environment, allowing C. tetani spores to germinate and grow. As C. tetani grows at the wound site, it releases the toxins tetanolysin and tetanospasmin as cells lyse. The function of tetanolysin is unclear, although it may help C. tetani to establish infection within a wound. Tetanospasmin (\\"tetanus toxin\\") is one of the most potent toxins known, with an estimated lethal dose less than 2.5 nanograms per kilogram of body weight, and is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus. Tetanospasmin spreads via the lymphatic system and bloodstream throughout the body, where it is taken up into various parts of the nervous system. In the nervous system, tetanospasmin acts by blocking the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid at motor nerve endings. This blockade leads to the widespread activation of motor neurons and spasming of muscles throughout the body. These muscle spasms generally begin at the top of the body and move down, beginning about 8 days after infection with lockjaw, followed by spasms of the abdominal muscles and the limbs. Muscle spasms continue for several weeks. The gene encoding tetanospasmin is found on a plasmid carried by many strains of C. tetani; strains of bacteria lacking the plasmid are unable to produce toxin. The function of tetanospasmin in bacterial physiology is unknown. =Treatment and prevention= C. tetani is susceptible to a number of antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin G, and tetracycline. However, the usefulness of treating C. tetani infections with antibiotics remains unclear. Instead, tetanus is often treated with tetanus immune globulin to bind up circulating tetanospasmin. Additionally, benzodiazepines or muscle relaxants may be given to reduce the effects of the muscle spasms. Damage from C. tetani infection is generally prevented by administration of a tetanus vaccine consisting of tetanospasmin inactivated by formaldehyde, called tetanus toxoid. This is made commercially by growing large quantities of C. tetani in fermenters, then purifying the toxin and inactivating in 40% formaldehyde for 4-6 weeks. The toxoid is generally coadministered with diphtheria toxoid and some form of pertussis vaccine as DPT vaccine or DTaP. This is given in several doses spaced out over months or years to elicit an immune response that protects the host from the effects of the toxin. Research C. tetani can be grown on various anaerobic growth media such as thioglycolate media, casein hydrolysate media, and blood agar. Cultures grow particularly well on media at a neutral to alkaline pH, supplemented with reducing agents. The genome of a C. tetani strain has been sequenced, containing 2.80 million base pairs with 2,373 protein coding genes. History Clinical descriptions of tetanus associated with wounds are found at least as far back as the 4th century BCE, in Hippocrates' Aphorisms. The first clear connection to the soil was in 1884, when Arthur Nicolaier showed that animals injected with soil samples would develop tetanus. In 1889, C. tetani was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment. In World War I, injection of tetanus antiserum from horses was widely used as a prophylaxis against tetanus in wounded soldiers, leading to a dramatic decrease in tetanus cases over the course of the war. The modern method of inactivating tetanus toxin with formaldehyde was developed by Gaston Ramon in the 1920s; this led to the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine by P. Descombey in 1924, which was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.

When he was in third grade, the family, which included a younger brother, moved to Marlboro, N.J.\\" He attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and was chapter president of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He graduated from Harvard Law School with a J.D. degree. Career Jeff Kwatinetz started his managing career with Chicago power pop trio, Material Issue. He attributes learning a lot about managing and the music industry to the band. Material Issue was Kwatinetz first band signed to a major label (Mercury). In addition, Kwatinetz claims that Material Issue and him invented, and had, the first Radio Show. Kwatinetz, partially due to his love of the film The Graduate was the one who had the idea for the cover of Mrs. Robinson, he originally had set up for Material Issue to do it, but due to the label it when to The Lemonheads instead. He has worked with many celebrities, including music acts Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Lopez, and Kelly Clarkson and actors Samuel L. Jackson, Vin Diesel and Colleen Ballinger. Kwatinetz founded The Firm in 1997 to quickly become one of the top management and production companies in the industry representing talent in all facets of entertainment. He has been successful in breaking, developing, and managing the careers of artists such as KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys, Snoop Dogg, Enrique Iglesias, Vin Diesel, Ice Cube, Kelly Clarkson, OneRepublic, Rachel Weisz, Audioslave, Pete Yorn, Puddle of Mudd, and many more. The Firm acquired Artist Management Group in 2002 to add high-profile television and film industry managers and clients such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Kate Hudson, Benicio del Toro, Bill Condon, and Martin Scorsese and expand into an all-encompassing entertainment management and production company. =Britney Spears= Kwatinetz's company represented Spears for one month in 2007.

We wish Britney the best.\\" =Prospect Park and relaunch of The Firm= Kwatinetz left The Firm in late 2008 and founded the media production, record label and talent management company Prospect Park. He relaunched The Firm in August 2015. Kwatinetz serves as executive producer of the F/X comedy Wilfred and USA Network‚Äôs medical comedy, Royal Pains. Jeff foresaw original content being consumed online. In 2011, pre-dating NETFLIX Originals, he planned on bringing daily soaps to the internet, but, at the time, the infrastructure was not available to make this a reality. In 2013, Prospect Park launched its own web channel, The Online Network, with revivals of the long-running daytime soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. Later that year, it filed a lawsuit against ABC, the licensee of those series, and the Prospect Park Networks division filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014. The production and music divisions remained unaffected, and in 2015 were positioned as subordinate entities to a reactivated The Firm, Inc. =Civil Rights Law= In late 2017, Kwatinetz began working with attorney Mark Geragos on numerous civil rights cases.

In its most common form it was used to look up information such as telephone numbers and email addresses. Today this service has been largely replaced by LDAP. It was used mainly in the early-to-middle 1990s. The name- server was developed by Steve Dorner at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, at the university's Computing and Communications Services Office (CCSO). There also exists an Outlook plugin and standalone application known as OutlookPH. Overview The name-server directories were frequently organized in Gopher hierarchies. The tools \\"Ph\\" and \\"Qi\\" were the two components of the system: Ph was a client that queried the Qi server. The Ph protocol was formally defined by in September 1998. However the memo issued at this time references its prior use for an unspecified period of time before this date (work on the protocol started around 1988, and it was in use from around 1991 Also search for ph.CCSO/CSO: *). It defines sixteen keywords that can be used on the server side to define record properties. It also defines how clients should access records on the server and what responses the server should give. Ph server communication takes place on TCP port 105. Command structure All commands and response are initially assumed to be in US-ASCII encoding for historical reasons, unless the client explicitly asks for 8-bit (ISO-8859-1) encoding. As a result, only characters between 0x20 and 0x7E are initially sent by the server in raw form. Other characters, if present in entries, will be escaped using the defined \\"Quoted-Printable\\" encoding. The initial request from the client is a text base keyword optionally followed by one or more parameters as defined in the . The server then responds to the request. The following example response to a status request is provided by the RFC memo. C: status S: 100:Qi server $Revision: 1.6 $ S: 100:Ph passwords may be obtained at CCSO Accounting, S: 100:1420 Digital Computer Lab, between 8:30 and 5 Monday-Friday. S: 100:Be sure to bring your U of I ID card. S: 200:Database ready Each command defined by the memo consists of a keyword followed as needed by one or more parameters or key words. They can be separated by spaces tabs or the end of the line. Each line must be terminated in CR+LF style. The following are a few of the commands: status This command takes no parameters and simply asks the server to report its status as above. siteinfo Returns information such as server version mail domain and whom to contact about password issues and authentication methods. fields [field ...] List all available entry fields on the server or only those of the specified name or names. id information Causes the server to log the specified information as the current user id without login. set [option[=value] ...] Sets the specified option on the server to value. If used without parameters it lists the current server settings. login [alias] logout This is the actual login/logout commands for the server here the alias must be the users Ph alias. Logging in allows a user to change their own entry and view certain fields in it flag for restricted access. answer encrypted-response clear cleartext-password The client normally uses one of these to send the password information after the login command is sent. quit exit stop One or more of these will be recognized by the server as an end of session command closing the connection. Database As distributed, the nameserver was backed by a flat file database. In the early 1990s, Indiana University software developer Larry Hughes implemented a version of Qi (called \\"Phd\\") that was written in Perl and backed by a relational database. That code was distributed under an open-source license for several years prior to the university's transition to LDAP.

English & Malayalam  other_name Etymology There is no place name named MARUTHA, but commonly calling an area 'MARUTHA' which includes different place names such as Mundappoty, Kettungal, School Kunnu, Chakkappadam, Kanjirathingal, Vendekumpoty, Vengapadam, Mathalappara, Maruthakkadavu, etc. Marutha is a part of Vazhikkadavu Panchayath and is known for its gold deposits along the banks of river Maruthappuzha. Maruthappuzha originates as two streams from Devala and Pandalur and joins near Marutha (Randupuzhamukku). Manchakkoodu is the ending point up to which bus service is available. Some buses end their service up to Chakkappadam (buses keep the name Maruthakkadavu to attract the passengers to Marutha, continuing same name before opening the Marutha bridge). Chakkappadam is the city center in on which all villagers are dependant as a common meeting point and for available things like social services, Govt. services and others. The main educational institute in the village is GHS Govt. High School at School Kunnu. Postal pin code is 679333. Nearby towns are Palemad, Vazhikkadavu, Edakkara & Nilambur. Demographics The population of Marutha is dominated by Muslims, Hindus (mostly Thiyya) and Christians. Many Maruthites are highly educated and are in service to the nation as government servants. Culture Marutha village is a predominantly Muslim populated area. Hindus exist in comparatively smaller numbers. So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Most of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala. Naxalite threat In November 2016, three naxalites were killed near Karulai in an encounter with Kerala police. Naxalite leader Kappu Devaraj from Andhra Pradesh is included in the list of killed in the incident.http://www.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/nilambur-maoist-malayalam- news-1.1529750 Villages like Mundakkadavu, Kalkullam and Uchakkulam near Karulai have been threatened by Naxalite attacks. Naxalites visit the locality regularly and ask for food and shelter from the tribals. The police are also combing the area regularly but have not arrested any naxalites. On 27 September 2016, there was firing between the Maoists and the Kerala police in this area and no one was injured in this incident.http://www.mathrubhumi.com/print-edition/kerala/nilampoor-malayalam- news-1.1394437 Transportation Marutha village connects to other parts of India through Nilambur town. State Highway No.28 starts from Nilambur and connects to Ooty, Mysore and Bangalore through Highways.12,29 and 181. National highway No.66 passes through Ramanattukara and the northern stretch connects to Goa and Mumbai. The southern stretch connects to Cochin and Trivandrum. State. The nearest airport is at Karipur. The nearest major railway station is at Feroke. Gold deposits Marutha is highly known for its Gold deposits and the soil of Marutha contains the gold in its pure form. People used to filter the gold from the soil from late seventies to late nineties. It was the livelihood of the village men during those days. During the filtration process people used to dig huge holes in the surrounding mountains of Marutha and collect the soil which contained a high concentration of gold. Interestingly, it is a live scenario that you can see, even today ‚Äì after a heavy rainfall most of the Maruthites still look downwards in search of gold nuggets in the soil which is cleared by heavy water streams.

Or, to put it more concisely, all pan-r-agonals sum correctly for r = 1...n. The above definition is the same as the Hendricks definition of perfect, but different from the Boyer/Trump definition. See Perfect magic cube Definitions A Nasik magic cube is a magic cube with the added restriction that all 13m2 possible lines sum correctly to the magic constant. This class of magic cube is commonly called perfect (John Hendricks definition.). See Magic cube classes. However, the term perfect is ambiguous because it is also used for other types of magic cubes. Perfect magic cube demonstrates just one example of this. The term nasik would apply to all dimensions of magic hypercubes in which the number of correctly summing paths (lines) through any cell of the hypercube is P = (3n\\\\- 1)/2 A pandiagonal magic square then would be a nasik square because 4 magic line pass through each of the m2cells. This was A.H. Frost‚Äôs original definition of nasik. A nasik magic cube would have 13 magic lines passing through each of its m3 cells. (This cube also contains 9m pandiagonal magic squares of order m.) A nasik magic tesseract would have 40 lines passing through each of its m4 cells. And so on.  History  In 1866 and 1878, Rev. A. H. Frost coined the term Nasik for the type of magic square we commonly call pandiagonal and often call perfect. He then demonstrated the concept with an order-7 cube we now class as pandiagonal, and an order-8 cube we class as pantriagonal.Frost, A.

In 1905 Dr. Planck expanded on the nasik idea in his Theory of Paths Nasik. In the introductory to his paper, he wrote; In 1917, Dr. Planck wrote again on this subject. In 1939, B. Rosser and R. J. Walker published a series of papers on diabolic (perfect) magic squares and cubes. They specifically mentioned that these cubes contained 13m2 correctly summing lines. They also had 3m pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the faces of the cube, and 6m pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the triagonal planes.Rosser, B. and Walker, R.

The experiments ended with the closing of the mine in 1992. Initial experiments The initial experiments that took place in KGF were related to the study of cosmic ray muons. KGF was chosen because the depths of its mines allowed muons to be studied in a better environment than what was possible with magnet spectrometers operated at sea level. KGF also allowed the scientists to study the energy spectrum and angular distributions of muons even at very high energies. The mines had abundance of Kolar rock whose special characteristics with respect to density and chemical composition (different from that of normal rock) were also a useful advantage in the experiments. The first experiments involving variations of muon fluxes (a measurement of muons passing through a given media) with depth was conducted by Sreekantan in 1950s. These were followed by experiments in 1961 by Miyake, Narasimham and Ramanamurty and sponsored by TIFR. During 1984, Naba Kumar Mondal, TIFR, and Prof. Ito, Osaka City University, Japan, performed experimental studies on proton decay and indirectly observed the scatter of muons. Murali and Balasubramaniam briefly assisted Mondal and Ito as research assistants. Neutrino find Neutrino-related experiments were started in KGF in 1964. The main goal was the detection of atmospheric neutrinos, with an understanding that cosmic rays contain high energy pions and muons which decay in the Earth's atmosphere to produce billions of neutrinos. The experiments were conducted by groups from TIFR, Durham University and Osaka University using basic trigger with scintillation counters and Neon Flash Tubes (NFT) for tracking detectors. Seven detectors were deployed at a depth of 2.3 km in Heathcote shaft and Champion Reefs mines. The experiment discovered the first atmospheric neutrinos in an iron calorimeter here about the same time as a similar discovery in the East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM experiment) in South Africa . The South African experiment begun in 1965, took place 3200 meters underground and was managed by groups from Case Institute of Technology, University of California, Irvine and University of Witswatersrand. Kolar events Some experimental observations, called Kolar events, have yet to be explained. They suggest the existence of massive (>3 GeV) particles having a long life (10‚àí9 secs). These massive particles are also seen to decay into 2‚Äì3 particles. It has been postulated that they could be the result of neutrino interactions or dark matter decay.

Katharina Kepler was married to Heinrich Kepler and had one daughter and three sons; one of them was Johannes Kepler. In 1615, a witch trial was initiated by Lutherus Einhorn who in his reign as vogt of the Protestant town of Leonberg (1613 - 1629) accused 15 women of sorcery and executed 8 of them. He acted in accordance with the will of the government and the public, which had asked for an investigation of sorcery, and issued an arrest of Katharina Kepler in 1615. Ursula Reinbold had accused Katharina Kepler of giving her a potion after an argument which had made her sick. Johannes Kepler defended his mother himself, with the assistance of his university in T√ºbingen. One of his student friends, Christopher Besoldus, assisted her juridically. Her son took her away to Linz in December 1616. When she returned to Leonberg in the summer of 1620, she was arrested and imprisoned for fourteen months. She was told how she would be tortured, as a means of frightening her, but she refused to confess anything. In October 1621, Kepler was able to effect her release. Katharina Kepler died the following year.

History  Share of the Vereinigte Zwieseler und Pirnaer Farbenglaswerke AG, issued January 1923 = Founding = A logo of Zwiesel Kristallglas On 25 November 1872 sheet glass was manufactured for the first time in a new glassworks, whose designer was the Zwiesel carter, Anton Mueller. In 1878 a storage hall, a house and stables were added for the factory manager; in 1883 the factory pub was opened. =Sale= On 7 November 1884, Mueller sold the factory with the buildings and a surface area of altogether 3.045 hectares for 36,000 Goldmarks to the brothers Theodor and Gustav Tasche of Cologne. The Zwieseler Farbenglash√ºtte Gebr√ºder Tasche, generally only called Tasche Glasworks, was converted into a corporation on 21 June 1898. The share capital of the Zwieseler Farbenglash√ºtten, vorm. Gebr√ºder Tasche, Aktiengesellschaft amounted to 525,000 marks. = Renaming and expansion = On 1 September 1899, a glass plant in Pirna was acquired for 675,000 marks and the company was renamed the Vereinigte Zwieseler und Pirnaer Farbenglaswerke AG. The share capital was increased to 1,200,000 marks. The Zwieseler plant supplied antique glass, so- called \\"Pirna Kathedralglas\\". The enterprise was constantly extended and equipped with new technical equipment. The years 1914 to 1918 during World War I, as well as the postwar years, brought significant difficulties. In 1924 the production range was extended, as container glass was produced for the first time for drinking glasses.  Part of Schott AG  In 1927, increasing automation and sharp competition led to a majority share of the Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Gen, which was finally acquired in 1929. The manufacturing of sheet glass in Zwiesel was abandoned in 1931 in favour of bottle glass production. At that time the plant employed about 450 persons in Zwiesel. During the 1930s glass production stagnated. Due to the scarcity of raw materials in World War II, bottle glass production was stopped altogether on 22 April 1944 and only war-important optical glass was produced. Since the Vereinigten Farbenglaswerke AG, as the Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Gen. was called after 1940, lost its main facilities in Jena due to the war, production of optical glass was continued in Zwiesel, until on 10 May 1952 the new main plant in Mainz was opened. Colour glass plant  In Zwiesel a colour glass plant started manufacturing crystal glass in 1953. In 1961 the machine production of cup glasses began, which were quite successful on the glass market. In 1972 the Zwieseler company took over sales of the well-known heat- proof and chemically resistant \\"Jena glass\\". On 17 August 1972 the company was renamed Schott Zwiesel Glaswerke AG. In the 1970s considerable expansion took place. In 1973 an area of about 100,000 m¬≤ was purchased in Zwiesel, on which a new plant was built. The annual turnover increased from 46 million DM in 1971 to 120 million DM in 1978. In 1979 the Schott Zwiesel Glaswerke AG employed about 1,900 workers and was one of Europe's largest cup glass manufacturers. After further developments in the 1980s a steady decline in the number of jobs took place. In 2001 this number had fallen to 569, while turnover was still approximately 100 million DM.  Today  After a management buyout in 2001, the two managers Robert Hartel and Andreas Buske acquired the enterprise. This led to a radical reorganization with reduction of the assortment, the selling of stocks and properties, as well as a further reduction in the number of employees to approximately 400 workers. Renaming took place at the same time to \\"Zwiesel Kristallglas AG\\". Higher price segment catering and hotels were new areas of concentration. On 1 January 2006 the trademark rights for the traditional brand 'Jenaer Glas' were acquired. In 2006 the enterprise was awarded the title \\"Turnaround of the Year\\" by restaurant magazine impulse and the BDO Deutsche Warentreuhand AG. In 2007 the Zwiesel Kristallglas AG was among the hundred winners of a competition for innovation, the \\"Top 100\\". Today the enterprise employs over 700 workers, approximately 500 in Zwiesel, and a turnover of over 70 million euro is expected. In the grounds of Zwiesel Kristalglass, the highest crystal glass pyramid of the world (approx. 26 feet high), made from over 93,000 glasses, was unveiled on 25 May 2007.

The park was also the home field for the Columbus Panhandles for half of a decade.Indianola Park: \\"1910s\\" (page 2)The Coffin Corner: \\"The Panhandles: Last of the Sandlotters\\" In the 1920s, new owners bought and remodeled the park, and it did well until it closed at the end of the Great Depression.Indianola Park: \\"1920s\\" Currently, the land, which extends from 18th Avenue to Norwich Avenue and 4th Street to Big Four Street, is occupied by Indianola Junior High School which was purchased by The Ohio State University in April, 2018, and the Indianola Shopping Center, which is owned by Xenos Christian Fellowship, and includes Suzi-Cue Pool Hall, Soussy Market, 4th Street Studio, and King's Pizza.Indianola Park: \\"2007\\"Google Maps: \\"Indianola Shopping Center\\" Location The entrance to Indianola Park was at N 4th Street and E 19th Avenue. The park itself covered approximately and extended north from E 18th Avenue north to E Norwich Avenue, and east from N 4th Street to Big Four Street and the railroad tracks. History =Miles' vision= The park advertised a great deal before opening.Indianola Park: \\"1905\\" Indianola Park was established by dentist-turned-developer Charles Miles, who was president of the Summit Land Company, which developed residential neighborhoods in the former farmland across High Street from The Ohio State University. He was inspired to go into the amusement park business, because he saw how well Coney Island's new Luna Park was doing, and he had experience using recreations to draw buyers. The park was designed by amusement park impresario Frederick Ingersoll, who also designed the Luna Parks in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, and the gates were opened to the public on June 8, 1905. In its original configuration, the park featured a dance pavilion, a very large swimming pool, an Ingersoll figure 8 roller coaster, a carousel, a scenic railroad, a band shell, a restaurant, concession stands, picnic grounds, and athletic playing fields, such as tennis courts, a football field, and a baseball diamond. In 1908, a theater was added, and Indianola began presented vaudeville for its patrons. The park entertained visitors with everything from Shakespeare's plays and Greek dances, to circus animals and diving horses. Events like hot air balloon ascensions, tightrope walking, outdoor cinema, live presentations of distant sporting events, infant beauty pageants, and massive fireworks extravaganzas were also part of the park's draw. A year later, the park underwent major renovations. The band shell area was expanded, and a Shoot the Chute ride, The Blue Streak roller coaster, and a \\"Human Laundry\\" funhouse were added. For the next five years, the park was home field for the Columbus Panhandles, an early professional football team. Indianola enjoyed sustained popularity through the 1910s. Crowds as large as 10,000 flocked to the park on weekends, with up to 5,000 in the pool alone on hot summer days. And in the winter, the dance pavilion remained popular, buoyed by the national dance craze launched by Irene and Vernon Castle, and, in 1918, the park even hosted the Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball games. =Revitalization= Indianola Park's Shoot the Chute ride, added by the second owners, was a popular attraction. In 1923, the park underwent a change in management. The new owners invested thousands of dollars in renovations. For weeks before opening day, advertisements trumpeted \\"A Greater Indianola\\" and \\"The Biggest Year of All\\". The dance pavilion was remodeled for The Jazz Age, repairs were made to the swimming pool, and the locker areas were expanded. New attractions were also added, such as a roller coaster called Thriller, a Seaplane Swing ride, a caterpillar ride, The Joyplane, and Custer Cars, an early version of bumper cars. Indianola also became much more aggressive in advertising and promotions, aiming to create \\"a clean and orderly park for clean and orderly people\\". The park gradually dropped vaudeville and band concerts. The dance pavilion orchestra was replaced with local and touring jazz bands, which were favored by flappers, with two of the most popular bands being Phil Baxter's Texas Tommies and Tom Howard‚Äôs Melody Lads. The park continued to do well into the mid-1920s. However, in 1927, the park sold its land north of E 19th Avenue to the Columbus Board of Education for the construction of a new school, Indianola Junior High School, which opened in 1929.Indianola Park: \\"1929\\" Reduced to just its core, the dance pavilion and the pool, Indianola stayed open into the 1930s. The Great Depression made a challenging situation even more difficult, because few people had money to spare for a day at the amusement park. However, the record hot summers of the early 1930s helped keep the park afloat during the lean years, with temperature at nearly 100 ¬∞F for weeks on end. When the hot summers passed after the 1937 season, Indianola Park closed. =Shopping center= Suzi-Cue Pool Hall is the oldest tenant in the Indianola Park Shopping Center. In 1948, Indianola Park was converted into Indianola Park Shopping Center, and the pool was filled in and paved over for a parking lot. The former dance pavilion became an Ohio Giant Market, and a dozen or so other shops and restaurants were built around its perimeters by 1952, such as a flower shop, a beauty shop, a bakery, a gift shop, an appliance store, a fashion boutique, a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, a laundromat, a finance center, a hardware store, a variety store, and a restaurant.Indianola Park: \\"1948\\" With the influx of students at the end of the Vietnam War, Ohio State enrollment went up to almost 50,000 students. This changed the businesses. By 1978, the shops included three restaurants, two new pharmacies, two realtors, a Salvation Army Thrift Store, and a coffee shop, as well as new grocery, sporting goods, and appliance stores.Indianola Park: \\"1968\\" In the early 1980s, Suzi-Cue Pool Hall, a local dive bar and billiards hall, moved into the complex. By 1990, Both Suzi-Cue and the Salvation Army remained, but the rest of the businesses had moved out, being replaced by Soussy Market, C&M; Towing, a hair salon, and Christian Embassy.Indianola Park: \\"1998\\" In 2006, Xenos Christian Fellowship purchased Indianola Park Shopping Center, just before Indianola Junior High School closed in 2010. They spent $4 million massively rehabilitating the mall and converting the old dance pavilion into a worship center. They replaced plumbing, heating/cooling, and electrical systems, added new lighting, planted trees, and repaved the lot. As part of the deal, the church was required to purchase the entire shopping mall, which still includes long-term tenants Soussy Market and Suzi-Cue, and has been joined by 4th Street Studio and King's Pizza. Once a week, a clinic also provides medical care to the needy, and, every summer, there is an urban farmer's market hosts an urban farmer's market. The last remaining parts of the park are some of original trees from the original picnic area, located behind the defunct school.Indianola Park: \\"1929\\" (page 2) Attractions File:Panhandles at indianola park 1910s.jpgIn the 1910s, the Columbus Panhandles played at Indianola Park.

In London, Oliver meets Jack Dawkins, the Artful Dodger, who offers him a place to stay, where he meets up with Fagin and his band of young thieves. Oliver innocently goes \\"to work\\" with Dawkins and Charley Bates, but sees the real nature of their \\"work\\" when Dawkins picks the pocket of a gentleman. When the gentleman, Mr. Brownlow, realises he is being robbed, Oliver is mistaken for the pickpocket. And he is then chased, captured, and taken to the police. Oliver, who was injured in the chase, is cleared by a witness to the crime and is taken in by Brownlow to his home where he is well treated. After recovering from his injuries, Oliver is sent on an errand by Brownlow to pay a local merchant ¬£5 and to return some books. However, Oliver is caught by Nancy and Bill Sikes, who pretend to be his siblings, and is returned to Fagin's den. However, Nancy later betrays Fagin and Sikes, as well as herself, for doing so since they've stolen Oliver's chance to have a better life. Mr. Brownlow, who mistakenly thinks that Oliver has run away with the money, assumes that Oliver was a thief all along. This belief is further strengthened when Bumble, in response to Brownlow's newspaper advertisement for information about Oliver, gives a disparaging opinion of the boy. Despite this, Brownlow still holds onto a little bit of hope that this might not be true. Meanwhile, Oliver is forced by Fagin to join Sikes in an attempted robbery at a rural house, as they need a small boy to enter a window and open the front door for Sikes to get in. However, the robbery fails and, in the ensuing chase, Oliver is shot. He is then nursed back to health at the home of the Maylies, the house Sikes was attempting to burgle. Oliver gives his story to the Maylies (more exactly, the widow Mrs. Maylie, her son Harry and her adoptive daughter Rose) and Doctor Losberne. He also helps out when Rose falls ill, casually meeting a mysterious man along the way. The mysterious man is Mr. Monks, who is revealed to be Oliver's half brother (his true name being Edward Leeford JR.). He joins Fagin in an attempt to recapture Oliver and lead him into a life of crime, so that Oliver's rightful inheritance, of which Oliver knows nothing, would then go to Monks. Nancy, who still feels compassion for Oliver, overhears Fagin's and Monk's plans and tells Rose Maylie, hoping to thwart them. Rose then contacts Brownlow (clearing Oliver's name in the process, much to Brownlow's relief), Dr. Losberne and other people, to help her protect Oliver. Meanwhile, Bumble has married the matron of the workhouse, Mrs Corney. The former Mrs Corney had been in attendance at Old Sally's death, and purloined the locket and ring Old Sally had taken from Oliver's mother Agnes on her deathbed. Monks buys these items from the Bumbles and throws them into the river Thames, hoping that, by destroying them, Oliver's true identity will remain hidden. Brownlow and Rose Maylie meet Nancy on London Bridge and she tells them how to find Monks. However, Fagin has had Nancy followed and, believing Nancy has revealed his secrets, Fagin tells Sikes that Nancy has betrayed them. Sikes brutally murders Nancy, then flees London to the country. However, their neighbors and some of Fagin's own band members soon find out about Nancy's death and, enraged, they tell the police; Sikes falls to his death when he's about to be captured and taken away. Oliver is revealed to be the illegitimate son of a rich man named Edwin Leeford SR. and his young mistress, a girl named Agnes Fleming. Leeford had also fathered another son, Edward JR. (\\"Monks\\"), through a failed former marriage. After seducing Agnes, Leeford died, leaving a will which stated that the unborn child would inherit his estate if \\"in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong\\" in the event of which all would go to Monks. Monks is given half of Oliver's inheritance in cash by Brownlow‚Äîwho had been Edwin Leeford's best friend and the keeper of his secrets‚Äîin the hope that he would start a new life. Monks flees to the United States, where he quickly squanders the money and dies in prison. Rose Maylie is revealed to be Agnes Fleming's younger sister, who was adopted by the Maylies after her parents died. Therefore, Rose is Oliver's aunt and is able to marry Harry Maylie. Oliver collects his inheritance and is adopted by Brownlow, for the conventional happy ending to the novel.

Considered impolite and an embarrassment, he's put out onto the streets of London. In the last episode, we see him forlorn and destitute on the street, until he meets up with the Artful Dodger and taken in to Fagin's den of thieves. It is the last scene of the last episode.

Born near Labasheeda, in Slievedooley, County Clare, Ireland, the son of Thomas Gallery and Mary O'Neill. Daniel Gallery moved with his fathers and brothers to Montreal Quebec in the early 1860s, after his father Thomas was evicted from his farms at Slievedooley. Daniel's brother John set up a successful large bakery in Montreal Gallery Brothers. Daniel Gallery was educated at the Christian Brothers' School. A merchant, he was an Alderman from 1898 to 1903 and acting mayor. For four years Daniel was School Commissioner of the Catholic Schools Board in Montreal. He visited Ireland in 1907 as part of a delegation from the Montreal Educational Commission, visited the Presentation brothers in Cork and was instrumental in bringing the Brothers to Canada in 1910 to improve education for English speaking Catholics. He was a lifetime member of the Young Irishman's Literary and Benefit Association. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada at the general elections of 1900. He served as Liberal Party Whip from 1902 on. He was re-elected at the general elections of 1904. A Liberal, he served until 1906 when the election was declared void. He was defeated in the 1917 federal election when he ran as an independent. Once World War 1 broke out Daniel was instrumental in setting up a Home Guard in Montreal. He was a member of several benevolent societies including the Catholic Order of Foresters and the Knights of Columbanus. He was Vice President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In 1894 Daniel was Grand Marshal of the Montreal St Patrick's day parade. Daniel was extremely proud of his Irish heritage and descent and was a big promoter of Home Rule for Ireland. His obituary mentions his paternal descent from some prominent Clare families Sheehy, McMahon and Lysaght and his maternal descent from the O'Neills originally Earls of Dungannon and that his maternal Grandfather John O'Neill was a prominent supporter of O'Connell.

It is sung at the close of the first act by the Mother Abbess. It is themed as an inspirational piece, to encourage people to take every step toward attaining their dreams.  Background  This song shares inspirational overtones with the song \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" from Carousel. They are both sung by the female mentor characters in the shows, and are used to give strength to the protagonists in the story, and both are given powerful reprises at the end of their respective shows. As Oscar Hammerstein II was writing the lyrics, it developed its own inspirational overtones along the lines of an earlier Hammerstein song, \\"There's a Hill Beyond a Hill\\". He felt that the metaphors of climbing mountains and fording streams better fitted Maria's quest for her spiritual compass. The muse behind the song was Sister Gregory, the head of Drama at Rosary College in Illinois. The letters that she sent to Hammerstein and to Mary Martin, the first Maria von Trapp on Broadway, described the parallels between a nun's choice for a religious life and the choices that humans must make to find their purpose and direction in life. When she read the manuscript of the lyrics, she confessed that it \\"drove [her] to the Chapel\\" because the lyrics conveyed a \\"yearning that ‚Ä¶ ordinary souls feel but cannot communicate.\\" Although this song has parallels with \\"You'll Never Walk Alone,\\" the song shares musical similarities with the song \\"Something Wonderful\\" from The King and I. Both songs are played at a similar broad tempo, and both songs have accompaniments punctuated by heavy chords in the orchestral score. The song has often been sung by operatically trained voices in professional stage productions. In the original Broadway production it was sung by Patricia Neway, in the original London production it was sung by Constance Shacklock, and in the original Australian production it was sung by Rosina Raisbeck. In the original stage play, the Mother Abbess sings the song at the end of the first act. When Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation, he shifted the scene so that this song would be the first major song of the second act. When Robert Wise and his film crew were filming this scene, Peggy Wood had some reservations about the words, which she felt were too \\"pretentious.\\" So they filmed Peggy Wood in silhouette, against the wall of the set for the Mother Abbess' office. Peggy Wood's singing voice is dubbed by Margery MacKay, the wife of the rehearsal pianist Harper MacKay, as Wood was not able to sing the high notes of the song. Rodgers wrote the piece in the key of C, with a modulation towards the end of the piece into the key of D flat, making the last note that the Mother Abbess sings an A flat (Ab5), though in the film it was sung a tone lower. With the popularity of the stage play it would seem Peggy Wood was not alone. Given the range of the piece and the average age of the actor playing Mother Abbess, the oldest character in the story, the song has proven daunting for many actresses over the years.

(9 August 2013) Highland News. Retrieved 16 October 2013. History The island's name is Old Norse in origin. It possibly means \\"island of the caves\\", which appears to be confirmed by the name Rubha na h-Uamh (headland of the cave) in the east of the island. However, Blaeu's map has \\"Hildesay\\", which suggests that the name may derive from the Norse for \\"Hilda's Island\\". Hellisay from Gighay The island's settlement was at Buaile Mh√≤r (anglicised to Bualavore and meaning \\"the big fold\\") near Eilean a' Ghamhna in the north west of the island. The remains of a sheep pen and a well can still be seen. Like so many other islands in the region, Hellisay was badly affected by the Highland Clearances. Firstly, refugees from clearances in neighbouring islands swelled the population, and latterly the island's inhabitants themselves were evicted, and many went to live on Eriskay. The population peaked at 108 in 1841, and the island was cleared in the 1840s - however it continued to have some inhabitants up until 1890. Alasdair Alpin MacGregor's stories reveal a rich folklore and mythology extant on the island, possibly only a fraction of which has been preserved. In Media Franciscan priest, specialist in mystical theology and author Rayner Torrington wrote a book describing how he was influenced by meeting a hermit called Peter Calvay who lived on Hellisay for a number of years in the first half of the twentieth century. The book titled ‚ÄòPeter Calvay, hermit: A personal rediscovery of prayer‚Äô was first published in 1977 and has had at least eleven reprintings.

The Goops series is among his most famous works. :The Goops, they lick their fingers, :and the Goops, they lick their knives; :They spill their broth on the tablecloth, :Oh, they lead disgusting lives! Since the publication of the original Goops book, Goops and How to Be Them, in 1900, the series has come to be seen as the quintessential series on teaching children the importance of manners and polite behavior. :When you are playing with the girls, :you must not pull their pretty curls; :if you are gentle when you play, :you will be glad of it some day! Though widely circulated during the height of Burgess' popularity, some of the Goops books have become difficult to find. Goops and How to Be Them and More Goops and How Not to Be Them are still widely available. Out-of-print titles such as Goops Encyclopedia and Blue Goops and Red may be found in rare book rooms and antiquarian bookstores. In addition to the books, Burgess created the syndicated comic strip Goops in 1924 and worked on it through its end in 1925. Elizabeth Metz Butterfield of Jamestown N.Y. set a number of Burgess' Goop poems to music. They were published under the name The Goop Songbook.

Plot Tom, in love with Toots, goes to her house, carrying Jerry in a ring box to woo her. Tom presents Jerry to his love interest, but Jerry pretends to be frightened of Tom and cuddles up with Toots, who instantly sympathizes with him, taking sides with the mouse. Later, Jerry waves Tom and then aims to gain more sympathy from Toots by framing Tom to jumping into his mouth repeatedly in three times and Toots coming to Jerry's rescue. And later, Tom tells Toots that he wasn't even trying to eat Jerry but she refuses to listen to him and smash the door with his hand before Jerry laughs with him, causing an angry Tom to grab Jerry and attempts to drop a concrete block on him and flatten him, but mad Toots interferes and causes Tom to drop the block on himself. The next morning, Toots is putting baby powder on Jerry while a bandaged Tom hobbles to the table. Toots kisses Jerry, but while doing so, she soon finds that in addition to being quite adorable, Jerry is also quite tasty. She suddenly has a change of heart and decides to eat Jerry, now taking sides with Tom, who reacts with joy. Toots blows a kiss to Tom (as though to thank him for giving her Jerry, after all), and prepares to kill and eat Jerry. But Jerry, now seeing that Toots is no longer on his side and deciding that pretending to be frightened of Tom was a bad idea, escapes to the door. The now-evil Toots chases after him with a fork, a knife and a napkin tied around her neck while Tom limps out and slowly follows her.

He is the founder and director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs (formerly the Saudi Institute), an independent think tank in Washington, D.C. focused on providing analyses and disseminating information on political issues in the Persian Gulf region and particularly Saudi Arabia, and U.S.-Gulf relations. IGA also convenes conferences, conducts independent research and investigations, and works with the media and policymakers to foster a deeper understanding of Arab states of the Persian Gulf by providing them with up-to-date and exclusive information and connecting them with reliable analysts. He has been invited to speak by Princeton University, Amnesty International, the Hudson Institute, American Enterprise Institute and Meridian International Center. As a journalist, al- Ahmed exposed major news stories such as The Pentagon's botched translation of the 9-11 Bin Laden tape in December 2001. He also discovered the video of Daniel Pearl's murder. He has testified before Congress on several occasions on the issue of civil rights and religious freedom in the Middle East. He has authored reports on Saudi Arabia regarding religious freedom, torture, press freedom, and religious curriculum. TOC  Family and early years  One of nine children, al-Ahmed was born in 1966 in al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, to a politically active Shi'a family. His maternal grandfather, Salman Abdul Hadi al-Habib, was the Sheikh of Safwa in the early to mid twentieth century until his death. His oldest uncle Ali Salman was arrested for his nationalist opposition activities in 1969-1975, and his youngest uncle Adil Salman was imprisoned for 18 months in 1991 for membership in the Socialist Workers Party. Al-Ahmed grew up in the Eastern Province city of Safwa. His political career began at the age of 14 when he became the Kingdom's youngest political prisoner, after he was arrested in Doha, Qatar and deported to Saudi Arabia while traveling with his parents and six siblings in 1981. Ten years later, he moved to the United States to earn a B.A. in Journalism and Science at Winona State University in Minnesota and a M.A. in International Finance at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. Later in al-Ahmed's career, in mid- May 2012, his brother Kamel Abbas al-Ahmed was arrested in Saudi Arabia. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) believed that Ali al- Ahmed's activities as an expatriate Saudi dissident were part of the reason for Kamel al-Ahmed's arrest and that the arrest was part of a \\"security campaign launched by the [Saudi Arabian] government\\" against the 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests.  Media and speaking appearances  Al-Ahmed is a frequent consultant to major international broadcast media on issues including Saudi political affairs, terrorism, Sunni-Shi‚Äôa relations, Wahhabi Islam, political and religious oppression, human and women‚Äôs rights in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi-U.S. relationship. He is a regular guest on CBS News, CNN, PBS, Fox News, and Al-Jazeera. He has written for, and has been quoted in, The Washington Post, Associated Press, The Times, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Boston Globe, amongst others. Al-Ahmed has been invited to speak at Princeton University, Amnesty International, the Hudson Institute, American Enterprise Institute and the Meridian International Center. He has testified before Congress on several occasions on the issue of civil rights and religious freedom in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia.  Achievements  =Daniel Pearl= In May 2002, after Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi, Pakistan, al- Ahmed found a video of his beheading on an Arabic language website used to recruit jihadi-s to fight the United States. The footage of Pearl‚Äôs murder was interspersed with news clips, Arabic subtitles and calls to holy war directed at young people in Saudi Arabia, at least some of whom found the video appealing. \\"The first place where they had it on most of the people who commented on the tape, they said, 'I wish I was there. I wish I had done it,'\\" said al-Ahmed. CBS‚Äôs decision to air parts of the videotape was criticized by Pearl‚Äôs family and the State and Justice Departments, both of whom asked the network not to air the video. Anchor Dan Rather defended CBS‚Äôs decision by saying the tape was aired after great deliberation and was carefully edited to omit the most brutal moments. \\"We believe,\\" said Rather, \\"it is important for Americans to see it and understand the full impact and danger of the propaganda war being waged against the United States and its allies, and also its effect on the young people of the Arab world.\\" =Saudi curriculum of intolerance= In May 2006, the Institute for Gulf Affairs and Freedom House‚Äôs Center for Religious Freedom released ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia‚Äôs Curriculum of Intolerance‚Äù, a report analyzing a set of 12 Saudi textbooks currently used in Islamic studies courses for elementary and secondary school students. The analysis showed that the textbooks espoused hatred toward non-Muslims and non- Wahhabi Muslims. IGA collected these textbooks, used in Saudi Arabia and Saudi-run schools outside the Kingdom, from teachers, administrators and families with children in Saudi schools. The report debunked claims repeated earlier by Saudi officials, including spokesman Adel al-Jubeir and Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Turki al-Faisal, that all educational materials have undergone significant revision. In stark contradiction to these claims, the IGA/FH analysis showed that the textbooks commanded Muslims to hate non- Muslims, denigrated non-Wahhabi Sunni Muslims, and Shi'ite and Sufi Muslims as \\"polytheists\\", taught conspiracy theories like Protocols of the Elders of Zion as if they were proven facts, and called upon students not to \\"greet,\\" \\"befriend,\\" \\"imitate,\\" \\"show loyalty to,\\" \\"be courteous to,\\" or \\"respect\\" non- believers. Saudi Arabia runs academies in 19 world capitals, including the Islamic Saudi Academy in Fairfax County near Washington, D.C., that use the same textbooks. The IGA/Freedom House study was cited as evidence in the report released by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in October 2007 that urged the State Department to shut down the Academy unless it could prove it was not teaching religious intolerance. The panel expressed \\"significant concerns\\" that the school is promoting a brand of religious intolerance that could prove a danger to the United States.  Hacking attempt  In 2018, a person identifying themselves as a BBC ‚ÄúSecretary to the Editor In Chief‚Äù, contacted al-Ahmed for an interview request. BBC later confirmed that they did not have any of that name employed, nor any such job description. An Associated Press investigation showed that it was most probably a trap to get al-Ahmed inadvertently to download spyware to his phone.In online ruse, fake journalists tried to hack Saudi critic, Raphael Satter, November 8, 2018, AP  References   External links  * Institute for Gulf Affairs * Saudi Information Agency (English) * Hypocrisy Most Holy (op-ed in WSJ) * Interview with PBS Frontline 1966 births Living people Saudi Arabian writers Winona State University alumni Saudi Arabian Shia Muslims Saudi Arabian dissidents People from Khobar ","title":"Ali al-Ahmed"},{"id":"13234510","text":"The Knoxville metropolitan area is a metropolitan statistical area centered on Knoxville, Tennessee, the third largest city in Tennessee and the largest city in East Tennessee. It is the third largest metropolitan area in Tennessee. In 2019, the metro area had an estimated population of 1,045,111. The KMSA is, in turn, the central component of the Knoxville‚ÄìMorristown‚ÄìSevierville Combined Statistical Area, which, in 2019, had a population of 1,146,049. Definitions As defined at the time of the 2010 United States Census, the Knoxville area was the third largest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in Tennessee. It is usually defined as consisting of the following eleven Tennessee counties: *Anderson *Blount *Campbell *Grainger *Jefferson *Knox *Loudon *Morgan *Sevier *Roane *Union Sevier County is often referred to separately as the Sevierville micropolitan area. Grainger and Jefferson counties are sometimes included in definitions of the Morristown metropolitan area. In 2019, the Knoxville metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1,045,111, and 869,046 when excluding Grainger, Jefferson, and Sevier counties. The Knoxville MSA is the chief component of the larger Knoxville‚ÄìMorristown-Sevierville, TN Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which also includes the Morristown metropolitan area (Hamblen, Jefferson, and Grainger counties) and the Sevierville (Sevier County), LaFollette (Campbell County), Harriman (Roane County, and Newport (Cocke County) Micropolitan statistical areas. =History= U.S. federal government definitions of the Knoxville metropolitan area have varied over time. The metropolitan area was first defined in 1947 as the Knoxville Standard Metropolitan Area, and consisted of Anderson, Blount and Knox counties. Union was added in 1970, and the area was renamed the Knoxville Standard Metropolitan Area. Grainger, Jefferson and Sevier counties were added in 1980, and it became the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area. Grainger and Jefferson counties lost metropolitan status in 1990. Loudon County was added in 2000. Grainger County was re-added in 2013. In new federal definitions of metropolitan areas announced in February 2013, the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area was redefined. Campbell, Grainger, Morgan and Roane Counties were added to the MSA, making it a nine-county metropolitan region. Three of the four added counties were previously classified as components of the CSA, when Campbell and Roane counties were treated as the LaFollette and Harriman micropolitan areas, respectively, while Grainger County was part of the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area. Morgan County was not previously included in any metropolitan or micropolitan area, nor was it previously considered part of the CSA. The 2010 population of the redefined MSA was 837,571, making it 64th largest of MSAs in the United States. The February 2013 announcement also included a new definition of the CSA associated with the Knoxville metropolitan area, renaming it the Knoxville‚ÄìMorristown‚ÄìSevierville, TN Combined Statistical Area. In addition to the Knoxville MSA, the CSA includes the Morristown MSA and the Newport, Tennessee, and Sevierville Micropolitan Statistical Areas. The newly defined CSA consists of the same twelve counties as the previous CSA, plus Morgan County. As of 2010, the Knoxville CSA ranked as 51st largest in the United States with a 2010 census population of 1,077,073. It has an estimated 1,096,961 residents as of 2014, making it the 50th largest CSA. Knoxville Economic Area As of 2004, the federal government's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) identified the Knoxville Economic Area as consisting of the Knoxville‚ÄìSevierville‚ÄìLaFollette CSA (as it was then defined) plus Bell County, Kentucky, and Claiborne, Hancock, Monroe, Morgan and Scott counties in Tennessee. BEA defines economic areas as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas that form regional centers of economic activity, plus the surrounding counties that are determined to be economically related to these centers of activity, based on a combination of census commuting data and newspaper circulation data supplied by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The Knoxville Economic Area was one of 179 economic areas that the BEA identified in the United States as of 2004.

It is endemic to a small area of eastern Brazil. The bird was not described as a new species until 2007 (coincidentally, another species was also described from the same region in 2007, the Diamantina tapaculo). The binomial name commemorates the German-born naturalist Rolf Grantsau who collected a specimen in 1965 that was recently identified as this species. Taxonomy The Sincor√° antwren was first described in 2007 from a specimen collected near the small town of Mucug√™ in the state of Bahia, eastern Brazil. It was given the binomial name Formicivora grantsaui. The specific epithet commemorates the German-born naturalist Rolf Grantsau who had collected a specimen in 1965.  Description  The Sincor√° antwren weighs . The adult male has brown upperparts. The face, throat, breast and upper belly are black bordered with white. The lower belly and vent are grey and the flanks are brown. The upperwing-coverts are black with white spots while the underwing-coverts are grey and white. The tail feathers are grey below with white tips and a black subterminal band. The bill is black and the feet are grey with yellowish soles. Adult females are paler above than the males and have a white face and underparts with heavy black streaking. The rusty-backed antwren (F. rufa) is similar to the Sincor√° antwren but has paler and more rufous upperparts, yellowish flanks and entirely white underwing-coverts. The bird has several calls. The alarm call typically consists of three notes, a single note followed by two short notes. Other related antwrens usually have a two-note alarm call. The song is a series of repeated short notes uttered at a rate of about 2.1 notes per second, much slower than the song of the rusty-backed antwren. Pairs have a distinctive short duetting call, often given after singing. Birds also give a soft whistling distress call and a harsh scolding call.  Distribution and habitat  It is found in the Serra do Sincor√°, part of the Espinha√ßo Mountains located at the eastern edge of the Chapada Diamantina region in the Bahia state. So far it has been recorded from four areas between 850 and 1100 metres above sea-level. It inhabits rocky outcrops in the scrubby savanna known as campo rupestre.

Her task in her final classification was to provide a \\"home base\\" for torpedo boats in remote parts of the ocean during the war, and to provide them with necessary services, such as fuel, food, and repairs. Construction Jamestown was built as Savarona in 1928, by Pusey & Jones Corp., Wilmington, Delaware, for Mrs. Thomas S. Cadwallader of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While Mrs. Cadwallader operated her, Savarona was said to be the largest and most luxurious yacht in the world. Colonel William Boyce Thompson purchased the palatial vessel in 1929, and renamed her Alder prior to his daughter donating the vessel to the U.S. Navy.  Yacht acquired by the Navy  Alder was donated to the U.S. Navy at New York on 6 December 1940; converted into a gunboat in the Fletcher Division Shipyard of Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., Hoboken, New Jersey; renamed Jamestown and designated PG-55; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard 26 May 1941 with Commander A. P. Lawton in command.  World War II operations  Jamestown's first summer in the Navy was devoted to training U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen. She sailed to Annapolis, Maryland, 1 June to embark her first detachment of 100 third-class men and 3 instructors for a 2-week training cruise to Norfolk, Virginia. = Conversion to motor torpedo boat tender = At the end of the summer, after completing a number of similar cruises, Jamestown steamed to New York to be fitted out as a motor-torpedo-boat tender. When final conversion was completed, she sailed to Melville, Rhode Island, to assist in establishing the Motor Torpedo Boat Training Center and to serve as training ship and tender for the boats of Squadron 4 while she readied herself for combat. = Transfer to the Pacific Theatre = In June 1942, she returned to New York to receive new equipment before departing for the South Pacific Ocean. Eager for action, the tender stood out of New York Harbor 1 August. While she steamed toward the New Hebrides Islands via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, the Navy daringly launched its first offensive thrust against Japan by landing the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal and Tulagi. = Supplying Guadalcanal and Tulagi with fuel = The Navy's resources available for Operation Watchtower were meager at the outset of the fighting on 7 August but had dangerously weakened by combat losses in ensuing weeks of desperate fighting against heavy odds. In September, when Jamestown arrived in Espiritu Santo, the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal were suffering from a critical shortage of supplies. While awaiting the arrival of the PT boats of Squadron 3, the tender busied herself escorting resupply convoys between the New Hebrides and Tulagi towing a barge carrying of gasoline and 500 quarter-ton bombs. = Constant threat of Japanese gunfire = Jamestown was at Noumea, New Caledonia, 19 September when boats of the 1st Division of Squadron 3 arrived. Cargo ship Bellatrix assisted her in towing them to Espiritu Santo, where Jamestown entrusted them to two fast minesweepers for the final passage to Tulagi and resumed her efforts to keep vital supplies flowing through the enemy infested waters to the Marines on Guadalcanal. Finally she reported to Tulagi 22 October and there, in the center of the bitter struggle subject to constant air attack, began servicing the PT boats of Squadron 3. For the next 4 months these fearless little ships patrolled \\"Iron Bottom Sound\\" nightly, frequently challenging Japanese destroyers, cruisers, and even battleships of \\"the Tokyo Express\\". During the day Jamestown worked feverishly to ready the worn and battered boats for the next patrol. Besides ministering to the PT boats, the tender assisted with preliminary repairs to battle-damaged American cruisers and sent parties ashore to construct pipelines to water holes. = Included in Presidential Unit Citation = Jamestown and the PT boats of Squadron 3 were explicitly included in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded the 1st Marine Division for taking and holding strongly defended Japanese positions on Tulagi, Gavutu, Tanambogo, Florida Island, and Guadalcanal. = Redesignated AGP-3 = The tender was redesignated AGP-3 on 13 January 1943, and commenced operating under Commander Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron, U.S. Pacific Fleet. She departed Tulagi 18 February 1943 on one of countless trips made during the following year from that port to the New Hebrides or Rendova for supplies for the PT boats or acting as escort between island groups. After 12 months of this valuable service, Jamestown departed Tulagi 9 February 1944 for a well-earned and badly needed overhaul at San Pedro, California. = Stateside repairs and return to South Pacific = Back in tip-top shape she sailed from San Pedro 17 July and arrived Espiritu Santo 5 August. By this time the Solomons and the Bismarck Archipelago were secure; and the PT boats were needed in the Southwest Pacific, where General MacArthur was fighting for New Guinea. Jamestown found herself shuttling supplies, equipment, and supporting troops from the Solomons to bases in New Guinea. Her former role as a tender was now filled by larger ships designed specifically for the task. Jamestown proudly proved her worth as a utility ship maintaining communications between PT boat bases. For example, she departed Treasury Island 6 September 1944 to rendezvous at Bougainville with a troop transport which she escorted to Milne Bay, Dutch New Guinea, returning to Treasury Island a week later ready for a similar voyage escorting merchantmen to Finschhafen, Dutch New Guinea. = Supporting invasion of the Philippines = Ordered to the Philippines 5 February 1945, Jamestown arrived Leyte 12 February to mess and berth men of Motor Torpedo Squadron 24 until 18 March. Convoy duty between Samar and Woendi, Schouten Islands was followed by voyages to Borneo and various ports in the Philippines occupying the tender until after Japan surrendered.  Post-war decommissioning  Jamestown departed Samar for the United States 20 October 1945 and arrived San Francisco, California, 24 November. She decommissioned there 6 March 1946 ending her busy and useful service and was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal 4 September 1946. She was sold to Balfour Gutrie and Co., Ltd., 16 December 1946.

Archaean cratons in grey. Modern continents added for orientation. Approximate location of Mesoproterozoic (older than 1.3 Ga) cratons in South America and Africa. The Rio de la Plata Craton (RPC) is a medium-sized continental block found in Uruguay, eastern Argentina and southern Brazil. During its complex and protracted history it interacted with a series other blocks and is therefore considered important for the understanding of the amalgamation of West Gondwana. Two orogenic cycles have been identified in the RPC: a 2000 Ma-old western domain representing the old craton and a 700‚Äì500 Ma-old eastern domain assigned to the Brasiliano Cycle. It is one of the five cratons (ancient nuclei) of the South American continent. The other four cratons are: Amazonia, S√£o Francisco, R√≠o Apa and Arequipa‚ÄìAntofalla. Geology Shear zones and terranes in Uruguay after Three shear zones divides the Precambrian basement of Uruguay and southern Brazil into four terranes. Along the Uruguayan east coast (reaching into Brazil) is the Cuchilla Dionisio Terrane, an allochthonous African block juxtaposed to the RPC along the Sierra Ballena Shear Zone (SBSZ). West of Cuchilla Dionisio, the Nico P√©rez Terrane is delimited by two longitudinal shear zones: the SBSZ and the Late Mesoporterozoic Sarand√≠ del Y√≠ Shear Zone (SYSZ). In the Nico P√©rez Terrane, Neoproterzoic sedimentary successions crop out, probably deposited on an Atlantic-style continental shelf. The terrane hosts a swarm of NEE-SSW oriented dykes that date to the Neoproterozoic. East of the SYSZ, the latitudinal Colonia Shear Zone (CSZ) separates the Palaeoproterozoic (2000¬±100 Ma) Piedra Alta Terrane to the north from the Tandilia Terrane to the south. A period of extensional tectonics in the Late Paleoproterozoic coincided with the formation and intrusion of the Piedra Alta mafic dike swarm and the rapakivi granites of Illescas Batholith. The 1790¬±5 Ma-old Late Palaeoproterozoic Piedra Alta mafic dike swarm was subsequently affected by the -wide Mesoproterozoic SYSZ and its eastern end bends along the dextral megashear zone.  Tectonic evolution  Today, the R√≠o de la Plata Craton crops out in southern Uruguay and parts of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Crystalline rocks of the R√≠o de la Plata Craton are dated between 2200 and 1700 million years ago, such as rocks in Uruguay which are dated at 1790 ¬±5 Ma. Dikes trending east-northeast in the same area are dated by argon- argon dating at 1727 ¬±10 Ma. The craton has a size of about . West Gondwana was assembled along the Transbrasiliano lineament in the Mid-Cambrian as, on one side, Amazonia, R√≠o Apa, and some minor blocks collided with, on the other side, S√£o Francisco/Congo, R√≠o de la Plata, and some minor blocks. South of this lineament, along the western margin of the R√≠o de la Plata Craton, the 535-520 Ma-old Pampean orogeny is partly made of an exotic terrane that was accreted to Gondwana's proto-Pacific margin (i.e. before the Andes had formed.)

Woodiwiss. The first modern \\"bodice ripper\\" romance novel, the book revolutionized the historical romance genre. It was also the first full-length romance novel to be published first in paperback rather than hardback. Background =Author= As a child, Kathleen E. Woodiwiss relished creating her own stories, and by age six was telling herself stories at night to help fall asleep. After she married, Woodiwiss continued to think of plots. Several times she attempted to write a novel, but each time stopped in frustration at the slow pace of writing a novel longhand. After buying her husband an electric typewriter for a Christmas present, Woodiwiss appropriated the machine to begin her novel in earnest. =Society= In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the feminist movement gained visibility in the United States, female sexuality became more open.McKnight-Trontz (2002), p. 23. The United States Supreme Court effectively gutted the nation's obscenity laws in 1966, ruling in Memoirs v. Massachusetts that the state could not ban the reprint of John Cleland's erotic novel Fanny Hill.Frum (2000), p. 189. Attitudes toward premarital sex also relaxed considerably. In 1972, less than 40% of American women fully or conditionally endorsed premarital sex; by 1982, 58% of women had adopted this attitude.Frum (2000), p. 191. =Publication= In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were two routes to publication for romance novels. Short novels which followed a conventional plot pattern and were set in contemporary times were known as category romances. These were distributed to drugstores and other mass-market outlets and were generally available for only one month before being pulled from the shelves. Longer novels, set in either contemporary or historical times, were published in hardback. Woodiwiss's finished work, The Flame and the Flower, was 600 pages long. It was rejected by multiple agents and hardcover publishers for its length. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publisher Avon Books. Avon editor Nancy Coffey pulled the manuscript from the slush pile and liked what she read.Lutz (2000), p. 6. Avon purchased the publication rights from Woodiwiss for $1,500 and agreed to pay her 4% of the royalties.Silverman (2008), p. 399. Plot summary The novel is set at the turn of the 19th century. After Heather Simmons, a penniless orphan, kills a man named William Court who was attempting to rape her, she flees the scene. Near the London dockside, two men, who mistake her for a prostitute, seize her and escort her onto a ship. Heather believes she has been arrested for murder. Unaware of the misconceptions on both sides, the captain of the ship, Brandon Birmingham, rapes Heather. When he does so, he ruptures her hymen and realizes she was a virgin and, therefore, probably not a prostitute. Likewise, Heather realizes Brandon can't possibly be a member of law enforcement. When Brandon asks her why she would sell her virginity on the streets, she tearfully tells him that she was merely lost. Afraid that Heather will tell others what he has done, Brandon tries to bribe Heather by offering to set her up in an affluent house as his mistress. She angrily declines. An enraged Brandon then takes Heather hostage and attempts to rape her again, but breaks off his attack when she protests. The next day, when Brandon leaves the ship, Heather manages to escape Brandon's ship and flees back to her home. The rape left Heather pregnant, and she reveals what happened to her aunt and uncle. Brandon is tracked down and a magistrate forces him and Heather to marry. Neither is pleased with their new situation. Over the next few months, as they prepare for and undertake a voyage to Brandon's home in Charleston, South Carolina, their feelings for each other begin to soften. Once in the United States, Heather is plagued by Louisa Wells, Brandon's jealous former betrothed, who attempts to drive a wedge between the couple. Other jealous girls, including Sybil Scott, also try to cause problems between Heather and Brandon. Heather and Brandon continue to misunderstand each other's motives, leading to much tension between them. Heather eventually gives birth to a healthy son, Beau. Several months later, Heather and Brandon resolve their differences, profess their love to each other, and share a bed for the first time as husband and wife. The following morning, Sybil Scott is found murdered. Although Brandon is accused of the crime, Heather is able to provide him an alibi. Soon after, Heather is blackmailed by Thomas Hint, the former assistant to William Court. Thomas also left England and came to Charleston where he opened a dress shop. He threatens to tell the authorities that Heather murdered William. One of Brandon's sailors named Dickie also informs Louisa that Brandon had discovered Heather on the streets. Louisa believes that Heather was a prostitute, and confronts Brandon. She promises to forgive him for his dalliance if he will send Heather back to London and allow her to take Heather's place as wife and mother of Beau. Brandon threatens Louisa and sends her away. When she is found dead the following morning, Brandon is arrested. Heather confronts Thomas, who confesses to killing both women, and also William Court, and then tries to rape her. She is saved by Brandon, who had been released from jail. During the ensuing confrontation, Brandon is shot in the arm. Thomas escapes, but the skittish horse he chose bucks him to the ground. A tree limb collapsed on him, killing him instantly. The charges against Brandon are dropped, and he and Heather live happily ever after. Genre At the time of this novel's publication, romance novels, especially those distributed in mass-market format, were generally very chaste, with minimal physical intimacy between the protagonists. Heroines remained virgins-or chaste widows-throughout the novel. The Flame and the Flower departed from this notion quite early in the book.The initial sex scene took place on page 28. (Frum (2000), p. 193.) The sexual encounters were not only graphic, but also sometimes violent and non- consensual. The heroine was not only raped by her future husband, but two other men attempted to rape her. The initial rape was used as a plot device to overcome the societal norms which frowned on women who consented to premarital sex. (Archive) Instead of being described as a completely violent act, the rape was depicted as an \\"erotic fantasy\\" of subjugation. In many romances, heroines generally did not have strong personalities, and were more submissive to the heroes.Thurston (1987), p. 42. Heroines of gothic romances often displayed more spunk, but were still dependent on a wealthy, handsome hero. Woodiwiss developed her female protagonist, Heather, more along the lines of a gothic heroine, as slightly more independent but still occasionally needing a stronger man to rescue her.Radway (1999), p. 572.Radway (1999), p. 571. However, rather than being completely dependent on her hero, Heather acted in a manner that earned his respect along with his love. Woodiwiss's hero, Brandon, was initially depicted as ominous and dangerous, \\"darkly tanned\\" with black hair and a willingness to imprison the heroine to get his way. As the book progressed, the hero was instead subjugated by his love for the heroine. In the novel's climax he was described as \\"pale\\" and \\"trembling\\", the antithesis of his initial description. In her book The Dangerous Lover, Deborah Lutz labels this reversal a \\"grandness of contradiction distinct from other romance formulas, particularly earlier ones\\". In another departure from romances of the time, The Flame and the Flower took the reader on journey to multiple locales, some exotic for their time. The travel was routine for the hero, but allowed the heroine to have a grand adventure. Publication Like most paperback publishers, Avon chose one book each month to receive extensive advertising and a larger than normal print run. In 1970, Avon had broken with tradition by selecting Burt Hirschfield's Fire Island, which had not previously been published in hardback, as a featured title. After reading The Flame and the Flower, Coffey believed that it, like Fire Island, could be a successful original feature. With its April 1972 publication as an \\"Avon Spectacular\\" book, the novel became the first single-title romance novel to be published as an original paperback.Category romances were always published originally in paperback; romances that did not fit into a category line debuted in hardcover. Like category romances, it was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets. Paperback books generally were not reviewed by critics. The novel's more erotic content probably contributed to it being a better candidate for initial paperback release rather than hardcover. The book was scheduled for an initial print run of 500,000 copies. By 1978, it had been through 40 printings and had sold over 4.5 million copies.Frum (2000), p. 193. It is still in print as of 2020. The cover, designed by Avon Art Director Barbara Bertoli, set a standard for sensual historical romance covers. The cover was an example of what was called \\"the Avon look\\" with a large solid color background, large type, and a small vignette. One early version of the cover included a vignette by veteran illustrator Robert McGinnis. To reflect the more sensual content of the novel, the cover depicted a couple in a full-embrace rather than subtly hinting at physical contact.McKnight-Trontz (2002), p. 24. Influence Avon followed its release of The Flame and the Flower with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss's second novel, The Wolf and the Dove and two similarly themed romance novels by newcomer Rosemary Rogers. In 1975, Publishers Weekly reported that these four \\"Avon originals\\" had sold a combined 8 million copies.Thurston, pp 47-48. Avon's \\"extraordinary success\\" led other paperback publishing firms to begin featuring original works by new authors. Avon became known as the premier publishing company for new writers of romance novels. Between 1972 and 1974, the popularity of gothic romances began to wane. The roots of this decline may lie in the sexual revolution and the feminist movement and are likely entwined with the success of The Flame and the Flower. Women were more accepting of, and possibly actively looking for, increased sensuality in novels. This novel-along with Woodiwiss's second and the two Rogers books-essentially established a new style of romance writing, the erotic historical romance. In 1976, over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over 40 million copies. These novels were historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between helpless heroines and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. This new type of novel, also occasionally referred to as an epic romance, featured longer plots and more intimate and steamy sex scenes. Female characters often travelled to exotic locations and historical incidents or issues were often used as plot points.Malhern (1989), p. 56. The Flame and the Flower directly inspired LaVyrle Spencer and Jude Deveraux to begin their own careers as historical romance novelists. According to Deveraux, she began work on her first book, The Enchanted Land, the day after she finished reading The Flame and the Flower Radway (2001), p. 230.

The range is sometimes referred to as The Wyomings. The vast majority of the range is public land administered by the U.S. Forest Service as part of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and is a popular destination for hiking, camping, fishing, horseback riding, snowmobiling, hunting, and other activities. The range contains numerous lakes and developed campgrounds, in addition to many wild and primitive areas. The closest towns to the range include Big Piney, Marbleton, La Barge, and Kemmerer. A branch of the Oregon Trail known as the Lander Road traverses the mountain range. The cutoff offered emigrants a shorter travel option. Numerous grave sites and historical markers can be found relating to the trail. The range is not to be confused with the Salt River Range, which runs closely parallel to the Wyoming Range on its western side. The two ranges are separated by Greys River that flows north through the Star Valley into the Snake River.

He spent much of his life working in Las Vegas. He played trumpet in bands led by Louie Bellson, Buddy Morrow, and Billy May. He composed \\"Little Train\\", which was recorded by the Buddy Rich Big Band. He worked as trumpeter and conductor for Frank Sinatra and Frank Sinatra Jr. Early years When he was fourteen, his mother died.\\"Obituary for Evelyn Phillips\\", Nebraska State Journal, October 24, 1949 (pg. 1). She played a significant role in introducing him to music. Distraught over the loss and in conflict with his father, he moved in with his aunt and uncle. When he was nineteen, his father died. Career Phillips graduated from Fremont High School in Fremont, Nebraska, in 1953 and attended the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, during the summer of 1954. After high school, he played trumpet in the Dick Mango Orchestra and the Verne Byers Orchestra. While touring with the latter, he met Pat Thompson, a trombonist with whom he became lifelong friends. While touring with Byers, he arranged songs, including \\"Pennies from Heaven\\". In 1955, Phillips and Thompson moved to New York City and shared an apartment. Bill Evans lived in the basement apartment. While waiting to get his union card, a six-month period, Phillips substituted in the bands of Les Elgart, Woody Herman, Dan Terry, Leon Merian, and Jimmy Dorsey. In 1960, he and his wife Carol moved to Las Vegas, joining Thompson. He spent the rest of his life in Las Vegas. He played in several show bands and worked for many years in the house band at the Flamingo Las Vegas. He belonged to the Las Vegas Hilton house band from 1970 to 1983. Although his colleagues often saw him writing arrangements during breaks, as seen in the documentary film of Elvis Presley's first appearance at the Hilton, he usually refused composer work while working there and concentrated on his house band performances. In 1973, he became close friends with James Moody while Moody worked at the Hilton. He also performed with the David Rose Orchestra. Several factors compelled Phillips to leave the Hilton. The Hilton management changed the showroom format by bringing in a production show, the type of show that, if it were a hit, would require a musician to play the same music for years. Phillips was disinclined. Around 1975, he injured his lip, which developed into a lump that wouldn't heal. He took lessons to rebuild his embouchure but worried that if he continued to play he would permanently damage his lip. Verne Byers felt that the music industry (from the perspective of musicians) fell apart in Las Vegas in 1983. According to Byers, the big band era was in decline and casinos were switching from live bands to recorded music, which resulted in a musicians' strike in 1989.Emmily N. Bristol, \\"Byers Orchestra: Group Enjoys Sounds of World War II Era\\", The View (Las Vegas) August 31, 2001 Personal life Phillips died on September 13, 1995, from complications of an aneurysm while conducting a jazz band rehearsal at the Community College of Southern Nevada.

Bass is currently an independent scholar who writes broadly on American religion and culture. She is the author of eight books, three of which have won research or writing awards. She earned a PhD in religious studies from Duke University in 1991 with an emphasis on American ecclesiastical history. While at Duke she studied under George Marsden. From 1995 to 2000, she wrote a weekly column on religion and culture for the New York Times Syndicate that appeared in more than seventy newspapers nationwide and has since become a popular commentator on American religion for other media outlets. Currently, she is a blogger for the God's Politics blog with Jim Wallis at Beliefnet, as well as On Faith and The Huffington Post. She is associated with Sojourners and the Red-Letter Christian movement. Early life and education Born on 1959, in Baltimore, Maryland, Bass grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona. Raised a United Methodist, she became an evangelical. She attended Westmont College, from which she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1981. She received a Master of Arts in Theological Studies degree in ecclesiastical history from Gordon‚ÄìConwell Theological Seminary in 1986. Studying under the supervision of George Marsden, she received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in religious studies from Duke University in 1991. Her doctoral thesis was titled Standing Against the Whirlwind: The Evangelical Party in the 19th Century Protestant Episcopal Church. Her spiritual memoir, Strength for the Journey: A Pilgrimage of Faith in Community, records her growing dissatisfaction with conservative evangelical religion. She is now a member of the Episcopal Church. Career For a decade, she worked primarily as an academic before becoming an independent scholar. She began in 1991 as an assistant professor of religious studies at Westmont College, from which she was fired in 1995. She went on to serve as a history instructor at the University of California at Santa Barbara from 1995 to 1996, as a visiting assistant professor of religious studies at Macalester College from 1996 to 1997, and as an associate professor of religious studies at Rhodes College from 1997 to 2000. In 2002, the Lilly Endowment awarded Bass a major grant to support her research on mainline Protestant churches at Virginia Theological Seminary. Bass's books range from a study of nineteenth-century evangelicalism (Standing Against the Whirlwind: Evangelical Episcopalians in Nineteenth- Century America) to a contemporary ethnography of mainline Protestantism (Christianity for the Rest of Us: How the Neighborhood Church Is Transforming the Faith). Throughout her work, she displays an interest in the role of religion in cultural and social change. She eschews programmatic spirituality and leadership in favor of encouraging Christians to seriously practice their faith as a way to reform American churches and political life. Two of her books, Strength for the Journeyhttp://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA257022.html and Christianity for the Rest of Ushttp://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6388182.html have been named among the best books of the year by Publishers Weekly. Christianity for the Rest of Us was named book of the year by the Academy of Parish Clergy. Standing Against the Whirlwind was awarded the Frank S. and Elizabeth D. Brewer Prize by the American Society of Church History.

The company was initially founded by financer Gary Levinsohn in 1989 as Classico Entertainment, before combining with The Mark Gordon Company in 1995 to form Cloud Nine Entertainment. Mutual is a film financier that was involved in the co-production of feature films. Mutual notably co-produced and financed several feature films for Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios. History = Classico Entertainment = In 1989, following the shutdown of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, Gary Levinsohn launched its own company Classico Entertainment and it will serve as sales agent of Dino de Laurentiis Communications. In 1994, Classico signed a deal with Atlas Entertainment, whereas Classico can finance films for Atlas Entertainment. = Mutual Film Company = In 1995, film producers Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn decided to merge their own companies into Cloud Nine Entertainment, a production company that would be involved in the co-production and financing of feature films. The company opened its office at Raleigh Studios on Melrose Avenue near the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, California. Following Cloud Nine's establishment, the company created an international sales division, and finalized a multi-year equity partnership with four companies ‚Äî the United Kingdom's BBC, Germany's Tele-M√ºnchen, Japan's Toho-Towa/Marubeni and France's UGC-PH. These four companies financed 60% (15% each) of the films' budgets, in exchange for distribution rights in their respective territories and equity stakes in the films on a worldwide basis. The company's first film under the new regime was 1997's The Relic. Eighteen months after forming Cloud Nine, Gordon and Levinsohn renamed the company to Mutual Film Company. The new name was meant to reflect the joint venture and the profits it would share with its international investors. Mutual notably financed films for Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures. On several occasions, films developed by Mutual, such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and The Patriot (2000), were financed by major studios. In 2000, three of Mutual's partners, Tele Munchen Gruppe, BBC, and Toho, negotiated with a banking consortium led by Union Bank of California and secured a $200 million revolving credit line that would allow Mutual to produce and finance films without approval from a major film studio. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, released in 2001, became the second highest-grossing film produced by Mutual (after Saving Private Ryan), while its sequel, subtitled The Cradle of Life, underperformed. Mutual's investors left the company, citing the poor box office performances of the many films produced. In September 2000, Gordon left Mutual to relaunch his own company, the Mark Gordon Company. Film producer Don Granger joined the company, working alongside Levinsohn. Filmography Mutual Film Company has produced 21 films. Of these, only two of them, Blue Ice and The Ripper were made-for- television productions. Note that in some cases the distributor or distributors are also co-producers. The box office column reflects the worldwide gross for the theatrical release of the films in United States dollars. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - style=\\"font-size:90%\\" ! width=\\"30\\"  Year ! width=\\"140\\"  Title ! width=\\"115\\"  Director ! width=\\"350\\"  Co- production company(s) ! width=\\"140\\"  Distributor(s) ! width=\\"80\\"  Box office ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  - style=\\"font-size:90%\\"  Blue Ice 1  Bregman Productions, M&M;

Its role was the training of officers in the administrative, staff and policy aspects of air force matters. History =Foundation= Following the foundation of the RAF in April 1918 and the end of the First World War in November 1918, there was a determination to maintain the Air Force as an independent service rather than let the Army and Royal Navy control air operations again. Therefore, the creation of an RAF Staff College to parallel the Army Staff College and the Royal Naval Staff College was an important element in fully establishing the RAF. On 14 November 1921, Air Commodore Robert Brooke-Popham was tasked with setting up the RAF Staff College. On 1 April the following year, the new RAF Staff College came into being with Brooke-Popham as its first commandant. The Staff College was based in Andover and was subordinate to Inland Area. The dog seen in the photograph on Robert Brooke-Popham's lap was Jane who was buried in the Staff College grounds. The gravestone still exists and was the only remaining memorial to the college in 2010. From its foundation and through the 1920s and 1930s, the Staff College provided training to selected officers (usually promising flight lieutenants or squadron leaders) to prepare them for staff duties at the Air Ministry or at Command or Group headquarters. =Changes during and after the Second World War= Although the College was closed on 3 September 1939, the day the British declaration of war was made, it reopened the same November running shorter courses. However, the next year on 28 May 1940, the College closed again. The RAF reopened its staff college at Bulstrode Park in December 1941. The College at Bulstrode Park was later reduced in size and only offered training to allied and foreign air force officers. When Bulstrode Park closed in 1948, this smaller College returned to Andover and its role in training overseas officers was continued. It was not until 1970 that the Staff College at Andover finally closed when it was absorbed into the RAF Staff College at Bracknell.

It has been performed and recorded by numerous blues and other artists and in 2008, Slim Harpo's original received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. Original song Written by Slim Harpo, whose legal name was James Moore, the song was recorded in March 1957. The recording features a spare arrangement and instrumentation typical of J. D. Miller's production approach. Accompanying Slim Harpo were Gabriel \\"Guitar Gable\\" Perrodin on guitar, John \\"Fats\\" Perrodin on bass, and Clarence \\"Jockey\\" Etienne on drums. The song has an irregular number of bars (as opposed to the standard 12 bars). According to blues historian Gerard Herzhaft, it is derived from songs by Memphis Minnie, Bo Carter, and Muddy Waters and uses the rhythm figure from \\"Rockin' and Rollin'\\" by Lil' Son Jackson. Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based Excello Records originally released it in 1957 as the B-side to his debut solo single, \\"I Got Love if You Want It\\". Rolling Stones version English rock band the Rolling Stones recorded \\"I'm a King Bee\\" for their 1964 debut album. It has been identified as an early important song for the Rolling Stones, although it was not released as a single. The band's arrangement generally follows Slim Harpo's, but includes a slide-guitar break by Brian Jones. The personnel consisted of Jagger on vocals and harmonica, Jones on slide guitar, Keith Richards on acoustic guitar, Bill Wyman on bass guitar, and Charlie Watts on drums. Later, Mick Jagger commented \\"What's the point in listening to us doing 'I'm a King Bee' when you can hear Slim Harpo do it?\\" Pink Floyd version The Tea Set, which became Pink Floyd, recorded \\"I'm a King Bee\\" and several other songs in December 1964. The recording features Syd Barrett, Bob Klose, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason. When it was officially issued on the vinyl-only 1965: Their First Recordings (2015), it became the only cover song ever released by Pink Floyd. The song was later issued for the first time on CD as part of The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 box set in November 2016, along with the other songs recorded in December '64. John Belushi version John Belushi performed \\"I'm a King Bee\\" on the January 17, 1976 broadcast of Saturday Night Live, with Belushi and the show's house band dressed in bee costumes and bandleader Howard Shore dressed as a beekeeper.

Swarming motility was first reported by Jorgen Henrichsen and has been mostly studied in genus Serratia, Salmonella, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Yersinia, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Vibrio and Escherichia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarming motility Bacteria of the species Bacillus subtilis were inoculated at the center of a dish with gelose containing nutrients. The bacteria start mass-migrating outwards about twelve hours after inoculation, forming dendrites which reach the border of the dish (diameter 90mm) within a few hours. Two days after inoculation the number of bacteria has increased so much that they diffuse light significantly and appear white. This picture was taken against a lightsource to make the dendrites (white branched structures) clearly stand out. This multicellular behavior has been mostly observed in controlled laboratory conditions and relies on two critical elements: 1) the nutrient composition and 2) viscosity of culture medium (i.e. % agar). One particular feature of this type of motility is the formation of dendritic fractal-like patterns formed by migrating swarms moving away from an initial location. Although the majority of species can produce tendrils when swarming, some species like Proteus mirabilis do form concentric circles motif instead of dendritic patterns. Biosurfactant, quorum sensing and swarming In some species, swarming motility requires the self-production of biosurfactant to occur. Biosurfactant synthesis is usually under the control of an intercellular communication system called quorum sensing. Biosurfactant molecules are thought to act by lowering surface tension, thus permitting bacteria to move across a surface. Cellular differentiation Swarming bacteria undergo morphological differentiation that distinguish them from their planktonic state. Cells localized at migration front are typically hyperelongated, hyperflagellated and grouped in multicellular raft structures. Ecological significance The fundamental role of swarming motility remains unknown. However, it has been observed that active swarming bacteria of Salmonella typhimurium shows an elevated resistance to certain antibiotics compared to undifferentiated cells.

It was written by Don Carlos Dunaway and Barbara Turner (using the pen name Lauren Currier), and starring Dee Wallace, Daniel Hugh Kelly and Danny Pintauro. The film follows a mother and her son who are trapped inside their car, while protecting themselves from a rabid St. Bernard. Despite receiving mixed reviews and being a modest success during its theatrical release, the film has gathered a cult following in the years since its release. Plot Cujo, a friendly and easygoing St. Bernard, chases a wild rabbit and inserts his head into a cave, where a rabid bat bites him in the nose. Meanwhile, the Trenton family ‚Äî advertising executive Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly), housewife Donna (Dee Wallace) and their sensitive young son Tad (Danny Pintauro) ‚Äî take their car to the rural home of abusive mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) for some repairs, where they meet Cujo, who is the Camber family's pet, and get along well with him. Donna notices Cujo's bitten nose, but thinks little of it. Later, Vic and Donna's marriage is tested when Vic learns that Donna is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend from high school, Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone), while Vic's advertising for a cereal commercial is failing. Charity (Kaiulani Lee) and Brett (Billy Jacoby), Joe's wife and son leave the house for a week to visit Charity's sister Holly. When the bite infection begins to set in, Cujo is able to refrain from threatening Brett, but soon succumbs and is driven mad. He kills their alcoholic neighbor, Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), and his owner Joe (who is attacked before he can call the authorities). Vic goes out of town on a business trip, as Donna and Tad return to the Camber's house for more car repairs. Cujo attacks them, and they are forced to take shelter in their Ford Pinto. Donna tries to drive home, but the car's alternator dies and the two are trapped inside. The hot sun makes conditions nearly unbearable, and Donna realizes that she must do something before they both die from heatstroke or dehydration. However, attempts at escape are foiled by Cujo repeatedly attacking the car and breaking a window in the process. Vic returns home to rekindle his marriage, only to find Donna and Tad missing and his house vandalized by Kemp. He suspects the possessive Kemp of kidnapping, but the police realize his wife and son might be at the Camber's house. The local sheriff, George Bannerman (Sandy Ward), arrives at the mechanics house and has a brief standoff; before he can draw his gun, Cujo kills him, knocking him off the catwalk in the barn and mauling him to death. Later, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and hits Cujo with a baseball bat until it breaks, leaving only a jagged handle. Cujo jumps at her and is impaled in the stomach by the broken bat. Donna takes the sheriff's gun and retrieves Tad, who is dehydrated and overheated. After Donna revives Tad inside the kitchen, Cujo, now recovered, breaks through the kitchen window and tries to attack Donna. However, Donna shoots Cujo dead, before Vic arrives and reunites with his family.

The film was released August 12, 1983, in the United States, opening in second place that weekend. It grossed a total of $21,156,152 domestically, making it the fourth- highest-grossing horror film of 1983 behind Jaws 3-D, Psycho II, and Twilight Zone: The Movie. =Critical response= Reviews from critics were mixed. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote the film was \\"by no means a horror classic, but it's suspenseful and scary.\\" Variety panned it as \\"a dull, uneventful entry in the horror genre, a film virtually devoid of surprises or any original suspense.\\" Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four, calling it \\"one of the dumbest, flimsiest excuses for a movie I have ever seen.\\" Roger Ebert called it \\"dreadful,\\" and Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"no theater is air conditioned enough to justify watching this scary, gory and beastly movie.\\"Gross, Linda (August 15, 1983). \\"Rabid Dog On The Rampage In 'Cujo'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 4. Steve Jenkins of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"for the most part Cujo works very effectively as a near reductio ad absurdum of the woman-in-peril- mode,\\" but disliked that the film changed the ending from the book, thinking it made \\"absolutely no sense in terms of the film's logic.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \\"genuinely frightening\\" also writing, \\"Builds slowly but surely to [its] terrifying (but not gory) climax.\\" Despite the mixed reception, Stephen King called the film \\"terrific\\" and named it one of his favorite adaptations. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 63% approval rating based on 40 reviews, with the website's consensus stating: \\"Cujo is artless work punctuated with moments of high canine gore and one wild Dee Wallace performance.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 57/100 based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating ‚Äúmixed or average reviews‚Äù.

Career The political and artistic upheavals of the 1930s meant a proliferation of serious magazines. Desmond wrote for Purpose, The Listener, Time & Tide and the New Statesman. He became literary editor of Purpose and of The New English Weekly, and T. S. Eliot made him fiction chronicler of his critical journal The Criterion. Before the Second World War Desmond had edited two books and had published two novels, the first of which was The Times's novel of the week. Desmond also had programme ideas accepted by the BBC and 1936 saw his first appearance in Radio Times with a programme called A Nest of Singing Birds ‚Äì an anthology he compiled of English poets on English birds. Working extensively for the BBC as a freelance, particularly on the Sunday programme Country Magazine and on the daily War Report, he was asked to join the Corporation's staff in Bristol in 1945 and soon became a features (i.e. documentary) producer. Desmond took the West Country to his heart and saw that among the assets of the region was the countryside and the wildlife. Having had a lifelong love of birds and nature, it was decided he should try and develop programmes of this type. What followed eventually became the BBC Natural History Unit (known as Desmond's baby), having its origins in radio early in 1946 when Desmond designed a programme called The Naturalist, with the curlew's song as a signature tune. This was followed by Birds In Britain, Birdsong of the Month and many more. Early in the 1950s, when television became able to attract a national audience, Desmond went to Lime Grove to learn the new trade, and with Peter Scott planned the long-running series of wildlife programmes, which Desmond named Look, because he felt television was about the opportunity to \\"look\\". In 1955 Desmond became Head of Programmes in Bristol, and Frank Gillard was promoted to be the West Region Controller. The two of them had enough clout in the BBC to establish in a formal sense in 1957 a specialist unit in the West Region to provide wildlife programmes for the national network ‚Äì the Natural History Unit. As well as developing wildlife programmes for radio and TV, Desmond dramatised five of Thomas Hardy's major novels as serials and enlarged Hardy's global impact. His version of The Return of the Native won the Society of Authors' Radio Award for the best dramatisation of 1976. In 1978 he dramatised The Woodlanders to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Hardy's death, and this again won the award for the year's best dramatisation. In May 1982 Hawkins was the guest for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His choices included Beethoven's Cello Sonata No. 3 in A major, Op. 6 and Polly Perkins recited by Dylan Thomas. His favourite choice was Schubert's Octet in F major He died on 6 May 1999, the same day as Johnny Morris, the TV personality he discovered.

It is listed as the most successful cycling team of all time, on cyclingranking.com, with a large margin on the second placed team, Alcyon. History Peugeot cycles started producing bicycles in 1882, and from then on it was involved in sponsoring cyclists. At the beginning of the century a Peugeot cycling team existed. Hippolyte Aucouturier rode Peugeot cycles when he won Paris‚ÄìRoubaix and Bordeaux‚ÄìParis in 1903, and when he was disqualified from the 1904 Tour de France in which he had finished fourth overall, for the illegal use of trains and cars. But the Peugeot team obtained success for the following four years in the Tour de France with Louis Trousselier, Ren√© Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The Peugeot team finished second overall in the 1912 Giro d'Italia. The team would obtain two further victories in the Tour de France with Belgian Philippe Thys before the outbreak of the First World War. Directly after the war, Peugeot cycles was one of the companies that made a consortium that pooled their resources into a collective cycling team called La Sportive. The objective of forming such a consortium was to keep the sport alive in the poor post-war economic situation. After three years of the La Sportive consortium, Peugeot re-established its separate cycling team, and with Belgian Firmin Lambot won the 1922 Tour de France. During this time the team was known as the Peugeot team, or sometimes the name of a co-sponsor was added, which occasionally was Wolber, Alcyon, Dunlop, Tedeschi, Bianchi-Pirelli. From 1936 until 1955 the team was the Peugeot- Dunlop team. Yves Petit-Breton (son of the two time Tour de France winner Lucien Petit-Breton) would be a directeur sportif of the team in 1956. From 1948 to 1959 there was a Belgian cycling team which was also sponsored by Peugeot, called Elv√©-Peugeot. In 1958, Gaston Plaud became the directeur sportif of Peugeot-BP, where he would stay until the mid seventies. He would direct big names to success, such as Charly Gaul, Pino Cerami, Ferdinand Bracke, Walter Godefroot, Tom Simpson, Jean-Pierre Danguillaume, and the early career of Eddy Merckx. In 1963 Team Peugeot adopted the black and white checkerboard design, that would be on their white jersey until the team retired from the sport in 1986. During this time the team achieved many successes, such as Tom Simpson winning Bordeaux‚ÄìParis in 1963, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo in 1964, and then in 1965 becoming world champion and winning the Giro di Lombardia. Eddy Merckx riding for Peugeot‚ÄìBP‚ÄìMichelin at the 1967 Giro d'Italia Eddy Merckx rode his first two seasons with the team, and won Milan‚ÄìSan Remo twice, Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, La Fl√®che Wallonne, a stage in the 1967 Giro d'Italia, and the world championships road race with the team, in 1966. In 1967, the Tour de France was disputed by national teams, and one of Peugeot's riders, Roger Pingeon won the race. He would win the 1969 Vuelta a Espa√±a for the team. The team won the Vuelta a Espa√±a again, with Ferdinand Bracke in 1971. The name of the team changed in 1965 to Peugeot-BP Michelin, which it stayed until 1976, when Esso took the place of the second sponsor. Maurice De Muer became directeur sportif with the team in 1975, and directed Bernard Th√©venet to beat Eddy Merckx, in the 1975 Tour de France. He directed the team until 1982. The last time the team would win the Tour de France would be with Bernard Th√©venet, in 1977. In 1982 Shell became the second sponsor, and until its finish the team was Peugeot-Shell-Michelin. In the late seventies and early eighties, the team signed many Anglophone riders. Many of these came from a Parisian Amateur club Athletic Club de Boulogne Billencourt (ACBB) that acted as a feeder club for top amateurs to turn professional. Phil Anderson, Robert Millar, Stephen Roche, Sean Yates, and Allan Peiper all started their careers with the Peugeot team. The last time that the team had the yellow jersey of the Tour was the 1983 Tour de France when Pascal Simon wore the jersey, but had to abandon the Tour, due to a broken collarbone. The team had its last chance at a Grand Tour win in the 1985 edition of the Vuelta a Espa√±a with Robert Millar. Millar was wearing the leader's red jersey on the penultimate day when Pedro Delgado attacked him, to take the stage and the leader's jersey. In its final year of existence (1986), the team was managed by Roger Legeay. After 1986, Legeay created the V√©tements Z-Peugeot team as a continuation of the Peugeot cycling team. Legeay's team was subsequently renamed Z-Peugeot (1988‚Äì89), Z-Tomasso (1990), Z (1991‚Äì92), GAN (1993‚Äì96) and Cr√©dit Agricole (1997‚Äì2008), before being disbanded in 2008. Legeay's team is best remembered for being the team which the American cyclist Greg LeMond rode for when he won the Tour de France in 1990 (when the team was known as Z-Tomasso). Other directeur sportifs of the Peugeot cycling team during its existence included: Leon Van der Hulst, Roland Berland, Robert Naeye, Roger Moreau, Jean Lecocq, Camille Narcy, Serge Beucherie, and Jean-Fran√ßois Guiborel.

According to a version of Gray's Coors Tavern's website, the slopper originated there in the 1950s.Google cache of http://www.grasycoorstavern.com 12 September 2007. The same site also claims that the name slopper was derived from a comment by a customer stating that the dish looked like slop.

Simmons touted Casebeer's creation as a Pueblo delicacy over the years. Sloppers were featured in a Travel Channel television show Food Wars episode \\"Pueblo -- The Slopper\\" (2010). The show interviewed persons involved in restaurants which serve sloppers, as well as Juan Espinosa, a former editor of the Pueblo Chieftain. Espinosa discussed the slopper's origin, attributing it to the Greco brothers who owned Johnnie's Coors Tavern from 1935 until 1983 when it was sold to the Gray family. Espinosa said that a customer of Johnnie' Coors Tavern named Herb Casebeer was dissatisfied with the amount of chili on his chiliburger, and to quell Herb, his burger was covered in chili (probably intended as an exaggerated and exasperated maneuver), and it became a delighted new serving suggestion.\\"Pueblo -- The Slopper\\", Food Wars, Travel Channel, 2010.

He last played Gaelic football with his local club Dromid Pearses, his divisional side South Kerry and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team since from 2003 until his retirement in 2014. O'Sullivan captained Kerry to back-to- back All-Ireland titles in 2006 and 2007. He is regarded as one of the all- time great centre forwards. Since retirement, O'Sullivan has taken the role of Kerry Minor selector for the 2015 season. As part of Jack O Connor's backroom team, in O'Sullivan's first season as selector, they captured the All-Ireland title. While O'Connor completed the historic back-to-back All-Ireland titles. O'Sullivan joined Jack O'Connor as selector for the Kerry under-21 football team for the 2016 Championship season. Playing career =Club= ;South Kerry Born in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, O'Sullivan plays his club football with his local club Dromid Pearses and with his divisional side South Kerry and has enjoyed much success. After garnering minor and under-21 county titles with South Kerry, he later went on to become a star at senior level. In 2004 O'Sullivan tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when South Kerry qualified for the final of the county senior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Laune Rangers. The divisional side were far too powerful on that occasion and secured a 1-13 to 2-5 victory. It was O'Sullivan's first county senior winners' medal. O'Sullivan's South Kerry side reached the county final again in 2005, this time with Dr. Croke's providing the opposition. In what was considered a dream final, the game turned into a close affair. After the sixty minutes South Kerry retained their title and O'Sullivan picked up a second county winners' medal. In 2006 South Kerry still dominated the club championship in Kerry. The final that year was a repeat of 2005 as Dr. Crokes set out on a revenge mission. The game developed into an extremely tense battle with no side taking a substantial lead. At the full-time whistle South Kerry just about retained their title for a third consecutive year on a score line of 0-12 to 1-8. It was O'Sullivan's third county winners' medal. South Kerry had the chance to make history in 2007 by capturing a fourth consecutive county title. All went to plan as the divisional side found little difficulty in reaching the final once again. A divisional side from the other half of the county, Feale Rangers provided the opposition. The game was an extremely close affair, however, O'Sullivan's side were finally bested as Rangers went on to win by 1-5 to 0-6. In 2009 for the third time in 5 years South Kerry and Dr. Crokes faced each other in the county final. South Kerry ran out one point winners on a score line of 1-08 to 0-10 giving Sullivan a fourth county championship medal. ;Dromid Pearses In 2004 he helped Dromid Pearses win their first ever South Kerry Senior Football Championship beating St Marys on a scoreline of 0-09 to 0-07 in the final. After losing out in 2010 O'Sullivan led Dromid Pearses back to the final of the Junior County Championship but this time thanks to 4 O'Sullivan landed Dromid Pearses their first Junior title. The later added the Munster Junior Club Football Championship title to their winnings for the year. =Inter-county= Declan made his first championship appearance for Kerry in 2003 against Tipperary. He won the National Football League and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2004 with Kerry, beating Mayo GAA comfortably. In 2005 aged just 21, O'Sullivan was named Kerry senior football captain. It was slightly less successful for O'Sullivan, with Tyrone GAA beating Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 2006 O'Sullivan captained Kerry to a comprehensive All-Ireland final victory over Mayo in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2006 final. He had lost his place in the side after the Munster Final Replay defeat to Cork and was booed off by a minority of his own fans. However, he won his place back to lead the team out for the All Ireland Final and scored the opening goal in the 4-15 to 3-05 demolition of Mayo before leading the team up the steps to lift Sam Maguire and shared the honour with Colm Cooper (who had captained the side in his absence). Again Kerry had completed a League-Championship double. In 2007, O'Sullivan had easily his best year so far, scoring a crucial goal against Monaghan and scoring 1-03 in a man of the match performance against Dublin, the latter coming in the classic semi-final. O'Sullivan was the winner of the Opel Gaelic Player of the Month award for August, and Kerry went on to claim the All-Ireland title by thrashing Cork 3-13 to 1-9. Kerry ironically became the first team to win consecutive titles since Cork in 1990 the same day, and O'Sullivan became the first man since Tony Hanahoe in 1977 to lift the Sam Maguire twice as captain. O'Sullivan was selected at centre-forward on the GAA All-Stars Awards team. Declan is also the winner of a Munster minor football championship and a Munster Under-21 football championship as well as having Munster and All-Ireland Vocational Schools championship medals. Declan is the fourth person after Dick Fitzgerald, John Joe Sheehy and Joe Barrett to twice captain Kerry to All-Ireland glory. He is also only one of eight people to lift the Sam Maguire cup twice. He was replaced by Paul Galvin as captain of the Kerry footballers for the 2008 season. O'Sullivan also received a knee injury in June which ruled him out for eight weeks. This injury caused him to miss the 2008 Munster final. It would be 6 years before he failed to start another championship game. O'Sullivan returned to the Kerry starting 15 for the qualifier victory over Monaghan and followed that up with 4 points in Kerry's classic All Ireland quarter final victory over Galway at a floodlit Croke Park. He also scored a goal in Kerry's semi final replay victory over Cork. In the 2008 All Ireland senior football final against Tyrone, O'Sullivan contributed 2 points but famously missed great goal chance 4 minutes from time which would have given Kerry the lead. In the end Kerry were beaten by 4 points. At the end of the year O'Sullivan won his 2nd all-star award. 2009 was a turbulent year for Kerry football. After being knocked out of the Munster championship by great rivals Cork, they were on the brink of elimination from the All Ireland series by minnows Sligo. On a dramatic evening in Tralee, Kerry were saved by heroic performances by O'Sullivan (0-04)and Paul Galvin (0-03) as they scraped through by a single point. Following another labored victory over Antrim, Kerry progressed to an All Ireland quarter final against old rivals Dublin. Kerry were considered huge underdogs but produced one of the greatest performances in their storied history to win on a score line of 1-24 to 1-07, O'Sullivan contributing 0-03 in a magnificent performance. Following a low key semi final victory over Meath, Kerry progressed to another final meeting with Cork. O'Sullivan was once again a key figure as he claimed his 4th all Ireland winners medal at the age of 25. He also won a 3rd consecutive all-star award. 2010 began well for Kerry as wins over Cork and Limerick saw them regain the Munster title. However they were stunned by Down in the All Ireland quarter final. This defeat marked the 1st time in O'Sullivan's inter-county career that Kerry failed to reach the All Ireland semi final. Kerry enjoyed a more successful year in 2011. They beat Cork retain their Munster title, with O'Sullivan (0-05) producing a truly breathtaking performance. Victories over Limerick and Mayo saw O'Sullivan and Kerry reach their 7th final in 8 years. In the final Kerry looked to be on course for victory but were stunned by a late Dublin comeback to lose by a single point. O'Sullivan had to endure the heartbreak of losing possession in the lead up to Dublin's match winning goal. 2012 proved to be hugely disappointing for O'Sullivan and Kerry. Defeat to Cork in Munster meant another run through the back door was required. A labored win over Westmeath was followed by a hugely emotional 10 point over old foes Tyrone. O'Sullivan contributed 0-03 on a highly charged evening in Killarney. A 19-point thrashing of Clare saw Kerry qualify for the quarter finals yet again. However their season came to an end at the hands of eventual All Ireland champions Donegal following a 2-point defeat. Afterwards Jack O'Connor resigned as Kerry manager with O'Sullivan's old teammate Eamon Fitzmaurice taking over the reins. O'Sullivan intended to sit out the entire 2013 national league campaign but after Kerry lost their opening 4 games he returned to help the team's fight against relegation. O'Sullivan was crucial to Kerry's eventual survival, playing a starring role in their crucial win over Tyrone in Omagh. The championship began better for Fitzmaurice's men when wins over Tippearary, Waterford and Cork saw them win yet another Munster. O'Sullivan (playing in a more advanced role) was again crucial as he bagged a goal against Waterford in the semi final. He then scored 2 points and set up Colm Cooper for the crucial goal in the final as he claimed a 7th provincial medal. A comfortable win over Cavan saw Kerry progress to a semi final against Dublin. Here the age old rivals would produce a modern classic. O'Sullivan again suffered heartache as he missed a 69th minute chance to put Kerry ahead before Dublin won the match with 2 late late goals. O'Sullivan turned 30 in December 2013 and sat out the entire 2014 national league campaign in order to deal with various injuries. He returned to score 2 points in Kerry's narrow Munster final win over Clare but aggravated an already troublesome knee injury. O'Sullivan appeared for the 2014 Munster final against Cork with both his knees heavily strapped. However he still managed to produce one of the greatest performances of his remarkable career. Playing in a more withdrawn \\"quarterback role\\" O'Sullivan showed the full range of his playmaking abilities as Kerry ran out 12 winners. O'Sullivan started the quarter final win over Galway but was subsequently benched due to his ongoing knee issues. The drawn semi final with Mayo marked the 1st championship game Kerry had started without him since the 2008 munster final. His final 3 appearances of the season came from the bench as Kerry claimed their 37th All Ireland title. Their victory over Donegal gave O'Sullivan his 5th All Ireland medal and confirmed his status as one of the greatest players in the history of the game. Afterwards manager Eamon Fitzmaurice confirmed O'Sullivan would need surgery on both knees over the winter but expressed confidence that he would return in 2015. In November 2014, O'Sullivan announced his retirement due to injury. In a released statement he said \\"‚ÄúToday, I would like to announce my retirement from inter-county football, It has been an incredibly difficult decision to arrive at but, after a lot of consideration, I feel now is the right time. Unfortunately, due to some long- standing injuries, it would be impossible for me to physically compete at the required level in 2015. Hopefully, after a long rest and some corrective work on my knees, I will be able to enjoy playing with my club for a number of years to come\\".

The Elizabeth Cady Stanton House is a historic house at 32 Washington Street in the village of Seneca Falls, New York. Built before 1830, it was the home of suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) from 1847 to 1862. It is now a historic house museum as part of Women's Rights National Historical Park. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965., Description and history The Elizabeth Cady Stanton House stands in a quiet residential area of Seneca Falls, east of its downtown at the junction of Washington and Seneca Streets. It is a modest 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, its L shape covered by gabled roofs and its exterior finished in wooden clapboards. The north wing, oriented with its gable to the street, is 2-1/2 stories, while the south wing is a single story with an open porch extending across most of its width. The main entrance is located in the south wing near the junction of the two sections. The house is not architecturally distinguished. A small garage stands southeast of the house. The oldest portion of the house, the south wing, was probably built before 1830, with the north wing added by 1840. It was purchased in 1846 by Henry and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and became their home from 1847 to 1862. During this period, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was active in organizing the first United States convention on women's suffrage. Held in 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention resulted in the first major calls for women to be granted the right to vote. Stanton remained an influential figure in the women's rights movements of the 19th century until her death in 1902. The house was acquired by the National Park Service in 1982 to become part of the Women's Rights National Historical Park. It then underwent restoration, removing alterations made after the Stantons sold the property and returning it to its appearance during their occupancy.

They speak a Katuic language, unlike the Brao, who speak a Western Bahnaric language. Baird, Ian G. 2008. ‚ÄúVarious forms of colonialism: The social and spatial reorganisation of the Brao in southern Laos and northeastern Cambodia‚Äù. PhD Dissertation, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada. The Bru are not found in northeastern Cambodia. The Lun, Kreung, Kavet, Amba and Brao Tanap groups in northeastern Cambodia are actually sub-groups of the Brao, not the Bru. The Brao sub-groups in Laos are the Lun, Kavet, Jree, Ka-ying, and the Hamong The Bru are also close ethnically to Pnongam peoples of Southern Vietnam/Eastern Cambodia. Despite kinship with this group, the Bru are different politically and historically from this other ethnic group.(Korolev: 1957, 378) The Bru speak Bru, a Katuic Mon‚ÄìKhmer language, which has several dialects. Their total population is estimated at 129,559 by Ethnologue. Some people have confused the Bru for the Brao in northeastern Cambodia and Attapeu and Champasak Provinces of southern Laos. In fact, they are different groups, and Bru people are not found in Cambodia. Settlements and villages The Bru settled mostly along waterways. Traditionally they live in small houses that are built on stilts. The houses are arranged around a central meeting building around a circle. In Thailand, most Bru live in Sakon Nakhon Province, and Mukdahan Province in the Isan region of Northeast Thailand. In Laos, most Bru live in eastern Savannakhet Province, in Sepone District, but also in other parts of the province, and also in Khammouane Province. In Vietnam, most Bru live in the Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk, and Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø provinces. History The early history of Bru remains somewhat obscure. Researchers believe that the ancestors of the Bru were members of the kingdom of the Khmers of Angkor which dominated large parts of Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, circa the 9th century and 13th century. This is also based upon the relationship between the Mon-Khmer languages and the Bru. During the Vietnam War, the Bru had to suffer greatly as a result of the conflict that surrounded them. During and following the Vietnam War the Bru people in Thailand were heavily involved in revolutionary activities against the local Thai governments. The Thai central government combated these activities by increasing Thai military presence as well as increasing spending for economic development. In Vietnam, during the war, the Bru people (called V√¢n Ki·ªÅu in Vietnamese language) provide significant support for the movement of Viet Minh and later the People's Republic of Vietnam. They later adopted the surname \\"Ho\\" to express their gratitude to President Ho Chi Minh. Religion The Bru mainly believe in Animism, but some (especially in Thailand), are adherents of Theravada Buddhism, which is observed along with Animism, which includes worship of ancestors, the spirits of the rice and fire spirits. Sacred objects to the Bru include relics and fragments of ancient weapons and household objects Also the Bru have a rich heritage of myths and legends passed down orally including several stories about animals. The most intelligent being the hare, and the hero being the tiger.(Zhuravleva: 1961, ‚Ññ 6. To 54)  Economy and occupation Some of the items traditionally used by the Bru people The main occupation of the people Bru is manual swidden agriculture The main crop grown by the Bru and a main staple of their diet is rice. Other crops grown by the Bru are beans, and corn The Bru are also involved in animal husbandry, fishing and hunting. The Bru are also involved in various crafts works which include basket-making and in the making of straw mats. The territories populated by the Bru include excellent conditions for prosperity, but the regions where they live lack adequate infrastructure for much needed development. Recent projects including cultivation of rubber, coffee, tobacco and cotton have struggled due to these conditions. In Thailand developments of the northeast region by the Thai Government has led to somewhat better economic development among the Bru people. Governance Every Bru village is relatively independent of others villages. A leader Headman (who in more traditional areas is often the village spiritual advisor) leads the community. In Thailand the village headman is democratically elected by members (usually the men) of the village In Laos, the village headman was integrated into the state administration. Culture The Bru are a patriarchal society where men held to a higher status than the women of the family and where older members enjoy a higher status than their younger counterparts. Men often practice polygamy, which although not sanctioned by the culture is accepted. Usually a polygamous man will have several wives spread out over several villages in which he travels. The Bru are socially outgoing and love music and dancing. They are very musical and are skilled with many different instruments including castanets, drums, gongs, zithers and simple and traditional instruments that used to accompany singing tales (cha chap) and change songs (sim) Although they are a Katuic people, they've adopted some elements of Tai culture. Their clothing reflects this, combining Tai and Katuic elements.

Geography  Nieden, one of the smallest towns in the surrounding district, lies on a relatively flat glacial moraine on the east bank of the Uecker river. The town is on the state line of Brandenburg and is about half way between the cities of Pasewalk und Prenzlau.  History  The first mention of the original name of the town, Nedam was in 1121. Already in the 6th Century Nieden was an important Slavic fortress. To secure the town and surrounding area from Polish attacks, the Duke of Pommerania built s castle in Nieden. In approximately 1600 the estate was inherited by the family von Winterfeld, along with the estates of Schmarsow, Damerow, Spiegelberg, Rollwitz and Z√ºsedom. In the 1920s the family built a field stone manor house featuring a tower and a park of many acres that stretched to the bank of the Uecker river. The manor house burned down in 1945, but the surrounding land is still in possession of the family. On July 25, 1952 Nieden, along with several other communities from the province of Brandenburg were reorganized into the district of Neubrandenburg.

He also served as a senior adviser on four General Election campaigns: 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2015, with The Guardian describing him as one of the most experienced election campaigners in the Labour Party. Philip Gould described him in The Unfinished Revolution as one of seven people who devised the strategy for the election-winning 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns. On 21 October 2015 he was created a life peer, taking the title Baron Livermore, of Rotherhithe in the London Borough of Southwark.

Career After graduating from LSE, Livermore worked for Gordon Brown, then Labour's Shadow Chancellor, during the 1997 general election campaign in which the Labour Party under the leadership of Tony Blair returned to power following 18 years in opposition to the Conservative Party. After the campaign he was appointed a Special Adviser in the Treasury, working as a key political aide to Gordon Brown, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, at the request of the Chancellor, who was Chair of Strategy for the election campaign, Livermore went to work alongside the General Election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander, Member of Parliament, at the Labour Party's Millbank Tower headquarters, helping to run the campaign as Director of Research. When he returned to the Treasury after the 2001 general election, Livermore was appointed as Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Livermore helped run the 2005 general election campaign, acting as Brown's campaign strategist, and working closely with Philip Gould, after which Livermore was appointed as the most senior of Brown's advisers, as Chief Strategy Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, responsible for planning strategic communications, managing qualitative and quantitative research, and developing the Government's economic messaging. During this time, Livermore also worked on a number of US congressional campaigns. It was subsequently reported that as Chief Strategy Adviser to the Chancellor, Livermore opposed the abolition of the 10p rate of income tax in the 2007 Budget, but was over-ruled by the Chancellor.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/tax/article3934693.ece Following Tony Blair's resignation as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, Gordon Brown, as the new Leader of the Labour Party, became Prime Minister.

Calls for restoration of service began in the early 2000s.When announced in the mid-2000s NJT stated construction could begin in early 2009 and last approximately 3 years and estimated the cost of the project to be $156 million. In a memorandum of understanding NJT agreed to pay NYSW more than $20 million for a 75-year easement for trackage rights on its freight line. In October 2015, U.S. Congressman Bill Pascrell joined state legislators in creating a coalition to revive the project, and in January 2016, the local governments of the involved municipalities passed concurrent resolutions to restart the project. In August 2017 NJT released an RFP to examine current conditions on the line and needs of communities it would serve. The new study called the Passaic‚ÄìBergen‚ÄìHudson Transit Project, expected to have been completed in 2019, and will also review the possibility of connecting to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail. NJ Midland and NYS&W; ROW through Hackensack The ROW was originally developed by the New Jersey Midland Railway in 1872. The NYS&W; ran passenger service until June 30, 1966. The line terminated at Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City until 1961, and until 1966 at Susquehanna Transfer in North Bergen, which had opened on August 1, 1939 to allow transfer to buses through the Lincoln Tunnel. NYSW freight operations terminate at the Landbridge Terminal south of the North Bergen Yard near Secaucus Road. While outside of the scope of the project the railroad and the city of Hackensack replaced a rail trestle to the east of the proposed terminus with a contingency for a future additional track and passenger platform. Route The line would run for approximate 8.3 miles in a generally east-west alignment, creating a cross-county corridor running between Hawthorne, where transfer to the Main Line would be available, and Hackensack, about two blocks from the Hackensack Bus Terminal. There would be five stations in Paterson, one station in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, and an additional station in Hackensack.

In the northeast it borders on the lake of Schmachter See near Binz. = Municipal divisions = Within the municipality of Zirkow are the following villages: Alt S√ºllitz, Dalkvitz, Nistelitz, Pantow, Schmacht, Serams and Viervitz.  History  The village of Zirkow was first documented in 1495. The place name comes from the Slavic Sirakov and means \\"place of Sirak\\". To 1326 the area was part of the Principality of R√ºgen and, thereafter, the Duchy of Pomerania. Under the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 R√ºgen, and thus Zirkow, came under Swedish rule, having previously belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1815 the parish, along with West Pomerania, went into the Prussian Province of Pomerania. In 1818, Zirkow became part of the county of Landkreis R√ºgen, apart from a short spell from 1952 to 1955 when it was in the County of Putbus.

The small parish grew up on and around the K√∂nigsh√∂rn. The area was part of the Principality of R√ºgen until 1326 and thereafter the Duchy of Pomerania.

In 1815, Glowe went, as part of New Western Pomerania, to the Prussian province of Pomerania. Since 1818, Glowe has been part of the county of R√ºgen. As seaside resort tourism began to take off in the early 20th century, the former fishing village expanded more and more into the neighbouring woods of the Schaabewald. From 1952-1955 Glowe was part of the county of Bergen.

It is managed from the Amt of West-R√ºgen with its head offices in the village of Samtens.  Geography  The village lies on the lagoon of Kubitzer Bodden. The villages of Bu√üvitz, Du√üvitz, G√ºttin, Landow, M√∂lln, Ralow and Rugenhof all belong to the municipality of Dreschvitz. The island of Liebitz also lies within its territory.  History  The village was first mentioned in the records in 1314 on an entry in an old deed of ownership. Originally a dead-end village (Gassendorf) with four large estates, Dreschvitz is only 3 kilometres from the old so-called Salt Road (Salzstra√üe). Until 1326, the settlement was part of the Principality of R√ºgen and, thereafter, of the Duchy of Pomerania. Under the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, R√ºgen, and therefore Dreschvitz, ended up under Swedish rule, partitioned from the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1815, the parish along with the rest of West Pomerania went into the Prussian Province of Pomerania. In 1818, Dreschvitz became part of the shire county of R√ºgen. From 1952-1955 it was part of the County of Putbus. From 1955 to 1990, the village was part of the County of R√ºgen in the district of Rostock and the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. In 1990, it was renamed the shire county (Landkreis) of R√ºgen, but this was finally merged in 2011 into the new county of Vorpommern-R√ºgen. By closing the gaps between buildings and development of building land, Dreschvitz has recorded an increase in population since 1990, bucking the trend. Many events of all types are held today in and next to the \\"House of Generations\\" (Haus der Generationen), a community centre.  Politics  = Parish council = In the last local elections on 7 June 2009, Olaf Braumann (FDP) was re-elected as parish chair with 62% of the vote. There are nine councillors on the parish council in addition to the chairman. The council is composed as follows: * FDP with the chairman ‚Äì five seats * CDU ‚Äì two seats * Der B√ºrgerwille (\\"Citizens Voice\\") ‚Äì two seats = Coat of arms = The coat of arms was adopted on 30 March 2010 by the Home Office and registered under as No. 331 in the state coat of arms register. In 1989, the occasion of Dreschvitz's 675th anniversary, a coat of arms was designed and flags and postcards circulated. However, they failed to properly register the coat of arms. It was then forgotten again. With the rediscovery of the documents, it was found that the coat of arms was now identical to that of a municipality in Schleswig-Holstein. After amending it and applying for approval, the coat of arms was authorised on 24 April 2010 and presented to the village in a ceremony by the interior minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The two green oak branches represent the forestry industry and long hunting tradition in the community. Separated by a so-called blue wavy bar, which represents the location of the village on the bodden coast of Priebowsche Wedde, is a plough in the lower section. This symbolizes the intensive agricultural use of the fields belonging to the parish.service.mvnet.de accessed on 19 May 2010 The coat of arms was designed by J√ºrgen Frenkel from Dreschvitz. = Flag = The flag is divided longitudinally white - blue - yellow, and the wavy blue stripes making up one seventh of the height, the white and yellow stripes each making up three sevenths of the height of the flag. In the centre of the white stripes are two diagonal green oak branches with three leaves and a green acorn next to one other. In the middle of the yellow stripe is a wheel-less black plough. The height to length ratio of the flag is 3:5. The flag was designed by J√ºrgen Frenkel from Dreschvitz.  Economy and infrastructure  The municipality is largely agricultural. In the parish of G√ºttin is the only airfield on the island of R√ºgen. At R√ºgen Airport, in addition to timetabled flights by light aircraft in the peak season round trips over the island may be booked. Every second weekend in July the local flying club holds flying days.  Sights  File:Landow, Dorfkirche 1.jpg File:Landow, Dorfkirche 2.jpg The village church of Landow is designed as a Wegekirche, a church which is laid out so that the priest and congregation are positioned as if they were on their way to the Lord, usually facing a returning Christ or a symbol such as a crucifix or painting. It is probably the oldest timber-framed church in the entire southeastern Baltic Sea region. The oak wood of the timber-frames comes from tree-felling that took place in 1312 or 1313. The original church was surrounded by a wall in 1546. The church is supported by a preservation society. It is home to numerous events, including concerts of the Mecklenburg- Vorpommern Festival.

Teams =Michigan Wolverines= Michigan earned the right to play in the 84th Rose Bowl game by going through the entire regular season undefeated. With a dominating defense led by Heisman Trophy-winning cornerback Charles Woodson and All-American defensive end Glen Steele and a resourceful offense led by quarterback Brian Griese, the Wolverines went 11-0, yielding only 144 points. Lloyd Carr was in his third season as the head coach. They defeated preseason top 5 Colorado, 27-3 in the season opener on September 13. Michigan defeated Notre Dame, 21-14 on September 27. Two-time Big Ten champion Northwestern was a 23-6 victim on October 11. The Iowa game on October 18 was the closest call as the Wolverines trailed 21-7 at halftime before rallying to win 28-24. Michigan stormed into Spartan Stadium on October 25 and subdued the Michigan State Spartans 23-7. On November 22, it was #1 (Michigan) vs. #4 (Ohio State) for the right to represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl. Thanks to an interception returned for a touchdown and a Charles Woodson 77-yard punt return for a touchdown, Michigan defeated Ohio State 20-14 to finish 11-0, 8-0. The Wolverines entered the Rose Bowl ranked #1 in the AP and coaches' poll. With the 21-16 Rose Bowl win over Washington State, the Wolverines would claim the Associated Press (AP) national championship, as well as the Grantland Rice Award (Football Writers Association of America) and MacArthur Bowl (National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame trophy). =Washington State Cougars= Washington State hadn't played in the Rose Bowl Game since it lost to Alabama in the 1931 edition‚Äîa 67-year absence. But the Cougars, led by high-profile quarterback Ryan Leaf, ended that streak mainly to their very first game of the 1997 season. In the opener, the Cougars stormed out to a big lead over the UCLA Bruins and held them off with a goal-line stand in the closing minutes to win 37‚Äì34. WSU followed that with a 28‚Äì21 win over the USC Trojans, the Cougars' first win in the Los Angeles Coliseum in many years. The Cougars also survived an overtime thriller against the Arizona Wildcats, winning 35‚Äì34 when Arizona chose to go for a two-point conversion attempt and failed. WSU's perfect season was ruined in a 44‚Äì31 loss at Arizona State, but the Cougars cemented their Rose Bowl bid with a 41‚Äì35 victory over the rival Washington Huskies, their first Apple Cup win in Seattle in a dozen years. On New Year's Eve, Cougar head coach Mike Price was bedridden with the flu. While Leaf was their best player (he'd declare himself for the 1998 NFL Draft on January 2), they also received important contributions from their wide receiving corps, better known as the Fab Five: Kevin McKenzie, Shawn McWashington, Shawn Tims, Chris Jackson and Nian Taylor. WSU also had a tremendous running back in Michael Black and a future NFL offensive lineman in Cory Withrow. On the defensive side, linemen Dorian Boose and Leon Bender both became NFL draftees in April, though Bender died in late May. Linebacker Steve Gleason and safety Lamont Thompson also went on to play in the NFL. Game summary In the first quarter, Washington State downed a punt at the 1 and forced a punt without a first down. After regaining possession at the Wolverines 47, Leaf connected with McKenzie on a 15-yard play to take a 7‚Äì0 lead with 3:07 remaining. Michigan moved the ball to the Washington State 37 before punting. Leaf marched the Cougars to the Michigan 14, but Woodson intercepted him in the end zone. The teams traded punts before Griese found Streets in stride on the right sideline for a 53-yard touchdown pass to tie the game with 7:08 left in the first half. Leaf opened the second half with a 99-yard drive for a go-ahead touchdown to take a 13‚Äì7 lead after the extra point was blocked. Key plays on the drive included a 19-yard pass Shawn McWashington and a 30-yard pass Kevin McKenzie to reach the Michigan 38. One play later, Leaf connected with McKenzie for 20 more yards. Then Shawn Tims took a reverse play 14 yards for the score with 8:33 remaining in the third quarter. On the ensuing possession, Michigan mixed four runs by Howard with a pair of short passes to Shaw before Griese found Streets for a 58-yard play- action pass touchdown to take a 14‚Äì13 lead with 5:07 left. After a punt by Washington State, Griese led a 14-play 77-yard drive that ended with a Tuman 23-yard play-action touchdown pass with 11:21 to go for a 21‚Äì13 lead. In the fourth quarter, Leaf converted a 3rd-and-18 play from his own 12 by connecting with McKenzie for 19 yards. Then a 42-yard pass to DeJuan Gilmore moved the ball to the Michigan 27. Washington State settled for a Rian Lindell 48-yard field goal with 7:25 to play to make the score 21‚Äì16. Michigan started a drive that included four consecutive third down conversions and consumed most of the clock. The conversions were as follows: a 3rd-and-11 Griese scramble to the Michigan 29; a 3rd-and-7 lateral to Woodson who faked a pass before running eight yards to keep the drive alive; on 3rd-and-6 a 13-yard pass to Shaw; and a 3rd-and-7 pass to Woodson taking the ball to the Washington State 33. A pooch punt by Feely from field goal formation left Washington State on its own 7-yard-line with 29 seconds remaining. The game ended in confusion with Leaf being deemed too late in an attempt to spike the ball to stop the clock for a last play. The drive began at the Cougar 7-yard-line with 16 seconds left to play. Leaf completed a 46-yard pass to Nian Taylor to move the ball to the Michigan 47. Washington State drew an illegal formation penalty with nine seconds remaining, but executed a hook and lateral play for 26 yards to the Michigan 26, with an 8-yard catch by Love Jefferson and an 18-yard run by Jason Clayton, who was tackled by Weathers and Jones. With two seconds to play, the clock was stopped to move the chains. With no timeouts left, Leaf spiked the football, but although there appeared to be one second remaining on the clock, Dick Burleson, the referee from the Southeastern Conference crew, shook his head as Leaf contested the decision. Michigan's victory evened the series between the Pac-10 and Big Ten in the Rose Bowl at 26 wins apiece. Aftermath The next year, the Rose Bowl game would become part of the Bowl Championship Series. This would give a greater chance of the number one and number two teams meeting. Michigan was named the college football national champion for the 1997 football season in the AP poll. In the coaches poll, undefeated Nebraska (which defeated #3 Tennessee 42‚Äì17 in the Orange Bowl) was voted #1; Michigan had entered the Rose Bowl first in both polls, and were favored to beat the Cougars by seven points. This was the last Rose Bowl game with an attendance of over 100,000. The stadium was modified following the game to widen the playing field for soccer and remove lower seats that were blocked by players on the sidelines.

Sawyer. The book won the 2002 Seiun Award, in Japan, for Best Foreign Novel. The story was published in hardback in December 1997, and appeared in paperback in England in January 1998 and in the United States in January 1999. Plot An alien spacecraft arrives on Earth, contact is established, and the two peoples begin to learn about each other. Frank Nobilio, Science Advisor to the American president, and Cletus Calhoun (a Tennessee hillbilly popularizer of science, somewhat like Carl Sagan), are the two main ambassadors to the aliens (who call themselves Tosoks). The Tosoks explain that their ship was damaged in the Kuiper belt (during initial attempted repairs, one of the eight Tosoks died), and they are assured that humans can provide or build the tools necessary to fix it. This will take about two years. Things go well for over a year, with the Tosoks taking a tour of the major civilized countries of Earth, during which they view and are impressed by the August 11, 1999, total solar eclipse. Then Cletus Calhoun is found dead, under circumstances that place one of the aliens, Hask, under suspicion. Calhoun bled to death when his leg was completely severed with a tool unknown to human forensic pathologists; also, his jaw, one eye, and his appendix have been removed and are never found. Hask appears while the police are investigating and, in the Tosok fashion, has shedded his skin; it is speculated that he did so in order to hide any tell-tale blood splatters. Hask is arrested for murder, and the remainder of the novel concerns Hask's trial in a Los Angeles, California court. Hask maintains that he never murdered Calhoun, who was his friend. His attorney, Dale Rice, an African-American who is famous for defending civil and political rights cases, believes that another Tosok murdered Calhoun for deviant reasons; the Tosoks have as strong a taboo about internal anatomy as most humans do about sex: it is a private matter, not to be shared with others, except for extreme cases, such as surgery. Rice speculates that the Tosok surgeon might be the murderer, or the Tosok named Ged, who shows signs of unnatural interest in the courtroom discussions of internal anatomy, or even the eighth Tosok, reported dead, who might be alive and in hiding. When Rice brings this last hypothesis to the courtroom, Hask is alarmed and announces that he wants to change his plea to guilty. Rice tells Hask that his duty is to defend him. Small things that the other Tosoks do (for example, the surgeon, Stant, pleads the Fifth while on the witness stand) lead Frank and Rice to suspect that the Tosoks are hiding more than one truth from them. At last Hask persuades Rice to take a day off court duty, and they and Frank secretly travel to the Arctic, where the eighth Tosok, Seltar, is indeed alive. They explain to Frank and Rice that the other Tosoks are determined, because of a combination of religious beliefs and a desire to protect the Tosok species, to destroy all intelligent life on Earth, including animals that might evolve intelligence. Most Tosoks share this determination, and they have already exterminated life on other planets. Hask admits that he was responsible for Calhoun's death, but had not wanted to kill him, only to restrain him. Calhoun had come across Hask secretly communicating with Seltar, his beloved mate; Seltar was to be responsible for destroying the mothership when the Tosok leader, Kelkad, had received repairs to the ship and could then wipe out the humans, hence the need for the story about her death. Armed with this information, the police confront the six complicit Tosoks. Kelkad realizes that Hask has betrayed them and runs to kill him; Hask kills Kelkad instead. The remaining five Tosoks are imprisoned. In the Epilogue, aliens from a different planet arrive on Earth, explain that they were to be victims of the Tosok genocide but succeeding in fighting back, and will take the Tosok prisoners with them to make them pay for their crimes. Dale Rice, always the champion of the underdog, goes with them into space to become defense attorney for the accused Tosoks. Themes The book contains several references to the O. J. Simpson trial, and it was in fact inspired by that trial. Sawyer (a Canadian) referred to the novel as \\"an outsider's view of American justice.\\" There are a number of pungent comments about the justice system, such as when a juror is discovered to be a \\"UFO nut\\" and is dismissed from the jury. While questioning the juror about the truthfulness about her answers to the pre-selection jury questionnaire, the judge uses the terms \\"UFO\\" and \\"flying saucer\\" synonymously, whilst the juror distinguishes them as different things. Told she should have answered the question in the spirit it was asked, and that the Court wants \\"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\\" the juror rebuts: External links Review at Helge's Notebook * Review by Evelyn C.

Expats such as Leopold Rother worked in Colombia.  Pre-Columbian period  Archaeology Museum of Sogamoso, Boyac√° The Pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continent, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period. While the phrase \\"pre-Columbian era\\" literally refers only to the time preceding Christopher Columbus's voyages of 1492, in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of indigenous Americas cultures until those cultures were exterminated, diminished, or extensively altered by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's first landing. For this reason the alternative terms of Precontact Americas, Pre-Colonial Americas or Prehistoric Americas are also in use. In areas of Latin America the term usually used is Pre-Hispanic. Many pre-Columbian civilizations established hallmarks which included permanent settlements, cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, major earthworks, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans (c. late 16th‚Äìearly 17th centuries), and are known only through archaeological investigations and oral history. Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya civilization, had their own written records. Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical, men like Diego de Landa destroyed many texts in pyres, even while seeking to preserve native histories. Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages, while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish, giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge. Indigenous American cultures continue to evolve after the pre-Columbian era. Many of these peoples and their descendants continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting new cultural practices and technologies into their lives. Colonial period Colombian architecture reflects seventeenth-century Spanish colonial origins. Regional differences derive from those found in Spain. Thus, hints of Moorish and Castilian architecture are evident in many cities. Many areas have had difficulty maintaining older structures, and the climate has destroyed many Baroque buildings. The many churches that dot the landscape are among the country's architectural gems, whose interiors reflect the influence of Medieval and Renaissance churches in Spain. Newer buildings in larger cities utilize modern styles with adaptations of the Baroque style supplemented with wood and wrought-iron elements. Republican (Republicano) period Painted ceiling and Murano chandelier at Teatro Col√≥n, Bogot√°. One of the finest, most lavish examples of Colombian architecture of the Republican period. Modern architecture in Colombia In the 1930s, Colombia began to embrace modern architecture. The new Liberal Party government tore down many older buildings to reject the conservative past. In their place, it constructed modern buildings with an international flavor. =Housing developments= Until the mid-1940s, most Colombians lived in single-family dwellings built of cinder blocks and covered with an adobe made of clay, cow manure, and hay. Uncontrolled urban growth due to massive migration from rural areas resulted in large unplanned settlements in cities. There have been a few notable examples of high-density housing projects, but most are targeted to the rising middle-class. These include the Centro Antonio Nari√±o, which followed the principles of Le Corbusier and the Torres del Parque by architect Rogelio Salmona.

Background In 1990 the Sierra Legal Defence Fund was incorporated as a charity. Founding board members included Stewart Elgie, Don Lidstone, Dr. Michael M'Conigle, John Rich, Don Rosenbloom, Rick Sutherland, Dr. Andrew Thompson, and Joan Vance and Greg McDade, a lawyer, was the executive director. Stewart Elgie worked in Alaska as an environmental lawyer where he was involved in the litigation following the March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, which was the \\"worst oil spill in U.S. waters\\" until BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The next year, when Elgie returned to Canada, he founded Ecojustice. Lidstone served as Sierra Legal Defence Fund/EcoJustice founding director from 1990 to 1999. Michael M'Gonigle, was chairman of the board of Greenpeace Canada, co-founder of Greenpeace International, law professor and member of the Broadbent Institute. Clients Clients have included Greenpeace, the Pembina Institute, Sierra Club of Canada, Living Oceans Society, Environmental Defence Canada, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), Raincoast Conservation Foundation, Prairie Acid Rain Coalition, and Toxics Watch Society. They represented Stephen Lewis, who was the chair of 1988 World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere which was held in Toronto; York University's Tzeporah Berman; Dalhousie University's atmospheric scientist, Thomas Duck; University of Alberta's Killam Memorial professor David Schindler (now retired); and the United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead Danny Harvey. Cases =Kearl Oil Sands (KOS) Project= On February 27, 2007 a joint provincial-federal regulatory panel, which consisted of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA), gave their approval for Imperial Oil's \\"massive\\" $8 billion Kearl Oil Sands (KOS) Project‚Äîthat would create four open-pit mines north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Based on the joint panel's \\"positive environmental assessment\\", the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) also authorized a \\"key water permit\\" for the KOS site. In the spring of 2007, Ecojustice (then Sierra Legal) launched legal action on behalf of a \\"coalition of environmental groups\\"‚Äî\\"Sierra Club of Canada, Pembina Institute, Prairie Acid Rain Coalition and Toxics Watch Society\\"‚Äîin Canada's Federal Court to overturn the regulatory approval, saying that \\"the project would destroy huge tracts of boreal forest and muskeg in the province's northern regions.\\" The Pembina Institute's Simon Dyer said that the \\"joint panel has rubber-stamped another oil sands mega-project in the absence of clear answers about how to restore wetlands, rehabilitate toxic tailings ponds, protect migratory bird populations, or address escalating greenhouse gas pollution.\\" In early March, when a federal judge ruled that the \\"federal-provincial assessment panel approved the Kearl development without adequately explaining its rationale,\\" the DFO revoked the KOS water permit. Imperial challenged the decision in court but lost. The joint panel then submitted a \\"more detailed rationale\\" justifying its \\"conclusion that Kearl posed no serious environmental concern.\\" The DFO then reinstated the water permit and in June 2008 Imperial Oil was granted permission to begin the KOS project. Although the DFO gave Imperial a \\"dozen pages of conditions\\" including \\"provisions for sediment and erosion control, plans to avoid a net loss of wildlife and provisions to transfer fish affected by the dredging to other bodies of water\\", Dyer said they it would be \\"extremely disappointing\\" if this did not include provisions for adequate \\"greenhouse-gas mitigation\\". He said that, the \\"federal government missed a real opportunity to show they're serious about dealing with climate change\\" by not including provisions for adequate \\"greenhouse-gas mitigation\\", without which this project would be \\"contributing to a growing problem over the next 50 years\\". =Climate denial groups= In December 2015 Ecojustice filed an official complaint against the Calgary-based non-profit advocacy organization group‚Äîthe Friends of Science (FoS), the International Climate Science Coalition, and the Heartland Institute‚Äîunder the Competition Act with the Competition Bureau of Canada on behalf of Stephen Lewis, Tzeporah Berman Thomas Duck, David Schindler, Danny Harvey and two others, in which they called for a criminal investigation. The Advertising Standards Canada (now Ad Standards) had ruled the Friends of Science ads‚Äîwhich appeared prior to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) talks, held in Paris from November 30 to December 12‚Äîwith messages of \\"overzealous\\" climate policies paid for by Canadian \\"taxpayers' money\\". By December, in spite of the ruling, FoS has placed billboards in major Canadian cities with messages such as \\"The sun is the main driver of climate change. Not you.\\" According to Charles Hatt, an Ecojustice lawyer, \\"The Competition Act makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly make a false or misleading representation for promotion of business interests. This is an attack on science.\\" According to a December 8, 2015 article in Ecojustice's Now Magazine, the Friends of Science's funding sources were unknown. Although Talisman Energy, had donated $175,000 to FoS in 2004 under Talisman's previous president, by 2015, the new president no longer shared FoS views on climate change. The Competition Bureau notified Ecojustice lawyer, Charles Hatt, in a June 29, 2017 letter, that the inquiry concerning \\"allegations that Friends of Science Society, International Climate Science Coalition and Heartland Institute made misleading representations regarding climate change on their respective websites and, in the case of Friends of Science Society, on billboards\\" had been discontinued. =Trans Mountain Pipeline= In 2017 Ecojustic, acting on behalf of their clients‚ÄîRaincoast Conservation Foundation and Living Oceans Society‚Äîwon the court case which overturned the federal government's approval of the Canadian division of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' $7.4-billion Trans Mountain Pipeline project which resulted in the National Energy Board (NEB) being forced to \\"re-evaluate the projects marine shipping impacts.\\" The successful lawsuit \\"halted construction on the expansion.\\" In November 6, 2017 letter to McDade sent a letter to Kinder Morgan seeking an apology to the \\"City of Burnaby and its professional staff\\" following accusations that Burnaby had stalled construction of the Canadian division of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' $7.4-billion Trans Mountain Pipeline project. McDade stated in his letter that Burnaby's \\"regulatory process has been applied in good faith, as the evidence will readily show in the motion before the NEB.\\" Following a June 2019 re-approval of the Trans Mountain project by the federal Cabinet government, in July 2019, lawyers from Ecojustice filed a motion with the Federal Court of Appeal to challenge the Cabinet's decision. =Volkswagen emissions scandal= In June 2017, Ecojustice, on behalf of the Canadian advocacy group‚ÄîEnvironmental Defence Canada‚Äîasked Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Canada's environment ministry, to \\"instigate an inquiry\\" into Volkswagen's alleged illegal actions in regards to emissions. Environment Canada‚Äînow known as Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)‚Äîhad undertaken an investigation in September 2015 to verify that Volkswagen had installed \\"defeat devices\\" designed to bypass emission control tests in Canada. An agreement was reached on December 15, 2016. According to a September 16, 2018 article in the Vancouver Sun, since 2015, while United States, German and other national governments had fined Volkswagen \\"billions of dollars and sent some of its top executives to jail for breaking environmental laws\\", by the fall of 2018, the Canadian federal government had done nothing. The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) are also a client of Ecojustice on this case. On July 23, 2019 Ecojustice lawyers on behalf of Environmental Defence \\"applied for a judicial review to challenge the failure of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change to properly report progress on an investigation requested by EDC staff in July 2017 as required by Public Participation provisions in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA).\\" =Ontario cancelled cap-and-trade= In September 2018, Ecojustice lawyers in \\"partnership with the uOttawa-Ecojustice Environmental Law Clinic\\", filed a lawsuit against the Ontario provincial government on behalf of Greenpeace alleging that the \\"Ford government unlawfully failed to provide for public consultation on a regulation that ended Ontario's cap and trade program and on Bill 4, the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018, currently before the legislature.\\" =Bill C-69= In a May 14, 2019 CBC News article, Environmental Defence's Julia Levin and Ecojustice lawyer, Joshua Ginsberg, expressed concern that proposed amendments to Bill C-69 would favour industry over the environment. =Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns= Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's one-year $2.5 million Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns, which he announced on July 4, 2019 is led by a forensic accountant‚ÄîSteve Allan‚Äîwith a \\"mandate to investigate foreign-funded efforts.\\" Kenney cited \\"the intrepid reporting of journalist Vivian Krause\\", who has spent ten years examining foreign funding of Canadian environmental non-profit organizations (ENGOs) when he made his announcement. In September 2019, Ecojustice issued a letter of warning of a potential legal challenge to commissioner Allan, asking for a response within 30 days. Ecojustice is saying that changes must be made to the mandate of the Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns. According to The Globe and Mail, \\"environmental and activist groups are mobilizing against the public inquiry\\". Ecojustice says \\"inquiry is unlawful and possibly unconstitutional because of the language used in the mandate\\" given to commissioner Steve Allan. Ecojustice said the inquiry labels \\"environmental groups critical of oil and gas development as \\"anti-Alberta.\\" On November 21, 2019 Ecojustice lawyer, Devon Page, filed the lawsuit in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta in Calgary. While the \\"factual premise\\" underlying the inquiry have been \\"seriously challenged several times\\", the lawsuit is the \\"first challenge to its legality.\\" The Ecojustice \\"lawsuit also alleges that inquiry commissioner Steve Allan was a donor to the UCP leadership campaign of Doug Schweitzer, now Alberta‚Äôs justice minister, who appointed him to the job.\\" =Orphan wells= In January 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of the Alberta Energy Regulator and Orphan Well Association in a case filed against the Alberta oil and gas company‚ÄîRedwater Energy. Redwater had gone bankrupt in 2015, leaving behind orphaned oil and gas wells that \\"needed to be cleaned up and decommissioned.\\" In 2018, Ecojustice had intervened in the Supreme Court hearing on who is responsible for cleaning up orphan wells after following a bankruptcy. On January 31, 2019, in the case of Redwater Energy, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 5‚Äì2 overturning \\"two lower court decisions that said bankruptcy law has paramountcy over provincial environmental responsibilities\\". The Supreme Court of Canada \\"allowed an appeal brought by the AER and the OWA from the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Orphan Well Association v Grant Thornton Limited (Redwater). The \\"case has been one of the most closely watched by the Canadian oil and gas industry in decades\\".Canada: Supreme Court Of Canada Allows Redwater Appeal: Regulator Entitled To Super-Priority For Abandonment And Reclamation Costs. Restructuring and Insolvency Bulletin. Adam C. Maerov, Kourtney Rylands, Preet Saini Redwater lawyers said that it was not possible for the company to comply with both the federal and provincial legislation in regards to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). The January 31 ruling means that \\"bankruptcy is not a licence to ignore environmental regulations, and there is no inherent conflict between federal bankruptcy laws and provincial environmental regulations.\\" Parterships Ecojustice partnered with the University of Ottawa in the uOttawa-Ecojustice Environmental Law Clinic, which is a \\"problem-based educational learning course designed to help train the next generation of environmental law and policy leaders.\\" See also * Climate ethics * West Coast Environmental Law * Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund * Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) * Greenpeace * Sierra Club Canada References Further reading * External links * Official website * Interview with Dr. Christopher Lind on the issue of \\"Ecojustice\\" in the Canadian context, Green Majority radio program, 21 December 2007.

Of medieval origin, it narrowly escaped destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666, but was rebuilt in the eighteenth century. The church closed in November 1926 and was demolished soon afterwards. Dedication The church was dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria. The additional name \\"Coleman\\" was taken from nearby garden called \\"Colemanhaw\\". St Katherine's was known earlier as \\"All Hallows Coleman-church.\\" History =Medieval church= The church was in existence by 1346, when the name of a rector is recorded. In about 1489, William White, then Lord Mayor, rebuilt or added the south aisle. There were repairs in 1620, and in 1624 a new gallery was constructed and a vestry added. There were further repairs in 1703. As described by Edward Hatton in 1708, the church was long, wide and ft high. There was a brick and stone tower\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p124:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 about high, with three bells. Hatton describes the architecture of the church as being \\"of the Gothic and Tuscan orders\\". =Eighteenth-century rebuilding= St Katherine's was demolished in 1734, and rebuilt in 1741 at the expense of the parish,Church of England, Diocese of London. - Files of parish deeds, papers and related documents, including consecration(Files 40-7, 1750. - M0002765CL); cited in to a \\"vernacular palladian\\" design by James Horne.Example of his work Never regarded as one of the more spectacular City churches, it was built of brick, with window and door surrounds of rusticated stonework. The interior was a plain room, with a flat ceiling, coved at the sides, ornamented with a single oval panel, with a flower at the centre. There was an arched recess at the east end to accommodate the reredos. Beneath the church was a burial vault, entered through a door at the west end. =Demolition= The parish was designated for amalgamation under the Union of Benefices Act 1860 but the church remained in use until 1926. The final service was held on 20 November, a joyous occasion (as reported in the City Press26 November 1926) after which it was quickly demolished. The gate piers and railings of the churchyard, which probably date from the 18th century survive, and the site of the churchyard itself is now a public garden, owned by Lloyd's Register of shipping. It was re-landscaped in 1996-2000. After the clearance of the graveyard, the burials were reinhumed at City of London Cemetery. Money raised by the sale of the site was used to erect a new church in Hammersmith, initially called St Catherine Coleman, but now known as St Katherine Westway. The marble font from the City church is now at St Peter's, Grange Park, Enfield.

It was predicted to exist in 1946 by John Archibald Wheeler, and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 2007 in an experiment performed by David Cassidy and Allen Mills at the University of California, Riverside. The researchers made the positronium molecules by firing intense bursts of positrons into a thin film of porous silicon dioxide. Upon slowing down in the silica, the positrons captured ordinary electrons to form positronium atoms. Within the silica, these were long lived enough to interact, forming molecular di-positronium. Advances in trapping and manipulating positrons, and spectroscopy techniques have enabled studies of Ps‚ÄìPs interactions. In 2012, Cassidy et al. were able to produce the excited molecular positronium L = 1 angular momentum state.

Lassie follows a rough collie named Lassie as he searches for his beloved friend Akutsu, who he wants to be his owner. Though named for the famous fictional collie from books, movies and television series in the United States, Takahashi's Lassie is male, and has little in common with the American Lassie other than a shared name and being the same breed. Though Takahashi is well known for his dog-oriented manga series, particularly Ginga Densetsu Weed and Ginga Nagareboshi Gin, Lassie series is one of his lesser known works, even in Japan, and it has never been licensed for an English language edition. Plot Lassie is focused around a male Rough Collie (named Lassie) and his journey to find a woman, Akutsu. Lassie spent much of his life in a pet shop, and the two developed a strong bond.

It was passed by the Canadian Parliament in May 2008. The act set up a public nomination process and sets heritage building conservation standards for lighthouses which are officially designated. First introduced in 2000 as Bill S-21 in the Senate of Canada the bill enjoyed consistent multi-party support despite the unpredictable legislative agendas of minority Parliaments and was repeatedly re-introduced. The final vote of approval was made by the Canadian Senate in 2008 and the bill received Royal Assent on May 29, 2008. The Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (S.C. 2008, c. 16) came into effect on May 29, 2010 and established a deadline of May 29, 2012 to nominate lighthouses for heritage designation. However an announcement in June 2010 to declare almost all Canadian lighthouses as surplus caused critics to accuse the Canadian Coast Guard of emasculating the bill. The first designations under the Act were announced on 3 August 2012: the St. Paul Island (Nova Scotia) in Dingwall, and three in Saugeen Shores, Ontario, McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the Saugeen River Front. As of February 2017, a total of 92 lighthouses had been designated. Origins Chebucto Head Lighthouse, at left where the Lighthouse Protection act campaign was launched With the world's largest coastline, Canada built a large network of lighthouses and developed a uniquely Canadian style of lighthouses following Confederation in 1867. Advances in navigational technology have lessened the critical navigational role of lighthouses while at the same time their cultural role and potential for tourism development has grown. Lighthouse groups seeking to preserve lighthouses soon found that in Canada, the landmark buildings fell into a heritage Catch-22. As federal buildings, they are exempt from municipal or provincial laws, but they are not protected by any federal heritage laws. Lighthouses are instead merely subject to a property management program called the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO). A survey of lighthouses across Canada in 1998 by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society showed that fewer than four per cent of Canadian lighthouses have been protected from demolition under FHBRO, while in the United States, 70 per cent of lighthouses over 50 years old have heritage protection by the National Register of Historic Places. The FHBRO process has also been criticized for lack of public consultation with most communities having no idea when local lighthouses were evaluated and for the fact that when lighthouses are sold privately or transferred to other levels of government, even the minimal FHBRO protection evaporates.CANADA NEEDS A LIGHTHOUSE PROTECTION ACT http://www.nslps.com/r&p;_lighthouse_protection_act.asp This lack of protection for heritage lighthouses was first felt in Nova Scotia, the Canadian province with the largest number of lighthouses. So many were facing demolition and neglect, that a campaign for federal legislation to protect lighthouses was launched by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society at the Chebucto Head lighthouse near Halifax on March 11, 1999.Graeme Hamilton \\"Lighthouse Yard Sale Coming, Group Fears\\" National Post March 12, 1999 A committee of the society soon networked with other lighthouse groups in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, organizing a letter campaign to the Canadian Heritage Minister and every Member of Parliament and Senator to ask for legislation creating a \\"Lighthouse Protection Act\\".Chris Mills 'Saving Our Lights' Heritage: The Magazine of the Heritage Canada Foundation Autumn 1999, page 9. Many politicians responded positively but the leadership for the bill emerged from a fitting East Coast/West Coast partnership of two Canadian Senators, Mike Forrestall from Nova Scotia and Pat Carney from British Columbia. Forrestall first introduced the Bill in 2000, noting that lighthouses were neglected national symbols, \\"The government was hell-bent on tearing them down or abandoning them.\\"Pamela Cook \\"Sending an SOS for Canada's Lighthouses\\" Capital News Online November 14, 2003 https://carleton.ca/jmc/cnews/14112003/n3.shtml Content The bill is modelled on the successful Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act passed by Parliament in 1988 which has proven a success in preserving railway heritage buildings.Parks Canada State of Protected Areas http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/pc/rpts/etat-state-2001/sec6/histor6_E.asp =Designation process= Under the Act, the Minister responsible for the Parks Canada Agency sets criteria to designate a heritage lighthouse, based on historical, architectural, and community values. The Minister is guided by specific criteria and the advice of an advisory committee. Before a lighthouse that has been declared surplus by the government can be designated, a group must provide a written commitment to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to acquire it, protect is heritage characteristics and to make use of it in a manner that will be financially viable. Parks Canada published full specifics about the program on its Web site. =Protection= Renovations at a designated lighthouse must meet heritage building criteria established by the minister based on national and international standards for the conservation of heritage properties. An exception is made for renovations in an emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements for the lighthouse's navigational role. The heritage character of the lighthouse must still be protected even if a lighthouse is sold or transferred to another level of government. A heritage lighthouse may not be demolished unless \\"there is no reasonable alternative\\". An exception is made for demolitions in an emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements. Both the sale and demolition of a designated lighthouse would require public consultation. History of the Bill in Parliament The Act was first introduced by the late Senator Mike Forrestall of Nova Scotia as a Private Member's Bill (S-21) in 2000. It was brought it forward three more times, as S-7, then as S-14, then as S-41 which was given Third Reading by the Senate on March 23, 2005. The House of Commons debated the bill in June 2005 in Second Reading and referred it to the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development for clause-by-clause review. The bill died on the Order Paper when the federal election of January 2006 was called. Following the death of Senator Forrestall in June 2006, the bill was re-introduced as Bill-S220 in October 2006 by Senator Pat Carney of British Columbia. The Bill was given Third Reading and passed by the Senate on December 14, 2006. Harbour Range lighthouse, Saugeen Shores, Ontario, one of the first four designated under the Act (2012) The bill was first sponsored in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament Gerald Keddy. It passed Second Reading on June 13, 2007 and was scheduled to be reviewed by the House of Commons Fisheries Committee in October 2007 before Third and Final Reading. However, the announcement on September 4 that Parliament would be prorogued in October put the bill back to the Senate where on October 30 Pat Carney re-introduced it as Bill S-215.LEGISINFO - The Library of Parliament's research tool for finding information on legislation The Bill passed Third Reading in the Senate on December 13, 2007 and was re-introduced in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament Larry Miller where it passed 2nd Reading on March 11, 2008. The bill was referred to committee where an amendment were made to define lighthouse structures and limit the act to federally owned lighthouses. The Third and final Commons vote was made on May 1, 2008 followed by a Senate vote to approve the amendment which the bill passed on May 8.

The only formal opposition was voiced by a Bloc Quebecois MP Raynald Blais who said he could not support the bill because it might mask federal neglect of other DFO responsibilities.Hansard Vol. 141 No. 129 1st Session 39th Parliament March 27, 2007 http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=Hansard&Doc;=129&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=1&DocId;=2805041&File;=0#Int-1986764 In addition to regional lighthouse advocates such as the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society, the Heritage Canada Foundation was a consistent supporter noting that lighthouses need special protection because of the lack of federal legislation for any federal buildings.http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/news/pdf/HeritageReportCardforCanada_2007.pdf Despite the broad public support for the bill, some federal departmental staff initially opposed the bill suggesting it could cost up to $384 million to upgrade all of Canada's lighthouses to heritage standards.Federal bill to protect lighthouses running out of time in Parliament, Macleans\\" June 9, 2007 Hannah Zitner Canadian press http://www.macleans.ca/canada/wire/article.jsp?content=n060908A Supporters of the bill called these numbers inflated, pointing out that it assumes that every piece of navigational equipment in the country, including hundreds of steel towers and floating buoys, would be designated whereas even the strongest proponents only anticipate the nomination of a select number of landmark lighthouses.

Born in Lafayette, Indiana, Scheeres received a bachelor's degree in Spanish from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and a master's in journalism from the University of Southern California. Now living and working in San Francisco, California, she has been a contributor to the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Wired News, and LA Weekly. She is a 2006 recipient of the Alex Awards.  Works  =Jesus Land= Scheeres came to prominence with the 2005 publication of Jesus Land, a memoir of her turbulent youth growing up rebellious in a strict fundamentalist Christian family near West Lafayette, Indiana, including a harrowing stint in a Christian \\"reform school\\" in the Dominican Republic. The memoir is centered on her relationship with her adoptive brother David, of African-American ancestry (Scheeres is white), and on their shared experiences coping with both religious and racial intolerance, in Lafayette, including at William Henry Harrison High School. Scheeres has described the genesis of the book by stating, \\"I knew David better than anyone. From the time he was adopted at age three until he died in a car crash at age 20, we were in constant contact. We were the same age. We shared classrooms, church youth groups, even a reform school. It fell on my shoulders to keep his memory alive. This was a heavy burden.\\" Jesus Land was a New York Times bestseller, and a Times bestseller in the UK (where it was published under the title Another Hour on a Sunday Morning). The book was also the winner of the American Library Association's ALex Award and the New Visions Nonfiction Book Award. The trade publication Publishers Weekly declared the book \\"announces the author as a writer to watch,\\" and the Boston Globe praised it as \\"rough, brutal, and shockingly good.\\" She stated in her memoir that she is no longer a Christian but a humanist. In December 2011, Escuela Caribe, the reform school featured in her memoir, was closed down due to a successful internet campaign by alumni to expose its 40-year history of child abuse. The property was transferred to another Christian ministry called Crosswinds, which reopened the school under the name Caribbean Mountain Academy. Although their website states their program is not affiliated with New Horizons Youth Ministries, as of 2014 at least five staff members from Escuela Caribe remained employed at the school after the transition. =A Thousand Lives= In 2011, Scheeres published A Thousand Lives, an account of the Jonestown settlement and mass murder. Based on 50,000 pages of recently released FBI files and rare interviews with survivors, \\"A Thousand Lives\\" chronicles the lives of five Jonestown residents who move to the jungle utopia in 1978 only to realize that their leader, Jim Jones, was a madman bent on killing them. Scheeres broke several stories while writing the book. She learned that Jones was planning to kill his followers for five years prior to actually doing it, and that his inner circle supported his plans for a \\"revolutionary suicide.\\" She also found notes and memos from the camp doctor, Larry Schacht, who struggled to find a way to kill the 900+ residents of Jonestown and experimented with botulism and other bacteria before settling on cyanide. A Thousand Lives was reviewed widely and critically acclaimed. The New York Times hailed the book as \\"a gripping account of how decent people can be taken in.\\" The Los Angeles Times raved that \\"Scheeres convincingly portrays the members of this community as victims, not fools. It's hard to imagine how people might be so browbeaten, afraid and misled that they would bring about their own deaths‚Äîbut Scheeres has made that terrifying story believable and human.\\" There are many parallels between her two books. Both deal with race, religion, and yearnings for utopia. At present, Scheeres is working on a second memoir about her years living in Spain in the aftermath of her brother's death. She is an office-holder at the San Francisco Writers' Grotto, where she teaches memoir workshops and works as a writing coach. = Notable Journalism = * 2019: Raising Children Without Sin, published in the New York Times.

London She was the daughter of a bootmaker and the granddaughter of the owner of the Castle Hotel in Brighton. At the age of fifteen, she ran off with Jem Mason, a well-known jockey, to live with him in London. As his red-headed mistress and an aspiring actress, she renamed herself Harriet Howard and was referred to as Miss Howard. At the age of eighteen, her next lover and patron was the married Major Mountjoy Martyn, Life Guards. Miss Howard bore him a son, Martin Constantin Haryett, who at his baptism was presented as the child of her parents. The grateful Major Martyn bestowed a fortune on her and their son. At a party given by Lady Blessington in 1846, Miss Howard met Louis Napoleon, pretender to the throne of France, but at that time exiled in London. He moved in with her. With her wealth, she supported his efforts and conspiracies to return to France. Napoleon brought his two sons (Alexandre Louis Eug√®ne and Louis Ernest Alexandre) from an affair at the prison at Ham into the household, where they were educated along with Martin. Paris In 1848 Napoleon returned to France and eventually became President. Miss Howard with the three boys moved to the rue de Cirque adjacent to the Palais de l'√âlys√©e, where she kept herself in the background as his mistress. She had a powerful enemy in Napoleon's cousin Princess Mathilde to whom he was once engaged (1836) and who also had supported him financially. Miss Howard continued to support his aspirations to become emperor and largely financed his 1851 Coup d'√©tat. One year later, after a confirming plebiscite, he became Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Soon, he was on a search for an empress, and Miss Howard found herself cast aside. Napoleon, after having been rejected by Carola of Vasa of Sweden and other high-standing members of the nobility, chose Eugenie de Montijo. Miss Howard was sent away to Le Havre when Napoleon announced this marriage, and her secretary desk was emptied of its compromising letters. Countess de Beauregard Baron Maurice de Hirsch Miss Howard's fortune was built up again, as Napoleon repaid his financial obligations. She was given the title comtesse de Beauregard, owner of the Ch√¢teau de Beauregard near the main route between La Celle-Saint-Cloud and Versailles near Paris.Not to be confused with the grand 16th‚Äì17th century Ch√¢teau de Beauregard not far from Chambord, occupied under the Second Empire by the comte de Cholet. Within six months of the marriage, Napoleon resumed his relationship with her. His wife, who found sex \\"disgusting\\", forbade him to see her, and he, being in need of an heir, had to submit. Eventually in 1854, Miss Howard married Captain Clarence Trelawny, an English horse breeder who used her money for his business. The two sons of Napoleon she helped to raise returned to their mother. However, Harriet and Clarence's marriage was difficult and did not last ‚Äì they divorced in 1865, the same year she died. The relationship to her son Martin was also strained ‚Äì at his 21st birthday party, he asked her publicly: \\"Now that I'm grown, Mother, won't you tell me who my father was?\\". Martin was later made comte de B√©chev√™t by Napoleon III, married into Hungarian nobility and had three children, Richard Martyn Haryett de B√©chev√™t, Grisilde Charlotte Haryett de B√©chev√™t and Marianne Josephine Haryett de B√©chev√™t. When Martin died in 1907, his son Richard inherited his title. She died in her castle on 19 August 1865 at 6:30 pmArchives D√©partementales des Yvelines.. She is buried alongside her son in the cemetery of Le Chesnay, located less than 900 metres from the ch√¢teau (now almost totally destroyed). References  Sources  * Betty Kelen: The Mistresses.

It is reprinted in Bob Callahan, ed. A Jaime de Anglo Reader (Turtle Island Books, 1974). Plot summary The Lariat is a story told through myriad voices with frequently shifting verb tenses, ultimately dissolving into a patchwork collection of scenes and impressions. Sometimes, we hear the voice of an unknown historian/narrator attempting to piece together the life of protagonist Fray Luis through family records and Luis's own diary entries. At other times the story is told in the present tense, using the voices of talking animals. Through these voices emerges the story of Fray Luis, a Spanish Franciscan friar with a wild secular past, who comes to Mission Carmel in Northern California with the goal of converting the local Native Americans to Christianity. The reader learns that the Esselen Indians are notoriously difficult to convert. Fray Luis, however, is able to convert a single Esselen girl who voluntarily comes to the Mission, and from her he learns the Esselen language. She was the wife of a medicine man, Hualala, whom she left after their son died. Ruiz, a Mestizo vaquero associated with the Mission, begins a covert relationship with the Esselen girl, sneaking her out of the nunnery at night. Ruiz makes plans with Mission leader Fray Bernardo to marry the girl, but Fray Luis, who envies Ruiz, does not want this to happen. It is ambiguous whether this is because she is Luis's convert and he claims her spiritually, or whether his sense of spiritual ownership has developed into a sexual desire for her. Fray Luis goes to Hualala's funeral, where he is involuntarily involved in a ceremony to relieve the Esselen community of the burdon of the death. A mouse takes pity of Fray Luis and attempts to help him, but he refuses to be led by the mouse. Fray Luis ends up living for a few weeks at the house of Esteban, Ruiz's Spanish father. Ruiz decides that he wants to kill the bear that has been eating their cattle, and asks the Mission Indian Saturnino to make him a lariat. Saturnino, who hates Ruiz, uses a piece of Fray Luis's monk's cord to weave a lariat. The lariat looks and feels perfect but its integrity is compromised by the addition of the cord, so it does not work properly when the time comes. Ruiz hunts down the bear with his cousin, Pawi. When Ruiz throws his lariat around the bear, the lariat becomes entangled in the saddle, and while Pawi's arrows bounce off the bear, the bear kills Ruiz. Fray Luis attempts to leave Mission Carmel on his donkey, but it transforms into a beetle and carries him down a ladder into a ceremonial hut, where a medicine man seems to transform into a bear. As Fray Luis flees back up the ladder that goes out the hole in the center of the hut, he puts his head through the loop of a waiting lariat, and is hung. It is ambiguous whether he was tricked, or has committed suicide. The narrative is open to interpretation. The chapter titles provide clues, though sometimes they do not seem directly connected to their context (\\"Fray Luis tries to double-cross the Devil,\\" for example). By using information provided in the first chapter to decipher the titles' meanings, the reader can more fully grasp what is taking place in the often confusing final chapters of this text. Physical and cultural setting There is a lot of \\"mixing\\" of opposites in this story that is a direct result of the physical and cultural setting: Catholic and Animist practice, Native American and European reminiscent of Estela Portillo Trambley‚Äôs \\"The Burning\\"in American Woman Writers: Diverse Voices in Prose Since 1845. eds. Eileen Barret and Mary Cullinan. St. Martin's, 1993. 637-644 which juxtaposes Europe versus the New World, aristocracy and peasantry, light and dark, justice and evil. The reata (or lariat) is functionally compromised when two elements are intertwined: Fray Luis‚Äôs monk‚Äôs cord and the leather from Saturnino‚Äôs reata. The elements are metaphorically Catholicism and Animism ‚Äì suggesting that the two cannot function together. Major characters 3.1 Fray Luis: A Franciscan friar from \\"Old Spain\\" who ends up at Mission Carmel in California. His job is to help save the \\"pagan\\" Indians' souls. He speaks Spanish and Sextapay, among other languages. The Mission Indians think he has powers of sorcery. 3.2 Ruiz- Kinikilali Berenda: This handsome young son of Esteban Berenda is a half- Spanish, half-esselen vaquero. He is skilled at riding horses and throwing the reata, or lariat. He is killed by a bear who may be a medicine man in disguise. 3.3 Saturnino: El mayordomo, \\"a combination of sacristan and Indian chief\\". He says he is a Rumsen Indian, but is most likely a runaway Esselen. He is in charge of the chapel and the nunnery (where the unmarried women stay). He is a reata-maker who weaves the lariat intended to snare the bear that eventually kills Ruiz. 3.4 Fray Bernardo: Superior of the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. He is proud \\"of the good order, of the prosperousness, of the apparent contentment of the Indians\\" in his Mission. He speaks Spanish and Rumsen. 3.5 Esselen Girl: Wife of Hualala and the first Esselen that Fray Luis converts. Luis and Ruiz appear to be in competition for this girl. Other characters 4.1 Pawi-maliay-hapa: \\"Many Arrows,\\" cousin and best friend of Ruiz. 4.2 Esteban Berenda: \\"One of the leather-jacketed soldiers who had come with Captain Portola on his first voyage of discovery.\\" He is a Spanish settler who lives down the coast. He married an Esselen woman and has one son, Ruiz. 4.3 Amomuths: The most powerful local \\"doctor\\" or medicine man. He is Ruiz's great-uncle on his mother's side. He is usually conducting ceremonies in the ceremonial house, where he tells ancient tales. Amomoths comforts Esteban Berenda after Ruiz dies. In the final scenes of Fray Luis's death, Amomuths is the mysterious figure seated before him in the ceremonial house: \\"Then it began again, the bear sitting there against the north wall, then Amomuths, then the bear . . .\\" 4.4 Hualala: He is an Indian medicine man and husband of the Esselen girl. Religious or supernatural content 5.1 Nature of the Native American folktale: Expressions of Native American spirituality in The Lariat: One of the most important aspects of Native American culture is that it springs from an oral tradition. Not only are the tales and moral precepts passed orally from one generation to the next, but the passing is multi-vocal in nature.Ridington, Robin. \\"Voice, Representation, and Dialogue: The Poetics of Native American Spiritual Traditions.\\" American Indian Quarterly (Fall) 20:4. U. Nebraska, 1996. Stories are told and retold, and are influenced by current events as well as by the speaker's interactions with his or her audience. Native spiritual traditions live in song, story, and ceremony. They live in the experiences of those who bring them into being. They live in the dream-space intensity of personal vision and in the shared cosmic ordering of words and actions that people of knowledge perform in ceremony. Songs, stories, and ceremony have an internal consistency. They represent the way things are. They constitute a language of performance, participation, and experience. They represent the cosmic order within which the world realizes its meaning. Because The Lariat is presented as a tale of white, Christian encroachment into and entanglement with the world of Native American spirituality, de Angulo, an anthropologist specializing in Native American culture, tells the story within the framework of that native tradition. The work is multivocal, told from multiple viewpoints, and retains the dialogic properties that are the basis of all Native American oral tradition. \\"In Native American cultures generally, conversational communicants include all sentient beings; animal persons, the voices of natural places and forces, and the voices of those who have gone before. Coyote may [be] there, too, making fun of it all\\". 5.2 Magic Realism in The Lariat:See also Jo-anne Archibald's discussion of Native American spirituality as a \\"circle of discourse\\" in: White, Ellen and Jo-anne Archibald. \\"Kwuasulwut S yuth [Ellen White's Teachings]: Collaboration Between Ellen White and Jo-anne Archibald.\\" Canadian Journal of Native Education, 19:2. 1992. It seems that the power of sorcery that Fray Luis has is an element of magic realism. The description of the rope on page 93 seems a lot like the magic realism in Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. The Lariat does have a postcolonial element: the two conflicting cultures are colonizer and colonized. I'm not sure what to call it in this story maybe religious perfection vs. humanness, or, a conflict between goodness and badness in the story. Seems that magical realism meshes the magical and the real at times. Magical Realism could explain the arrows bouncing off the bear in the story and other parts where the bear is in the story. Suzanne Baker in her essay, \\"Binarisms and Duality: Magic Realism and Postcolonialism\\" talks about magic realism: ...the central concept of magic realism in literature is its insistence on the co-existence of the magic and the real. While a narrator of the fantastic dispenses with the laws of logic and the physical world and recounts an action which may be absurd or supernatural, a narrator of magic realism accepts most or all of the realistic conventions of fiction but introduces \\"something else,\\" something which is not realistic, into the text. These elements are not highlighted for shock value, but are woven in seamlessly.\\" The point regarding presenting Magical Realism in a way that avoids shock value is an important one. Plodding readers, those who are mired in everyday \\"reality\\" will be shocked or skeptical of talking animals or mice traveling via moonbeam. The more accepting or open-minded reader should not be surprised at such events because, properly presented, the so-called magical elements are everyday events and parts of the natural order.

Early life and education Csaba Horv√°th was born in Szolnok, Hungary and graduated in chemical engineering from the Budapest Institute of Technology. In 1956 he went to West Germany to work for Hoechst AG. He then studied physical chemistry at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, receiving his Ph.D. in 1963. Career In 1964 he joined Yale School of Medicine. From 1967 he also had an appointment in the Faculty of Engineering. In 1972 he joined the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yale, becoming full Professor in 1979 and Chair of the Department from 1987 to 1993. He was named as Roberto Goizueta Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1998. He died on 13 April 2004, at Yale-New Haven Hospital of a stroke. Professor Horvath had an abiding interest in the advancement of the careers of young scientists, and has been memorialized by the establishment of the Csaba Horvath Young Scientist Award for the best presentation by a scientist under the age of 35 at the International Symposium on High Performance Liquid Separations and Related Techniques (HPLC) meeting. The award is sponsored by HPLC, Inc. =Work= Csaba Horv√°th Memorial Award Having worked in industry in the pilot plant of Farbwerke Hoechst AG and then on the surface chemistry of organic pigments, he studied for a PhD at Goethe University in gas-liquid chromatography, a method of separating volatile materials for chemical analysis. He applied his knowledge of chemical engineering science to improving the technology, and developed support-coated open tubular (SCOT) columns which were widely used until supplanted by further developments in capillary columns. He continued to be involved in developments in gas-liquid chromatography in his later career. However, it was while at Harvard Medical School and Yale School of Medicine that he appreciated the need for analytical separation of biological compounds which could not be vaporized, and this led to the application of his particular understanding of separation processes to vastly improve the performance of liquid chromatography. Thus was created high performance liquid chromatography or HPLC, a technique which became a major field of study (and in which he remained a leading figure), and continued to publish till shortly before his death. Together with Imre Molnar and Wayne Melander he developed the framework for describing retention mechanisms in reversed phase chromatography (RPLC), employing the framework of the solvophobic theory. As HPLC and RPLC became the preeminent techniques associated with biochemical analysis, many have suggested that Csaba Horvath inexplicably missed inclusion in the ranks of Nobel laureates. He worked on other methods of analytical separation of biological materials, notably electrophoresis and displacement chromatography, but also was influential in developing biochemical engineering within the Chemical Engineering Department at Yale. He published about 300 papers and held 9 patents. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering. He received many other honors and awards and is remembered in the Horv√°th Laboratory of Separation Science at Innsbruck. Personal life In 1963, Horv√°th married Valeria Scioscioli in Rome, and they emigrated to the United States. He joined the Physics Research Laboratory at Harvard Medical School. The couple had two daughters. References Sources * L. S. Ettre (2004) American Laboratory, May 2004, pages 4-6 In memoriam: Csaba Horv√°th * A.

General Alava was built in 1895 by A. McMillan & Sons, Dumbarton, Scotland; captured during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; transferred from the War Department to the Navy on 21 February 1900; commissioned at Cavite, Philippines on 9 March 1900, Lieutenant Commander C. E. Fox in command. General service General Alava served in the Philippines as a transport and lighthouse tender. She transported Marines between various garrisons in the Philippines, making a voyage to Guam in November 1900 to return survivors of Yosemite‚Äîlost at sea during a typhoon‚Äîto Cavite. Following a tour of the Archipelago with the Army Board for selection of a leper colony site, she carried a Naval Observatory party to Pendang, Sumatra, to observe a partial eclipse of the sun on 16 May 1901. From 3‚Äì26 September 1901, she cruised with Rear Admiral C. C. Remey on inspection of the southern islands. She carried Governor William Howard Taft from Manila to Singapore and back from 5‚Äì22 August 1902. The transport again sailed from Manila on 29 October, transporting a Forestry Commission to the southern islands, Northern Luzon, Formosa and Nagasaki, Japan. She returned to Subic Bay on 30 December and decommissioned at Cavite on 24 January 1903. Recommissioning prior to World War I General Alava recommissioned on 11 June 1904 for transport service between the islands until May 1905, when she departed for the coast of China. She returned to Cavite from Shanghai on 21 November and decommissioned on 26 February 1906. General Alava recommissioned on 18 December. She was largely used to carry passengers between Cavite and Olongapo until February 1925. This service was interrupted (May‚ÄìNovember 1919) by a cruise to Batavia, Saigon, and Celebes to show the flag. With the assignment of hull classification and numbers to ships in 1920, she was designated a miscellaneous auxiliary (AG-5). The transport departed Manila on 18 February 1925 once again to show the flag at Batavia and Saigon and to proceed via Hong Kong to Shanghai, arriving on 24 April. China operations For the next two years, General Alava carried passengers between Chinese ports, twice returning to the Philippines for brief visits. In several inspection cruises from Shanghai, she carried the Asiatic Fleet Commander to such ports as Dairen, Chefoo, Tsingtao, Tientsin, and Chinwangtao. On 24 August 1927, she became receiving ship at Shanghai for transient officers of the Yangtze Patrol and from time to time made inspection trips along the river. Decommissioning She returned from her last cruise on the river to Nanking on 3 June 1929 and decommissioned at Shanghai on 28 June. Her hulk was used as a target during gunnery practice off the Asiatic coast and sunk on 17 July.

He is best known for his appearance with the Minneapolis-based promotions Pro Wrestling America and the American Wrestling Association. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Trained by Eddie Sharkey, Rice spent much of his early career in Sharkey's Pro Wrestling America promotion defeating Mad Dog Vachon for the heavyweight title in March 1986 and, with Derrick Dukes, defeating The Terminators for the tag team title in June 1987 before jumping to the American Wrestling Association in early 1988. =American Wrestling Association= Although having a somewhat successful singles career feuding with The Nasty Boys, he would have more success in tag team competition teaming with Dukes, Mando Guerrero and Baron von Raschke. He would also team with Jon Paul as the Top Guns during his feud with Teijho Khan and Soldat Ustinov and later Badd Company, defeating the then AWA tag team champions by disqualification in Columbus, Nevada on July 9, 1988. After losing to Badd Company in a rematch in Two Rivers, Wisconsin on July 29, they became involved in a short-lived feud with Beauty & The Beast although John Paul would eventually leave the team by late 1988. Reuniting with Dukes, they later won a mixed tag team match while teaming with Wendi Richter against AWA tag team champions Badd Company and AWA Woman's champion Madusa Miceli at AWA SuperClash III on December 13, 1988. Making regular appearances on the promotion's syndicated television program on ESPN during early 1989, the two eventually worked their way back up the tag team ranks although failed to unseat the AWA tag team champions The Destruction Crew in St. Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989. Before leaving the AWA, Rice wrestled as the Unknown Soldier, a masked wrestler in military fatigues. He participated in the very first Team Challenge Series match, defeating Mike Enos (he would later lose to Enos in a NWA Central States championship tournament in March 1989). =Later career= Wrestling for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion during early 1989, Rice returned to PWA within several months defeating Larry Cameron to regain the heavyweight championship on July 8, 1989. Although trading the belt with Charlie Norris and Jerry Lynn, he finally lost the heavyweight title for a fourth and final time to his old tag team rival Terminator Riggs on September 22, 1990. After a short stint in Windy City Pro Wrestling in which he defeated Jerry Lynn in Sullivan, Illinois on October 6, he returned to the AWA for a one-time appearance losing to Steve O on May 3, 1991. Rice enjoyed a brief seven-day reign as the PWA Light Heavyweight champion before losing the title to Jerry Lynn on December 29. Rice remained with the promotion until its close in 1990. In 1990 and 1991, Rice made several appearances for the World Wrestling Federation as an enhancement talent on their weekly syndicated programs, working with such stars as Ted DiBiase, Ricky Steamboat, The Big Boss Man, Kerry Von Erich, The Mountie and Bret Hart. Inactive for much of the mid-90s, he returned to professional wrestling competing for St. Paul Championship Wrestling in 1998.

Early in the course of the disease, the lesions cause acute and marked vision loss (if it interferes with the optic nerve) that ranges from mild to severe but is usually transient in nature. APMPPE is classified as an inflammatory disorder that is usually bilateral and acute in onset but self-limiting. The lesions leave behind some pigmentation, but visual acuity eventually improves even without any treatment (providing scarring doesn't interfere with the optic nerve). It occurs more commonly in females and is more likely to affect persons between 20 and 30 years of age, but has been seen in people aged 16 to 40. It is known to occur after or concurrently with a systemic infection (but not always), showing that it is related generally to an altered immune system. Recurrent episodes can happen, but are extremely rare.  Signs and symptoms  The onset of ocular symptoms are usually preceded by episode of viral or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat (however this is not always the case). Patients can typically present erythema nodosum, livido reticularus, bilateral uveitis, and sudden onset of marked visual loss associated with the appearance of multiple lesions in the retina. These lesions may be colored from grey-white to cream- shaded yellow. Other symptoms include scotomata and photopsia. In weeks to a month times the lesions begin to clear and disappear (with prednisone) leaving behind areas of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and diffuse fine pigmentation (scarring). Rarely choroidal neovascularization occur as a late onset complication. Cause The cause of the inflammation remains unknown, with various theories of it occurring as an autoimmune response to a mild infection, or the possibility of it being viral because of the preceding flu- like illness that generally accompanies it. It is usually associated with HLA-B7 and HLA-DR2. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by an ophthalmologist or optometrist during eye examination. Further tests such as fluorescein angiography or lumbar puncture are usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. Neurosarcoidosis is a similar autoimmune disorder that can be confused with APMPPE. Treatment Owing to the self-limiting nature of the disease, treatment is generally not required. In cases where lesions appear to be interfering with the optic nerve, methyl prednisone is prescribed. Prognosis Vision improves in almost all cases. In rare cases, a patient may suffer permanent visual loss associated with lesions on their optic nerve. Rarely, coexisting vasculitis may cause neurological complications. These occurrences can start with mild headaches that steadily worsen in pain and onset, and can include attacks of dysesthesia. This type of deterioration happens usually if the lesions involve the fovea.

An Austrian force under the command of Johann Freiherr von Mohr faced off against a Neapolitan force under their king, Joachim Murat. The battle took place around the village of Casaglia, seven miles northwest of Ferrara, and resulted in the Austrians recapturing the village from Murat.  Battle  After Murat was defeated at the Battle of Occhiobello, the Neapolitans stopped their advance and made a defensive line on the Po River. However, even from his new position, Murat was still able to threaten the key Austrian held city of Ferrara, which had been under attack since 7 April. The commander of the main Austrian force on the north bank of the Po, Johann Frimont, decided to break out from his bridgehead at Occhiobello and drive Murat from his position, forcing him to lift the Siege of Ferrara. Murat had entrenched General Ambrosio's division on his right flank northwest of Ferrara, around the villages of Ravale and Casaglia. The Neapolitan garrison of Ravale was quickly routed on the morning of 12 April. On the same day, an Austrian column under the command of General Mohr, attacked a larger Neapolitan force entrenched in Casaglia. Following severe fighting in the village, the Austrians eventually broke the morale of the defenders and drove the Neapolitans from their positions by the evening. The Neapolitans suffered severe casualties as they retreated. The remainder of the force fell back on the road to Bologna with a large number deserting Murat's cause altogether. Mirandola fell the following day to the Austrians without major fighting and Murat was forced to retire from his defensive position, finally pulling his troops back from Ferrara.  References  *Capt.

It was founded by Fernando Solanas, Octavio Getino and Gerardo Vallejo, and became closely linked to the Peronist Left. In the subsequent years other films directors (grupo Realizadores de Mayo, Enrique and Nemesio Ju√°rez, Pablo Szir, etc.) revolved around the active core of the Cine Liberaci√≥n group.Muere Gerardo Vallejo, fundador de Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n , Noticias de Cine Social, 8 February 2007 Gerardo Vallejo, emblema del cine militante de los ‚Äò60 y ‚Äò70, Pagina 12, 7 February 2007 Along with Raymundo Gleyzer's Cine de la Base in Argentina, the Brazilian Cinema Novo, the Cuban revolutionary cinema and the Bolivian film director Jorge Sanjin√©s, the Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n was part of the Tercer Cine movement.Oscar Ranzani, La revoluci√≥n es un sue√±o eterno, Pagina 12, 20 October 2004 The name of Tercer Cine (or Third Film, in an obvious allusion to the Third World) was explicitly opposed to \\"First World\\" cinema, that is, Hollywood, and was also contrasted with auteur film, deciding to engage itself more explicitly in the social and political movements. From his exile in Francoist Spain, Juan Peron sent in 1971 two letters to Octavio Getino, one congratulating him for this work of Liberation Film Group, and another concerning two documentaries that were to be done with him (La Revoluci√≥n Justicialista and Actualizaci√≥n pol√≠tica y doctrinaria). The graphist Raimundo Ongaro, also founder of the CGT de los Argentinos (CGTA) trade-union, was also close to this movement.  Theory and practice  One of the principles of the Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n was to produce anonymous films, in an endeavour to favorite collective creation processes, to create a collective discourse, and also to protect themselves from political repression. According to Lucio Mufud, the collective authorship movement of the 1960s and 1970s was \\"among other things, about erasing any authorial mark. It concerned itself, on the one hand, with protecting the militant creators from state repression. But it was also about having their voice coincide with the 'voice of the people.'Lucio Mufud, Un llamado a transformar la realidad, Pagina 12, 25 August 2007 \\" Another similar group included the Grupo Cine de la Base (The Base Film Group), which included the film director Raymundo Gleyzer, who produced Los Traidores (The Traitors, 1973), and was later \\"disappeared\\" during the dictatorship. Both Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n and Grupo Cine de la Base were especially concerned with Latin American integration, neo-colonialism and advocated the use of violence as one of the alternative possible means against hegemonic power.  La Hora de los hornos (1968)  In 1968, the Cuban film director Santiago √Ålvarez collaborated with Octavio Getino and Fernando Solanas on the four-hour documentary La Hora de los hornos (\\"The Hour of the furnaces\\"), about foreign imperialism in South America. The title of the film itself comes from a writing by 19th Century Cuban poet and independence leader Jos√© Mart√≠, who proclaimed, in an eponymous manifest, the need to start the independence war against Spain again. Among the other subjects explored in this film were the musical and cultural scene in Latin America and the dictatorships which gripped the region ‚Äì at the same time, several Latin American authors, including the Mexican Carlos Fuentes and the Argentine Julio Cort√°zar, initiated the Dictator Novel genre. The movie was diffused only in alternative circuits, both by choice and by censorship obligations.Entrevista con Alfredo Marino, by Jairo Straccia, Segundo Enfoque, May 2003  Ya es tiempo de violencia (1969)  In 1969, the film director Enrique Ju√°rez thus anonymously produced Ya es tiempo de violencia (Now is the Time for Violence), mainly concerned with the events of the May 1969 Cordobazo riots and the assassination of the trade-unionist Augusto Vandor on 30 June 1969.Ana Bianco, La militancia en im√°genes, Pagina 12, 25 August 2007 Other images included those of the massive funerals of Emilio J√°uregui, another trade-unionist shelled three days before Vandor's death during a demonstration in protest of Nelson Rockefeller's (owner of Miramax there) arrival to Argentina. The film, entirely made clandestinely, criticized Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's dictatorship and the media's official discourse. Ya es tiempo de violencia was thought to have been destroyed in the turmoil of the 1976 coup d'√©tat and the \\"Dirty War,\\" but a copy of it was in fact stored by the Cuban film institute Icaic. In 2007, the film was brought back to Buenos Aires by Fernando Krichmar, a member of the Grupo Cine Insurgente (Insurgent Cine Group), and Aprocinain (Asociaci√≥n para el Apoyo Patrimonial Audiovisual y la Cinemateca Nacional) made another copy of it to insure its preservation. In this film documentary, Enrique Ju√°rez used a multiplicity of voice-overs (among which an anonymous narrator and an anonymous Peronist activist, among others) against censorship exerted by the hegemonic discourse ‚Äî the voices are in fact those of Ju√°rez himself, the actor H√©ctor Alterio, etc. The film itself was almost exclusively composed from media images, with the editing used to contradict the official discourse by using contradictory voices and images (i.e. a civil servant of Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's dictatorship states that everything is well, contradicted by images showing the Cordobazo riots). Furthermore, the voice-over often address itself directly to the spectator, urging him to take action.  El Camino hacia la muerte del viejo Reales (1968)  El Camino hacia la muerte del viejo Reales was mainly produced by Gerardo Vallejo, and depicted the exploitation of sugarcane workers. Persecuted by Ongania's dictatorship, Vallejo fled to Rome and finished the film there. Although the movie won several awards abroad, it was censored in Argentina in 1972, and diffused in clandestine networks. It only re-appeared legally due to a decree passed by Juan Peron's after his return in 1973 to Argentina. Vallejo returned from exile after Peron's return, but he was again forced into exile after a bomb planted by the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance exploded in his home in December 1974.

Adverse effects Individuals requiring anti-coagulant therapy such as warfarin should avoid use of American ginseng. Not recommended for individuals with impaired liver or renal function. It is not recommended in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Other adverse effects include: headaches, anxiety, trouble sleeping and an upset stomach. Criticism The product has not been shown to reduce the number or severity of common colds. There is tentative evidence that it may shorten colds in people who are otherwise healthy adults when taken preventatively. All studies posing 'significant' results on its efficacy were funded by the manufacturer. Other criticisms point out that these studies have been small scale, with conspicuously shallow participant pools and lopsided gender distributions. Researchers have pointed out that there aren't enough studies on the effects of any form of ginseng on the common cold to form any conclusions. Scientists have argued that the product has not been tested for its ability to treat a cold after an individual has been infected. No studies have yet been performed to assess the possible long term side effects of taking the pills every day during the cold and flu season. The manufacturer was criticized for making health claims about the product that have never been tested or scientifically verified. Until February 2007, the company advised a regimen of 18 pills over a course of 3 days in order to obtain \\"immediate relief\\" from a cold. Health Canada's review of the scientific literature confirmed that this is not a claim that it was entitled to make. The company formulated a separate product for this usage. A CV Technologies press release explained the change in the dosing regimen as a choice to take a two-tier approach application to Health Canada. In 2015 a class action lawsuit was launched that claimed that the manufacturer misled people. This lawsuit was subsequently dismissed in a B.C. Supreme Court ruling. The appeal on this case has been dismissed.

Haldimand House in 2012 Early years The history goes back to 1834 when Ranald McKinnon was hired by the Grand River Navigation Company to construct Caledonia Dam and Lock number 3 at Caledonia. At this time the town was just a small village with buildings clustered around the corner of what today is Argyle Street North and Caithness Street. When McKinnon came to Caledonia it was a vast wilderness, with only this main corner cleared and settled. There was a tavern owned by a Mr. Bryant, and a log cabin owned by a native man. The south side of the Grand River at Caledonia had not yet seen any development. McKinnon, after completing the dam and lock for the Navigation Co., decided to settle in Caledonia and bought up tracts of land on the north side of the river. He started industry in Caledonia with the construction of three water-powered mills. One for flour, one for textiles, and a saw mill. It wasn't until McKinnon pushed for the Hamilton-Port Dover Plank Haldimand House in the 1890s when owned by James Hayes Road to cross the Grand River at Caledonia that South side development became feasible. James Little was an Irish immigrant to the Dominion and settled in the Seneca Village (just east of Caledonia, past the present-day fairgrounds). Little was post-master for Seneca, Caledonia and Oneida, and owned a saw mill and feed mill in the Seneca Village. When he heard of the Hamilton‚ÄìDover plank road crossing in Caledonia, he took a chance and petitioned the government to purchase lots of land on the south side of the river at Caledonia. In 1836 he started construction on his first Caledonia business venture, a stagecoach inn, which he would call Haldimand House after Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of Upper Canada at the time. Shortly after beginning construction on Haldimand House, Little received his Crown patents and was legally given possession of the land he was developing. Haldimand House was built three stories high using squared timbers cut at Little's Seneca saw mill. Just before finishing construction, Little had his Seneca house moved off its foundation and put on a barge to be pulled up-river and added to the back of Haldimand House. On The Stagecoach Route Little finished construction just as the first bridge across the river in Caledonia was completed. He opened shop in 1842. The business boomed early on as one of the main stops on the stagecoach route between Hamilton and Port Dover. The hotel quickly built up a reputation for famous ciders. Little moved his post office into Haldimand House in 1842, but was petitioned by the locals to move it back into Seneca on the North side of the river. The postmaster general ordered he comply with the petition. Later that year Little sold Haldimand House to Bridget Britton. Britton added his name to the stenciled 'Haldimand House' on the facade of the Building. It now read 'Haldimand House B. Brittons'. During Britton's control of the building, a portion was used for the campaign office of William Lyon McKenzie in his campaign for the Haldimand bi-election of 1851. McKenzie won this election and a party was held in Haldimand House to celebrate. Britton sold Haldimand House to the Sutherland family in the late 1860s. They owned it until 1870, when it was sold to James Hayes. The Britton's name was removed and the facade now read 'Haldimand House J'AS Hayes' Hayes continued to operate Haldimand House like it had been run for almost 50 years before as a hotel and bar. He died in 1900, and his daughter, Miss Maggie Hayes, sold the building on August 1, 1900 to Mr. Matthew Richardson and family. A photo from the 1930s showing Walter Richardson in front of his Cone Cottage Refreshment stand. The Richardson Family The Richardson's continued to operate Haldimand house as a hotel and bar until the early 1900s when the hotel license was cancelled. For the decades Canada was at War Haldimand House served as a boarding house for soldiers before they were shipped overseas to Europe. Mrs. Richardson ran a strict household, and was frequently upset by muddy sheets and messes created by her military guests. In the 1920s prohibition struck Ontario, and the bar was closed in Haldimand House. In 1927 Matthew's son Walter took over the management of Haldimand House. He opened a billiard hall in the old bar and constructed the Cone Cottage Refreshment stand, which would later become The Oasis in the 1950s. In the early 1950s, after Walter's death, Haldimand House was split into five apartments: two on the first and second floor and one on the third. In 1959 there was a fire on the top floor apartment caused by Mrs. Caroline Richardson lighting her gas furnace. The fire was prevented from spreading past the second floor. Leslie Richardson had just returned home five hours before the fire from a vacation in Mexico. He went to sleep at 7am, and was woken up at 12 noon by his mother, who told him about the fire. Les was a boy scout leader in Caledonia, and his troop of boy scouts along with several cub scouts showed up to Haldimand House and assisted removing large numbers of books and small objects to prevent smoke and water damage. At this time the dormers were added to the third-floor roof line. Recent years A photo of Caledonia's Oasis Drive-In in 1956. Pictured are Tom Leousis (left) and his father Louis Leousis (right). In 1991, when Leslie Richardson (Walter & Caroline's son) died, Haldimand House was sold to Louis and Chris Leousis whose family had run the Oasis since 1956. In the early 1990s Chris ripped out the first floor apartments and uncovered the original plank flooring and tin ceilings and walls from the days of the old hotel. In 1992 Haldimand House was opened as a gift and antique store. Through the 1990s the Leousis's spent many hours renovating and restoring Haldimand House. In 1995 the Haldimand House Beanery and Cafe was opened in the section of the building which was once James Little's House. In the 2000s a changing demographic and political issues in Caledonia required a change to the business. The Cafe was closed in 2006 and the gift and gift basket business was discontinued. In 1936, the Caledonia Candy Company was started by the Vlachos family in Caledonia. In the 1990s, Louis Leousis and son Chris revived the business and manufactured brittle, brickle, almond bark, and a variety of chocolates and treats. In 2014 Alex Leousis (daughter of Chris and granddaughter of Louis) and long time employee and friend of the family Ian Thompson once again revived the Caledonia Candy Company after several years of hiatus. Today Haldimand House features Haldimand Counties best selection of antique furniture and accessories. Including three full rooms of fine, primitive, and 'restoration necessary' furniture. Haldimand House stands as a reminder of Caledonia's significance along the Grand River Navigation Company canal and the Hamilton-Port Dover Plank Road.

The ATG brought together for the first time into a joint effort members of these ethnic groups: Aleut, Athabaskan, White, Inupiaq, Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Yupik, and most likely others. In later years, all members of some native units scored expert sharpshooter rankings. Among the 27 or more women members were at least one whose riflery skills exceeded the men. The ages of members at enrollment ranged from 80 years old to as young as twelve (both extremes occurring mostly in sparsely populated areas). As volunteers, the Alaska Territorial Guard members were those who were too young or too old to be drafted during WWII. One first-hand estimate states that around 20,000 Alaskans participated, officially or otherwise, in ATG reconnaissance or support activities. The ATG served many vital strategic purposes to the entire Allied effort during World War II: * They safeguarded the only source of the strategic metal platinum in the Western Hemisphere against Japanese attack. * They secured the terrain around the vital Lend-Lease air route between the United States and Russia. * They placed and maintained survival caches primarily along transportation corridors and coastal regions. In addition to official duties, ATG members are noted for actively and successfully promoting racial integration within US military forces, and racial equality within the communities they protected. Several former members of the ATG were instrumental in achieving Alaska Statehood in 1959, as members of the Alaska Statehood Committee and/or delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Convention. In 2000 all ATG members were granted US veteran status by law, acknowledging the contribution of the ATG, some of whose members are still living. But efforts to find the surviving ATG members and assist them through the application process are difficult due to lack of written records, oral cultures, lack of trained staff, passage of time, and unclear bureaucracies and advocates.

Alaska was now without military reserves or any form of Home Guard. In the face of an encroaching enemy, the defense of nearly of US coastline was left to the best efforts of unorganized local citizens and already overworked seasonal laborers. That enemy was demonstrating a definite interest in taking Alaska. In the early months of 1942, a Japanese Navy reconnaissance unit was caught on film making detailed surveys of Alaska coastline. Enemy combatants strode unopposed onto American soil and made inquiries among the populace about the local economy. Enemy aircraft and submarine sightings were common, inspiring great fear among the locals, and culminating in the raid on Dutch Harbor and the occupation of the Aleutian Islands of Attu, Kiska and Adak that June.  Creation of the ATG  By the time of the Dutch Harbor bombing, Major Marvin R Marston had submitted a new plan to defend the entire Alaska coast by enlisting the local citizens. He had conceived this plan while visiting Saint Lawrence Island and contemplating the fate of the locals he'd met. Marston's proposal finally met with favor when word of it got to Alaska territorial governor Ernest Gruening. Gruening had sought to organize a new guard for Alaska, including every able man and boy, since he got word that the US Army would reassign the Alaska National Guard. Motivated by the recent Dutch Harbor attack, the Alaska Command assigned Major Marston and Captain Carl Schreibner within days to serve as military aides to Governor Gruening. Shortly after, Gruening and Marston flew a chartered plane to begin setting up units of the new Alaska Territorial Guard. This included one of the most strategically important sites in all Alaska, a tiny mining town called Platinum‚Äîthe only source of that strategic metal in all the Western Hemisphere. The enrollment drive continued into early 1943, the organizers travelling in all kinds of weather and by every available mode of transport, including airplane, boat, snowmobile, foot, and the most reliable means in the region, dogsled. When a promised plane failed to arrive after a week, Major Marston set out by dogsled on an epic trip around the Seward Peninsula, during the coldest winter in 25 years. He survived by foregoing standard military survival training in favor of the native methods of his Eskimo/Scout and OSS member guide, Sammy Mogg. Thanks to Marston and Mogg's heroic effort, the ATG stood as a first line of defense for the terrain around the Lend-Lease route from America to Russia, against attack by Japan and the Axis Powers. This vital lifeline allowed the US to supply its Russian ally with essential military aircraft. This lifeline had proven to be crucial to Russia's survival during Hitler's Operation Barbarossa.  Organization of the ATG  = Authority = The Alaska Territorial Guard was organized in June 1942 under the authority of the office of the territorial governor, Ernest Gruening, who served as Commander-In- Chief. All members took an oath to obey the Governor's orders. The governor was directly supported by the ATG Adjutant General, J. P. Williams. Headquarters was in the territorial capital, Juneau. = Mission = The mission of the ATG was to play a defensive role for the entire coast of Alaska. Offensive action was the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, with North Pacific forces operating from large bases at Dutch Harbor, Cold Bay and Anchorage. Explicit within the ATG mission was that of protecting the terrain around the American terminus of the Lend-Lease air route to Russia on which warplanes were flown from Great Falls, Montana to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, then to Ladd Field, Alaska (now Fort Wainwright) and on to Nome. Here, Russian pilots flew the planes on to their intended use, combat against Hitler's Third Reich. = By Date = The Alaska Territorial Guard operated from its inception in June 1942 until it was officially disbanded on 31 March 1947. = By Geographic Area = The Territory of Alaska was divided vertically by the 156th Parallel into Eastern and Western Areas. To the Eastern Area was added Southwest Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, which had been evacuated of non-combatants. The Western Area had a Field Headquarters in Nome, with the offices of the Commander, Quartermaster, Instructors, Public Relations Officer and Chaplains. Other field staff were located in Anchorage, Koyuk, Selawik and Gambell (on Saint Lawrence Island, where Major Marston first conceived his plan). The Eastern Area was headquartered in Juneau and held the offices of Property Officer (a role filled by the Adjutant General) and Instructors. Field staff were assigned to Glacier Highway, Douglas, Ketchikan, Palmer, Hoonah and Sitka. = By Ethnic Group = The Alaska Territorial Guard was drawn from 107 communities and from these ethnic groups: Aleut, Athabascan, White, Inupiaq, Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Yup'ik, and probably more. = By Rank = The ATG, being organized by US Army officers, made use of the same US Army rank structure, with these exceptions: * Throughout the duration of the ATG, no member rose above the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, including the Adjutant \\"General\\". * The designation \\"Private\\" appears to have been little used, though most members were in fact of Private rank. = By Workload and Pay = The 21 staff officers were all full-time, paid positions (except for the governor, whose ATG duties were in addition to his regular office and without added salary). All other positions were strictly part-time volunteer, without pay. = By Sex = That total includes at least 27 ATG members who were women. Most women served as nurses at the field hospital in Kotzebue, although at least one woman served the ATG's primary mission alongside the men. Laura Beltz Wright of Haycock is also noted for being the best sharpshooter in her company, scoring 98% bulls-eyes. = By Age = The age of ATG members at enrollment ranged from 80 years old to as young as twelve, even though official regulations put the minimum age at sixteen. = By Number = All told, there were 6,389 members of the Alaska Territorial Guard, according to an official roster. = Unofficial tally = Alongside those who served in the ATG, many others worked to support them, including food service, providing equipment and supplies to the Quartermaster, repair work, etc. Major Marston put the estimate at 20,000 Alaskans who materially participated in ATG activities, in his Western Area alone.  ATG Activities  All ATG members except the 21 staff officers served without pay, and had to perform their new ATG duties in addition to the often difficult challenges of subsisting in Arctic and extreme marine environments. The ATG trained for and/or actively carried out the following: * Issuing of weapons and ammunition * Instruction, drill and target practice * Transport of equipment and supplies * Construction of ATG buildings and facilities * Construction of airstrips and support facilities for other military agencies as needed * Coastal and inland scouting patrols * Breaking hundreds of miles of wilderness trails * Setup and repair of dozens of emergency shelter cabins * Distribution of emergency food and ammunition containers for the US Navy * Firefighting * Land and sea rescue * Enemy combat The ATG received commendations for: * Shooting down Japanese air balloons carrying bombs and eavesdropping radios * Rescue of a downed airman In addition, some ATG members performed the following: * Medical care at the field hospital in Kotzebue  ATG Artists  During the 1930s, as part of FDR's New Deal programs to ease the country out of Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) hired many noted American artists. On the US entry into World War II, several WPA artists took work with the War Department. A few of these artists made their way to Alaska to help document the Aleutian Campaign and other Alaskan military operations, including the new Alaska Territorial Guard. Some of their work was featured nationwide on a number of wartime posters. The artists included: * Magnus Colcord \\"Rusty\\" Heurlin - An ATG lieutenant, his painting was reproduced as the posters \\"Back the Attack\\" and \\"From Metlakatla to Barrow - The Territorial Guard\\". * Joe Jones * Henry Varnum Poor - His \\"Major Muktuk Marston Signs Up Soldiers\\" now hangs in the Pentagon's Hall of Fame. Other artists, born in Alaska and already well-known, gained further exposure through contact with ATG members and artists: * Florence Nupok Melewotkuk \\\\- a Siberian Yupik from Saint Lawrence Island. Her work was promoted in the 1920s by Otto Geist, later an ATG major. * George Aden Ahgupuk (also known by the indigenous name Twok) - a Shishmaref artist since boyhood and later the village's postmaster, he was befriended by Major Marston, who wrote and spoke of his artistry within and outside the ATG.  ATG influences  Plaque honoring the ATG and the Alaska National Guard at the Alaska Veterans Memorial. Several former members of the ATG were instrumental in achieving Alaska Statehood. In 1958 three of the eleven members of the Alaska Statehood Committee were former ATG members. Seven delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Committee had served with the ATG. Both are listed below under Noted ATG Members. The ATG actively and successfully promoted racial integration in the US Army by proving the worth of native Americans as soldiers within US military forces much as the Navajo, Comanche and Choctaw Code talkers did elsewhere during World War II. ATG members were also active in promoting racial equality in their communities, insisting on equal treatment for natives and whites alike at movie theaters, restaurants and other public facilities.  Recent developments  Discharge ceremony, 2008 In 2000 Alaska's senior US Senator, Ted Stevens, sponsored a bill ordering the Secretary of Defense to issue Honorable Discharges to all Americans who served in the Alaska Territorial Guard (ATG). Stevens was himself a World War II veteran, flying with the Army Air Corps in China. The bill was signed into law by President Bush that August. Because of disagreement as to whose responsibility it was to seek the ATG veterans out to inform them of the new law, and because of the advanced age and geographic isolation of many of the veterans, a temporary position, filled by retired colonel Robert A \\"Bob\\" Goodman, was created in the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs in 2003, to find and assist as many former ATG members as possible. After the position ended that October, Bob continued the work, on his own and funded out of his own pocket. In support of this effort, he founded the Alaska Territorial Guard Organization (ATGO), a 501(c)(3) non- profit, in April 2006. He continues the work with the help of a small paid and volunteer ATGO staff. To date, they have found and helped obtain an honorable discharge for about 150 ATG members. They estimate there are several hundred more yet to be found. Bob Goodman and the ATGO have pleaded the case of the ATG members and spouses with US senators two Alaskan governors, most of the state legislature, the Anchorage Assembly, as well as numerous Alaska Native Regional Corporations and other corporations and foundations.

One of the few was a building known then as the Bryant Tavern, located on the corner of present-day Argyle Street North and Caithness Street East, where the Cornerstone Restaurant is now located. In the 1850s the Bryant Tavern became known as the Roper block as a druggist with the name Roper owned the building. During this time the building held a variety store, the Roper drug store, and several other small shops on the main level. The second floor was a large opera hall used and rented for the showing of theatre performances, in addition to chataqua shows and political rallies of the day. The top storey of the red-brick building was used as the lodge hall for the Caledonia Masonic Lodge.  End of an era  In 1947 a fire started in the opera hall, which gutted the entire building and the stores located next to it, including the Caledonia Restaurant, owned by the Vlachos family (whose daughter would later become co-owner of Caledonia's Oasis Drive-In). It was the end of an era, as Caledonia has not seen a permanent theatre facility since.  Other theatre companies  Caledonia has had several other theatre companies in more recent times. Theatre Amicitia was operated in the St. Andrews Masonic Lodge Hall until the mid-2000s. Another company called Grand Mill Theatre operated as a committee of the Caledonia Old Mill Corporation until 2008. In the 1900s Caledonia was also home to the Regency or Regent Theatre which showed motion picture films in a small building located on Caithness Street East, about where the Regency Apartments are now located. This Theatre closed in the late 1970s.

They will be used to relay secure communications for the Armed Forces of the United States, the British Armed Forces, the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Netherlands Armed Forces and the Australian Defence Force. The system will consist of six satellites in geostationary orbits. The final satellite was launched on 26 March 2020. AEHF is backward compatible with, and will replace, the older Milstar system and will operate at 44 GHz Uplink (EHF band) and 20 GHz Downlink (SHF band). The AEHF system is a joint service communications system that will provide survivable, global, secure, protected, and jam-resistant communications for high-priority military ground, sea and air assets. Overview AEHF satellites use many narrow spot beams directed towards the Earth to relay communications to and from users. Crosslinks between the satellites allow them to relay communications directly rather than via a ground station. The satellites are designed to provide jam-resistant communications with a low probability of interception. They incorporate frequency-hopping radio technology, as well as phased array antennas that can adapt their radiation patterns in order to block out potential sources of jamming. AEHF incorporates the existing Milstar low data-rate and medium data- rate signals, providing 75‚Äì2400 bit/s and 4.8 kbit/s‚Äì1.544 Mbit/s respectively. It also incorporates a new signal, allowing data rates of up to 8.192 Mbit/s. When complete, the space segment of the AEHF system will consist of six satellites, which will provide coverage of the surface of the Earth between latitudes of 65¬∞ north and 65¬∞ south. For northern polar regions, the Enhanced Polar System acts as an adjunct to AEHF to provide EHF coverage.http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/EnhancedPolarSystem/Pages/default.aspx The initial contract for the design and development of the AEHF satellites was awarded to Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Northrop Grumman Space Technology in November 2001, and covered the System Development and Demonstration phase of the program. The contract covered the construction and launch of three satellites, and the construction of a mission control segment. The contract was managed by the MILSATCOM Program Office of the United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center. Like the Milstar system, AEHF will be operated by the 4th Space Operations Squadron, located at Schriever Air Force Base. It extends the \\"cross-links\\" among AEHF of earlier MILSTAR satellites, which makes it much less vulnerable to attacks on ground stations. As a geosynchronous satellite over the Equator, it still needs to be supplemented, with additional systems optimized for polar coverage in high latitudes. In the April 2009 Defense Department budget request, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he planned to cancel the Transformational Satellite Communications System, still in the design phase, in favor of additional AEHF capacity. Individual AEHF satellites, exclusive of launch expenses, cost US$850 million. Bands Prior to the AEHF, U.S. and allied military satellite communications systems fell into one of three categories: * Wideband: maximum bandwidth among fixed and semifixed earth stations * Protected: survivable against electronic warfare and other attacks, even if bandwidth is sacrificed * Narrowband: principally for tactical use, sacrificing bandwidth for simplicity, reliability, and light weight of terrestrial equipment. AEHF, however, converges the role of its wideband Defense Satellite Communications System and protected MILSTAR predecessors, while increasing bandwidth over both. There will still need to be specialized satellite communications for extremely high data rate space sensors, such as geospatial and signals intelligence satellites, but their downlinked data will typically go to a specialized receiver and be processed into smaller amounts; the processed data will flow through AEHF. Launch and positioning AEHF satellites are sent into space using an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). The payload weight at launch is approximately ; by the time it expends propellants to achieve proper orbit, its weight is approximately . The satellites will operate in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) orbit; it takes over 100 days for the orbital adjustments to reach its stable geo-position after launch. Electronics Uplinks and crosslinks are in the extremely high frequency (EHF) while the downlinks use the super high frequency (SHF). The variety of frequencies used, as well as the desire to have tightly focused downlinks for security, require a range of antennas, seen in the picture: * 2 SHF downlink phased arrays * 2 satellite-to-satellite crosslinks * 2 uplink/downlink nulling antennas * 1 uplink EHF phased array * 6 uplink/downlink gimbaled dish antenna * 1 uplink/downlink earth coverage horns Phased array technology is new in communications satellites, but increases reliability by removing the mechanical movement required for gimbaled, motor-driven antennas. The low gain earth coverage antennas send information anywhere in a third of the Earth covered by each satellite's footprint. Phased array antennas provide super high-gain earth coverages, enabling worldwide unscheduled access for all users, including small portable terminals and submarines. The six medium resolution coverage antennas (MRCA), are highly directional \\"spot\\" coverage; they can be time-shared to cover up to 24 targets. The two high-resolution coverage area antennas enable operations in the presence of in-beam jamming; the nulling antennas are part of the electronic defense that helps discriminate true signals from electronic attack. Another change from existing satellites is using solid-state transmitters rather than the traveling wave tubes used in most high-power military SHF/EHF applications. TWTs have a fixed power output; the newer devices allow varying the transmitted power, both for lowering the probability of intercept and for overall power efficiency. The payload flight software contains approximately 500,000 lines of real-time, distributed, embedded code executing simultaneously on 25 on-board processors. Services AEHF provides individual digital data streams from rates of 75 bits/second to 8 Mebibits/s. These include and go beyond MILSTAR's low data rate (LDR) and medium data rate (MDR) as well as the actually fairly slow high data rate (HDR) for submarines. The faster links are designated extended data rates (XDR). While there are a number of ground terminals, the airborne terminal has been part of the Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight-Terminal (FAB-T) project. Other ground stations include the Single-Channel Antijam Man- Portable Terminal (SCAMP), Secure Mobile Anti-jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T), and Submarine High Data Rate (Sub HDR) system. With Boeing as the prime contractor and L-3 Communications and Rockwell as major subcontractors, the first FAB-T (Increment 1) was delivered, for use on the B-2 Spirit aircraft, in February 2009. It is planned for other aircraft including the B-52, RC-135, E-4, and E-6 aircraft. Other installations will go into fixed and transportable command posts. It successfully interoperated with legacy communications using a command post terminal and the Army Single Channel Anti- jam ManPortable Terminal,  Satellites  = AEHF-1 (USA-214) = The first satellite, USA-214, was successfully launched by an Atlas V 531 rocket on 14 August 2010, from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This occurred four years behind schedule; when the contract was awarded in 2000 the first launch was expected to have taken place in 2006. The program was restructured in October 2004, when the National Security Agency did not deliver key cryptographic equipment to the payload contractor in time to meet the launch schedule. Successful launch The Atlas V launch vehicle successfully placed the satellite into a supersynchronous-apogee transfer orbit with a perigee of 275 km, an apogee of 50,000 km, an inclination of 22.1¬∞.Justin Ray, SPACEFLIGHT NOW, \\"Air Force satellite's epic ascent should finish soon\\". October 9, 2011 (accessed December 14 2011) Failure of the kick motor, and recovery using the Hall-effect thrusters The satellite vehicle's Liquid Apogee Engine (LAE) provided by IHI failed to raise the orbit after two attempts. To solve the problem, the perigee altitude was raised to 4700 km with twelve firings of the smaller Aerojet Rocketdyne-provided Reaction Engine Assembly thrusters, originally intended for attitude control during the LAE engine burns. From this altitude, the solar arrays were deployed and the orbit was raised toward the operational orbit over the course of nine months using the 0.27 Newton Hall thrusters, also provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne, a form of electric propulsion which is highly efficient, but low thrust. This took much longer than initially intended due to the lower starting altitude for the HCT maneuvers. This led to program delays, as the second and third satellite vehicle LAEs were analyzed. The investigation into the propulsion anomalyJustin Ray, SPACEFLIGHT NOW, \\"Investigators probing what went wrong with AEHF 1\\", Sept. 2, 2010 (accessed December 14, 2011) has been completed (but not publicly released ) and the remaining satellites were declared flight-ready. A Government Accounting Office report released in July 2011 stated that the blocked fuel line in the Liquid Apogee Engine was most likely caused by a piece of cloth inadvertently left in the line during the manufacturing process. While this is believed to have been the primary cause of the failure, a Department of Defense Selected Acquisition Report adds that fuel loading procedures and unmet thermal control requirements could also have contributed. = AEHF-2 (USA-235) = Like the first AEHF satellite, the second (AEHF-2) was launched on an Atlas V flying in the 531 configuration.

Burlington Island is officially part of the city of Burlington, in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. It is an uninhabited scenic landmark in the Delaware River. Burlington Island Lake is a large artificial lagoon within the island. Fort Wilhelmus The indigenous Lenape population called the island Matennecunk. In 1624, Cornelius Mey, the first Director of New Netherland planted an initial settlement of two families and eight men on what they called Hooghe Eylandt (High Island), making it the site of the first European settlement in what would become New Jersey. The factorij, or trading-post, called Fort Wilhelmus was completed under the direction of the 2nd director, Willem Verhulst, who lent his name to the island. Originally the Dutch West India Company intended to create a headquarters for the new province of New Netherland at what they called the Zuydt Rivier, or South River. In 1626, Peter Minuit decided to shift the base of operations to Manhattan Island, and move the trading post further south to what became Fort Nassau, one of many to be built along the river within the European colonies of New Netherland and New Sweden. Though relations between the Lenni Lenape and the colonists were generally peaceful, Burlington Island witnessed one of the few murders of that era.

It replaced Fort Conti which had been built on the site in 1679 and had burned later that year. The fort was located at the mouth of the Niagara River on Lake Ontario. In the summer of 1687 the Governor of New France, Jacques-Ren√© de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville, was on a military expedition to pacify the Iroquois. Nearing the end of the campaign season the governor, wishing to keep French presence in the area, moved his army to the site and constructed a post and named it after himself. The fort, which comprised eight wooden buildings and a stockade, was garrisoned by one hundred men and commanded by Captain Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes. The governor and the rest of the force returned to Montreal for the winter. The Seneca, in reprisal for Denonville's attack of 1687, laid siege to the fort and denied the garrison the benefits of forage or fresh air. Eighty-nine of the garrison died of scurvy, disease, and starvation during the siege.Claiborne A. Skinner, The Upper Country (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 71. On Good Friday of 1688 a relief force returned and found twelve survivors.

Joachim Murat, King of Naples was repulsed by an Austrian force under the command of Johann Frimont whilst trying to cross the bridge over the Po River at Occhiobello. Following the battle, the Austrians would not lose an engagement for the remainder of the war.  Background  By March 1815, it became increasingly likely that Joachim Murat would lose the crown of Naples, which had been given to him by his brother-in-law, Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1808. After hearing news that Napoleon had escaped from exile in Elba and landed in France, Murat decided to take matters into his own hands and declared war on Austria, the greatest threat to his position as King of Naples. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, areas such as Lombardy and Venetia became part of the Austrian Empire and were directly ruled from Vienna. On 30 March, hoping to start a popular uprising against the Austrians, Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation calling all Italian nationalists to war. Although there were many Italians sympathetic to his cause, fearful of the increasing Austrian influence in Italy and longing for independence, most Italians saw Murat as someone trying to save his own crown rather than a figurehead for unification. The Austrians also quickly crushed any unrest and there would be no general insurrection so long as Austrian troops were stationed in Italy. Despite this, by early April, Murat has reached the Austrian border on the Po River. Across the border in Lombardy, there were reportedly around 40,000 Italian partisans, mostly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, waiting to join Murat's army as soon he arrived in Milan. However, the Austrians had also been assembling troops in northern Italy. Originally intended for an invasion of southern France following Napoleon's return from exile, the Austrians troops now moved south to counter the threat Murat now posed. Realising the danger of an Italian insurrection should Murat arrive in Milan, Johann Frimont moved his headquarters to Piacenza to block Murat's direct route to Milan. By now, the Austrian numbers on the frontier and available for war swelled to nearly 50,000, vastly outnumbering the Neapolitans. With his original route now blocked, Murat was forced eastwards to Ferrara. On the 8 April, Murat made an attempt to cross the Po into Austria with the bulk of his army at the town of Occhiobello, just a few miles northwest of Ferrara.  Battle  Murat chose Occhiobello as a crossing point because the bridge was only lightly defended by a small force of Austrians under the command of Johann Freiherr von Mohr. However, the majority of the Neapolitan artillery had been diverted to the Siege of Ferrara along with a significant portion of Murat's army, where the Austrian garrison was frustrating the Neapolitans. Nevertheless, Murat was still able to move on Occhiobello with around 25,000 infantry and cavalry. Meanwhile, although the Austrians had spread their forces along their border, they had concentrated their guns at favourable positions around the bridges over the Po. When on 8 April, Murat finally launched his first attempt to cross the bridge at Occhiobello, a dogged defensive action by Mohr's outnumbered infantry combined with a devastating artillery barrage, threw the Neapolitan attack back in disarray. After successive charges, including one by an entire dragoon regiment, were repulsed by the Austrians, the Neapolitan morale slowly disintegrated and the assault petered out. The following day, Murat again attempted to force a crossing but by now Frimont had reinforced Mohr's force to around 10,000 men. On the other hand, the Neapolitan force had dwindled due to large numbers of the less enthusiastic officers and men deserting Murat's cause altogether. By the end of the second day, Murat was compelled to fall back from Occhiobello and establish a new defensive position in preparation of the inevitable Austrian counterattack. To make matters worse, news had reached Italy that the United Kingdom had declared war on Murat and were sending a fleet of gunboats to the Adriatic Sea. Aftermath The Neapolitans had sustained over 2,000 casualties during the two days of fighting with thousands more deserting. The Austrians had sustained only 400 casualties and had established a bridgehead around Occhiobello from where they would able to launch attacks against Carpi and Casaglia. With the morale of Neapolitan army broken and the partisans in Lombardy unable to join his cause, Murat would eventually be forced to retire back to his original headquarters in Ancona by late April.

Live Adventures has since been re-released on CD but without any additional material beyond its initial release; the concerts took place over three nights, and according to Kooper,in the sleeve notes for two sets a night; this should have yielded several hours of recordings, of which the album provides just short of ninety minutes.

Their homeland is the diamond-rich Kono District in eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are primarily diamond miners and farmers. The Kono people speak the Kono language as their first language and is the most widely spoken language among the Kono people. Many youth from the Kono ethnic group use the Krio language as the primary language of communication with other Sierra Leonean ethnic groups. Unlike many other Sierra Leonean ethnic groups, the Kono people rarely travel outside Eastern Sierra Leone; as a result only few Konos are found in the capital Freetown and in northern Sierra Leone. History The Kono people are the descendants of Mali-Guinean migrants who are said to have moved to Sierra Leone and settled in what is now Kono District in the mid-16th century, however there is archaeological evidence of settlement in Kono District as far back as 2200 B.C.Coon C S (1968) Excavations at Yengema Cave, Expedition Magazine, vol 11 issue 1 September 1968, http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/excavations- at-yengema-cave accessed 15/10/2014 Kono history claims that the Kono were once a powerful people in Mali and Guinea. The Kono migrated to Sierra Leone as peaceful hunters. The tribe was split during partitioning of Africa by European colonists and part of the tribe still exists in neighbouring Guinea. Attacks from the related Mende people forced the Kono to seek refuge in the Koranko territory to the north, where they were allowed to farm the land. The Mende eventually moved further south, and the Kono returned to their own land in the east. Economy and culture The Kono are primarily farmers and in some areas, alluvial diamond miners. They grow rice, cassava, corn, beans, groundnuts, sweet potato, peppers, cassava leaf, greens, potato leaf etc. as their main crops, along with banana, pineapple and plantain, and cash crops such as cocoa, coffee and kola nut. They live in towns and villages and travel daily to their surrounding farm lands to work. They are a polite and hospitable people and even allow strangers to lodge with them or their chiefs. The size of rural Kono villages varies from several houses to nearly one hundred dwellings. Kono District also contains the city of Koidu / Sefadu and several small towns. Kono houses were at one time round constructions made of mud, clay, and thatch. Although some of these houses still exist today, most are now rectangular and made of adobe blocks or cement with corrugated zinc sheet roofing. The rectangular houses have verandas where the women cook and others can enjoy the shade. After sunset, in the open compounds (courtyards) of the villages, the entire village may sing. The people dance in a single- file circle to the beat of drums. Each person develops his own individual steps and movements in an attempt to stand out in the crowd. The Kono year is divided into a rainy season and a dry season. Late dry season (March‚ÄìApril) is the time for preparation and clearing of farms and the rainy season is a time for farming. Families leave their homes early in the morning, walk to their farms, and return home at dusk. Cooking, bathing, and other household chores are done at the farms by most of the women, while the men and other women perform the agricultural tasks. After the rice harvest, the heavy agricultural work is finished, giving way to the dry season. Most people remain in town every day during the dry season since many social events take place at that time of year. During this period, young boys are initiated into the Poro society, and young girls, into the Bondo or Sande society. These societies teach youth the Kono culture and traditions. Training for these organisations bridges the gap between childhood and adult life. The dry season is also a time when much courting and many marriages take place. A man's wealth used to be determined by the number of wives he could support. Most men had more than one wife, and those men with many wives were shown the greatest respect and honour. Nowadays many men have only one wife although polygamy is still widely practised. During the dry season, women organise fishing expeditions and older men and women may be found outdoors weaving traditional country cloth. Religious and spiritual beliefs Most Konos practice Islam or Christianity. Some practice traditional religion as well. Konos invoke and pray to their ancestors and other spirits for protection, health, guidance and good fortune. They believe the ancestors are present during every activity, including eating, sleeping, and important events. Some Kono are also superstitious and use curses, omens, charms, and magic in their daily lives.

Career Sir William was the son of Richard Laken of Willey in Shropshire. His father served as counsel and military lieutenant to the Earl of Arundel. As a lieutenant to Arundel, Laken was noted for his valour in the defence of England against Welsh military incursions. William became a lawyer and was called upon by many of England's most powerful landed families to settle the delicate legal disputes that often set the aristocratic houses of the kingdom against one another. Towards the end of his august legal career, King Henry VI appointed Laken Justice of the King's Bench. An effigial memorial brass to Sir William Laken can be found at Bray Church in Berkshire, where he was laid to rest alongside his wife Sybilla, daughter and heiress of John Syfrewast, Lord of the Manor of Clewer. Bray was this lady's home. Sir William was the third of her five husbands. His chief residence was at Stone in Kent. Legacy While he was survived by two sons, neither reached William's prominence.

He was born in the Sorkhab district of Tabriz, Iran. Both his father, Abu- TƒÅlib NajjƒÅr Tabrizi, and grandfather, Ali-Morad NajjƒÅr Tabrizi, were carpenters (whence the name NajjƒÅr). No information concerning the maternal side of his family is available. In 1851, Talibi emigrated to Tbilisi (Tiflis), the administrative capital of the Russian Caucasus, and began a new life there (see Treaty of Gulistan and Treaty of Turkmenchay). According to one Iranian source, Talibi attended school in Tbilisi and studied modern sciences, however there is no independent evidence in support of this report. It has been suggested that Talibi may in fact never have received a formal education in Russia. In a letter written to an Iranian friend, he indicated that he produced his major works through relying on personal reading and self- discipline. In Tbilisi, Talibi worked for an Iranian businessman, named Mohammad-Ali Khan, who had emigrated to Transcaucasia from the city of Kashan. Mohammad-Ali Khan was a contractor who had accumulated much of his wealth from obtaining concessions for construction of roads and bridges in Transcaucasia. After years of working for the wealthy compatriot, Talibi must have saved a sufficient amount of capital to start his own construction business. He also moved from Tbilisi to Temir-Khan-Shura (Buinaksk, since 1922), the provincial capital of Dagestan, where he bought a comfortable house, built a small private library and married a woman from Derbent. Talibi wrote all of his works after the age of fifty-five. He had by then attained a degree of financial security that enabled him to devote the next twenty-one years of his life to writing and translating from Russian into Persian. With the exception of his last two books, he published all of his works at his own expense. Of his last two books, the first, ƒ™zƒÅhƒÅt dar Khosus-e AzƒÅdi (Explanations Concerning Freedom), was published in Tehran after the victory of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1906, and the second, SiyƒÅsat-e TƒÅlibi (TƒÅlibian Politics), was published posthumously in Tehran a few months after his death in 1911. During his lifetime, two of Talibi's works, namely KetƒÅb-e Ahmad yƒÅ Safineh-ye TƒÅlebi (Ahmad's Book or the Talibian Vessel) and MasƒÅlek'ol- Moh'senin (The Ways of the Charitable), achieved great eminence. KetƒÅb-e Ahmad, which consists of two volumes, was inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's tract on education Emile. The book is based on conversations between the author and his fictional seven-year-old son, Ahmad, whose searching and inquisitive mind compels his father to expand on a wide range of scientific, historical, political and religious topics. Their dialogue on these issues reveal Talibi's social reformism. The Ways of the Charitable involves four characters: Mustafa and Hossein who are engineers, a physician named Ahmed, and Muhammad who is a chemistry teacher. They are appointed by a fictional geographic administration of Iran to travel to Damavand mountain for scientific studies and measurement. They encounter a number of spaces and characters on their way‚Äîfrom a mujtahid to a dervish to shoemaker‚Äîand these encounters attempt to demonstrate Iran‚Äôs problems. These problems are political, social, and scientific. Kings live in luxury while the country‚Äôs infrastructure is crumbling; European cities enjoy wealth and application of sciences while Iranian cities lack them; other nations unite with a spirit of reform and talk at lengths to make their nation a better place while Iranians are silent about their problems, alienated from one another, and set in archaic, ancestral ways; the Qajar ministries are mere imitations without any institutional foundation and government officials are not appointed based on merit; education too is in a poor condition and no books are written for the advancement of sound pedagogy.

This song is sung by the nuns at Nonnberg Abbey, who are exasperated with Maria for being too frivolous and frolicsome for the decorous and austere life at the Abbey. This song gave its title to Andrew Lloyd Webber's 2006 reality TV series How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?, in which TV viewers voted for a contestant to play the lead role of Maria von Trapp in his London revival of The Sound of Music. Connie Fisher won the TV series and was cast as Maria in the London revival of the show that opened in November 2006 at the London Palladium. When Oscar Hammerstein II wrote the lyric for this song, he followed the lead from a line in the dialogue that Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse wrote in their script, describing Maria's flighty ways in the Abbey. In particular, he was taken by the detail of her wearing curlers in her hair under her wimple. Hammerstein asked if he could incorporate their dialogue into the song, and they allowed him to do so because \\"if you tell a story in a song, it's so much better.\\" When writing the lyric, Hammerstein knew he needed adjectives for the nuns to describe Maria. He admitted that his vocabulary was never big, but the simple adjectives he used to describe Maria's character proved a success.

Joseph Blumenfeld of the U.S. District Court in Hartford and for Chief Judge David L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She then practiced in Houston with the firm of Vinson & Elkins. At Boalt Swift joined the Boalt faculty in 1979. She served as associate dean at Boalt from 1998 to 2000. She is also chair of the Committee on Professional Development of the Association of American Law Schools and is a past chair of the Evidence Section. From 1992 to 1997, she chaired a special faculty-student committee appointed by Dean Herma Hill Kay to develop a proposal for improving and expanding the clinical curriculum at Boalt. In 1998 she received Boalt's Rutter Award for Teaching Distinction and in 2000 she received UC Berkeley's Distinguished Teaching Award. The focus of her teaching and research is on the adversary system: the legal rules, practices, and procedures that govern civil and criminal trials. She teaches courses in Civil Procedure, Evidence, and the Legal Profession. Swift incorporates three perspectives in her classes: theoretical, professional, and ethical. \\"My aim,\\" she says, \\"is to introduce students to the practice of law under a system of rules, to develop their ability to critique those rules, and to enable them to experience the ethical dilemmas of lawyers acting in role.\\" Students consistently point to the effect her teaching has had on their lives. A former student says, \\"It would be easy for me to say that I went to the Eleanor Swift School of Law. . . .The lasting imprint of her message makes me use my legal education to make the world a slightly better place. I could never thank her enough for her instruction.\\" Student course evaluations point to the demanding nature of the course: \\"Evidence is a conceptually difficult course, but her teaching brought out clear thinking,\\" says one student. Says another, \\"I think this topic is pretty complex and difficult, which makes the instructor and class materials all the more impressive.\\" One of Professor Swift's most lasting contributions to the Law School's teaching mission is her leadership in the establishment of Boalt's Center for Clinical Education,\\" which brings clients in need of legal advice to Boalt, where students, directed by a faculty member, provide counsel. Swift v. Boalt Swift was originally denied tenure at Boalt Hall in 1987. She initiated a suit against the University alleging sex discrimination in her tenure review process. The suit was settled with an agreement to leave the tenure decision to an outside independent review committee of distinguished academics. This committee unanimously recommended that she be promoted to tenure, which finally happened in the fall of 1989. She wrote about this experience in Becoming a Plaintiff, 4 Berkeley Women's L.J. 245 (1990). Statement of Teaching Philosophy \\"The courses that I teach at the School of Law‚ÄîCivil Procedure, Evidence, and Legal Profession‚Äîall focus on the adversary system. My goal is, of course, to develop students' knowledge of the legal rules, practices and procedures that govern civil and criminal trials. Equally important, however, is that students understand how these rules establish roles for the participants in the adversary system ‚Äî the lawyers, their clients, the judge and the jury. I develop opportunities for students to learn how lawyers function in resolving individual and societal disputes, and to critique this function from theoretical, professional, and ethical perspectives. \\"Taking a theoretical perspective on the rules of the adversary system requires examination of the core values‚Äîtruth (or rectitude of decision), fairness, efficiency and finality‚Äîthat underlie our procedural justice system. The rules are carefully examined and debated with regard to their efficacy in promoting these values. Since these core values are often in tension, alternatives are explored and compromises are evaluated. \\"A professional perspective on legal rules integrates both theory and practice. Students are introduced to acting in the lawyers' and judge's roles through specific role-playing techniques that I have incorporated into all of my classes. These techniques permit discussion of ethical dilemmas in the lawyer's role to arise naturally in class. \\"The ethical perspective emphasizes the importance of the lawyer's responsibility to the client within the adversary system. Law students tend to think of lawyers as \\"in charge\\" and it is important to expose them to the constraints on their autonomy created by a representational relationship. My aim is to introduce students to various other role dilemmas, to the incomplete answers provided by our codes of professional ethics, and hence to their own responsibility to develop their individual moral commitments both in and out of role. Finally, I also address the ethical obligation of the legal profession to provide access to our system of justice. \\"The practice of law is challenging precisely because it is constantly working out the tension in the core values of the justice system. Legal education must train students to think competently and critically not only about the content of the law and legal rules, but also about the lawyer's role as a professional, with obligations to others, including the legal system in general, beyond self- interest. In law teaching, it is easy to focus almost exclusively on content, but to do so would be to fail in our own professional responsibility.\\" Publications Swift's recent and forthcoming publications include \\"One Hundred Years of Evidence Law Reform: Thayer's Triumph\\" in the California Law Review (2000); \\"Rival Claims to 'Truth'\\" in Hastings Law Journal (1998); and Evidence: Text, Problems and Cases, 2nd ed.

She saw service in both the First and Second World Wars, before being torpedoed and sunk in February 1944. Construction HMS Warwick was built during the First World War as part of the Royal Navy's (RN) War Emergency Programme. She was part of the Admiralty W class of 21 ships, representing the last word in destroyer design at the time. Warwick was built by Hawthorn Leslie & Company, Hebburn, being laid down 10 March 1917. She launched on 28 December 1917, and completed 18 March 1918.Preston 1971, p.105. Service history =First World War= In dock after striking a mine following the second attempt to block the ship canal channel during the second raid on Ostend, 10 May 1918 Warwick commissioned in March 1918 and saw action in the last months of World War I. She took part in the raid on Zeebrugge in April, the attempt by the RN to blockade Germany's U-boat force stationed in Flanders. She also participated in the second raid on Ostend on 10 May and was heavily damaged by a mine, breaking her back, and had to be towed back to Dover by .Preston 1971, p. 24. Warwick was present at Scapa Flow in November 1918 when the Grand Fleet received the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet at the end of the war. =Inter-war years= Following the end of World War I Warwick was stationed in the Mediterranean Sea, serving there during the 1920s, before joining the RN Reserve in the 1930s. With the onset of war in 1939 Warwick was re- activated, re-commissioning in August, and joining the fleet at Plymouth in September. =Second World War= During World War II Warwick served as a convoy escort, being too out-dated for modern destroyer work. In September 1939 was allocated to the 11th Destroyer Flotilla. In February 1940 she was deployed to the Western Approaches Escort Force for Atlantic convoy defence. In this role she was engaged in all the duties performed by escort ships; protecting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors. In November 1940, with the formation of distinct escort groups, she joined 7 EG. In December she was mined and spent the next four months in dock for repairs. In March 1941 she rejoined Western Approaches Command and saw out the year in the Atlantic. In January 1942, following the US entry into the war and the opening of the U-boat offensive off the US east coast (Operation Drumbeat), Warwick transferred there, on loan to the United States Navy (USN). In June 1942 she was transferred to the West Indies serving with USN and Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) ships of the Caribbean Escort Force on anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort duty. In December Warwick returned to Britain for conversion as a long range escort. This entailed, among other modifications, removal of one of her boilers to allow extra fuel capacity, thus sacrificing speed for endurance and range. She remained in dock at Dundee for the first half of 1943 while this was carried out. In July she was on anti-submarine duties in the Bay of Biscay, supporting Operation Musketry, the Royal Air Force Coastal Command's Bay offensive. In November she took part in Operation Alacrity, the establishment and supply of Allied air bases in the Azores which served to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. In January 1944, having returned to Britain, Warwick was assigned to lead an escort group operating in the South-West Approaches, guarding against attacks by German S-boats and submarines. It was while engaged in this she was struck by an acoustic torpedo and sunk on 20 February 1944 by the submarine .Allen (2006)Roskill 1960, p. 293. Fate On 20 February 1944, while patrolling off Trevose Head, and under command of Cdr. Denys Rayner, Warwick was torpedoed by . She sank in minutes, with the loss of over half her crew.

He is considered to be the first Leader Hungarian parliamentary opposition. Biography Kis was born in Budapest, Hungary. His father was killed in the Holocaust. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in 1967. Kis was inspired by the ideas of Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, and became marxist in the 1960s. He joined the Hungarian Communist Party (MSZMP) too. In 1973 he was dismissed as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences after co-authoring a book criticizing Marxist socialism from leftist point of view. He was excluded from the MSZMP as well. On radical leftist and human- rights-liberal basis, he strongly opposed the communist regime in Hungary, he helped to create the first opposition journal Besz√©l≈ë which was first issued in December 1981. He was the Editor-in-Chief of this underground journal until the democratization of the country in 1989. He was also member of the democratic opposition party Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz). From 1988 to 1989 he was visiting professor at the New School for Social Research in New York City. After the fall of communism in 1989‚Äì1990, the SzDSz entered the democratic Parliament and Kis was elected as the party leader on 23 February 1990. He remained in this office until 23 November 1991, when he left active politics and returned to an academic career. However, he remained in the SzDSz. He welcomed the coalition of the SzDSz with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) In 1992, he became a professor at the Central European University. Since 1996, he has also been a visiting professor at New York University. He left the SzDSz in 2002, when the socialist prime minister, P√©ter Medgyessy proved to be a former officer of the communist secret service (officer D-209).

It is most often used to explain the causes of World War I and the subsequent heavy losses that occurred year after year, on all sides, during the fighting on the Western Front. The term has also been applied to pre-World War II air power doctrine that held that \\"the bomber will always get through\\" and the only way to end a bombing campaign was to bomb the enemy into submission. It is also often used to explain Israeli strategy during the 1960s and 1970s, as demonstrated in the Six-Day War in which Israeli forces attacked and routed much larger enemy forces in a lightning attack. Military theory Under the cult of offensive, military leaders believe that the attacker will be victorious (or at least cause more casualties than they receive) regardless of circumstance and so defense as a concept is almost completely discredited. This results in all strategies focusing on attacking, and the only valid defensive strategy being to counter-attack. International politics In international relations, the cult of offensive is related to the security dilemma and offensive realism theories. It stresses that conquest is easy and security difficult to obtain from a defensive posture. Liberal institutionalists argue that it is a commitment problemPowell, Robert. 2006. \\"War as a Commitment Problem.\\" and that a preemptive war that results from the security dilemma is fairly rare.Reiter, Dan. 1995. \\"Exploding the Powder Keg Myth: Preemptive Wars Almost Never Happen.\\" World War I The cult of the offensive was the dominant theory among many military and political leaders before World War I.Snyder, Jack L., The Ideology of the Offensive: Military Decision Making and the Disasters of 1914, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984 Those leaders argued in favor of declaring war and launching an offensive, believing they could cripple their opponents, and fearing that if they waited, they in turn would be defeated. The dominance of this line of thought significantly contributed to the escalation of hostilities, and is seen as one of the causes of World War I. Military theorists of the time generally held that seizing the offensive was of crucial importance, hence belligerents were encouraged to strike first in order to gain the advantage.Azar Gat, The Development of Military Thought: The Nineteenth Century, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992 Most planners wanted to begin mobilization as quickly as possible to avoid being caught on the defensive. This was complicated as mobilizations were expensive, and their schedules were so rigid that they could not be canceled without massive disruption of the country and military disorganization. Thus, the window for diplomacy was shortened by this attitude, and once the mobilizations had begun diplomacy had the added difficulty of having to justify cancelling the mobilizations. This phenomenon was also referred to as \\"war by timetable\\".Taylor, A. J. P., War by Time-Table: How the First World War Began, London: Macdonald & Co., 1969 The German Schlieffen Plan is a notable example of the cult of the offensive. Supported by offensively-minded officers such as Alfred von Schlieffen and Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, it was executed in the first month of the war (with some historians maintaining it was nearly victorious,Dupuy, Trevor N, A Genius for War: the German Army and General Staff, 1807-1945, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1977 though others claim the Plan never had any chance of success.) A French counter- attack on the outskirts of Paris, the Battle of the Marne and unexpectedly speedy Russian mobilisation and attacks, ended the German offensive and resulted in years of trench warfare. It was not only Germany who followed the cult of the offensive; the French army, among others, was also driven very strongly by this doctrine, where its supporters included Ferdinand Foch, Joseph Joffre and Loyzeaux de Grandmaison. Officers of that period were indoctrinated that \\"The French Army, returning unto its traditions, no longer knows any law other than the offensive.\\" This is thought to be the military reason behind the French Conscription Law in July 1913, following the passing of a similar bill in Germany six months earlier: the offensive \\"guerre √† outrance\\" swiftly to seize Alsace-Lorraine was felt by military planners to require an additional 200,000 conscripts with respect to the defensive war for which the army was prepared. World War I was dominated by defensive firepower but the onus on the Entente was to conduct an offensive strategy, that caused mass casualties and mutual exhaustion. German armies prepared elaborate defensive positions on the western front with trenches, barbed wire and concrete strong-points backed by artillery, rifles and machine guns which until 1917, were sufficient to inflict mass losses on attacking infantry and restrict the Franco-British armies to minor gains in ground. Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917 began to return mobility to the battlefield and a form of semi-open warfare developed. Much inter-war military thinking was influenced by the cost of offensives fought for strategic reasons, in circumstances of defensive operational and tactical dominance. In World War II, the Western Allies from 1939‚Äì1940 avoided an offensive, intending to wait until Franco-British rearmament had matured and the blockade of Germany had undermined its war economy, then in 1941 or 1942, resume the firepower warfare of 1918.

Aside from the eponymous village, the municipality consists of the following districts: Abbendorf, Bergmoor, Dankensen, D√ºlseberg, Haselhorst, H√∂ddelsen, Hohenb√∂ddenstedt, Hohengrieben, Lindhof, Mehmke, Molmke, Neuekrug, Peckensen, Reddigau, Schadeberg, Schadewohl, Waddekath, and W√ºllmersen, as well as the smaller settlements Forsthof Vier, Kerstenberg, R√∂mke, and Schinkenm√ºhle. Waddekath is located immediately east of the former inner German border. The climate is comparatively dry with an average yearly precipitation of 622 mm, lower values being registered in only 25 % of the weather stations of DWD. Precipitation is distributed fairly evenly over the year, with a ratio of 1.6 between the wettest month (August) and the driest (October), with lower variations being registered only in 4 % of the DWD weather stations.  History  Megalithic graves near Diesdorf, Molmke, and Schadeberg are evidence of the area having been populated already in the Upper Paleolithic era. Diesdorf was first mentioned in 1112. The monastery Marienwerder of the Augustinian Canons, founded in 1161 by count Hermann of Warpke-L√ºchow, had a major influence on the development of the village. After the Protestant Reformation and the secularisation of the monastery in 1551, the administration of a demesne of the state of Brandenburg and a noble women's convent were established in its place. Both were dissolved under the rule of the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1810. After the return to Prussia, Diesdorf and the Altmark were integrated into the Magdeburg district of the Province of Saxony, from which the country of Saxony-Anhalt emerged in 1947. From 1952 to 1990 Diesdorf was part of Kreis Salzwedel in Bezirk Magdeburg. Abbedorf and Waddekath were incorporated into Diesdorf on 1 January 1991, Schadeberg followed on 1 November 1992. The formerly independent municipality of Neuekrug was incorporated on 1 January 2010, and the municipality of Mehmke on 1 September 2010. The coat of arms was confirmed by the regional council in Magdeburg on 1 April 1997 and refers to the traditions of the Augustinian monastery and its role in the Christianisation of the area, symbolised by the black cross with golden borders, as well as to the location near the border of several lordships, symbolised by the rhombic pattern in the escutcheon which stands for a traditional border fence, but also for the pattern of the timber framework of the buildings. The oak leaves refer to the natural beauty of the countryside and the old oak trees along the monastery walls. In 1998 the municipality was officially designated as a Flecken. A storage facility for natural gas was built in a salt dome near Peckensen and has been substantially extended in 2014.  Transportation  State road 8 between Wittingen and Salzwedel, part of tourist route German Timber-Frame Road, passes through Diesdorf, and state road 11 to Beetzendorf and Apenburg, part of tourist route Romanesque Road branches off in the centre of Diesdorf village. The railway lines to Salzwedel, Beetzendorf, and Wittingen were closed in 1993, 1973, and 1945, respectively.  Population and politics  Per the 2011 census, 41.1 % of the then 2474 inhabitants were recorded as Protestants, 3.2 % as Roman Catholics, the remaining 54.7 % did not state any religion. After the elections of 7 June 2009, of the 12 seats in the municipal council were distributed as follows: CDU 3 seats, Die Linke 4 seats, SPD 4 seats, FDP 1 seat.  Sights  Alte Darre, oast house of the former monastery Diesdorf is home to what is claimed as the oldest open-air museum in Germany. Opened in 1911 by the local doctor, Goerg Schultze, the museum comprises more than 20 mostly timber-framed historical houses and farm buildings, as well as a post mill. At the same time as creating the museum, the doctor also set up an adjacent open-air swimming pool. The church St Mary and Crucis of the former monastery has been built in Brick Romanesque style. Construction started in 1182. Its neo-romanesque tower was added in 1863. Alte Darre, the old brewing and baking house of the former monastery dating back to the 14th century, has been restored in the early 2010s and is used as the local historical museum. The monastery walls are largely preserved. Several megalithic graves are found in the municipal area.

Great Northern, along with sister ship , were built to provide a passenger and freight link by sea between the northern transcontinental rail lines via the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway terminal at Astoria, Oregon and San Francisco beginning in spring of 1915. The ship was acquired for military service in September 1917 and served as USS Great Northern (AG-9), USAT Great Northern and USS Columbia before returning to commercial Pacific Coast service as H. F. Alexander. In 1942 the ship was acquired by the War Shipping Administration and again became an Army transport, USAT George S. Simonds. After layup in the reserve fleet 5 March 1946 the ship was sold to Boston Metals Company on 25 February 1948 for scrapping. Construction and design Great Northern and sister ship Northern Pacific were built by William Cramp & Sons for the Great Northern Pacific Steam Ship Company, Astoria, Oregon to the order of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway Company to serve between Astoria and San Francisco. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway line itself was a joint venture between the Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway that would give two ships their names. Contracts for both ships were let on 26 April 1913 with keel laying for Great Northern on 22 September 1913 and launch on 7 July 1914 with service due to start in March 1915. Both ships were designed for 856 passengers and 2,185 tons of freight with a 23 knot speed making possible the run between the ports in 25‚Äì26 hours, equal to the time for an overland route, under favorable conditions and thus allowing direct service to San Francisco from the east using the two northern rail lines. Both ships were classed A100 according to British Lloyds and met the latest requirements of the United States Steamboat Inspection Service. Design specifications were for a ship with length overall, length between perpendiculars, beam, full load draft, depth molded to A deck with and approximately 200,000 cubic feet of cargo space. The 856 passenger capacity was broken down into 550 first class, 108 second class and 198 third class served by a crew of 198. The double bottomed hull was divided into eleven watertight compartments with ten extending to the bottom of the second deck above full load waterline. Twelve Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers provided steam for Parsons turbines on three shafts with a requirement that the 23 knot speed be available with steam from only ten boilers. One high-pressure turbine long with diameter rotor drum with four stages of expansion and two low- pressure turbines, with integrated astern and each long with ahead and astern diameter rotor drums, develop about 25,000 shaft horsepower at 325 revolutions. Four 35 kilowatt, 110 volt steam driven Diehl Manufacturing Company generators provided electric power for lighting and auxiliary electric machinery. Commercial service 1915‚Äì1917 Great Northern Pacific Steamship Company postcard for sending messages written on board Great Northern Great Northern's Observation Room During summer Great Northern, advertised with her sister as \\"Palaces of the Pacific,\\" was engaged in the Astoria to San Francisco service. The service was inaugurated during the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition with a schedule of departure from Portland by steamer train with a three and a half hour trip to the pier in Astoria departing at 1:30 p.m. on the twenty-six-hour trip to San Francisco, scheduled to arrive at Pier 25 of the Greenwich Street wharf at 3:30 p.m. starting 25 March. In winter Great Northern changed to a luxury service to Hawaii on a route of San Francisco‚ÄîSan Pedro‚ÄîHilo‚ÄîHonolulu with passage out taking four days with the stop in Hilo long enough for a volcano visit by tourists. The two ships maintained into 1917 the Great Northern Railway's sea link between the sights of the northwestern states and California with advertisements of the parks and sights connected by the railroad and the ship's link to San Francisco. Military service 1917‚Äì1922 USS Great Northern as an armed transport returning US troops in 1919 The entry of the United States into World War I brought the end of the ship's commercial service with wartime service as a fast troop transport. =Navy= Great Northern was acquired from her owners on 19 September 1917, by the United States Shipping Board; converted to a transport at the Puget Sound Navy Yard; and commissioned as USS Great Northern (ID-4569) on 1 November 1917 with Captain W. W. Phelps in command. Six officers and men of the civilian crew joined the Navy to serve on board. Captain Phelps remained in command until 20 September 1918 when he was relieved by Captain S. H. R. Doyle. Embarking nearly 1,400 passengers at Puget Sound, including 500 \\"enemy aliens,\\" women and children as well as men, Great Northern sailed for the U.S. East Coast on 21 January 1918, reaching New York City on 9 February via the Panama Canal and Charleston, South Carolina. On 7 March, she sailed from the Army's then Hoboken Port of Embarkation, later designated the New York Port of Embarkation, for Brest, France with 1,500 members of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Great Northern returned to Hoboken on 30 March with wounded veterans. From then until August 1919, she made a total of 18 transatlantic voyages, first carrying troops to the fighting zones and then bringing home the victorious \\"doughboys\\". Great Northern decommissioned at New York on 15 August 1919 and was transferred to the U.S. Army Transportation Service the same day. =Army= Great Northern was transferred to the Army Transport Service (ATS) on 15 August 1919. USAT Great Northern was home ported at the New York Port of Embarkation 1919‚Äì1920 and then transferred to Fort Mason in San Francisco for Pacific service and home ported there 1920‚Äì1921. In February 1920 the ship transported Y.M.C.A. and Red Cross workers from Vladivostok to San Francisco and in April transported approximately 3,000 American officers and men of the American Expeditionary Force Siberia from Siberia to the Philippines. Great Northern also took a Congressional party on a long Pacific inspection, touching at Hong Kong, Honolulu, Cavite, and then returning to San Francisco, California in the summer of 1920. The ship was laid up at San Francisco on 1 November 1920. By this time the Army found both Great Northern and Northern Pacific, then laid up in New York, too fast and too expensive to operate in peacetime and was attempting to lease them to private operators. Great Northern was turned over to the Navy by Executive Order on 29 July 1921. =Navy and rename= USS Columbia (AG-9) At Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dressed with flags for George Washington's Birthday, 22 February 1922. This ship served as USS Great Northern in 1917‚Äì1919. The ship was reacquired by the Navy from the War Department 3 August 1921 and commissioned 11 August as Great Northern (AG-9). On 19 November 1921, Great Northerns name was changed by Presidential order to Columbia to honor a name long famous in Navy annals. She remained in New York harbor, functioning as a floating command post, through the rest of 1921. Columbia sailed for the Caribbean to join the annual Atlantic Fleet winter exercises on 7 January 1922, reaching Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, via Charleston and Key West, Florida on 18 January. Three days later she joined the battleships , , , and at Guantanamo Bay. Columbia sailed north on 24 February, reaching New York on 27 February. That same day, Admiral Jones shifted his flag to , and Columbia sailed for Chester, Pennsylvania. She decommissioned there on 4 March 1922 and was transferred to the U.S. Shipping Board. Commercial service 1922‚Äì1942 The ship returned to merchant service with Admiral Lines' Pacific Steamship Company under the name H. F. Alexander as the line' flagship, noted in 1933 as the fastest coastwise vessel in the American Merchant Marine. World War II service On 25 July 1942 she was taken over by the War Shipping Administration and transferred to the Army under bareboat charter as the troop transport USAT George S. Simonds. Simonds had a capacity for 1,803 troops and was one of the U. S. Army Transports carrying troops to Normandy from England in June 1944. The ship went into the reserve fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia 5 March 1946 and was sold to Boston Metals Company on 25 February 1948.
