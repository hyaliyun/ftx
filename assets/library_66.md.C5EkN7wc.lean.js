Secondly, there are fonctionnaires or functionaries, meaning the permanent staff which form the majority of the European institutions. There are two categories of fonctionnaires, Assistants and Administrators. The former perform \\"secretarial\\" roles while the latter have more policy-related or managerial responsibilities. The third category is the contractual agents. Contractual agents do not have an employment contract with the same conditions as the fonctionnaires. Their first job contract is limited in duration, and only after several renewals can this contract be extended permanently. Eurocrats generally come from all member states of the European Union. EPSO is the main body which selects staff for recruitment to the European Institutions. Nowadays the term Eurocrat has come to encompass staff from all EU Institutions and not only staff from the European Commission. Although the term Eurocrat might convey negative connotations for some, specialists of European Union and its institutions Didier Georgagakakis and Jay Rowell use the concept of Eurocracy as a way to describe and analyse EU actors and professionals interactions.

Apollodorus left a technique behind known as skiagraphia, a way to easily produce shadow, that affected the works not only of his contemporaries but also of later generations. This shading technique uses hatched areas to give the illusion of both shadow and volume.  Life and accomplishments  Little is known about the actual life of Apollodorus, although he was catalogued by the notable historians Plutarch and Pliny the Elder. It was recorded that Apollodorus was active around 480 BCE; his dates of birth and death, however, are not attested in any surviving historical works or fragments of works.“Apollodorus.” The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 26 Nov. 2008. http://www.answers.com/topic/apollodorus- painter. He was given different names by those who wrote about him. To Pliny, he was the great painter Apollodorus of Athens; therefore, it can be assumed that he lived and worked in the polis of Athens.Pliny. The Natural History of Pliny. Trans. John Bostock and Henry T. Riley. H.G. Bohn, 1857. 250. But, to Plutarch and Hesychius, he was known as Apollodorus Skiagraphos, \\"the shadow- painter, named after his greatest legacy. None of his actual paintings remain, for, due to weathering, almost all ancient Greek paintings have been destroyed, and the elegance and beauty of Greek art can mainly be glimpsed in the Macedonian tombs with their rich artistic programmes, in works such as the Derveni krater, and in the sculptures and motives that were later copied by the Romans and architectural ruins that remain. The subjects of some of the paintings were recorded, however, by quite a number of ancient Greek historians. Pliny the Elder recorded two paintings, Praying Priest and Ajax Burned by Lightning, that resided in the ancient Greek city of Pergamon which was situated in modern-day Turkey. Other ancient Greek historians cited the painting Odysseus Wearing a Cap and also Heracleidae, a painting that referenced the descendants of Hercules. Also, one of his paintings was supposedly entitled Alcmena and the Daughters of Hercules Supplicating the Athenians. As demonstrated by the titles of the paintings, it is probable that the majority of his works were similar to the other artists of the era in that their subject matter was most often based around the Greek gods and goddesses or other famous Greek citizens from historical epic poems that were passed on for generations in the oral tradition. The topics of his paintings may have been unimaginative and common during the time period; however, it was his ingenious technique that made him such a renowned painter. One of the major artistic techniques that Apollodorus developed was called skiagraphia, or shading in English, hence his title “the shadow-painter”. The historian Plutarch recorded an inscription above one of Apollodorus' painting which read, “’Tis no hard thing to reprehend me; But let the men that blame me mend me.”Plutarch. Plutarch's Morals. Trans. Several Hands. Ed. William W. Goodwin. Vol. 5. Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1878. . In other words, “You could criticize [skiagraphia] more easily than you could imitate it”. The type of shading applied by Apollodorus is highly sophisticated and even today people struggle to master skiagraphia. Apollodorus used an intricate way of “crosshatching and the thickening of inner contour lines as well as the admixture of light and dark tones” to show a form of perspective. Though it expanded the use of perspective in the ancient Greek world, skiagraphia was most effective in the depiction of stationary objects such as drapery, fruit, or faces; but it was ineffective in the painting of a body in action or a spatial setting for which perspective is usually used. Another one of Apollodorus' greatest accomplishments did not have to do with his actual style or technique, but rather with the medium he chose. Apollodorus could very well have been one to the first well-known artists who painted on an easel as opposed to a wall which was the common action of the day.Pollitt, Jerome Jordan. The Art of Ancient Greece : Sources and Documents. New York: Cambridge UP, 1990. 146-47.  Effect on contemporaries  Though not much about his life is known, historians have made assumptions about Apollodorus and his works and actions through his contemporaries. Zeuxis of Heraclea was one of Apollodorus' rivals according to Pliny. Zeuxis was tutored in the arts by Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos. At one point, Apollodorus even accused Zeuxis of stealing art techniques from others which might very well have been true because Zeuxis was also attributed with the expansion and development of Apollodorus' prized skiagraphia. Zeuxis is said to have innovated skiagraphia by “adding highlights to shading and applying subtly different colours.”Arafat, Karim. \\"Zeuxis.\\" The Oxford Companion to Western Art. 2008. 14 May 2006. Oxford Art Online. Lucas Library, Atherton. 26 Nov. 2008. Keyword: http://oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr. Regardless of what Zeuxis did, he was not the only painter to adapt Apollodorus' creation for his own purposes. Another painter named Parrhasius of Ephesus, also a rival of Zeuxis, helped expand skiagraphia as well. He purportedly used it in a contest against Zeuxis and won because the curtain that Parrhasius had painted looked so real that Zeuxis tried to pull it back. Whereas Zeuxis examined the technique of light and shade in skiagraphia, Parrhasius looked into the contoured lines that help express depth in a spatial way; therefore taking the meaning of skiagraphia even further.Robertson, Martin. A Shorter History of Greek Art. New York: Cambridge UP, 1981. 147. Not only was skiagraphia prominent in Athens, but also its influence extended beyond Athens' borders into the tomb paintings of Vergina, Aineia, and Lefkadia in northern Greece and even into Seuthopolis, a city in what is now modern Bulgaria. Though scarce, some of the tomb frescoes in Seuthopolis used only a limited range of colours; however others in Vergina and Aineia used six or more colours further demonstrating the extent of the transformation of Apollodorus' skiagraphia. Skiagraphia continued to mutate and develop until the age of the Italian Renaissance when it was given a new name: chiaroscuro.  Effect on the development of chiaroscuro  Apollodorus' development of skiagraphia was only the beginning of this form of art's gradual development. In Italian, chiaro means light and scuro means dark. So the two together symbolize the combination and distribution of light and dark into one to create a more lifelike image. No longer simply used for paintings on canvas of stationary objects, chiaroscuro is used in all types of art, even sculpture, frescoes, and woodcuts. Chiaroscuro is used to produce volume and relief, to unify the objects in a painting, or differentiate them from one another. The simple creation of skiagraphia led to the invention of diverse techniques that continued to be produced from the times of ancient Greece to Gothic times and then it reached its pinnacle in the Italian Renaissance in 14th century. Even today it continues to be important to artists.Bell, Janis C. \\"Chiaroscuro.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006. 25 Feb. 2007. Oxford Art Online. Lucas Library, Atherton. 26 Nov. 2008. Keyword: http://oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art. In the 15th-century, chiaroscuro was described by Cennino Cennini, a famous Italian painter. He stated that the ideas of gradation between light and dark, skiagraphia, were combined with medieval techniques known as incidendo and matizando, which are a “layerings of white, brown, or black in linear patterns over a uniform colour” to indicate relief and volume. These two were previously used by monks in the illustration of religious manuscripts. The addition of these two techniques to skiagraphia was instrumental in the evolution of chiaroscuro. Giotto, a Florentine painter, and Cimabue, Giotto's teacher, used chiaroscuro in their late Gothic painting as well, by mixing large amounts of white into the painting, therefore creating an easy transition between tones. In frescoes, mosaics, and manuscript illuminations, artists like Master Honore, a French manuscript painter, and Pietro, a painter and mosaic designer active in the Middle Ages, modelled from underneath with black and white space to create brightness in their works. In the end, Apollodorus' master creation after years of evolution transformed into something that, though it still resembled the original and served the same purpose, was new and thoroughly necessary to all great works of art.

It is the first book in the seven-book Septimus Heap series. The sequel, Flyte was released in March 2006, Physik in March 2007, Queste in 2008, Syren in September 2009, Darke in July 2011, and Fyre in 2013. The book cover of Magyk alludes to the diary that the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia makes for her apprentice, Septimus Heap. The cover also depicts Septimus's Dragon Ring, rendered as if it were sitting atop the diary. Setting The story's setting is mainly centered on the Marram Marshes, which is where Aunt Zelda lives. It also takes place in a castle simply known as \\"The Castle\\", which started as a small village inside the curve of a river. A moat was built to prevent witches and wolverines from a nearby forest from attacking the inhabitants. Summary The book begins with Silas Heap, father of the eponymous protagonist to the series, returning home through the winter snow. As he is walking, he feels a heartbeat in the snow, through Magykal means, and finds that a newborn baby girl with violet eyes has seemingly been abandoned in the snow. Since Silas already has six children and a new one born just that day, he finds that another will do no harm and that his wife, Sarah Heap, will not disagree. He hides the baby in his cloak and continues his trek home. However, he is confronted by the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, who warns him that he should not tell anyone about the baby he found, and that he should say the child was born to him. Silas agrees, as she is the new ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Silas continues his walk home, to bring his wife the herbs she needs and a new child. Upon reaching his home, Silas sees the midwife run out with a bundle of cloth, wailing that his newborn Septimus, the seventh son of a seventh son, is dead. Silas and his wife, Sarah, decide to raise the baby girl in place of Septimus, as if she was their own daughter. They name their child Jenna. Months later, Sarah learns from her friend Sally Mullin that the queen has been assassinated, and the castle is under the control of the Supreme Custodian. As well, the queen's newborn daughter had gone missing. Sally also says that the assassination had occurred months before, but had been kept a secret. She mentions that it happened around the time Alther Mella, Marcia's mentor, had been killed. Sarah realises that Jenna is the missing princess, but decides to keep this a secret from everyone, other than Silas. Ten years later, Jenna Heap is celebrating her tenth birthday with her parents and six other brothers. Marcia Overstrand interrupts the party, telling the family that the woman living next door works as a spy for the Supreme Custodian, and has confirmed with him that Jenna is the queen's daughter. Marcia states that she must take Jenna into safekeeping right away, for the Assassin is on his way. Sarah agrees, and explains to a reluctant Jenna that she is a princess, and that she must go with Marcia. Marcia whisks Jenna to her apartment in the Wizard Tower, where she can temporarily be kept safe. Marcia also finds a boy, part of the Young Army, buried in the snow and close to death. The boy, called Boy 412, is rescued by Marcia, and is taken into her apartment to warm up. The Assassin, being a skilled huntsman, manages to locate Jenna's whereabouts, and goes after her. Silas, Nicko (the youngest of the six brothers), and their dog Maxie decide to pay Jenna a visit. Shortly after they arrive, the ghost of Alther Mella warns Marcia that the Assassin is outside the tower. Marcia panics and tries to get everyone, including Boy 412, out of the tower through the rubbish chute. The group ends up in the dump, with a Hunter hot on their heels. Marcia clogs the chute to make it look as though they had gotten stuck. The owner of the nearby cafe, Sally Mullin, finds them and shelters them in her cafe. Silas tells her about their predicament, and Sally allows them to use her sailboat to escape. Marcia gives Sally a KeepSafe Charm in return for her thanks. Silas, Marcia and the children then flee to the Marram Marshes, with Nicko sailing the boat. The Hunter reaches the dump, and spends quite a while in unclogging the chute. After sending one of his men to make sure they are still not stuck somewhere inside, he looks for anyone who may have seen the escapees. He notices Sally and confronts her. She denies knowing anything, but her actions prove otherwise. He threatens to burn down her café, unless she confesses. She still refuses, but one of her customers rats out Marcia's group, and the huntsman allows the customer and his friends to leave before he burns the café down. He locks Sally inside and sets the building on fire. However, Sally survives because of Marcia's KeepSafe Charm. The Hunter, accompanied by his Pack, follows the group, heading for the Marram Marshes. His skilled men manage to catch up with the small sailboat, but are unable to see them through the thick Magykal fog that Marcia conjures. Boy 412 causes a scuffle, for he thinks that the wizards are holding him captive. Jenna, just a bit stronger than 412 (much to his dismay) manages to keep him quiet, before he kicks the boat, and alerts the Hunter where the boat is. Marcia uses a spell to Project an image of the Muriel, Sally's boat, and distract the Hunter, upon which he loses the group's trail, and has to return to the castle. The group reaches the Marshes and must navigate through perilous bogs, but eventually reaches a safe cottage belonging to Zelda Heap, Silas' aunt and a White Witch. Aunt Zelda keeps everyone safe and well-fed throughout the winter. The group learns that the Supreme Custodian is doing the bidding of DomDaniel, an ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard and an evil Necromancer; with Marcia and Jenna gone from the Castle, he is free to return and wreak havoc on the inhabitants. The Heaps, Marcia, and Boy 412 settle into life at the cottage. After 2 weeks, Marcia decides to make 52 shield bugs to use in case of an emergency. One day, with a heavy fog covering the island, Boy 412 gets lost when he gets separated from Jenna and Nicko on a walk. He wanders around until he walks through a bush and falls into a hidden hole. He finds himself in a series of tunnels in total darkness. Scared, he begins searching in the dark until he finds a ring shaped like a dragon biting its tail. It shrinks to fit his finger and begins to glow, allowing him to find his way through the tunnels, which happen to lead into Aunt Zelda's closet. He keeps the ring a secret for some time. Marcia begins teaching the children basic Magyk to protect themselves, and Boy 412 finds that he is a natural, even though he has never done Magyk in his life. Marcia sees potential in him and asks him to be her Apprentice, but Boy 412 declines, believing that the only reason he can do Magyk is because of the ring. Silas receives word that his eldest son, Simon, has gone missing. He sets off to journey back to the Castle to look for him, but soon afterwards is cut off from the Marshes by the area's annual winter storm, the Big Freeze. After several weeks without word from him, a Message Rat finally delivers a strange message, apparently from Silas, asking Marcia to return to the Castle. Marcia leaves at midnight, intending to use the Magykal Midnight Minutes for protection, but is captured upon her arrival because her timepiece was wrong from the energy at Zelda's cottage. She is thrown into Dungeon Number One and nearly dies, but Alther finds her and manages to keep her alive. When the Big Thaw finally sets in and the Marshes become navigable again, the Hunter, who has discovered the location of the Cottage, takes DomDaniel's Apprentice out into the Marshes and makes another attempt to kill the occupants of the cottage. He finds Jenna, Nicko, and Boy 412 out on one of the islands, and gives chase. Jenna and Boy 412 split off from Nicko and the Hunter follows them until Boy 412 realizes where they are, and tackles Jenna into the concealed hole he'd found weeks ago. He leads her through the tunnels back to Zelda's cottage, where they find the Hunter Frozen by Aunt Zelda, and arrive shortly before Nicko and a captured Apprentice. Zelda and Boy 412 use a spell to erase the Hunter's memories and convince him his is a buffoon looking for work in a circus, and the Hunter leaves, leaving the Apprentice behind. The cottage occupants interrogate the Apprentice and he tells them that his name is Septimus Heap, and that he is a seventh son of a seventh son. They don't believe him, as he is an awful person and in league with DomDaniel. Later that night, the Apprentice sneaks out of the cottage and takes the Hunter's abandoned canoe across the Marshes to DomDaniel's ship in Bleak Creek. After discovering the Apprentice's disappearance the next morning, Jenna, Nicko, and Boy 412 set off to look for him, and discover the ship, as well as Alther hiding nearby. He informs them of all that has happened at the Castle in their absence and that Marcia may be on board the ship. He asks the children not to do anything dangerous and leaves, after which they promptly sneak on board to try and find Marcia. However, they are discovered by DomDaniel, and must make a hasty escape, but not before they do see Marcia and Boy 412 manages to give her his Dragon Ring, which returns her powers. DomDaniel begins to summon a massive storm to try and drown them, which floods the Marshes as they get back to the cottage. Zelda tells them to go down into the tunnels to hide, which they do, taking Maxie with them. In the tunnels, they get a chance to really look at the pictures depicted on the walls. Upon Jenna's touch, the walls open up to reveal a massive cavern containing a golden boat with a dragon's neck and head, tail, and wings. She comes to life when the trio climbs on board and Jenna finds that she can communicate with the dragon as all the Queens used to be able to do during their yearly trips to visit the boat. Due to the huge storm outside, the cavern collapses and floods, allowing the boat to sail again, and fly, as it turns out she is able to do. The trio decide to use the boat to rescue Marcia from the Vengeance. On board the Vengeance, Marcia uses her newly returned Magyk to incapacitate her guards and make her way up to the deck, where she sees the incoming Dragon Boat and a stunned and angered DomDaniel. She takes advantage of his shock to take back the Akhu Amulet, the source of the ExtraOrdinary Wizard's power, and leaves him on the deck as the Dragon Boat swoops down and scoops her up. They leave the powerless Vengeance sinking, having been damaged by the storm. The Dragon Boat flies back to the cottage and with the storm fading, the Marshes slowly drain and begin to return to normal. The next day, Jenna is out admiring the Dragon Boat when she hears something in the water, and finds the weak Apprentice clinging to some wreckage from the ship. He claims it sank but he got out, but when Jenna and Nicko bring him back to the cottage, Marcia strikes him down and Magykally returns him to the sunken ship, saying it was DomDaniel in disguise and showing everyone the almost-dead real Apprentice that she found earlier in the day. Zelda is able to nurse the boy back to health and brings him to recover in the cottage, and goes to scry with the moon to find out who he really is. Marcia returns the Dragon Ring to Boy 412, telling him that he is now the Dragon Master and that things have a habit of working out eventually, referring to his Magykal talent. She asks him again is he would consider becoming his Apprentice, and this time he agrees. Silas, Sarah, and Simon, who was eventually found by Silas, have made their way to the cottage, and they all join in the Apprentice Supper being held to celebrate Boy 412's Apprenticeship. Marcia asks Boy 412 if there is anything he would like as a gift, and he asks to know who he is, as he has grown up in the Young Army since he was a baby. Zelda takes them all to her scrying pond and asks the moon to first show them the family of Boy 412. They see their own reflections in the pond and are disappointed that it didn't work, but only Marcia notices that her reflection is missing from the group. Next, Zelda asks to see Boy 412's mother, and the reflections begin to disappear until only Sarah Heap is left. With realizations beginning to hit everyone, Zelda asks to see Septimus Heap, and Sarah's reflection is replaced by Boy 412's, revealed to be Septimus. In an epilogue, it is revealed what Aunt Zelda discovered when she was scrying on her own to discover who the Apprentice was. When the Midwife took newborn Septimus away, he was not dead, merely drugged, and she was taking him to be collected to be raised as DomDaniel's Apprentice. She takes the baby to the Young Army barracks nursery, where her own son is being babysat while she is on her mission. She sets Septimus down and picks up her own child, but at that moment, the nurse assigned to collect Septimus from the nursery arrives. Seeing the midwife with a baby in her arms, she wrongly believes it is Septimus and takes him away. Septimus is raised in the Young Army and the midwife's son is raised as DomDaniel's apprentice.

He has worked with Norah Jones, Melody Gardot, Madeleine Peyroux, Nikki Yanofsky, and Lizz Wright. Early life and education Harris was born in New York City,Jesse Harris biography. – MusicianGuide.com. along with his twin sister. He attended Riverdale Country School in New York City. He graduated from Cornell University in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. Career Jesse Harris's music has been described as a \\"blend [of] folk, rock, jazz, and world rhythms.\\" Harris gave guitar lessons and performed in musical groups before he formed the duo Once Blue with singer-songwriter Rebecca Martin. This was the first group he was in and his first experience writing for another singer. Once Blue released its self-titled debut on EMI Records in 1995 and nine additional songs were included in the album's re-release in 2003. Harris signed as a songwriter with Sony Publishing in 1998 and then made three self-released recordings with his new band, The Ferdinandos, consisting of Harris, Tony Scherr, Tim Luntzel, and Kenny Wollesen. The band released two more albums on Verve Records. Harris recorded three solo albums Mineral, Feel, and Watching the Sky on his own label, Secret Sun Recordings. In 2003, he was awarded a Grammy Award for Song of the Year for \\"Don't Know Why\\", performed by Norah Jones. Jones's album, Come Away With Me, includes five of Harris' compositions: \\"Don't Know Why,\\" \\"Shoot the Moon,\\" \\"One Flight Down,\\" \\"I've Got To See You Again,\\" and \\"The Long Day is Over.\\" Harris plays guitar throughout the whole album. Jones and Harris have collaborated numerous times since then. Jones has been a guest on many of his albums and he appears as guitarist on almost all of her albums. Harris contributed songwriting to Jones' 2008 release The Fall. Harris appears as a guitarist on Bright Eyes' 2005 album, \\"I'm Wide Awake It's Morning,\\" as well as \\"Motion Sickness.\\" In 2007, Harris contributed songs to the soundtrack of the film The Hottest State, written and directed by Ethan Hawke. The soundtrack featured new versions of his songs by Jones, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Feist, Cat Power, M. Ward, The Black Keys, Bright Eyes, Brad Mehldau and Rosario Ortega. He also acted in the film. In August 2010 Harris released his album Through the Night and recorded a new version of his song \\"The Secret Sun\\" for a Corona (beer) commercial. Harris's 11th album, Sub Rosa, recorded in Rio de Janeiro, was released in July 2012 and features guest vocals from Conor Oberst, Melody Gardot, and Norah Jones. Harris's 12th album, the stripped down Borne Away, was released on June 25, 2013. In 2013, Harris joined John Zorn's, The Song Project, along with Mike Patton, Sofia Rei, and Sean Lennon, writing lyrics for various Zorn compositions and singing them at festivals worldwide with a band featuring Marc Ribot on guitar, John Medeski on keyboards, and Zorn conducting. Two of the group's albums have been released by Tzadik Records. Harris and Jones appear together in the 2014 David Wain/Michael Showalter film, They Came Together, performing his song, \\"It Was The Last Thing On Your Mind,\\" which Harris produced. In 2016 he appeared in Showalter's film \\"Hello, My Name Is Doris,\\" performing his song, \\"Anything Was Possible.\\" Recently, Zorn and Harris have begun a new project, Songs For Petra, which features Petra Haden and The Julian Lage Trio (for whom Harris has produced two albums, Arclight and Modern Lore), plus Harris on guitar.

In a series of three stages, the conquest of the Maghreb commenced in 647 and concluded in 709 with the Byzantine Empire losing its last remaining strongholds to the then-Umayyad Caliphate under Caliph Muawiyah I. By 642, under Caliph Umar, Arab Muslim forces had laid control of Mesopotamia (638), Syria (641), Egypt (642), and had invaded Armenia, all previously territories split between the warring Byzantine and Sasanian empires, and were concluding their conquest of the Persian Empire with their defeat of the Persian army at the Battle of Nahāvand. It was at this point that Arab military expeditions into North African regions west of Egypt were first launched, continuing for years and furthering the spread of Islam. In 644 at Medina, Umar was succeeded by Uthman, during whose twelve-year rule Armenia, Cyprus, and all of Iran, would be added to the growing Rashidun Caliphate; Afghanistan and North Africa would receive major invasions; and Muslim sea raids would range from Rhodes to the southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. The Byzantine navy would be defeated in the eastern Mediterranean.  Sources for the history of the invasion  The earliest Arab accounts that have come down to us are those of ibn Abd al- Hakam, al-Baladhuri and Khalifah ibn Khayyat, all of which were written in the ninth century, some 200 years after the first invasions. These are not very detailed. In the case of the most informative, the History of the Conquest of Egypt and North Africa and Spain by Ibn Abd al-Hakam, Robert Brunschvig has shown that it was written with a view to illustrating points of Maliki law rather than documenting a history, and that some of the events it describes are probably historical.Brunschvig 1975. Beginning in the 12th century, scholars at Kairouan began to construct a new version of the history of the conquest, which was finalised by Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqiq. This version was copied in its entirety, and sometimes interpolated, by later authors, reaching its zenith in the 14th century with scholars such as ibn Idhari, ibn Khaldun and al-Nuwayri. It differs from the earlier version not only in the greater detail, but also in giving conflicting accounts of events. This, however, is the best-known version and is the one given below. There is ongoing controversy regarding the relative merits of the two versions. For more information, refer to the works cited below by Brunschvig, Yves Modéran and Benabbès (all supporters of the earlier version) and Siraj (supports the later version).  First invasion  The first invasion of North Africa, ordered by Abdallah ibn Sa'd, commenced in 647. 20,000 Arabs marched from Medina in the Arabian Peninsula, another 20,000 joined them in Memphis, Egypt, and Abdallah ibn Sa'd led them into the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa. The army took Tripolitania (in present-day Libya). Count Gregory, the local Byzantine governor, Rodd, Francis. \\"Kahena, Queen of the Berbers: \\"A Sketch of the Arab Invasion of Ifriqiya in the First Century of the Hijra\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol. 3, No. 4, (1925), 731-2 had declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire in North Africa. He gathered his allies, confronted the invading Islamic Arab forces and suffered defeat (647) at the Battle of Sufetula, a city 240 kilometres (150 mi) south of Carthage. With the death of Gregory his successor, probably Gennadius, secured the Arab withdrawal in exchange for tribute. The campaign lasted fifteen months and Abdallah's force returned to Egypt in 648. All further Muslim conquests were soon interrupted, however, when the Kharijite dissidents murdered Caliph Uthman after holding him under house arrest in 656. He was replaced by Ali, who in turn was assassinated in 661. The Umayyad Caliphate of largely secular and hereditary Arab caliphs, then established itself at Damascus and Caliph Muawiyah I began consolidating the empire from the Aral Sea to the western border of Egypt. He put a governor in place in Egypt at al- Fustat, creating a subordinate seat of power that would continue for the next two centuries. He then continued the invasion of non-Muslim neighboring states, attacking Sicily and Anatolia (in Asia Minor) in 663. In 664 Kabul, Afghanistan, fell to the invading Muslim armies.  Second invasion  Great Mosque of Kairouan (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in 670 AD - the oldest and most important mosque in North Africa,Hans Kung, Tracing the Way : Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, page 248 city of Kairouan, Tunisia. The years 665 to 689 saw a new Arab invasion of North Africa. It began, according to Will Durant, to protect Egypt \\"from flank attack by Byzantine Cyrene\\". So \\"an army of more than 40,000 Muslims advanced through the desert to Barca, took it, and marched to the neighborhood of Carthage\\", defeating a defending Byzantine army of 20,000 in the process. Next came a force of 10,000 Arabs led by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi and enlarged by thousands of others. Departing from Damascus, the army marched into North Africa and took the vanguard. In 670 the city of Kairouan (roughly 150 kilometers [80 mi] south of modern Tunis) was established as a refuge and base for further operations. This would become the capital of the Islamic province of Ifriqiya, which would cover the coastal regions of today's western Libya, Tunisia, and eastern Algeria. After this, as Edward Gibbon writes, the fearless general \\"plunged into the heart of the country, traversed the wilderness in which his successors erected the splendid capitals of Fes and Morocco, and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic and the great desert\\". In his conquest of the Maghreb (western North Africa) he besieged the coastal city of Bugia as well as Tingi or Tangier, overwhelming what had once been the traditional Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana. But here he was stopped and partially repulsed. Luis Garcia de Valdeavellano writes: > In their invasions against the Byzantines and the Berbers, the Arab > chieftains had greatly extended their African dominions, and as early as the > year 682 Uqba had reached the shores of the Atlantic, but he was unable to > occupy Tangier, for he was forced to turn back toward the Atlas Mountains by > a man who became known to history and legend as Count Julian. Moreover, as Gibbon writes, Uqba, \\"this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the universal rebellion against muslim occupation of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic.\\" On his return, a Berber-Byzantine coalition ambushed and crushed his forces near Biskra, killing Uqba and wiping out his troops. Then, adds Gibbon, \\"The third general or governor of Africa, Zuhayr, avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor in the Battle of Mamma. He vanquished the native population in many battles; but he was overthrown by a powerful army, which Constantinople had sent to the relief and liberation of Carthage.\\" Meanwhile, a new civil war among rivals for the monarchy raged in Arabia and Syria. It resulted in a series of four caliphs between the death of Muawiya in 680 and the accession of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Abdalmalek) in 685; strife ended only in 692 with the death of the rebel leader.  Third invasion  This development brought about a return of domestic order that allowed the caliph to resume the Islamic conquest of North Africa. It began with the renewed invasion of Ifriqiya. Gibbon writes: > the standard was delivered to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of > that kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to the > important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the interior provinces had > been alternately won and lost by the Saracens. But the seacoast still > remained in the hands of the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had > respected the name and fortifications of Carthage; and the number of its > defenders was recruited by the fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli. The arms of > Hassan were bolder and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the > metropolis of Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the > suspicion, that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more tedious > operations of a regular siege. Having lost Carthage to the Muslims in 695, the Byzantine Empire responded with troops from Constantinople, joined by soldiers and ships from Sicily and a powerful contingent of Visigoths from Hispania. This forced the invading Arab army to run back to Kairouan. Then, writes Gibbon, “the Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance.” In 698, the Arabs conquered Carthage under Hassan ibn al-Nu'man and completed the conquest of the eastern Barbary coast. Anticipating attempts at Byzantine reconquest however, they decided to destroy it. The walls were torn down, the agricultural land ravaged, the aqueducts and harbors made unusable. They established their base instead at Tunis which was heavily expanded, though Kairouan remained the governor's capital until late-9th century. This was immediately followed by a Berber rebellion against the new Arab overlords and a decisive victory at the Battle of Meskiana. Gibbon writes: > Under the standard of their queen Kahina, the independent tribes acquired > some degree of union and discipline; and as the Moors respected in their > females the character of a prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an > enthusiasm similar to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate > to the defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; > and the Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired to the confines > of Egypt. In 703, five years passed before Hassan received fresh troops from the caliph. Meanwhile, the people of North Africa's cities chafed under the Berber reign. Thus Hassan was welcomed upon his return, and managed to kill Kahina at the Battle of Tabarka. Gibbon writes that “the friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land; and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle.” By the meantime, the Arabs had taken most of North Africa from the Byzantines. The area was divided into three provinces: Egypt with its governor at al-Fustat, Ifriqiya with its governor at Kairouan, and the Maghreb (modern Morocco) with its governor at Tangiers. The successful general Musa bin Nusair was appointed the governor of Ifriqiya. His armies brutally put down the Berbers, consisting of various faiths, who fought against the advancing Muslims. Their conquest reached the Atlantic coast in 708. He was noted for the vast number of mawla he had amassed which consisted of Berber converts to Islam and people from other regions as well. The number of slaves he took in his various campaigns is said to range from 30,000 to 300,000 in various Muslim histories and some even allude to a higher number., page 1 Philip Khuri Hitti described the attribution of figures such as 300,000 slaves (also capturing 30,000 noble maidens of Spain) to him as exaggerated which was due to the high number of slaves that were available after Muslim conquests. Musa also had to deal with the Byzantine navy that still fought on against the Muslim invasions. So he built a navy of his own which went on to conquer the Christian islands of Ibiza, Majorca, and Menorca. Advancing into the Maghreb, his forces took Algiers in 700.  Aftermath  By 709, all of North Africa was under the control of the Arab caliphate. The only possible exception was Ceuta at the African Pillar of Hercules. Gibbon declares: \\"In that age, as well as in the present, the kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta [...] Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of Count Julian, the general of the Goths.\\" Other sources, however, maintain that Ceuta represented the last Byzantine outpost in Africa and that Julian, whom the Arabs called Ilyan, was an exarch or Byzantine governor. Valdeavellano offers another possibility, that \\"as appears more likely, he may have been a Berber who was the lord and master of the Catholic tribe of Gomera.\\" In any case, being an able diplomat who was adept in Visigothic, Berber, and Arab politics, Julian might well have surrendered to Musa on terms that allowed him to retain his title and command. At this time the population of Ceuta included many refugees from a ruinous Visigothic civil war that had broken out in Hispania (modern Portugal and Spain). These included family and confederates of the late King Wittiza, Arian Christians fleeing forced conversions at the hands of the Visigothic Catholic church, and Jews. As Gibbon puts it, Musa received an unexpected message from Julian, \\"who offered his place, his person, and his sword\\" to the Muslim leader in exchange for help in the civil war. Though Julian's \\"estates were ample, his followers bold and numerous\\", he \\"had little to hope and much to fear from the new reign.\\" And he was too feeble to challenge Roderic directly. So he sought Musa's aid. For Musa, Julian, \\"by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, ... held in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy.\\" And so Musa ordered some initial raids on the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula in 710. In the spring of that same year Tariq ibn Ziyad—a Berber, a freed slave, and a Muslim general—took Tangier. Musa thereupon made him governor there, backed by an army of 6,700. The next year, 711, Musa directed Tariq to invade Hispania. Disembarking from Ceuta aboard ships provided by Julian, Tariq plunged into the Iberian Peninsula, defeated Roderic, and went on to besiege the Visigothic capital of Toledo. He and his allies also took Córdoba, Ecija, Granada, Málaga, Seville, and other cities. Due to this, the Umayyad conquest of Hispania completed the Arab conquest of North Africa. Fearing that the Byzantine Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy Roman Carthage in a scorched earth policy and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, its water supply cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbors made unusable. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to the Byzantine Empire's influence in the region. It is visible from archaeological evidence, that the town of Carthage continued to be occupied. Constantine the African was born in Carthage. The fortress of Carthage was used by the Muslims until Hafsid era and was captured by the Crusaders during the Eighth Crusade. Remnants of former Roman Carthage was used as a source to provide building materials for Kairouan and Tunis in 8th century. Indigenous Christianity after the Muslim conquest  Archaeological and scholarly research has shown that Christianity existed after the Muslim conquests. The Catholic church gradually declined along with local Latin dialect.Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten By Heinz Halm, page 99Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition By David E. Wilhite, page 332-334 Another view however that exists is that Christianity in North Africa ended soon after conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between AD 647–709 effectively. Many causes have been seen as to leading to the decline of Christianity in Maghreb. One of them is the constant wars and conquests as well as persecutions. In addition many Christians also migrated to Europe. The Church at that time lacked the backbone of a monastic tradition and was still suffering from the aftermath of heresies including the so-called Donatist heresy, and that this contributed to the early obliteration of the Church in the present day Maghreb. Some historians contrast this with the strong monastic tradition in Coptic Egypt, which is credited as a factor that allowed the Coptic Church to remain the majority faith in that country until around after the 14th century despite numerous persecutions. In addition, the Romans were unable to completely assimilate the indigenous people like the Berbers.Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition By David E. Wilhite, page 336-338The Disappearance of Christianity from North Africa in the Wake of the Rise of Islam C. J. Speel, II Church History, Vol. 29, No. 4 (December, 1960), pp. 379-397 Local Catholicism came under pressure when the Muslim fundamentalist regimes of the Almoravids and especially the Almohads came into power, and the record shows persecutions and demands made that the local Christians of Tunis to convert to Islam. We still have reports of Christian inhabitants and a bishop in the city of Kairouan around 1150 – a significant report, since this city was founded by Arab Muslims around 680 as their administrative center after their conquest. A letter from the 14th century shows that there were still four bishoprics left in North Africa, admittedly a sharp decline from the over four hundred bishoprics in existence at the time of the Arab conquest. The Almohad Abd al-Mu'min forced the Christians and Jews of Tunis to convert in 1159. Ibn Khaldun hinted at a native Christian community in 14th century in the villages of Nefzaoua, south- west of Tozeur. These paid the jizuah and had some people of Frankish descent among them. Berber Christians continued to live in Tunis and Nefzaoua in the south of Tunisia until the early 15th century, and \\"[i]n the first quarter of the fifteenth century, we even read that the native Christians of Tunis, though much assimilated, extended their church, perhaps because the last of the persecuted Christians from all over the Maghreb had gathered there.\\" Another group of Christians who came to North Africa after being deported from Islamic Spain were called the Mozarabic. They were recognised as forming the Moroccan Church by Pope Innocent IV. Another phase of Christianity in Africa began with the arrival of Portuguese in the 15th century. After the end of Reconquista, the Christian Portuguese and Spanish captured many ports in North Africa. In June 1225, Honorius III issued the bull Vineae Domini custodes that permitted two friars of the Dominican Order named Dominic and Martin to establish a mission in Morocco and look after the affairs of Christians there. The bishop of Morocco Lope Fernandez de Ain was made the head of the Church of Africa, the only church officially allowed to preach in the continent, on 19 December 1246 by Pope Innocent IV., page 103-104 Innocent IV asked emirs of Tunis, Ceuta and Bugia to permit Lope and Franciscian friars to look after the Christians in those regions. He thanked the Caliph al-Sa'id for granting protection to the Christians and requested to allow them to create fortresses along the shores, but the Caliph rejected this request., page 117-20 The bishopric of Marrakesh continued to exist until the late 16th century and was borne by the suffragans of Seville. Juan de Prado who had attempted to re- establish the mission was killed in 1631. Franciscan monasteries continued to exist in the city existed the 18th century. The growth of Christianity in the region after the French conquest was built on European settlers, and these immigrants and their descendants mostly left when the countries of the region became independent. Resistance Although the area was under control of the caliphate, there were still some sections of the population that would resist the spread of Islam. The Berber people were thought of as inferior and made to convert to Islam and join the Arab army, receiving less pay than an Arab would have. This led to much dissatisfaction and ultimately the death of Mahgreb's Arab governor, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim at the hands of one of his bodyguards after ordering them to tattoo his name on their arms to signal his ownership. Another rebellion was prompted by the enslavement of the Berbers. This occurred in southern Morocco, in 739 lasting through to 740. However, this rebellion would be suppressed by an Arab expedition, which seized both prisoners and gold in the process. One of the unifying forces of these rebellions were the teachings of Arab Kharijite missionaries who had worked as merchants. They were able to convert some sections to their way of thinking and this provided a \\"unifying discipline and revolutionary zeal that powered the Berber rebellion of 739\\" through 743.

The bobbinet/bobbinette is a type of scrim that has a hexagonal hole shape and comes in a variety of hole sizes. It is used for a number of lighting effects in the film and theatre industries. Scrim is also used in clothing, usually covering the face or head. This allows the wearer to see out, while preventing others from seeing in. This may also be combined with camouflage to completely hide a person, such as a sniper. A scrim was also an integral part of the Beijing Olympic Stadium in Beijing. It was the screen running around the top of the stadium during the opening ceremonies on which all kinds of scenes were projected. Li Ning also ran around it just before the cauldron lighting. A scrim (also called a screen) is used as an acoustically transparent covering for a loudspeaker to protect the diaphragm and dust cap, or as an air filter element to protect the voice coil and other components of the transducer. = Applications to stage lighting = Scrims both reflect and transmit light. This means that if a light from a front-of-house position is shone at a scrim, then both the scrim and everything behind it will be lit. This can lead to a variety of interesting effects: *A scrim will appear entirely opaque if everything behind it is unlit and the scrim itself is grazed by light from the sides or from above. *A scrim will appear nearly transparent if a scene behind it is lit, but there is no light on the scrim. *A dreamy or foggy look can be achieved by lighting a scene entirely behind a scrim. *If a light with a gobo is aimed at a scrim, the image will appear on the scrim, but also any objects behind the scrim will be lit by the pattern as well. In general, anything that is lit will be seen on both sides of a scrim: scrims do not absorb light. Scrim can also be used in theatre in combination with a cyclorama or backdrop. The idea is similar to the other uses. When the drop is lit (or images or video are rear-projected onto the back of the drop), the images or colours projected are visible. However, when the drop is not lit, the images or colors will disappear. A scrim can also help dull the image, creating a greater sense of depth. Another effect is caused by layering two scrims, or even by placing a mirror behind a scrim and lighting it: the familiar moire effect. This can often cause audience disorientation. Reinforcement material Shop windows in the United Kingdom extensively covered with scrim during the 1940-1941 Blitz The technique of using scrim as a reinforcement occurs commonly in the manufacture of glass-fiber or carbon-fiber composites: scrim layers may cover the exterior surface of the carbon-fiber laminate for an improved protective surface. Jute scrim can reinforce plaster in sculpture, when casting or working directly in plaster. A similar usage of the term is found in sailcloth manufacture, where scrim is a strong loose weave of fibres laminated into the cloth to provide extra strength and stability to sails. In carpentry, scrim is a very heavy, coarsely-woven fabric (similar to hessian or to coarse canvas) which is stretched over interior boards to provide support for wallpaper and to add an extra rigidity. This method of construction, widely used in older houses, is often referred to as \\"scrim and sarking\\", the sarking being the board. Scrim is also an item that utilizes plies of tissue reinforced with a layer of nylon (much like fishing line or heavy duty monofilament) or cotton thread. 2-ply tissue 1-ply scrim the layer of scrim is not counted in the ply count. 2/1 would be a 2-ply scrim. Scrim is a glass fibre (previously burlap) open-mesh tape used to cover joints in plasterboard/wall board prior to plastering. It prevents a crack appearing in the plaster finish at a later date. The roll of tape may be plain or adhesive-coated to facilitate its installation. Scrim was handed out during World War II to tape windows, so that they should not cause hazardous shrapnel in case of bomb blasts.

The oldest part of Ísafjörður with the town centre is located on a spit of sand, or eyri, in Skutulsfjörður, a fjord which meets the waters of the larger fjord Ísafjarðardjúp. With a population of about 2,600, Ísafjörður is the largest settlement in the peninsula of Vestfirðir (Westfjords) and the administration centre of the Ísafjarðarbær municipality, which includes – besides Ísafjörður – the nearby villages of Hnífsdalur, Flateyri, Suðureyri, and Þingeyri. History Ísafjörður harbour According to the Landnámabók (the book of settlement), Skutulsfjördur was first settled by Helgi Magri Hrólfsson in the 9th century. In the 16th century, the town grew as it became a trading post for foreign merchants. Witch trials were common around the same time throughout the Westfjords, and many people were banished to the nearby peninsula of Hornstrandir, now a national nature reserve. The town of Ísafjörður was granted municipal status in 1786. The former Danish trading post Neðstikaupstaður, established in the 18th century, contains the oldest collection of timber frame houses in Iceland. These include Krambúð (1757), Faktorshús (1765), Tjöruhúsið (1781), and the site of the Westfjords Heritage Museum Turnhúsið (1784). Geography and climate The Westfjords are known to be the coolest area in Iceland at sea level. Ísafjörður has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification: ET), closely bordering on either a dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc) or a cold-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csc), depending on if you use the 0 °C isotherm or the -3 °C isotherm. The climate is characterised by cold winters and cool summers. The warmest month is July with the mean temperature of ; the wettest is November with of precipitation. The climate has significantly warmed in recent years due to the effects of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. As the rest of Iceland, Ísafjörður experiences high winds and very few clear days throughout all the year. Overview Town centre Hafnarstræti The town is connected by road and a road tunnel to Bolungarvík which lies to the northwest, and to the village of Súðavík to the east. The partly one-lane Vestfjarðagöng (Vestfirðir Tunnel), completed in 1996, leads to the towns of Flateyri and Suðureyri, and to the western parts of the Westfjords. Ísafjörður has an airport with regular flights to Reykjavík. Fishing has been the main industry in Ísafjörður, and the town has one of the largest fisheries in Iceland. A severe decline in the fishing industry for a variety of reasons, such as fishing restrictions in the early 1980s, and a decline in the fish population, has led the inhabitants to seek work elsewhere, leading to a decline in the town's population. The harbor also serves ferries to nearby settlements as well as larger cruise ships for tourists visiting the area. The tourist industry is growing; it is a major access point to the nature reserve on the Hornstrandir Peninsula, an uninhabited wilderness area to which ferries run weekly during summer. Despite its size, small population, and historical isolation from the rest of the country, the town has a relatively urban atmosphere. Ísafjörður has a school of music, as well as a hospital. The older former hospital building now accommodates a cultural center with a library and showrooms. Recently, the small town has become known in the country as a center for alternative music outside of Iceland. A yearly festival, Aldrei fór ég suður, provides a platform for local musicians and bands from around Iceland and even from overseas. A university center, Háskólasetur Vestfjarða, which acts as a distance learning center for the 7000 residents of the Westfjords, was established in March 2005. Education Ísafjörður is the home to the University Centre of the Westfjords. The University Centre offers three master's degree programs. One in Coastal & Marine Management, one in Coastal Communities and Regional Development and another in Marine Innovation. Students graduate from the University of Akureyri. The only gymnasium located in the Westfjords, Menntaskólinn á Ísafirði, is in Ísafjörður. The students range from 16 to 20 years of age, as is traditional in Icelandic gymnasium. Business Major employers in the region include Hraðfrystihúsið-Gunnvör, 3X technology, Klofningur, and Íslandssaga. Ísafjörður is also the base of several noteworthy start-up companies including Fossadalur and Kerecis. Culture right The town hosts varied and widely popular events, in the realms of both culture and outdoor recreation. These events include, but are not limited to: *The Ski Week Festival *Aldrei fór ég suður music festival *Fossavatn Ski Marathon *European Swampsoccer Championships *Act Alone – a theatre festival dedicated to the art of acting alone, monodrama, held in August every year *Westfjords Heritage Museum =Annual music festivals= Aldrei fór ég suður – Ísafjörður Rock Festival In 2002, Ísafjörður's own Mugison (a.k.a. Örn Elías Guðmundsson) and his father organized the first Aldrei fór ég suður Music Festival as a free concert to support the burgeoning music community in Ísafjörður. The event has been established as an annual festival in mid April. The name Aldrei fór ég suður (I never went south) is taken from a Bubbi Morthens song of the same name, and may refer to a movement among young Icelanders to establish cultural events outside Reykjavík, and draw attention back to the nation's roots in the countryside. The festival's subtitle is \\"rokkhátið alþýðunnar\\" or \\"rock festival for the people.\\" Við Djúpið Music Festival From 2001 through 2014, the Við Djúpið Music Festival offered master classes and concerts with nationwide and worldwide known artists, such as Erling Blöndal Bengtsson, cellist and Vovka Ashkenazy, pianist as well as the Pacifica Quartet, Evan Ziporyn, clarinetist, composer, and a member of the band Bang on a Can gave a master class and concert in Ísafjörður during Við Djúpið 2007 and among performers at the 2008 festival where Pekka Kuusisto, violinist with Simon Crawford-Phillips, pianist and Håkon Austbø, pianist.

The founding mainstays are Glenn Bennie (guitar, vocals) and Vincent Giarrusso (vocals, guitar, keyboard) who had formed the group as GBVG, in 1988. By May 1990 the duo were renamed as Underground Lovers and joined by Richard Andrew (drums), Maurice Argiro (bass guitar) and Philippa Nihill (vocals, guitar and keyboard). History Underground Lovers' founding mainstays Glenn Bennie and Vincent Giarrusso met in a Melbourne suburban high school during the 1970s. Both were influenced by Joy Division, New Order, the Cure and the local underground electronic and experimental scene. By 1988 they formed a music duo, GBVG, while studying drama at university. They released a single, \\"Blast\\", in that year. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, opined that \\"Glenn's striking hypnotic guitar atmospheres balanced against Vince's acute pop sense.\\" Bennie on guitar and vocals and Giarrusso on vocals, guitar and keyboards formed a pop music group, Underground Lovers, sometimes stylised as undergroundLOVERS, in late 1989 in Melbourne. The name is from an Italian surrealist play. Their first gig, in May 1990, was at the Corner Hotel, Richmond, supporting the Macguffins. The line-up was Bennie, Giarrusso, Richard Andrew on drums, Stephen Downes on bass guitar and Philippa Nihill on vocals, guitar and keyboard; Maurice Argiro (ex- No Nonsense) replaced Downes on bass guitar after that first show. Their first manager Craig Kamber was instrumental in developing and establishing their career, and securing sought after support slots with profile local and international artists in Australia and overseas - such as The Cure, Ride, Lush, My Bloody Valentine and many others. The members of Underground Lovers funded their self-titled debut album, with Simon Grounds producing; it was released via Shock Records in March 1991. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described its sonation, \\"melancholy guitar pop ('Girl Afraid', 'Wasted'), rhythmic dance pop ('Yes I Do', 'Round and Round') and reflective, acoustic folk ('My American Accent').\\" The first two singles from the album were, \\"Round and Round\\" (February) and \\"Looking for Rain\\" (April). In November they issued a non-album single, \\"Lick the Boot\\", which was their first United Kingdom single. When the album appeared in the UK and United States markets it was re-titled, Get to Notice, after its opening track. For the international version, \\"Lick the Boot\\", replaced an album track, \\"Ascend Up\\", from the Australian version. By year's end a four-track extended play, Nice, appeared, in addition to \\"Ripe\\" on rooArt's Youngblood 3 various artists' compilation album. Beat magazine selected Nice as single of the week, describing it as \\"pop rich in all the right ingredients\\" and \\"awesome\\". Bevan Hannan of The Canberra Times felt that \\"Nice G.I.\\" was the \\"outstanding cut from their last EP\\" which dealt with \\"the early stages of the Gulf War about the commandos orchestrating the bombing of Iraq.\\" Hannan also praised \\"Ripe\\" as \\"by far the best\\" track on Youngblood 3. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 in March the group won Best New Artist for Underground Lovers; it was also nominated for Best Independent Release. In January 1992 they entered the studio where Bennie and Giarrusso co-produced their second album, Leaves Me Blind with Wayne Connolly (of the Welcome Mat). It was a more layered and experimental work. The album came out first in the UK, in August, through the short-lived 4AD imprint, Guernica. By that stage Polydor had signed the group in Australia, and released Leaves Me Blind locally, in December. Mathieson described how \\"they were so far ahead of their contemporaries that they passed over the horizon, borne on a rolling sea of sound that would become their signature.\\" Underground Lovers supported the Cure (in August 1992) and My Bloody Valentine on their respective Australian tours of that year. The album provided three singles, \\"Ladies Choice\\" (August) \\"I Was Right\\" (November) and \\"Your Eyes\\" (August 1993). Mathieson found that the latter track was a \\"telling example of their refusal to be contained... The focus is on the bedroom, one person looking into the eyes of another, as the bassline dips and rises like a heart beginning to race with excitement.\\" Following a tour of the UK and North America for the first half of 1993, the Underground Lovers enlisted Melburnian electronic producers David Chesworth and Robert Goodge (both ex-Essendon Airport) for their third album, Dream It Down (June 1994). McFarlane noticed that it was \\"lush and atmospheric.\\" It reached the top 60 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Ahead of the album, Richard Andrew was replaced on drums by Derek Yuen. Dream It Down provided two singles, \\"Las Vegas\\" (May 1994) and \\"Losin' It\\" (August). The latter received high rotation on national youth radio, Triple J, it reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 100 and was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1994 at No. 19. The band quit Polydor in 1995 and, in a quest for more artistic freedom, set up their own Mainstream label (in conjunction with the big-league indie, Rubber Records). Also produced by Wayne Connolly, Rushall Station, which came out in April 1996, was their most 'bare bones' recording since their debut. Philippa Nihill left the band during the recording of the album (though she recorded vocals for two tracks). The band subsequently received a nomination for Best Independent Release at the 1997 ARIA Awards. Also in 1997 Giarusso and Bennie put out the debut album by their experimental side-project GBVG, titled Whitey Trickstar, in addition to the fifth Underground Lovers album Ways T'Burn. The latter saw a move towards more electronic territory. Drummer Derek Yuen departed the band during the \\"Ways T'Burn\\" recording sessions, Autohaze drummer Andrew Nunns filled the drum stool for future touring and recording duties. Giarrusso and Bennie maintained a low profile for much of 1998, though they did release another GBVG project - a cover of Can's \\"I Want More\\". The vocals were credited to a made-up Japanese chanteuse named Mitsuame, who in reality was Triple J and Recovery co-host Jane Gazzo. Maurice Argiro left the band at the end of 1998. Emma Bortignon came on board as bass player and the Underground lovers readied their sixth album Cold Feeling. Cold Feeling was the Underground Lovers' most electronic- influenced album to date. It also featured minor contributions from The Paradise Motel's Mérida Sussex, and ex-Triffids pedal steel guitarist Graham Lee, among other Melburnian indie musicians. The title track received considerable airplay on Triple J. Following Cold Feeling, Giarrusso concentrated mainly on finalising his feature film debut Mallboy, which he wrote and directed, and starred Kane McNay of SeaChange fame. Inspired by Giarrusso's work as a social worker, the film focused on a troubled youth and his dysfunctional lifestyle in Melbourne's northern suburbs. The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival where it was selected for the highly prestigious Director's Fortnight (at the time only the fifth Australian film to have been selected). It later premiered in Australia at the 2001 Melbourne International Film Festival as closing night film and had a limited release in cinemas soon after (through Buena Vista International). McNay won an AFI Award (Best Actor) for his performance. Giarrusso and Bennie composed and recorded the score for Mallboy, which came out as the unofficial seventh Underground Lovers album in 2001. Further live activity was undertaken that year, to preview newer material - none of which has been recorded or released. Underground Lovers played shows supporting New Order during their Australian tour in January 2002 before taking an extended break. It was announced in July 2009 that the \\"classic\\" early 1990s lineup of Underground Lovers would reform for an appearance at the Homebake Festival in Sydney on 5 December. In conjunction with the reunion, Rubber Records re-released Underground Lovers' 1990 self-titled album and post-1996 output digitally on iTunes that November. A 'secret' warm-up show was performed on 1 November at Melbourne's The Toff In Town. Well-received club shows in Sydney and Melbourne were also performed in December. In October 2010, Mathieson and fellow music writers and critics John O'Donnell and Toby Creswell listed Leaves Me Blind as the 54th greatest Australian album in their book, 100 Best Australian Albums. The band supported Primal Scream for their Melbourne shows in February 2011 and also supported Mark Gardener (formerly of Ride) on his Australian tour in 2012. Underground Lovers seventh album, Weekend was released in April 2013. It features the energetic rock stylings and elements of electronica that are now a signature of the band. ‘Weekend’ was created with longtime collaborators Wayne Connolly (recording engineer) Tim Whitten (mix engineer ), Don Bartley ( mastering) and a new addition to the production crew, Tim Prince (recording engineer). Related projects Glenn Bennie has an ongoing solo project named GB3. Rubber Records released the first GB3 album Circlework in October 2003, which was a collaboration with Philippa Nihill. The second GB3 album Emptiness Is Our Business was issued in August 2006. The collaborators on the album were Sarah Blasko, Steve Kilbey, Philippa Nihill, Grant McLennan of the Go Betweens, ex-Frente! vocalist Angie Hart, Sianna Lee from Love Outside Andromeda, Stephen Cummings, and Adalita from Magic Dirt amongst others. A third GB3 album, Damaged/Controlled, released in 2010, was largely co-written and recorded with Steve Kilbey. Philippa Nihill provided vocals for the track \\"Nectarine\\", which was also accompanied by an animated video created by Maurice Argiro. Throughout the 2000s, Giarrusso started developing a number of film and music projects with funding from private and government bodies including Godless, a feature film that was originally slated for production in 2007. That year he also re-emerged under the moniker Mist and Sea - predominantly a recording project in collaboration with Jason Sweeney and Cailan Burns of Pretty Boy Crossover. Their first album Unless was released by Popfrenzy Records in July 2007.\\"Mist & Sea: Sprawling Sounds\\" in Mess+Noise, September, 2007. Giarrusso also performed live around that time with a new band called Raining Ropes, featuring former members of Bergerac and The Paradise Motel. However, these projects have since remained dormant. In 2009 Giarrusso performed a couple of shows in Melbourne as Underground Lovers In LA, backed by bassist Todd Hutchinson (Tim Steward Band), as well as cellist/keyboardist Zoe Barry, guitarist Jed Palmer and drummer Steve Griffiths from the Hope Diamond. Both sets consisted of a selection of Underground Lovers songs. After officially leaving Underground Lovers in 1996, Philippa Nihill released the Dead Sad EP in November 1996, a full-length album A Little Easy in 2000. She also collaborated with Australian singer and film maker Paula Kehoe on the Saoi CD This Drowning Is Dreaming in December 2006.

Leeway joined Thompson Twins in 1981 after being one of their roadies. He was born to an Irish mother and Nigerian father, but was fostered to an English family in Dartford, Kent, from the age of two. At college he took English and Drama, then he began teaching English, which was how he met Tom Bailey. He joined a theatre group in Cardiff after failing to establish his own company. He spent a year with the Young Vic theatre before joining Thompson Twins as a roadie at Tom Bailey's invitation.  Thompson Twins  Playing bongos and congas, he appeared on the Thompson Twins debut record album, A Product of .... By the time the band recorded their second album Set in 1982, Leeway had begun contributing to the songwriting process, and he wrote a pair of songs for the album completely on his own and sang lead on three tracks. At that time in 1982, Thompson Twins underwent a radical change in line-up. Previously an ever-changing lineup of musicians that featured seven members at the time of Set, band leader Tom Bailey reduced the band to a trio by firing everybody except Alannah Currie and Leeway. Leeway's main role in the new trio was to assist in writing the songs, contribute background vocals and design the band's stage shows. Leeway's background in theatre made him an obvious and well-suited choice for the latter, and the live shows of the band always met with success and critical acclaim. Thompson Twins enjoyed at least three solid years of worldwide commercial success, beginning with the 1983 album Quick Step and Side Kick (released in the United States as simply Side Kicks) followed by Into the Gap, which garnered critical acclaim and lucrative international sales, and Here's To Future Days. After these three albums, their contract with Arista Records was up for renewal and after the extensive world tour following the release of the album, Leeway chose to leave the band for a number of personal reasons, mostly due to difficulties with the group's management. However, the split from the rest of the trio was amicable.  Solo Work and career change  After leaving the band, Leeway dabbled in solo work. He recorded a demo tape of original material, but ultimately an album never materialised. He appeared in the 1989 James Ivory film Slaves of New York as musician Johnny Jalouse. Leeway's part in the film was originally a prominent supporting character, but this was changed when most of his scenes were cut. The actress that Leeway had filmed most of his scenes with was fired from the film and their scenes together were cut. Leeway can still be seen in the film singing one of his original songs, \\"Mother Dearest\\", in the night club scene, (not in the soundtrack album). The experience with Slaves of New York seemed to stall Leeway's career as an actor permanently, but he continued to work in sound design for films as well as commercials for Nike and Pepsi. , Leeway resides in Los Angeles, California, and works in the field of hypnotherapy. He is on the staff at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute (HMI) in Tarzana, California and is also a certified trainer in neuro-linguistic programming.

Built between 1884 and 1914, it was dedicated on , and became the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince. The cathedral was destroyed in the 12 January 2010 earthquake. Before its destruction, the cupola of the north tower of the Cathedral served as the front lighthouse of a pair guiding mariners into Port-au-Prince harbor. Destruction The roof and the towers flanking the main entrance collapsed in the 12 January 2010 earthquake, although the lower parts of the walls remain standing. The earthquake also destroyed the nunciature and the archdiocesan offices, killing Archbishop Joseph Serge Miot instantly and Vicar General Charles Benoit later.

Reconstruction In March 2012, the Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince, in collaboration with Faith & Form magazine and the Institute for the Safeguarding of National Heritage (ISPAN), a Haitian-government institution, launched an international design competition inviting the architects from all over the world to submit ideas that would inform the reconstruction of the cathedral. Puerto Rican architect Segundo Cardona, FAIA from SCF Architects won the competition. He proposed to integrate and frame the facade of the old building, which survived the earthquake, with two new concrete towers, while the old nave, whose pillars also partially survived, will be transformed into a covered courtyard. The religious ceremonies will take place at the level of the current transept under a vast room surmounted by a dome, underneath which will be the altar. The new design allows for a capacity of 1,200 faithful (capacity which can be raised to 600 additional persons thanks to the use of the covered yard). The interior of the new cathedral will be marked by the creative and abundant use of natural light, as the supply of electricity in Port-au-Prince is intermittent and expensive. \\"The winning design — [is] a modern interpretation of the traditional architecture of a cathedral [...]. Cardona’s other significant works include the Coliseum of San Juan and the Puerto Rico Pavilion built for the 1992 World Expo in Seville, Spain.\\" In 2020 the building is still in ruins.

It covers about and includes rocket launch sites at the Kwajalein Atoll (on multiple islands), Wake Island, and Aur Atoll. It primarily functions as a test facility for U.S. missile defense and space research programs. The Reagan Test Site is under the command of the US Army Kwajalein Atoll, or USAKA (pronounced ).  Purpose and facilities  The facility is part of the Defense Major Range and Test Facility Base. They provide range instrumentation, missile launch facilities, mission control center, range safety, meteorological support, and support space operations. , the facility's budget was US$182 million. The site hosts a suite of unique instrumentation, located on eight islands throughout the Kwajalein Atoll. This instrumentation includes a comprehensive suite of precision metric and signature radars, optical sensors, telemetry receiving stations, and impact scoring assets. RTS provides both mobile and fixed ground and flight safety instrumentation. The Pentagon lease for the islands of the Kwajalein Atoll extends through 2066. Equipment installed at the test site includes various tracking radars, stationary and mobile telemetry, optical recording equipment and a secure fiberoptic data network via the HANTRU-1 undersea cable. The Reagan Test Site also serves as a tracking station for manned space flight and NASA research projects. Launch activities at the test site include ballistic missile tests, ABM interception tests, and meteorological sounding rockets. The Kwajalein Atoll used to host a commercial spaceport for SpaceX at Omelek Island.  Population  There are about 2,500 permanent residents of Kwajalein, including 1,200 employees of Bechtel and Lockheed Martin's Kwajalein Range Services and more than 800 dependents. The Bechtel employees are located on 11 sites spread across and seven time zones. The civilian jobs on the facility are managed under contract by Bechtel. Depending on the job, some positions are unaccompanied. Vehicles are not permitted. Workers on the facility may qualify for tax-exempt status in the United States. The Americans are supported by about 900 Marshallese workers who take a ferry from Ebeye Island to the base. Bechtel provides a wide variety of support services to the Department of Defense and military personnel and their families. These include dining operations, public utilities, medical and dental care, transportation, firefighting, recreational activities, youth and education services, retail, religious services, and newspaper, radio, and TV access. A Catholic and a Presbyterian chaplain are employed by Bechtel. There are also religious services available for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Location  The mission control center, along with most of the personnel and infrastructure, is located at the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Eleven of the atoll's islands are operated by the U.S. military under a long term lease (through 2066) with the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Climate threat  According to a report commissioned by the Department of Defense, the site is expected to be entirely submerged by seawater at least once annually by 2035.

He was a specialist on the flies, Diptera. He is remembered for Williston's law, which states that parts in an organism, such as arthropod limbs, become reduced in number and specialized in function through evolutionary history. Early life Williston in 1891 Williston was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Samuel Williston and Jane A. Williston née Turner. As a young child, Williston's family travelled to Kansas Territory in 1857 under the auspices of the New England Emigrant Aid Company to help fight the extension of slavery. He was raised in Manhattan, Kansas, attended public high school there, and graduated from Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in 1872, afterwards receiving a Magister Artium from that institution.Blackmar 1912. In 1874, he went on his first field fossil hunting expedition for Othniel Charles Marsh at Yale University under the mentorship of Benjamin Franklin Mudge, and led his first expedition in 1877.Williston 1898. With Mudge, Williston discovered the first fossils of the dinosaurs Allosaurus and Diplodocus. He was noted for painstakingly illustrating the finds. In 1880, he matriculated to Yale University, for several years was a post-graduate student and faculty member. Around this time, he proposed the first explicit model for the terrestrial origin of bird flight (i.e., that dinosaurs developed flight by running along the ground rather than jumping from trees). Williston returned to Kansas in 1890, to take a position on the faculty at the University of Kansas as a professor of geology and anatomy. In 1899, he was named the first Dean of the new School of Medicine there. He was also a member of the state boards of health and medical examiners. In 1902, Williston left Kansas again, and took the chair of paleontology at the University of Chicago. Williston was a fellow of the Geological Society of America and foreign correspondent for the London Geological and Zoölogical societies. He was president of the Kansas Academy of Science, and in 1903 became president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. He was the author of several books, and the Smithsonian Institution now administers an endowment fund in his name. Work on Diptera Although never employed as a professional entomologist, Samuel W. Williston was a Fellow of the Entomological Society of America since 1915, and was well- renowned specialist on the taxonomy and systematics of flies (Diptera). He became the first North American specialist on this group, publishing over 50 books and papers, and naming more than 1250 species. His best-known works were the three editions of the Manual of North American Diptera (1888, 1896, 1908).Beckemeyer 2009. Williston's law Williston noticed that, over evolutionary time, the modular and serially repeated parts distinguishing animal groups exhibited trends in numbers and types. For instance, ancient vertebrates were characterized by mouths that contained mostly similar teeth, whereas recent vertebrates are characterized by mouths with different kinds of teeth, adapted for biting, tearing, and compacting food; differences ultimately characterized different diets, with carnivores bearing incisors, canines and carnassials, and grazers bearing mostly molars. In 1914, Williston declared that \\"it is also a law in evolution that the parts in an organism tend toward reduction in number, with the fewer parts greatly specialized in function\\". However, empirical studies have not always confirmed this generalization. For instance, a study of the evolution in the number of branchiostegal rays in osteichthyans has failed to support a generalized trend towards reduction. Instead, this series of elements shows an early burst pattern (rapid evolution early in the history of the group, followed by a decrease in evolutionary rate).

Since 1 June 2010 he has been the President of the Provisional Government of Kabylia, a government in exile that the movement set up in France. He has been a Laureate of the Gusi Peace Prize since 23 July 2013. In 2012, Mehenni assumed a controversial position by visiting Israel where he voiced his support for and solidarity with Israel, comparing it to Kabylia: \\"We are in a hostile environment. Both countries share kind of the same path, but Israel already exists – that’s the only difference.\\" Activism Mehenni was born on 5 March 1951 in Illoula Oumalou, Tizi Ouzou Province, Algeria. Having graduated from the University of Algiers with a degree in political science, Mehenni made his first steps into the world of music in 1973 by winning the Algiers Modern Music Festival's first prize. It was soon after this success that he began his career as a protest singer and political activist. He was notably hostile towards the Algerian government and extremists; this led to him being arrested 13 times, imprisoned for three years, and tortured by government forces. After the Black Spring massacre in Kabylie triggered by the Algerian army killing of a young Kablye man, Massinissa Guermah in detention, he, first, established the MAK, Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylia, a political movement calling for the political autonomy in Kabylia. In 2015, the MAK movement passed over from the large autonomy claim to Self-determinationhttps://www.makabylie.org/. The assassination of his eldest son (Améziane Mehenni) in 2004 is regarded by some as a punishment to his fight for autonomy. Though others suspect it was a case of mistaken identity and that Ferhat was the real target.

Merchant houses were backed by relatively small private financiers acting as intermediaries between simple commodity producers and by exchanging debt with each other. Thus, merchant capitalism preceded the capitalist mode of production as a form of capital accumulation. A process of primitive accumulation of capital, upon which commercial finance operations could be based and making application of mass wage labor and industrialization possible, was the necessary precondition for the transformation of merchant capitalism into industrial capitalism. Early forms of merchant capitalism developed in the 9th century, during the Islamic Golden Age, while in medieval Europe from the 12th century.Jairus Banaji (2007), \\"Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism\\", Journal Historical Materialism 15 (1), pp. 47–74, Brill Publishers.Maya Shatzmiller (1994), Labor in the Medieval Islamic World, pp. 402–03, Brill Publishers, .Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \\"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\\", The Journal of Economic History 29 (1), pp. 79–96. In Europe, merchant capitalism became a significant economic force in the 16th century. The mercantile era drew to a close around 1800, giving way to industrial capitalism. However, merchant capitalism remained entrenched in some parts of the West well into the 19th century, notably the Southern United States, where the plantation system constrained the development of industrial capitalism (limiting markets for consumer goods) whose political manifestations prevented Northern legislators from passing broad economic packages (e.g. monetary and banking reform, a transcontinental railroad, and incentives for settlement of the American west) to integrate the states' economies and spur the growth of industrial capitalism.Headlee, S.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms of inflammatory arthritis include stiffness, pain, and swelling of the joints, restricted motions, and reduced physical strength. Other symptoms may include systemic complaints including fatigue. Management Treatments for inflammatory arthritis vary by subtype, though they may include drugs like DMARDs (disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Prognosis Inflammatory arthritis can be disabling to the point where people with the diseases can lose their jobs, which can cause psychological distress. Because it is typically progressive, those who lose their jobs are unlikely to re-enter the workforce after leaving due to their diagnosis. Programs now aim to retain those with inflammatory arthritis by preventing work-related injuries and by making necessary accommodations in the workplace. A 2014 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence that work focused interventions, including counseling, education, advocacy, and occupational medicine consultations, were effective in retaining workers with inflammatory arthritis. Epidemiology The worldwide prevalence of inflammatory arthritis is approximately 3%. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis are the most common subtypes of inflammatory arthritis. The diseases occur most commonly in the 30-40 age group.  References  Arthritis ","title":"Inflammatory arthritis"},{"id":"2980052","text":"Pilot #5 (a.k.a. Destination Tokyo, Skyway to Glory, and The Story of Number Five) is a 1943 black-and-white World War Two propaganda film from Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, produced by B.P. Fineman, directed by George Sidney, that stars Franchot Tone, Marsha Hunt, Gene Kelly, and Van Johnson. Pilot #5 marked Gene Kelly's dramatic film debut. Plot In May 1942, an Allied base on Java is bombed by Japanese aircraft, with another attack expected the next day. With only one working fighter and five American pilots who all volunteer to fly it, Dutch commander Major Eichel (Steven Geray) chooses George Collins (Franchot Tone) because he has come up with a daring plan: attach a bomb rack to the fighter to bomb the Japanese aircraft carrier from which the attack came. After George takes off, Eichel asks the other pilots to tell him about George. Flashbacks stories of his civilian life before the war are interleaved with radio broadcasts from George. Four years earlier, George is working his way through law school and is at the top of his class. He takes Freddie Andrews (Marsha Hunt) to an empty lot in the country, where he proposes and tells her that he has bought the land to build their home. She accepts. At first, they are happy, but then his friend and fellow lawyer Vito S. Alessandro (Gene Kelly) invites him to join his law firm after graduation. Vito's firm works for corrupt state governor Hank Durban. Despite Freddie's concerns, George takes the job. He ends up evicting poor farmers to make way for an irrigation project which will mostly benefit Durban and his cronies. Meanwhile, Vito's brother Nikola arrives from Italy. A member of the resistance to Benito Mussolini's regime, he had been imprisoned, but finally managed to escape. When he sees a portrait of the Italian dictator hanging in Vito's office, he becomes enraged and tears it down. The prison ordeal has taken its toll on Nikola's health, and he commits suicide. Freddie finally divorces George because, while she still loves him, she does not like him anymore. Eventually, George becomes sickened when a mentally disabled girl dies accidentally during the eviction of her family. He provides information that brings about the downfall of Governor Durban, but the residents of his town ostracize him, unaware of his pivotal role in the downfall. Freddie, however, knows that he has redeemed himself, and they get back together. Back in the present, George locates the Japanese carrier and dives on it, but the 500-pound bomb fails to release properly. After shooting down a couple of enemy fighters, George makes a fateful decision and deliberately crashes his fighter into the carrier. The explosion rocks the ship and fires spread rapidly. The carrier's battle ensign, now afire, is the last thing seen as it slips beneath the waves. Cast * Franchot Tone as George Braynor Collins * Marsha Hunt as Freddie Andrews * Gene Kelly as Vito S.

Henry, Lord Clifford inherited his father's title in 1641, whereupon he sat in the House of Lords as Earl of Cumberland until his death in 1643.

History The game originated in the 18th century. It is still popular in the Channel Islands and Bermuda, but is strictly controlled and may be played legally only on certain occasions, such as the Channel Islands' agricultural shows or annual Liberation Day celebrations The Gambling (Crown and Anchor) (Guernsey) Ordinance 1983 States of Jersey Crown and Anchor Policy Statement or Bermuda's annual Cup Match cricket game. Three special dice are used in Crown and Anchor. The dice are equal in size and shape to standard dice, but instead of one through six pips, they are marked with six symbols: crown, anchor, diamond, spade, club and heart. (The last four are the same symbols used on playing cards.) Rules of play Crown and Anchor playing mat and dice The game is played between a player and a banker. A canvas or felt mat marked with the six symbols is used for play. The player places bets on one or more symbols. He then throws the three dice. If there is a bet on any symbol which comes up on one or more of the dice, in addition to returning the stake the banker pays the player the amount of his stake for each die showing that symbol: even money if one, 2:1 if two, and 3:1 if three. If the symbol doesn't come up, the player loses his bet. The expected return of a $1 wager on a particular symbol is calculated as follows: * The chance of the symbol coming up on none of the dice is 5/6 × 5/6 × 5/6, which is 125/216. The player loses $1 in this case. * The chance of the symbol coming up on all three dice is 1/6 × 1/6 × 1/6, which is 1/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $3 more. * The chance of the symbol coming up on two of three dice is C(3,1) x 1/6 × 1/6 × 5/6, which is 15/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $2 more. * The chance of the symbol coming up on one of three dice is C(3,1) × 1/6 × 5/6 × 5/6, which is 75/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $1 more. In total, the expected return of a $1 wager is ((+$3 × 1) + (+$2 × 15) + (+$1 × 75) + (-$1 × 125))/216, or ($3 + $30 + $75 - $125)/216, which is (-$17)/216 ≈ -$0.078704. Put another way, for every $1.00 wagered, a player can expect to receive back $0.921296. Thus, the banker has a substantial edge. In a game at a festival or casino, the house will be banker. In a game among friends, each person serves as banker in turn. Variations A similar version of the game is played in Nepal, called \\"Langur Burja\\" (). There is a similar Flemish version called Anker en Zon (\\"Anchor and Sun\\"), in which a sun symbol replaces the crown. The French version again uses the sun, and is called Ancre, Pique, et Soleil (\\"Anchor, Spade, and Sun\\"). A similar game played in China called Hoo Hey How (, Fish-Prawn-Crab in Hokkien) and Vietnam called or Bầu cua cá cọp.The Gamer 1981 p17 \\"In Britain, the game is Crown and Anchor and is played with dice spotted (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Crown and Anchor).

He is apparently the first artist to use drypoint, a form of engraving, for all of his prints (other than woodcuts he may have designed). The first name derives from his book of drawings with watercolour, called the Housebook, which belonged to the German noble family of Waldburg-Wolfegg from the 17th century until 2008, when they were reported to have sold it for €20 million to a Swiss buyer;Wikinews story. Full story in German however, the legality of its sale for export has been challenged and, for the moment, it remains with the family.

Most, but not all, art historians still agree that the Housebook and the prints are by the same artist.Timothy Husband,\\"The Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet\\"Burlington Magazine, Vol. 127, No. 987 (Jun., 1985), pp. 348+401-405  Work  His ninety-one prints are extremely rare, with sixty surviving in one impression (copy) only, and none in more than five - there are a total of 124 impressions, 80 in Amsterdam.Filedt Kok, 91 It is thought that because his prints were made using only the shallow, scratched line of drypoint, probably on tin or a pewter-type alloy, only ten to twenty impressions of each could be taken before the plate wore out.Parshall, 5 and 23 Many engravings by other artists are believed to be copies of missing works by this master. In particular, Israhel van Meckenem seems to have copied more than thirty. His work is very well drawn and lively, with the interest in detail typical of Early Netherlandish painting. Arthur Mayger Hind notes of his style that \\"he is an artist with a freedom of draughtsmanship quite remarkable at this epoch. If his manner of engraving has something of the irregularity of an amateur, his power of expression is vigorous and masterly.\\" A high proportion depicts secular subjects, more than is typical with artists of the period. Along with his contemporary Martin Schongauer, the Housebook Master was the leading artist making old master prints in Germany in his period. Both Schongauer and the Housebook Master had a considerable influence on the prints of Albrecht Dürer.Parshall, 311 The Master suggests Netherlandish influence in the modelling of light and shade and in some of his figural types. A small number of paintings are also thought to be his work, notably the Pair of Lovers in Gotha, the Speyer Altarpiece (divided among Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, the Städel, Frankfurt, and Augustiner Museum Freiburg, and the Holy Family (Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, since 2004). However, many scholars feel the Gotha Lovers and the Speyer Altarpiece cannot be by the same artist, and favour attributing only the Lovers to the Housebook Master. Others disagree, and attribute the engravings and the altarpiece to the same master.Bodo Brinkmann and Stephan Kemperdick, \\"Deutsche Gemälde im Städel 1300-1500\\". Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 2002. Erhard Reuwich? It was first suggested in 1936 that he should be identified as Erhard Reuwich of Utrecht, an artist and (or) printer working in Mainz, who designed and signed an influential woodcut panoramic view of Venice made following a visit in 1483 or 1484 during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.Ernstotto Graf zu Solms-Laubach, Der Hausbuchmeister, in: Städel-Jahrbuch IX (1935/36), pp. 13 – 96. Reuwich printed the account in Latin of the trip, the Sanctae Peregrinationes by Bernhard von Breydenbach of 1486, in which the woodcut was the first ever fold-out plate. The design was later adapted by Michael Wolgemut for the Nuremberg Chronicle. Reuwich was taken as an artist in the entourage of Breydenbach, a wealthy canon of Mainz Cathedral. The book also contained panoramas of six other cities, including Jerusalem, studies of Near Eastern costume, and an exotic alphabet - the first in print. It was a bestseller, reprinted thirteen times over the next three decades, including editions printed in France and Spain, for which the illustration blocks were shipped out to the local printers. Lover's Garden, drawing from the \\"Housebook\\" In 1485 Reuwich drew some plants for the woodcuts in a herbal also published in Mainz. His identification with the Housebook Master has not been generally accepted, though A. Hyatt Mayor supported it; other suggestions have also been made.A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 43.

This position has historically been referred to as Anglican Papalism; the term Anglo- Papalism is an American neologism and it seems not to have appeared in print prior to the 1990s. Anglican Papalists have suggested \\"that the only way to convert England is by means of an 'English Uniate' rite.\\" Anglican Papalists have historically practiced praying the Dominican rosary, among other Marian devotions, Corpus Christi procession, as well as the reservation of and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. Origins The origins of \\"Anglican- Papalism\\", as it was then termed, lie in the writings of Spencer Jones, Vicar of Moreton-in-Marsh, and Lewis T. Wattson, an American who became an Anglican Franciscan friar. Both men were active around the turn of the twentieth century. Later adherents of the tradition include Henry Fynes-Clinton, Dom Gregory Dix and Hugh Ross Williamson. Some Anglican religious communities were Anglican Papalist, prominent among them the Benedictines of Dix's Nashdom Abbey, who used the Roman Missal and monastic breviary in Latin. Beliefs and practices Anglican Papalists regard the Pope as the earthly leader of the Christian Church. They generally accept in full all the Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church, including the Councils of Trent and the First Vatican Council, along with nearly all subsequent definitions of doctrine, including the bodily Assumption of Mary and her Immaculate Conception. There are Anglican Papalists who are in communion with the Church of England, who reject the Vatican II Council for the same reasons many traditional Catholic; sedevacantist groups, in particular; reject the Vatican II council. Most Anglo-Catholics regard the English Reformation as an act of the Church of England repudiating papal authority. They usually regarded Archbishop Thomas Cranmer as more of a translator than as a theologian, and saw the service in the first Book of Common Prayer as being the Mass in English.This view has become discredited among some historians and has taken considerable damage from the work of Diarmaid MacCulloch, especially in his Life of Thomas Cranmer published in 1996. Anglo-Papalists, on the other hand, regard the Church of England as two provinces of the Catholic Church's Latin Rite (the Province of Canterbury and the Province of York) forcibly severed from the rest by an act of the English Crown. In his defence of Anglican orders, Gregory Dix speaks of Cranmer and his associates using the power of the English state to impose their views on the church by Act of Parliament. Anglo-Papalists therefore regard the Book of Common Prayer as having only the authority of custom, and believe it is legitimate to use the Roman Missal and Breviary for their worship. Like many other Anglo-Catholics, Anglican Papalists make use of the rosary, benediction and other Catholic devotions. Some have regarded Thomas Cranmer as a heretic and his second Prayer Book as an expression of Zwinglian doctrine (as did Gregory Dix in his pamphlet \\"Dixit Cranmer et non Timuit\\"). They have actively worked for the reunion of the Church of England with the Holy See, as the logical objective of the Oxford Movement. In 1908, they began the \\"Church Unity Octave of Prayer\\", the precursor of the much more general \\"Week of Prayer for Christian Unity\\". = Liturgy = The English Missal has been widely used by Anglican Papalists. This volume, which is still in print, contains a form of the Tridentine Mass in English interspersed with sections of the Book of Common Prayer. The Roman Catholic writer Fr. Adrian Fortescue's Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described served as a useful guide as to how to use the missal. At early celebrations, some Anglican Papalist priests would use only the Roman Missal, in Latin or in English translation. Many modern Anglo-Papalists use the modern Catholic rite of Mass in English. Some Anglican Papalist parishes advocate \\"corporate worship in the Latin tongue\\". Groups and publications Anglo-Papalists have established a variety of organisations, including the Catholic League and the Society for Promoting Catholic Unity (SPCU), which published The Pilot. They have also provided the leadership in many more general Anglo-Catholic organisations such as the Annunciation Group. Other Anglo-Papalist groups include the Sodality of the Precious Blood. Priests of the Sodality commit themselves to recitation of the modern Roman Liturgy of the Hours and to the Latin Rite discipline of celibate chastity. The now-defunct Society of SS. Peter and Paul published the Anglican Missal. In the 1950s the Fellowship of Christ the Eternal Priest, which was established for Anglican ordinands in the armed forces, published a journal called The Rock, which was strongly pro- Roman. Few copies remain as it consisted of cyclostyled sheets.

He founded the House of Bourbon-Parma, a cadet line of the Spanish branch of the Bourbon dynasty. He was a son-in-law of Louis XV. Life Born at the Royal Alcazar in Madrid as Felipe de Borbón y Farnesio, he was the third child and second son of Philip V of Spain and his wife, Elisabeth Farnese. He was raised in Madrid and as a child showed more interest in art than in politics. He was also the 12th Count of Chinchón and Grandee of Spain First Class with a coat of arms of Bourbon after the alienation with royal authorization in 1738 of the 11th Count of Chinchón, Don Jose Sforza-Cesarini, Duke of Canzano, a title he later ceded to his brother Louis in 1754. His mother came from the family of Farnese, which had ruled the Duchy of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla for many generations. The duchy had been ruled between 1731 and 1736 by his elder brother Charles, but was exchanged with Austria for The Two Sicilies after the War of Polish Succession. Twelve years later, in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Austria lost the duchy and Philip became the new duke, founding the House of Bourbon-Parma. As part of the Second Treaty of Versailles (1757) between Austria and France, it was intended that Phillip would become king of the Southern Netherlands in a deal that would see French troops occupy key positions in the country – however this arrangement was repudiated by the subsequent Third Treaty of Versailles and Phillip continued in Parma. The Duchy of Parma was ruined by many years of warfare, and in 1759 Philip named the able Frenchman Guillaume du Tillot as his minister to restore the economy. Philip was an enlightened ruler who stimulated education and philosophy, attracting personalities such as Étienne Bonnot de Condillac. =Marriage= Philip married his first cousin once removed Princess Louise Élisabeth of France in Alcalá de Henares, Spain on 25 October 1739. They had the following children: *Isabella Luisa Antonietta Ferdinanda Giuseppina Saveria Dominica Giovanna of Parma (31 December 1741 – 27 November 1763) – she married Marie Antoinette's older brother, the Austrian emperor, Joseph II. She had children, but they all died in childhood. *Ferdinando Maria Filippo Lodovico Sebastiano Francesco Giacomo of Parma (20 January 1751 – 9 October 1802), ) – he succeeded his father as Duke of Parma in 1765 and married his older sister's sister-in-law, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria. He left children. *Luisa Maria Teresa Ana of Parma (9 December 1751 – 2 January 1819) – she was known as Maria Luisa. She was Queen of Spain as the wife of her cousin, Charles IV of Spain. She left children. Their marriage was an unhappy one, and Louise Elisabeth died of smallpox at the age of 32 in 1759. Philip died unexpectedly on 18 July 1765 in Alessandria, Italy, after having accompanied his daughter Maria Luisa on her way to Genoa, where she sailed for Spain to marry Infante Charles. Through Philip's daughter Maria Luisa, he is an ancestor of the Bourbons of Spain, the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, and the House of Orléans.

Construction on the facility began in 2001 and portions of the road were opened to traffic in May 2004. Construction of the roadway was completed in August 2005. The Westpark Tollway begins at Post Oak Boulevard in the Uptown District of Houston and runs approximately west to State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway). It runs roughly parallel and to the south of Westheimer Road (FM 1093) in Harris County and concurrently with FM 1093 in Fort Bend County. The Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) and the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA) operate the Westpark Tollway jointly. The HCTRA section is simply named Westpark Tollway; however, the six-mile (10 km) section of the toll road operated by the FBCTRA is named Fort Bend Westpark Tollway. There are two major interchanges in between: the Southwest Freeway (I-69)/(US 59) and the West Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8), along with several minor interchanges. The namesake of the tollway is Westpark Drive --an east-west major arterial running through a mostly industrial area. Like other toll roads in the Houston area, the speed limit is 65 mph--even inside Beltway 8. The Westpark Tollway is the first fully electronic toll road in the United States. There are no tollbooths or toll collectors along either section of the route. The only way to legally drive on the road is by using a transponder unit attached to a vehicle's windshield (either HCTRA's EZ TAG, NTTA's TollTag, or TxTAG). These transponders communicate with overhead sensors to deduct tolls from the user's toll account. Fort Bend County Section The Fort Bend section ties into the HCTRA portion of the tollway and is operated by the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA), under the alias of the Fort Bend Westpark Tollway. The project, completed on August 10, 2005, improves auto mobility for residents in northeastern Fort Bend County by creating a new east-west corridor with access to State Highway 6, Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8), I-69/US 59, and the Uptown District of Houston. The Fort Bend section of the Westpark Tollway is patrolled by Fort Bend County Constable, Precinct 4. Additional coverage is provided by the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Department or other agencies as needed.FBCTRA Question and Answer page =Future Segments= Parallel to the Fort Bend Westpark Tollway, FM 1093 has been widened by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to four lanes. FM 1093 at this location serves as a toll-free frontage road for the tollway. The Fort Bend Westpark Tollway will add an additional four lanes to this effort--resulting in an eight-lane road. TxDOT is funding construction of the tollway interchanges at State Highway 99 and FM 1464. Additionally, a 2012 expansion plan shows a Westpark Tollway addition to the city of Fulshear, Texas. The expansion promises a connection with the future Fulshear Parkway, and additional direct connection flyovers with SH-99.FBCTRA http://www.westhouston.org/03%202012West%20Park%20Extension%20west%20from%2099.jpg WestHouston.org graphic indicating future construction Construction of phase one to extend Westpark Tollway from the Grand Parkway to just west of Spring Green Boulevard began in February 2016 and was finished in November 2017. From 2017 to 2020, FM 1093 was expanded from two to four lanes from the Grand Parkway to James Lane near Fulshear; the highway will serve as frontage roads for future extensions of the Westpark Tollway.FM 1093 project continues with tollway study plans Community IMPACT Newspaper. 17 April 2019 (Retrieved 9 August 2020) Harris County Section The Harris County portion of the tollway right-of-way was acquired by HCTRA from METRO, which had previously purchased the entire railroad right-of-way from Southern Pacific in 1992. The Westpark corridor has a storied history as a transportation possibility. Originally on the books in the 1950s as the location of what is now Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 (Southwest Freeway) before developers lured it south to serve Sharpstown, the Westpark corridor has seen several transportation plans. The first time a toll road was mentioned was in a 1979 survey of several routes by the Texas Turnpike Authority, leading to the construction of the Hardy Toll Road in Northern Harris County by HCTRA. A heavy rail line along the corridor was floated in the 1980s, but failed to win voter approval, along with a monorail that was ended with Mayor Kathy Whitmire in 1991. Another commuter rail idea ended as METRO purchased the corridor and planned to run trains, but reversed itself and floated plans for a reversible high occupancy vehicle and bus transit lane to supplement the Southwest Freeway, tearing out the tracks in the mid 1990s. In 1999, HCTRA and METRO reached an agreement for half of the right-of-way to go towards a toll road run by HCTRA and the other half for use by METRO for light rail. Whether or not it will be the main corridor for the University Line is a contentious issue - Richmond Avenue, to the north, emerged as another option under consideration, along with the fact that Westpark Drive and its corresponding railroad right-of-way do not intersect METRORail at any point, much less Wheeler Station, which was chosen as the junction between the lines. As of 2006, a final corridor has not been chosen. As of 2014, a combination of Westpark and Richmond has been chosen as the University Line (METRORail), but the city has not allocated money for the project.

A FIB setup is a scientific instrument that resembles a scanning electron microscope (SEM). However, while the SEM uses a focused beam of electrons to image the sample in the chamber, a FIB setup uses a focused beam of ions instead. FIB can also be incorporated in a system with both electron and ion beam columns, allowing the same feature to be investigated using either of the beams. FIB should not be confused with using a beam of focused ions for direct write lithography (such as in proton beam writing). These are generally quite different systems where the material is modified by other mechanisms. Ion beam source Most widespread instruments are using liquid metal ion sources (LMIS), especially gallium ion sources. Ion sources based on elemental gold and iridium are also available. In a gallium LMIS, gallium metal is placed in contact with a tungsten needle, and heated gallium wets the tungsten and flows to the tip of the needle, where the opposing forces of surface tension and electric field form the gallium into a cusp shaped tip called a Taylor cone. The tip radius of this cone is extremely small (~2 nm). The huge electric field at this small tip (greater than 1 x 108 volts per centimeter) causes ionization and field emission of the gallium atoms. Source ions are then generally accelerated to an energy of 1–50 keV (kiloelectronvolts), and focused onto the sample by electrostatic lenses. LMIS produce high current density ion beams with very small energy spread. A modern FIB can deliver tens of nanoamperes of current to a sample, or can image the sample with a spot size on the order of a few nanometers. More recently, instruments using plasma beams of noble gas ions, such as Xenon, have become available more widely. Principle The principle of FIB Focused ion beam (FIB) systems have been produced commercially for approximately twenty years, primarily for large semiconductor manufacturers. FIB systems operate in a similar fashion to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) except, rather than a beam of electrons and as the name implies, FIB systems use a finely focused beam of ions (usually gallium) that can be operated at low beam currents for imaging or at high beam currents for site specific sputtering or milling. As the diagram on the right shows, the gallium (Ga+) primary ion beam hits the sample surface and sputters a small amount of material, which leaves the surface as either secondary ions (i+ or i−) or neutral atoms (n0). The primary beam also produces secondary electrons (e−). As the primary beam rasters on the sample surface, the signal from the sputtered ions or secondary electrons is collected to form an image. At low primary beam currents, very little material is sputtered and modern FIB systems can easily achieve 5 nm imaging resolution (imaging resolution with Ga ions is limited to ~5 nm by sputtering and detector efficiency). At higher primary currents, a great deal of material can be removed by sputtering, allowing precision milling of the specimen down to a sub micrometer or even a nano scale. If the sample is non- conductive, a low energy electron flood gun can be used to provide charge neutralization. In this manner, by imaging with positive secondary ions using the positive primary ion beam, even highly insulating samples may be imaged and milled without a conducting surface coating, as would be required in an SEM. Until recently, the overwhelming usage of FIB has been in the semiconductor industry. Such applications as defect analysis, circuit modification, photomask repair and transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample preparation of site specific locations on integrated circuits have become commonplace procedures. The latest FIB systems have high resolution imaging capability; this capability coupled with in situ sectioning has eliminated the need, in many cases, to examine FIB sectioned specimens in a separate SEM instrument. SEM imaging is still required for the highest resolution imaging and to prevent damage to sensitive samples. However, the combination of SEM and FIB columns onto the same chamber enables the benefits of both to be utilized. FIB imaging At lower beam currents, FIB imaging resolution begins to rival the more familiar scanning electron microscope (SEM) in terms of imaging topography, however the FIB's two imaging modes, using secondary electrons and secondary ions, both produced by the primary ion beam, offer many advantages over SEM. Correlative light-ion microscopy of cells on glass. Color image obtained by fluorescence microscope, black-and- white image obtained by scanning ion microscope and London skyline milled by focused ion beam. FIB secondary electron images show intense grain orientation contrast. As a result, grain morphology can be readily imaged without resorting to chemical etching. Grain boundary contrast can also be enhanced through careful selection of imaging parameters. FIB secondary ion images also reveal chemical differences, and are especially useful in corrosion studies, as secondary ion yields of metals can increase by three orders of magnitude in the presence of oxygen, clearly revealing the presence of corrosion. Another advantage of FIB secondary electron imaging is the fact that the ion beam does not alter the signal from fluorescent probes used in the labelling of proteins, thus creating the opportunity to correlate FIB secondary electron images with images obtained by fluorescence microscopes. Etching Unlike an electron microscope, FIB is inherently destructive to the specimen. When the high-energy gallium ions strike the sample, they will sputter atoms from the surface. Gallium atoms will also be implanted into the top few nanometers of the surface, and the surface will be made amorphous. Because of the sputtering capability, the FIB is used as a micro- and nano-machining tool, to modify or machine materials at the micro- and nanoscale. FIB micro machining has become a broad field of its own, but nano machining with FIB is a field that is still developing. Commonly the smallest beam size for imaging is 2.5–6 nm. The smallest milled features are somewhat larger (10–15 nm) as this is dependent on the total beam size and interactions with the sample being milled. FIB tools are designed to etch or machine surfaces, an ideal FIB might machine away one atom layer without any disruption of the atoms in the next layer, or any residual disruptions above the surface. Yet currently because of the sputter the machining typically roughens surfaces at the sub-micrometer length scales. Deposition A FIB can also be used to deposit material via ion beam induced deposition. FIB-assisted chemical vapor deposition occurs when a gas, such as tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6) is introduced to the vacuum chamber and allowed to chemisorb onto the sample. By scanning an area with the beam, the precursor gas will be decomposed into volatile and non-volatile components; the non-volatile component, such as tungsten, remains on the surface as a deposition. This is useful, as the deposited metal can be used as a sacrificial layer, to protect the underlying sample from the destructive sputtering of the beam. From nanometers to hundred of micrometers in length, tungsten metal deposition allows metal lines to be put right where needed. Other materials such as platinum, cobalt, carbon, gold, etc., can also be locally deposited. Gas assisted deposition and FIB etching process are shown below. FIB is often used in the semiconductor industry to patch or modify an existing semiconductor device. For example, in an integrated circuit, the gallium beam could be used to cut unwanted electrical connections, and/or to deposit conductive material in order to make a connection. The high level of surface interaction is exploited in patterned doping of semiconductors. FIB is also used for maskless implantation. For TEM preparation TEM sample prepared using a FIB, shown at different length scales. The two left images show the sample imaged using secondary electrons acquired on the FIB which prepared the sample. The right image showing the sample imaged using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The FIB is also commonly used to prepare samples for the transmission electron microscope. The TEM requires very thin samples, typically ~100 nanometers or less. Other techniques, such as ion milling or electropolishing can be used to prepare such thin samples. However, the nanometer-scale resolution of the FIB allows the exact region of interest to be chosen, such as perhaps a grain boundary or defect in a material. This is vital, for example, in integrated circuit failure analysis. If a particular transistor out of several million on a chip is bad, the only tool capable of preparing an electron microscope sample of that single transistor is the FIB. The same protocol used for preparing samples to transmission electron microscopy can also be used to select a micro area of a sample, extract it and prepare it for analysis using a Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The drawbacks to FIB sample preparation are the above-mentioned surface damage and implantation, which produce noticeable effects when using techniques such as high-resolution \\"lattice imaging\\" TEM or electron energy loss spectroscopy. This damaged layer can be minimized by FIB milling with lower beam voltages, or by further milling with a low-voltage argon ion beam after completion of the FIB process. FIB preparation can be used with cryogenically frozen samples in a suitably equipped instrument, allowing cross sectional analysis of samples containing liquids or fats, such as biological samples, pharmaceuticals, foams, inks, and food products. FIB is also used for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The ejected secondary ions are collected and analyzed after the surface of the specimen has been sputtered with a primary focused ion beam. For Atom Probe sample preparation The same successive milling steps applied when making TEM samples can be applied to make conical samples for atom probe tomography. In this case the ion moved in an annular milling pattern with the inner milling circle being made progressively smaller. The beam current is generally reduced the smaller the inner circle becomes to avoid damaging or destroying the sample. FIB tomography The focused ion beam has become a powerful tool for site-specific 3D imaging of sub-micron features in a sample. In this FIB tomography technique, the sample is sequentially milled using an ion beam perpendicular to the specimen while imaging the newly exposed surface using an electron beam. This so-called, slice and view approach allows larger scale nano-structures to be characterized across the many imaging modes available to an SEM, including secondary electron, backscattered electron, and energy dispersive x-ray measurement. The process is destructive, since the specimen is being sequentially milled away after each image is collected. The collected series of images is then reconstructed to a 3D volume by registering the image stack and removing artifacts. The predominant artifact that degrades FIB tomography is ion mill curtaining, where mill patterns form large aperiodic stripes in each image. The ion mill curtaining can be removed using destriping algorithms. FIB tomography can be done at both room and cryo temperatures as well as on both materials and biological samples. History History of FIB technology *1975: The first FIB systems based on field emission technology were developed by Levi-Setti and by Orloff and Swanson and used gas field ionization sources (GFISs). *1978: The first FIB based on an LMIS was built by Seliger et al. Physics of LMIS *1600: Gilbert documented that fluid under high tension forms a cone. *1914: Zeleny observed and filmed cones and jets *1959: Feynman suggested the use of ion beams. *1964: Taylor produced exactly conical solution to equations of electro hydrodynamics (EHD) *1975: Krohn and Ringo produced first high brightness ion source: LMIS Some pioneers of LMIS and FIB *Mahoney (1969) *Sudraud et al. Paris XI Orsay (1974) *Hughes Research Labs, Seliger (1978) *Hughes Research Labs, Kubena (1978 -1993) *University of Oxford Mair (1980) *Culham UK, Roy Clampitt Prewett (1980) *Oregon Graduate Center, L. Swanson (1980) *Oregon Graduate Center, J. Orloff (1974) *MIT, J. Melngailis (1980) Helium ion microscope (HeIM) Another ion source seen in commercially available instruments is a helium ion source, which is inherently less damaging to the sample than Ga ions although it will still sputter small amounts of material especially at high magnifications and long scan times. As helium ions can be focused into a small probe size and provide a much smaller sample interaction than high energy (>1 kV) electrons in the SEM, the He ion microscope can generate equal or higher resolution images with good material contrast and a higher depth of focus. Commercial instruments are capable of sub 1 nm resolution. Wien filter in focused ion beam setup Imaging and milling with Ga ions always result in Ga incorporation near the sample surface. As the sample surface is sputtered away at a rate proportional to the sputtering yield and the ion flux (ions per area per time), the Ga is implanted further into the sample, and a steady-state profile of Ga is reached. This implantation is often a problem in the range of the semiconductor where silicon can be amorphised by the gallium. In order to get an alternative solution to Ga LMI sources, mass-filtered columns have been developed, based on a Wien filter technology. Such sources include Au-Si, Au- Ge and Au-Si-Ge sources providing Si, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Ge, In, Sn, Au, Pb and other elements. Mass selection in the FIB column The principle of a Wien filter is based on the equilibrium of the opposite forces induced by perpendicular electrostatic and a magnetic fields acting on accelerated particles. The proper mass trajectory remains straight and passes through the mass selection aperture while the other masses are stopped. Besides allowing the use of sources others than gallium, these columns can switch from different species simply by adjusting the properties of the Wien filter. Larger ions can be used to make rapid milling before refining the contours with smaller ones. Users also benefits from the possibility to dope their samples with elements of suitable alloy sources. The latter property has found great interests in the investigation of magnetic materials and devices. Khizroev and Litvinov have shown, with the help of magnetic force microscopy (MFM), that there is a critical dose of ions that a magnetic material can be exposed to without experiencing a change in the magnetic properties. Exploiting FIB from such an unconventional perspective is especially favourable today when the future of so many novel technologies depends on the ability to rapidly fabricate prototype nanoscale magnetic devices.

Used historically by the Scottish monarchs, the banner differs from Scotland's national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Monarchy in Scotland. pointing at the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672, c. 47 and the Lyon King of Arms Act 1867, 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17 It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Head of State is not present. The earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222; At Google Book Search with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286). This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which, together with a royal banner displaying the same, was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI acceded to the thrones of the kingdoms of England and Ireland. Since 1603, the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Monarch and at royal residences, the Royal Banner continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols. Design Royal Banner being flown above Holyrood Palace Displaying a red lion rampant, with blue tongue and claws, within a red double border on a yellow background, the design of the Royal Banner of Scotland is formally specified in heraldry as: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter- flory of the second, meaning: A gold (Or) background, whose principal symbol is a red (Gules) upright lion (lion rampant) with blue (Azure) claws and tongue (armed and langued), surrounded by a two-lined border (tressure) decorated with opposing pairs of floral symbols (flory counter-flory) of the second colour specified in the blazon (Gules). Used as a house flag, its proportions are 5:4; however, flag manufacturers themselves may also adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3. History Reverse of Alexander II's Great Seal, displaying the Lion rampant on saddle and shield. The Lion rampant has been used as a heraldic symbol by heirs of Malcolm III beginning with David I. The Great Seal was used by Alexander II (1214–1249). Its use in Scotland originated during the reign of Malcolm III (1058–1093), The Lion rampant motif is used as a badge by those Irish clans who has lineage in common with Malcolm III. They are linked to the legendary Milesian genealogies. Google Books Google Books An early recorded Scottish royal standard featured a dragon, which was used at the Battle of the Standard in 1138 by David I (1124–1153). Following the Union of the Crowns of England, Ireland and Scotland in 1603, the Royal Banner of the arms of the kings of Scotland was incorporated into the royal standards of successive Scottish then, following the Acts of Union in 1707, British monarchs; with all such royal standards being quartered to include the banner of the arms of each individual realm. Since 1603, the Royal Banner of Scotland has appeared in both the first and fourth quarters of the quartered royal standard used in Scotland, while appearing only in the second quarter of that version used elsewhere. Protocol =Use at royal residences= The Royal Banner of Scotland flying above Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh. The Royal Banner of Scotland is used officially at the Scottish royal residences of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, and Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire, when the Queen is not in residence. The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland is flown when the Monarch is present. =Use by representatives of the Monarchy= In the tradition of Scottish heraldry, use of the banner is not restricted to the monarch. At Google Book Search Several Great Officers of State who officially represent the Monarchy in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland, including; the First Minister of Scotland (as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland), Lord Lieutenants within their respective Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by the Head of State. =Use by the Heir Apparent= A variation of the Royal Banner of Scotland is used by the heir apparent to the monarch, the Duke of Rothesay, whose standard is the banner defaced with an Azure coloured plain label of three points. The personal banner of the current titleholder, Prince Charles, also features the same, displayed upon an inner shield. =Legal status= As the personal banner of the Monarch, use of the Royal Banner of Scotland is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17, and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act. In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for usurpation of the banner on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the banner. Despite such action, the flag continues to feature on a variety of merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important tourism industry. In 1934, George V issued a Royal Warrant authorising use of the Royal Banner of Scotland during the Silver Jubilee celebrations, due to take place the following year. However, such use was restricted to hand-held flags for \\"decorative ebullition\\" as a mark of loyalty to the Monarch; the banner was not to be flown from flagpoles or public buildings. Google Books The use of hand-held flags at state occasions, such as the opening of the Scottish Parliament, and at sporting events, continues to be authorised by this Royal Warrant, although according to former Lord Lyon Robin Blair, in an interview given to the Sunday Post in November 2007, such use at sporting events \\"was not envisaged in 1935\\". Appearance in other royal flags As well as forming the basis of the standard of the Duke of Rothesay, At Google Books the Royal Banner of Scotland has since 1603 been a component of what is now styled the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom; both that version used exclusively in Scotland and that used elsewhere. It similarly appears in the Royal Standard of Canada, with the arms of Canada reflecting the royal symbols of England, Scotland, Ireland and France.

At present, the Fon of Bafut is still a local ruler, but under the jurisdiction of the Government of Cameroon, and a board of Fons. Bafut is one of the largest villages in the North West Province. Once autocratic, the Fondom of Bafut was turned into a part of the German protectorate of Cameroon (Kamerun Schutzgebiet) due to increasing tension, military conflict, and finally defeat at the hands of the Germans in the Bafut Wars (1901–1907) during the reign of Abumbi I. After World War I, the Fon of Bafut and his people became part of the British protectorate of the Cameroons or British Cameroon. International image The Fon of Bafut is perhaps best remembered due to Gerald Durrell's humorous portrayal of the Fon Achirimbi II in his books describing animal-collecting missions to Bafut in the 1940s and 1950s – Bafut Beagles and A Zoo in My Luggage. Traditional role of the Fon The Fon had titular powers in pre-independent Cameroon. He had multifarious functions: *He controlled external relations and internally he made laws. *All justice was done in his name, and he was the final court of appeal and had power of life and death over his subjects. *As chief priest he offered sacrifices to his ancestors and interceded with them for the welfare of the people. He presided at important festivals, the most important being the Abin e Mfor, the dance of the Fon. The Fon was assisted and advised by titled royals – the most prominent among them being the Mamfor or the mother of the Fon, either his real mother or a sister. In addition there were two fraternal assistants called Ndimfor (the elder brother) and Muma (younger brother). However, none of these royals served as regent in the case of the Fon's death or indisposition. The body which actually shared power with the Fon and deputised for him was the council of elders or Kwifor. The strength of the Kwifor lay in its role as a council of kingmakers; it was thus a check on royal power. The Fon acknowledged this and tried as much as possible to avoid confrontation with the Kwifor. Role of the Fon during the colonial era The Germans tried to put a puppet ruler in place of the Fon after the Bafut Wars, but failed. The Fon Abumbi I was openly hostile to the Germans, and diplomacy was not pursued. The idea of decentralised governance by local people was put into practice in July 1917 in the British Cameroon when the District officer inaugurated an 'Instructional Court' in Bamenda. This was an assembly of chiefs from surrounding communities who were summoned to be instructed in the new native court ordinance and to go on to form the new courts. The membership of the court consisted of 27 chiefs with the Fon of Bafut Abumbi I appointed as president due to his role as the \\"supreme fon\\". The court proved only mildly successful, but his son Achirimbi II was very tolerant of the British. He alienated himself from other Fons by being sympathetic to the British cause and was awarded a Certificate of Honour by the British government 'as a record of the valuable services rendered by him to his own country and people and to the British Government... and loyal services given to the Administration in the maintenance of good order'. Role of the Fon in the post-colonial period Even in the post colonial period, the Fon of Bafut has been an important administrative force. When asked whether to join the independent country of Cameroon from the British Cameroons, Fon Achirimbi II famously said that it was a choice between the \\"Fire and the Deep Sea\\". Bafut is one of many places in Northwest and West Cameroon where traditional power structures are still in place. The Fon of Bafut also holds several important administrative positions including that of the head of the North West Fons' Union (NOWEFU), and member of the Management Board of the North-West Development Authority (MIDENO). Ceremonies involving the Fon The Fon participates in virtually all the important ceremonies of Bafut. Some of the most important ones are: *The stoning ceremony: When a new Fon takes over, he is presented to the Bafut population for \\"stoning\\". The population may decide to throw token pebbles at him or choose to hurt him by throwing large stones. While a token ceremony now, this ceremony may have served some purposes of democracy and election early on. *The annual grasscutting ceremony: This takes place at the end of the dry season, around late April. The entire community goes to the surrounding grasslands to collect bundles of dry grass for rethatching the important buildings in the palace complex (notably the Achum), trooping in front of the Fon with their offerings. The festival typically ends with a gala feast accompanied by palm wine. *The annual dance Abin e Mfor or Dance of the Fon: This annual event, held in December is also known as the Abin Lela, or Dance of the Flutes. Village nobles play traditional flutes and fire guns to mark the proceedings. It is the climactic point of the annual ritual cycle, and is supposed to signify the death and rebirth of the year (i.e. a new year ceremony). The ethnic dance is performed in traditional dress. The basic structure of the dance is: **Luminaries of society (the Fon of Bafut and his advisors) form a spiral in the centre. **The general public dance concentric rings around the spiral in a counter-clockwise fashion. :Present-day African American ring ceremonies probably owe their origins to such ceremonies. The grass-cutting ceremony and the annual dance were described by Gerald Durrell in detail in his accounts The Bafut Beagles, and A Zoo in My Luggage. The palace of the Fon The Fon's palace at Bafut was listed as one of the 100 most endangered monument sites in 2006 The palace of the Fon of Bafut or Ntoh is a major tourist attraction and is listed in the 2006 World Monuments Watch list of the 100 most endangered sites of 2006 by the World Monuments Fund. The original palace was built out of wood and liana. The complex and the central shrine were burnt to the ground by the Germans in the Bafut Wars, but was rebuilt over the period 1907 – 1910 with help from the Germans after the signing of the peace treaty. Its buildings represent both colonial influences and indigenous vernacular architectural styles, and are mostly made of fired bricks covered by tiles. The residence built by the Germans for the Fon presently serve as the guest house, and also houses a museum. Fon Abumbi II has declared that the museum will feature relics from the Battle of Mankon (1891), of the Bafut Wars, when warriors from Bafut routed a German expeditionary force. Only one building from the original palace stands – it is supposed to shelter the spirit of the Fon's ancestors. It is the Achum – the old palace, and has a striking architecture with its pyramidal thatched roof. Only the Fon and some village notables are allowed entry into the Achum. There are two other older palaces of the Fon of Bafut. *The old palace of Mbebli, also known as Ntoh Firloo was built by the Bafut people when they first arrived from Tikari some 400 years ago.

Yörüks lived within the Yörük Sanjak () which was not a territorial unit like other sanjaks but a separate organisational unit of the Ottoman Empire. According to some, those tribes residing in the east of the Kızılırmak river are called Turkmen and those in the west Yörük. Both terms were used together in Ottoman sources for Dulkadirli Turkmens living in Maraş and its surroundings.Solak, İbrahim. XVI. Yüzyılda Maraş ve Çevresinde Dulkadirli Türkmenleri. The ethnohistorical terms Turcoman and Turkmen are used synonymously in literature to designate Yörük ancestry. Today they live mostly in houses in the valleys and plains and have preserved fair hair and a fair complexion, and blue or greyish-blue eyes of their Oghuz ancestors.Yusuf Durul: Flat-woven rugs made by \\"Yürüks\\".

Historians and ethnologists often use the additional appellative 'Yörük Turcoman' or 'Turkmens' to describe the Yörüks of Anatolia. In Turkey's general parlance today, the terms \\"Türkmen\\" and \\"Yörük\\" indicate the gradual degrees of preserved attachment with the former semi-nomadic lifestyle of the populations concerned, with the \\"Turkmen\\" now leading a fully sedentary life, while keeping parts of their heritage through folklore and traditions, in arts like carpet-weaving, with the continued habit of keeping a yayla house for the summers, sometimes in relation to the Alevi community etc. and with Yörüks maintaining a stronger association with nomadism. These names ultimately hint to their Oghuz Turkish roots. The remaining \\"true\\" Yörüks of today's Anatolia traditionally use horses as a means of transportation, though these are steadily being replaced by trucks. The Yörüks are divided in a large number of named endogamous patrilineal tribes (aşiret). Among recent tribes mentioned in the literature are Aksigirli, Ali Efendi, Bahsıs, Cakallar, Coşlu, Qekli, Gacar, Güzelbeyli, Horzum, Karaevli, Karahacılı, Karakoyunlu, Karakayalı, Karalar, Karakeçili, Manavlı, Melemenci, San Agalı, Sanhacılı, Sarıkeçili, Tekeli and Yeni Osmanlı.

They mainly live in the Mersin province, in the central- eastern parts of Turkish Mediterranean coast, and consist of about 200 families. Their winter camp is in Silifke, Gülnur and Anamur coasts. In summer they live in the districts of Beysehir and Seydisehir of the Konya province. Their nomad tents can be seen throughout the Mediterranean coastal sides of Turkey. This is a very common practice among old Turkic tribes in central Asia even nowadays.A. Georgoudis, A. Rosati, C. Mosconi.

Throat playing tradition, known as “Boğaz Havası” or “Boğaz Çalma”, has an important aspect in the culture of the Sarıkeçili Yörüks, it is perfomred by pressing the throat with a finger while singing with a sound. In the past centuries, many Sarıkeçili tribes also resided in these areas: İçel, Aydın, Konya, Karahisâr-ı Sahib, Akşehir, Saruhan, Doğanhisarı, Antalya, Eğridir, Isparta, Burdur, Dazkırı, Uluborlu, Tavşanlı, Kütahya. Most Sarıkeçili tribes living in these areas have already accepted the sedentary way of life. The Sarıkeçili around Antalya and Mersin are the last representatives of Yörük nomadism.Dulkadir, Hilmi (1997). İçel'de son Yörükler: Sartkeçililer, İçel Valiliği Yayınları They are considered ‘the only group representing the Turkish migration from Central Asia’. = Lifestyle = French historian and Turkologist Jean-Paul Roux visited the Anatolian Yörüks in the late 1950s and found that the majority of them were practicing Sunni Muslims. The tribes he visited were led by elected officials called muhtars, or village headmen, rather than hereditary chiefs, although he did note that village elders maintained some social authority based on their age. For the majority of the year, they lived in dark wool tents called kara fadir. During the summer, they went up to the mountains, and in the winter they came down to the coastal plains. They kept a variety of animals, including goats, sheep, camels, and sometimes cattle. The focus of each tribe was the family unit. Young men would move directly from their family's tent to their own upon marriage. The Yörüks married endogamously; that is, they married strictly within their own tribe. Children were raised by the tribe as a whole, who told Roux \\"we are all parents.\\" Although the Yörüks had acquired a reputation for being deliberately resistant to formal education, Roux found that a full quarter of Yörük children he encountered were attending school, despite the difficulties of living a nomadic lifestyle in remote locations with limited access. Balkans Balkan Yörük settlements In 1911, the Yörük were a distinct segment of the population of Macedonia and Thrace, where they settled as early as the 14th century. An earlier offshoot of the Yörüks, the Kailar or Kayılar Turks, were among the first settlements in Europe. * Rumelian Yörüks: Atçekenler/Tanrıdağı Yörüks, Naldöken Yörüks, Kocacık Yörüks, Ofcabolu Yörüks, Vize Yörüks, Yanbolu Yörüks, Selanik Yörüks. Tekirdağ Yürüks.Çevik, Hikmet (1971). Tekirdağ Yürükleri, Tekirdağ Halkevi Yayını, İstanbul In 1900 the Rumelian Turkish population in the Balkans was estimated at about seven million. Shortly after the independence of the new Bulgarian state, they formed the majority in the country. Several migrations led to a decline of the Rumelian Turkish population, leaving about 1.5 million people by 1925. Many Rumelian Turks in Greece are not counted in census because they are registered as Christians to escape discrimination.Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R, Volume 3 of Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World, James Minahan, Greenwood Press (Westport, Conn., 2002) , 9780313316173 pp. 1611–1616.The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide, Walter de Gruyter 2011. Due to religious, linguistic and social differences, most part of Rumelian Turks did not intermarry or mix with the native populations of the Balkans.Vol. 2 of Muslim Peoples: A World Ethnographic Survey (Greenwood Press, 1984) by Richard V. Weekes, , p.821. As late as 1971, Rumelian Turks still formed a disctinct ethnos of former nomads (known as Yorukluk). Originally, these Yörük nomads were taken from West Anatolia (Saruhan, Menemen) to colonize parts of Rumelia, such as Thessaly and Rhodope in the Greek-Bulgarian-Macedonian borderland, or Plovdiv and Yambol in Bulgaria.Volume 3 of Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies (London, 2006) by Elizabeth Jeffreys, quotation from p. 105.Volume 4 of Encyclopaedia of the World Muslims: Tribes, Castes and Communities (Global Vision, 2001), by Nagendra Kr Singh, , 9788187746058.Ottoman Methods of Conquest, by Halil Inalcik, Studia Islamica No. 2 (1954), pp. 103-129 (27 pages) Published By: Brill DOI:10.2307/1595144 After decimating the last resistance of Skanderbeg in the Albanian mountain regions, formerly irregular Turkmen troops settled down and now form the basis of the Muslim Albanian population.Fischer Weltgeschichte Vol. 15: Der Islam II Die islamischen Reiche nach dem Fall von Konstantinopel, by G.E. von Grunebaum, p.44 =Yörüks of Macedonia and Bulgaria = In 1993, the Yörük population of Bulgaria is estimated at apprx. 418 thousand people,\\"Turquie: situation générale\\".

Current estimates of 2019 assume that in the entire Balkan region approx. 1.5 to 2.3 million people of Yörük Turkish descent live. =Kayılar Yörüks= Anthropological essay on male Yörük adults (Felix von Luschan, 1889) The Kailar Turks formerly inhabited parts of Thessaly and Macedonia (especially near the town of Kozani and modern Ptolemaida). Before 1360, large numbers of nomad shepherds, or Yörüks, from the district of Konya, in Asia Minor, had settled in the country. Further immigration from this region took place from time to time up to the middle of the 18th century. After the establishment of the feudal system in 1397 many of the Seljuk noble families came over from Asia Minor; some of the beys or Muslim landowners in southern Macedonia before the Balkan Wars may have been their descendants. Iran Clans closely related to the Yörüks are scattered throughout the Anatolian Peninsula and beyond it, particularly around the chain of Taurus Mountains and further east around the shores of the Caspian sea. Of the Turkmens of Iran, the Yomuts come the closest to the definition of the Yörüks. An interesting offshoot of the Yörük mass are the Tahtacı of the mountainous regions of Western Anatolia who, as their name implies, have been occupied with forestry work and wood craftsmanship for centuries. Despite this, they share similar traditions (with markedly matriarchal tones in their society structure) with their other Yörük cousins. The Qashqai people of southern Iran are also worthy of mention due to their shared characteristics.  Anthropology  A. A. Ivanovsky discovered quite noticeable protruding cheekbones, weak development of the tertiary hairline in the Yörüks. 18 people of the Yörük examined by him also had epicanthus. These features go back to the Turkic tribes of the Middle Ages.Д.Е. Ермеев. «Этногенез турок». / D.E. Ermeev. \\"Ethnogenesis of the Turks\\".

According to his birth certificate, Kitchener was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on 13 August 1916, to his parents, Findlay Howard MacDonald and Jessie E. Sutherland. Though Kitchener's situation is obscure, he was most likely conscripted for duty by the Canadian government in late 1944, following an apparent shortage of volunteering military enlistees (though this can not be known for certain, as Kitchener's military records will not be made available until 2023, and he adamantly refused to discuss the subject). Opponents of the idea that Kitchener was drafted assert that the Canadian government would not have had the power to conscript an American citizen (assuming he was not naturalized). The exact date that Kitchener took up isolation in his home beside Gully Lake is uncertain, whether it be immediately after he jumped the train, or gradually into the 1950s; nor is it known why he chose to stay there. It is likely that he originally began his dwelling to elude capture and punishment for his desertion, but Kitchener stayed there even after the Canadian government declared amnesty to deserters in 1950. Only a year before his death, Kitchener's makeshift hut, as well as all of the belongings it contained -- including books, his various writings, a homemade guitar, and a .303 rifle -- were destroyed in a forest fire. With reluctance, Kitchener subsequently moved into a cabin built for him by Colchester County using aggregated pension funds. In 2003, after some of his friends went to get medical help against his will, Kitchener fled back to the woods, apparently to evade treatment or placement in a retirement home. His remains were found on 27 June 2004 by a search party of over 100 volunteers. A film of his life and final days, , was produced and directed by Amy Goldberg and premiered in 2007.

It can also act on 3hKyn (to produce 3hAnt) and some other (3-arylcarbonyl)-alanines. Humans express one kynureninase enzyme that is encoded by the KYNU gene located on chromosome 2. KYNU is part of the pathway for the catabolism of Trp and the biosynthesis of NAD cofactors from tryptophan (Trp). Kynureninase catalyzes the following reaction: * L-kynurenine + H2O = anthranilate + L-alanine Structure Kynureninase belongs to the class V group of aspartate aminotransferase superfamily of structurally homologous pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. To date, two structures of human kynureninase have determined by X-ray diffraction with resolutions of 2.0 and 1.7 Å.; Forty percent of the amino acids are arranged in an alpha helical and twelve percent are arranged in beta sheets. Docking of the kynurenine substrate into the active site suggests that Asn-333 and His-102 are involved in substrate binding. Function In KYNU reaction, PLP facilitates Cβ-Cγ bond cleavage. The reaction follows the same steps as the transamination reaction but does not hydrolyze the tautomerized Schiff base. The proposed reaction mechanism involves an attack of an enzyme nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon (Cγ) of the tautomerized 3hKyn-PLP Schiff base. This is followed by Cβ-Cγ bond cleavage to generate an acyl-enzyme intermediate together with a tautomerized Ala-PLP adduct.

He was the most popular black comedian of his day, best known for his work in blackface minstrelsy. In addition to his skillful acrobatics, dancing, singing, and instrument playing, Kersands was renowned for his comic routines involving his large mouth, which he could contort comically or fill with objects such as billiard balls or saucers. His stage persona was that of the dim-witted black man of the type that had been popularized in white minstrel shows. Modern commentators such as Mel Watkins cite him as one of the earliest black entertainers to have faced the dilemma of striking a balance between social satire and the reinforcement of negative stereotypes.Watkins 114. Career Kersands began performing with traveling minstrel troupes in the early 1860s. As black minstrelsy gained popularity, Kersands became its biggest star. In 1879, he earned about $15 a week, but by 1882, he was reportedly earning $80, only slightly less than a featured white minstrel. He was known to have earned $250 a week during European Minstrel Tours. He was a hit with both white and black audiences, particularly in the Southern United States.Tom Fletcher wrote that \\"In the South, a minstrel show without Billy Kersands is like a circus without elephants.\\"Fletcher, Tom (1954). One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business. Quoted in Toll 256. Over his career, Kersands played with many of the major black minstrel troupes. He was a member of Sam Hague's Georgia Minstrels, along with Charles Hicks and Bob Height. When the company returned from an English tour in 1872, Charles Callender purchased the troupe and renamed it Callender's Georgia Minstrels. When Kersands and other popular troupe members demanded higher pay and more favorable treatment, Callender dismissed them. They quit to form their own ensemble, a move Callender characterized as theft. The company did poorly, and Kersands and most of the others returned to Callender. During his years with Callender's Georgia Minstrels, Kersands regularly featured in the military burlesques that regularly ended the first act beginning in 1875 or 1876. These sketches earned him renown for his acrobatic feats of drumming.Quoted in Toll 249. In 1885, Kersands began his own minstrel troupe, named Kersands' Minstrels. Charles Hicks was the manager, but he left to form his own group after little more than a year. Kersands' Minstrels was well known for its marching band, and the group led a Mardi Gras parade in 1886. Kersands offered $1000 to any rival who could outmarch them. He also continued to play engagements with other companies, including Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels in 1890 as one of \\"The Vestibule Car Porters and Drum Majors\\". In 1904, Kersands performed in an urban, black-produced show in the East. He only stayed for a short time, instead preferring the blackface minstrelsy he knew best. He formed another troupe and took up touring primarily in the South. Kersands answered the inevitable question of why he had not made the move to vaudeville thus: \\"All of my money came from the people of the South, the white and the colored, while playing down there. Whether they meant it or not, the way I was treated by them, and still am, I feel at home. I also make a good living with no worries.\\"Fletcher, Tom (1954). One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business. Quoted in Watkins 115. Performance Kersands's comedy act centered on his enormous mouth, which he exuberantly contorted into countless shapes. He peppered his songs with these movements and their accompanying noises. One observer remarked, \\"The slightest curl of his lip or opening of that yawning chasm termed his mouth was of itself sufficient to convulse the audience.\\"8 October 1887. The Clipper. Quoted in Toll 256. He could even fit several billiard balls or a cup and saucer into his mouth and still perform a dance routine or fill the theater with boisterous laughter. Tom Fletcher wrote that while touring in England, Kersands told Queen Victoria that if his mouth was any bigger, his ears would have to be moved.Fletcher, Tom (1954). One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business. Quoted in Toll 254. This physical feature fit well into racist white-created stereotypes of blacks having large lips and mouths. Kersands further embraced such disparaging caricatures by affecting the stage persona of a slow and ignorant Sambo. He also sang songs that reinforced these racist views. In his \\"Mary's Gone with a Coon\\", he sang of a black man \\"lamenting\\" his daughter's impending marriage to a black man: \\"De chile dat I bore, should tink ob me no more / Den to run away wid a big black coon.\\"Haverly, J. H. (1881) \\"Mary's Gone with a Coon\\". Haverly's Genuine Troupe of Blacks. Quoted in Toll 256. His \\"Old Aunt Jemima\\" lent its name to the stereotyped mammy Aunt Jemima that later was developed into an iconic trademark for a brand of pancakes. Despite Kersands's reinforcement of negative black stereotypes, very few African Americans disdained his act. Part of his appeal for them lay in his mixing of elements of African American folklore into his show in a way that would appeal to his black audience but be ignored or derided by whites. \\"Old Aunt Jemima\\", one of his signature songs, serves as a good example. The song exists in three texts, two published 1875 and one in 1880, suggesting that Kersands made up verses as he sang. All three versions begin in a church, a locale that white minstrels tended to avoid. The 1875 texts describe charismatic black worship practices, but the 1880 edition begins with a black character fleeing a white church because they \\"prayed so long\\".Quoted in Toll 259. Verses from the song soon entered the African American tradition and appeared in later collections of folklore. Other songs Kersands performed featured African American elements like talking animals and weak-versus-strong match-ups. His popularity led many theatre owners to relax rules limiting black patrons to specific sections of the playhouse. Despite weighing over 200 pounds, Kersands was also a talented dancer and acrobat. His trademark dance was Essence of Old Virginia or Virginia Essence, which he may have introduced. The dance later developed into the soft shoe. He was also known for the Buck and Wing. His dance routines helped cement such dance acts as fixtures in later vaudeville and Hollywood routines.Watkins 113.

Located on the Chambal River near the tripoint of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, it was first declared in Madhya Pradesh in 1978, and now constitutes a long narrow eco-reserve co- administered by the three states. Within the sanctuary, the pristine Chambal River cuts through mazes of ravines and hills with many sandy beaches. It is part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. History Administrative approval of the Government of India for the establishment of the National Chambal Sanctuary was conveyed in Order No. 17-74/77-FRY (WL) dated 30 September 1978. The Sanctuary has sanctuary status declared under Section 18(1) of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Since such a declaration is carried out by individual states for territory falling within their jurisdiction, there are three separate notifications covering the National Chambal Sanctuary - the Madhya Pradesh portion was gazetted in the Government of Madhya Pradesh Notice No. F.15/5/77-10(2) dated 20 December 1978, the Uttar Pradesh portion was gazetted in the Government of Uttar Pradesh Notice No. 7835/XIV-3-103-78 dated 29 January 1979 and the Rajasthan portion was gazetted in the Government of Rajasthan Notice No.F.11(12)Rev.8/78 dated 7 December 1979.Sale J.B. 1982. 2nd Draft.

The sanctuary is protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary is administered by the Department of Forest under the Project Officer with headquarters at Morena, Madhya Pradesh. Fauna Gharial in Chambal River Red-crowned roof turtle in the sanctuary Ganges dolphin An Indian skimmer on the Chambal river The critically endangered gharial and the red-crowned roof turtle live here, and together with the endangered Ganges river dolphin are the keystone species of the sanctuary. Other large threatened inhabitants of the sanctuary include muggar crocodile, smooth-coated otter, striped hyena and Indian wolf. Chambal supports 8 of the 26 rare turtle species found in India, including Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle, three-striped roof turtle and crowned river turtle. Other reptiles who live here are: Indian flapshell turtle, soft shell turtle, Indian roofed turtle, Indian tent turtle and monitor lizard. Mammals of less concern which live here include: rhesus macaque, Hanuman langur, golden jackal, Bengal fox, common palm civet, small Asian mongoose, Indian grey mongoose, jungle cat, wild boar, sambar, nilgai, blackbuck, Indian gazelle, northern palm squirrel, Indian crested porcupine, Indian hare, Indian flying fox and Indian long-eared hedgehog. The National Chambal Sanctuary is listed as an important bird area (IBA) IN122. and is a proposed Ramsar site. At least 320 species of resident and migratory birds inhabit the sanctuary. Migratory birds from Siberia form part of its rich avian fauna. Vulnerable bird species here include the Indian skimmer, sarus crane, Pallas's fish eagle and Indian courser. The pallid harrier and lesser flamingo are near threatened. Winter visitors include black-bellied tern, red-crested pochard, ferruginous pochard and bar-headed goose. Other species include great thick- knee, greater flamingo, darter, and brown hawk owl. Flora Common plants in the sanctuary include khair (Acacia catechu), palash (flame of the forest, Butea monosperma), churel (Indian elm tree, Holoptelea integrifolia), ber (Indian plum, Ziziphus mauritiana) and grassy patches on both sides of the river. Conservation management The sanctuary is protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary is administered by the Department of Forest under the Project Officer with headquarter at Morena, Madhya Pradesh. Parts of the sanctuary are threatened by extensive illegal sand mining, which is endangering the fragile lotic ecosystem critical for Gharial breeding. Gharial and turtles On 27 December 2010, the Minister for Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh, during a visit to the Madras Crocodile Bank, announced the formation of a National Tri-State Chambal Sanctuary Management and Coordination Committee for gharial conservation on of the National Chambal Sanctuary. The Committee members will comprise representatives of three states' Water Resources Ministries, states' Departments of Irrigation and Power, Wildlife Institute of India, Madras Crocodile Bank, the Gharial Conservation Alliance, Development Alternatives, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Divisional Forest officers of the three states. The Committee will plan strategies for protection of gharials and their habitat. It will conduct further research on the species and its ecology and evaluate the related socio-economic elements of dependent riparian communities. Funding for this new initiative will be mobilized as a sub-scheme of the ‘Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats’ in the amount of Rs. 50 to 80 million (USD 1 million to 1.7 million) each year for five years. This project has long been advocated by herpetologist Rom Whitaker. Visitor activities There are many nature watching opportunities available for visitors to the National Chambal Sanctuary. The best opportunities for sighting and photography of gharial and dolphins can be had by hiring a boat with a driver and guide, available at several points along the river. A boat excursion will also offer many viewpoints for photography of water and shore birds and landscapes. Walking trails in the ravines and along the river offer opportunities for close observation of the wide variety of plants and animals in the sanctuary. There are public vehicle entry points to Chambal Sanctuary at Pinahat, Nandagon Ghat, Sehson and Bharch. Boating and visiting arrangements can be made with the help of the office of the Conservator of Forests, at Kota. Visitors may explore Ater Fort, a beautiful but dilapidated landmark and historical site near Ater town, 35 km from Bhind. The fort was built by the Bhadauria kings Badan Singh, Maha Singh and Bakhat Singh in 1664-1698. The fort is situated on the banks of the Chambal River and can be reached by bus, jeep or boat. There are forest rest houses at Bah and Chakkar Nagar and Public Works Department inspection bungalows at Bah and Pinahat. There are several commercial hotels and eco lodges at Agra, Etawah and Bah. The nearest airport is at Agra. The nearest railway station is at Agra. Agra and Mathura are major rail junctions with a number of trains from all over the country. Bharatpur, Ranthambhor National Park (with change at Bharatpur), Bandhavgarh National Park (Katni, Umaria) and Kanha National Park (Jabalpur) are all well serviced by the rail network from Agra.

Previous to the act, these materials were subject to mining claims under the General Mining Act of 1872. Background Previous to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, the General Mining Act of 1872 authorized citizens to freely prospect for minerals on public lands and allowed a discoverer to stake claims to both minerals and surrounding lands for development. This open-access policy enabled a major oil rush in the West, in 1909 prompting U.S. Geological Survey Director George Otis Smith to warn Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger that oil lands were being claimed so quickly they would be unavailable within a few months.Hayes, Samuel. Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890–1920 (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1999), pp 89–90 Ballinger notified President Taft who promptly created the first American oil reserve by executive order on September 27, 1909, withdrawing of public lands in California and Wyoming from further claims, and reserving the oil for use by the United States Navy.Lita Epstein, C.D. Jaco, and Julianne C. Iwersen-Niemann, The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Politics of Oil (Alpha Books, 2003), pp 131–132 Congress ratified the president's authority to set aside federally owned lands with the passing of the Pickett Act () in 1910. The Supreme Court further affirmed the president's constitutional power to withdraw public land from use in . Following these events, Congress enacted the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 which dictated a system of leasing and development for mining interests on federally owned lands. Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 Provisions in the act provide a number of functions:Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 et seq. * Enables entrance onto public lands to explore for minerals with permission of the government. * Enables drilling and extraction of minerals with authority granted by the government. * Enables the government to manage the exploitation of leasable minerals. * Enables the government to receive compensation from the lessee for the privilege of extracting minerals on federal public lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a division of the Department of the Interior (DOI), is the principal administrator of the Mineral Leasing Act. BLM evaluates areas for potential development and awards leases based on whoever pays the highest bonus during a competitive bidding period. Leasing The Mineral Leasing Act \\"establishes qualifications for leases, sets out maximum limits on the number of acres of a particular mineral that can be held by a lessee, and prohibits alien ownership of leases except through stock ownership in a corporation.\\" Conditions of a lease under the Mineral Leasing Act vary based on the type of mineral being extracted. Phosphate and potassium leases have terms and conditions subject to readjustment at the end of each 20-year period. Sodium and sulphur lessee's have the right to renew the lease terms at the end of the first 20-year period and every 10-year period after that.Feriancek, Jeanine. Minerals & Mining Law. Holland and Hart LLP. . Coal and oil shale leases are generally for 20 year periods, while oil and natural gas leases are generally for 10 year periods.Gray, Brian. Mineral Leasing Act (1920). . Royalties Royalties are payments made from one party to another based on usage of an asset, often in the form of a percentage. The Mineral Leasing Act required monetary gains from the leasing of public lands to be divided three ways, except for Alaska:Sally K. Fairfax, Carolyn E. Yale, Council of State Governments. Federal lands: a guide to planning, management, and state revenues (Island Press, 1987), pp 60. * 50 percent of gross revenues to states other than Alaska. * 40 percent of gross revenues to Reclamation Fund. * 10 percent of gross revenues to Federal Treasury. * 90 percent of gross revenues to Alaska. Petroleum Under the Mineral Leasing Act and later amendments, the right to produce federally owned petroleum (oil and natural gas) is secured for ten-year periods by competitive bidding, and goes to the party paying the highest bonus. There are three forms of payment to the government: bonus (an initial payment to the government), rental (an annual payment of $2 per acre), and royalty ( a payment of 1/8 or 12.5% of the gross value of the oil and gas produced).American Petroleum Institute. Oil and Natural Gas Development on Public Lands are an Important Revenue Source for Government. . Coal Under the Mineral Leasing Act as amended and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 as amended, coal leases are initially obtained for a 20-year period but can be terminated in 10 years if the resources are not sufficiently developed. As with petroleum, an initial bonus must be paid to the government at the time the lease is awarded. Annual rental fees for coal are $3 per acre. Royalties are 12.5% of the gross value for surface mined coal and 8% for coal produced from underground mines.Bureau of Land Management. Coal. .

The constant (C) and variable (V) domains are shown.An antibody molecule. The two heavy chains are colored red and blue and the two light chains green and yellow. The immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) is the large polypeptide subunit of an antibody (immunoglobulin). In human genome, the IgH gene loci are on chromosome 14. A typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains and two Ig light chains. Several different types of heavy chain exist that define the class or isotype of an antibody. These heavy chain types vary between different animals. All heavy chains contain a series of immunoglobulin domains, usually with one variable domain (VH) that is important for binding antigen and several constant domains (CH1, CH2, etc.). Production of a viable heavy chain is a key step in B cell maturation. If the heavy chain is able to bind to a surrogate light chain and move to the plasma membrane, then the developing B cell can begin producing its light chain. The heavy chain doesn't always have to bind to a light chain. Pre-B lymphocytes can synthesize heavy chain in the absence of light chain, which then can allow the heavy chain to bind to a heavy-chain binding protein. In mammals =Classes= There are five types of mammalian immunoglobulin heavy chain: γ, δ, α, μ and ε. They define classes of immunoglobulins: IgG, IgD, IgA, IgM and IgE, respectively. * Heavy chains α and γ have approximately 450 amino acids. * Heavy chains μ and ε have approximately 550 amino acids. =Regions= Each heavy chain has two regions: * a constant region (which is the same for all immunoglobulins of the same class but differs between classes). ** Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line next to each other) immunoglobulin domains but also have a hinge region for added flexibility. ** Heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four domains. * a variable region that differs between different B cells, but is the same for all immunoglobulins produced by the same B cell or B cell clone. The variable domain of any heavy chain is composed of a single immunoglobulin domain. These domains are about 110 amino acids long. =Cows= Cows, specifically Bos taurus, show a variation on the general mammalian theme in which the heavy chain CDR H3 region has adapted to produce a divergent repertoire of antibodies which present a \\"stalk and knob\\" antigen interaction surface instead of the more familiar bivalent tip surface. The bovine CDR is unusually long and contains unique sequence attributes which support the production of paired cysteine residues during somatic hypermutation. Thus, where in humans the somatic hypermutation step targets the V(D)J recombination process, the target in cows is on the creation of diverse disulfide bonds and the generation of unique sets of loops which interact with antigen. A speculated evolutionary driver for this variation is the presence of a vastly more diverse microbial environment in the digestive system of the cow as a consequence of their being ruminants. In fish Jawed fish appear to be the most primitive animals that are able to make antibodies like those described for mammals.Fish heavy chain and light chain genes However, fish do not have the same repertoire of antibodies that mammals possess. Three distinct Ig heavy chains have so far been identified in bony fish. * The first identified was the μ (or mu) heavy chain that is present in all jawed fish and is the heavy chain for what is thought to be the primordial immunoglobulin. The resulting antibody, IgM, is secreted as a tetramer in teleost fish instead of the typical pentamer found in mammals and sharks. * The heavy chain (δ) for IgD was identified initially from the channel catfish and Atlantic salmon and is now well documented for many teleost fish. * The third teleost Ig heavy chain gene was identified very recently and does not resemble any of the heavy chains so far described for mammals. This heavy chain, identified in both rainbow trout (τ) and zebrafish (ζ), could potentially form a distinct antibody isotype (IgT or IgZ) that may precede IgM in evolutionary terms. Similar to the situation observed for bony fish, three distinct Ig heavy chain isotypes have been identified in cartilaginous fish. With the exception of μ, these Ig heavy chain isotypes appear to be unique to cartilaginous fish. The resulting antibodies are designated IgW (also called IgX or IgNARC) and IgNAR (immunoglobulin new antigen receptor). The latter type is a heavy-chain antibody, an antibody lacking light chains, and can be used to produce single- domain antibodies, which are essentially the variable domain (VNAR) of an IgNAR. Shark single domain antibodies (VNARs) to tumor or viral antigens can be isolated from a large naïve nurse shark VNAR library using phage display technology. IgW has now also been found in the group of lobe finned fishes including the coelacanth and lungfish. The IgW1 and IgW2 in coelacanth has a usual (VD)n-Jn-C structure as well as having a large number of constant domains. In amphibians Frogs can synthesize IgX and IgY.

Being one of the oldest camps in Canada, the Haliburton Scout Reserve opened in 1947 and has been operated consistently by Scouts Canada. HSR is located in the heart of the Haliburton highlands with 18 lakes and a rolling natural landscape rich in nature and untouched beauty. Centered on Kennabi Lake to the southeast of the property are 24 campsites accessible by water. HSR is Canada's largest Scout camp and third largest in North America. Scout troops normally come to the camp for week-long summer camps. The young and energetic HSR staff provide numerous adventurous programs for tens of thousands of scouts from around the world. HSR, as it is commonly known, is currently operated under Greater Toronto Council supervising the 50-70 young, well- trained resident staff who cooperate to run the diverse camp program throughout the summer months. History Following World War II, Toronto Scout District (now Greater Toronto Council) wanted a rugged site for Scout camping. Their camping committee eventually located a site owned by the Mill Valley Lumber Company in now, Haliburton County, which was completing cutting in that area. The property was purchased in the fall of 1946 and opened the following summer as Camp Kennabi. Many of the original lumber camp buildings are still in use. The first Camp Chief was Field Commissioner James C. Moore, after whom Moore Lake and the J. C. Trail are now named. Starting in 1953, a composite camp (consisting of scouts from various troops attending as individuals with leadership provided by the camp staff) called Camp Kennaway, was run on the site. Camp Kennaway and Camp Kennabi merged in 1960 to form Haliburton Scout Reserve. Over the years, various plots of land were added to the original purchase. Since 1947, thousands of Scouts from North America, Europe, and Asia along with many other areas globally have visited the reserve to experience its fantastic adventure-centered program within the worldly- unique setting of the Canadian wilderness. Since its earliest days, the camp has operated under the supervision of senior staff members supervising young staff members hired to run camp programs and help provide food and maintenance for the staff that do so. Staff members are more than often brought on for their first summer in a volunteer capacity, known as a Staff in Training or SIT This offers a chance to try their hand at the many positions that the camp has to offer for paid staff members that not only offers preferred hiring opportunities for the following summer but also a magnificent addition to any resume and the chance to fill out some if not all of your secondary school required volunteer hours. Staff are also hired in paid capacity right from the start if their abilities provide that opportunity. Staff spend the summer in a beautiful settings with powered room and board provided. Program =Staffed programs= The Shoe Tree outside the entrance of the Scout Reserve. After driving to your site on Saturday after you arrive, HSR's trained staff run a variety of instructional programs during the week starting with driving to the hub area for basic Canoe lessons on Sunday to get your group started with daily transportation. Programs throughout the week include: * Sailing lessons * Kayak lessons * Riflery with .22 calibre rifles on a range. * Archery * Trapper's Cabin - Scouts visit a reconstructed cabin from the fur trapping era and learn about trapping and logging, both of which were practised on the land that is now HSR. * Survival Island — Scouts learn about building shelters, purifying water, and how to become found if one is lost in the woods. * Rappelling- Scouts get the chance to rappel down a 50-foot rock face deep in the Haliburton Wilderness. * Climbing Wall * Low Ropes course - An obstacle course including tight rope walks, slate bridges, etc. * Snorkel Island — Scouts don mask, snorkel, and fins and search for treasures in the water near the island. * Mountain Biking - Scout troops are taken for a three- hour ride to one of the few different locations * Star Hike — Troops are barged to the middle of Kennabi Lake to look at the stars and hear stories about the constellations under a dark, milky way lit sky with full city-less view of the milky way streak. A must see for any youth from urban environments. * Badge Trading — Scouts gather at the Hub on Tuesday evening from approximately 6:30 to 8:30 to trade and show badges. Present are youth and Leaders of all ages trading badges from their large collections. A must see for anyone in camp as the many attendees usually have large badge collections present with many decades of patches represented. =HSR Regatta= Thursday afternoon is the famous HSR Regatta. Troops gather at the Hub to compete in a variety of friendly water-based activities. The events normally include: * War Canoe race — A race in which there are ten scouts in each war canoe. (This race uses two of the three ten person war canoes owned by the reserve) * PFD Swim — Swimming while wearing a PFD (Personal Flotation Device) * Match Swim — Contestants must swim from one dock to another carrying a match. The winner is the first to light their match. Matches are normally carried in the mouth to keep them dry. * Medly Swim — Four Scouts swim in a relay, each using a different stroke (back stroke, breast stroke, side stroke, and free style). * Head-Up Front Crawl Race - Venturers swim two laps of head- up front crawl * In and Out Canoe Race — Scouts race canoes. When a whistle is blown, Scouts must jump out then climb back in before continuing. * Canoe Sculling Race — Scouts race three to a canoe without paddles using their hands for propulsion. * Canoe-Over-Canoe Race — Four Scouts with two canoes from each site race. When a whistle is blown, one canoe must swamp and be rescued by the other using canoe-over-canoe rescue, and then both canoes must race back to shore. *Kayak Race - Venturers compete in an individual kayak race. *Solo Canoe Race - Venturers compete in an individual canoe soloing race. Although points are usually kept during the event, the rewards are usually restricted to friendly bragging rights and a take-home home trophy. Although the bragging rights seem to be more than enough to instill friendly competition between troops. A must-see for any attendee. =Camp-wide Fire= On Friday evening, the staff host a camp-wide campfire at Smokey Hollow, located just east of the hub down the camp road. Each group usually prepares a song or skit to perform at the campfire as a final send-off to the week long camp before departing on Saturday. At the same time as arriving for this fire in their canoes at the waterfront in front of the hub, campers can sign themselves in with their song or skit along as their canoes and they will be drove back to their site for the night on the pontoon boats before being drove out on the same boats the following morning. This is done to save time the following morning by having the canoes brought back on the night of the campfire. Due to the early morning the next day, Groups will be called from the campfire to leave in numerical order with some required to remain longer based on their departure time the next morning. =Program resources= Scouts will have access to their assigned canoes all week and rowboats present at site while kayaks, and sailboats will be available by request of a staff member after they have had their respective lesson in the craft. Kennabi Lake offers excellent fishing. Important to note is the license required to fish within Canadian inland waters for all who wish to do so, international or domestic in origin. These can be acquired online prior too arrival or at numerous outdoor shops throughout Ontario. For those wishing to venture off on their own to explore there are many day trips available including visiting the logging museum within Algonquin Provincial Park, seeing undomesticated wolves at the Haliburton Forest & Wildlife Reserve, or climbing up the Dorset County Scenic Lookout Tower in the town of Haliburton. =Hiking= HSR has an extensive network of marked hiking trails and outpost campsites, ideal for overnight hikes throughout the approximately 5000 acres of camp property. Hiking trails wind their way through forests and over rock formations typical of the Canadian Shield. One can often see wildlife, such as deer on these hikes. Popular hiking destinations include High Falls, where one can have a shower under the waterfall; Pike's Peak, a must-see, being the highest point on camp property offering a fantastic view of the rolling highlands; and Hurst Lake, where there is a large shelter and a supply of canoes. Campers are encouraged to plan out excursions in great detail with experienced staff due to the large amount of unused and overgrown trails not present on camp maps due to natural rehabilitation and to reduce risk of lost campers on such a large fence-less property. Facilities The central facility at HSR for its staffers is called the Hub. Just below the Hub is the Trading Post where souvenirs, snacks, and a small amount of camping equipment are available for purchase. Nearby, just westward down the main camp road and down a small path southward past the camp clinic is the Dobson Centre, where the Country Store is located. The Country Store, essentially a small and basic grocery stop, stocks a full line of food and can make special orders (credit card facilities are NOT available anywhere in camp). Also located here is the camp office. Here, the campers and troop leaders can have any of their questions answered by a knowledgeable and experienced administrative staff. The camp clinic just north of this building is staffed by either a doctor and/or a nurse during each week long camp, available for necessary camp medical issues that may arise. For emergencies not treatable in camp, transportation is available into the town of Haliburton 23 minutes away that holds a fully staffed hospital installation. Around Kennabi Lake and on its many islands are 24 troop campsites, often with one closed on rotation every summer for natural re- growth. Each of these include a dock, swimming area, picnic tables, ground cooler for food, outdoor kybos, rowboats, campfire circle, and several patrol sites. These offer a unique semi-secluded lakeside camping experience within the confines of the supervised camp. A very hard to find aspect within other camps throughout other North American establishments. Haliburton Scout Reserve Staff Alumni Association The Haliburton Scout Reserve Staff Alumni was founded in 1989 and exists to provide former staff members of the Haliburton Scout Reserve with a sense of ongoing fellowship, camp news and history through linking present and past staff members, while promoting service to the camp through donations and service projects. A variety of activities are conducted each year, both social and service-oriented. Members are encouraged to participate in whatever activities for which they are available. For the majority of members who live outside the Toronto area, the Alumni Thunderbird newsletter is what keeps them connected. In regards to the actual camp, the HSRAA provides a bursary offered to one current staff member who is attending post secondary education that is announced during the Alumni Weekend. During this weekend, the staff play an annual cricket game against the alumni. Any former staff member is eligible to join the HSR Staff Alumni, free of charge.

London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) 6170 (later 46170) British Legion was a British steam locomotive. It was the prototype for, and is sometimes considered a member of, the Rebuilt Royal Scot Class but differed from those later rebuilds principally in having a unique type 2 boiler, rather than a type 2A boiler, the two not being interchangeable.  Overview  6170 was constructed in 1935 utilising the frames of the unsuccessful experimental high pressure compound locomotive 6399 Fury. The Schmidt-Henschel boiler was replaced with a taper boiler, designed by William Stanier, and a new smokebox and inside cylinder were fitted. The locomotive was named after the British Legion and given a number as part of the Royal Scot Class. The boiler type was type 2. It remained the only Class 6P rebuild until 1942 when two Jubilee Class engines 5735 Comet and 5736 Phoenix were also rebuilt with 2A boilers. After that, the LMS rebuilt all 70 of the Royal Scots, between 1943 and 1955 and 18 of the Patriot Class between 1946 and 1949 with 2A boilers. Thus 6170 was a prototype of a family of LMS 2A boilered 4-6-0s. When built, 6170 was given the standard passenger livery of LMS crimson lake and was the only rebuilt Scot to wear that livery whilst in service, though 6100 Royal Scot carries it in preservation. There were numerous differences between 6170 and the other rebuilt Scots. 6170's boiler was longer and it had a new cab with side windows, whereas the other rebuilt Scots retained their old cut-out cabs (the rebuilt Jubilees retained their original side window cabs and the rebuilt Patriots gained new side window cabs). It was the only rebuilt Scot built with a single chimney. Changes during its lifetime saw the fitting of a double chimney and smoke deflectors. After nationalisation in 1948, 6170 was renumbered 46170. It was withdrawn in 1962 and subsequently scrapped.

Background The Connecticut Western Reserve was established by Connecticut's cession of its Ohio and Illinois Country land claims in 1785. The later designated Firelands western portion of the Reserve extended west of the Treaty line established by the Treaty of Fort McIntosh that same year. Conflicts over the area, which was in Indian Country, erupted almost immediately after the treaty signing. While the Treaty of Greenville generally brought peace to the Ohio Country frontier, the Western Reserve boundary line problem was not resolved until the Firelands portion was acquired by the Treaty of Fort Industry. Aftermath The location of Fort Industry is one of the enduring mysteries of the western frontier. The place of the signing was on the upper Maumee River though the exact location is lost to history. It was possibly a temporary stockade or fortification erected just for the signing. Local tradition places the fort at the mouth of the Swan River on the Maumee in Toledo, Ohio, although there is no documented record of this. U.S. government and military records do not mention that any fort or post was ever built there or anywhere with that name. The name does not appear in period letters and documents before or after that time. The name is often associated with Gen. Anthony Wayne as one of the forts he built along the western Ohio border in the Northwest Indian War more than a decade before. However, Gen. Wayne had been dead for nine years at the time of the signing.

An Ontario Heritage Trust plaque at the site notes that the 1844 church is the oldest surviving church in the city. The cornerstone for the Tudor Gothic church was laid on July 20, 1843, and the first services were held February 14, 1844 making it the oldest surviving church building in Toronto. It was the second Anglican church in the city, after St. James' Cathedral. The church is so named to distinguish itself from the later Church of the Holy Trinity. The architect was 25-year-old Henry Bowyer Lane who had recently immigrated from England. The structure is red brick with accents of tan brick and stone. Local craftsmen donated many of the bricks and their labor to construct the church. The square bell tower has contrasting octagonal buttresses at each of its four corners. The congregation was established in eastern Toronto on July 12, 1842 for working-class families unable to pay the high pew prices at St. James', and so they built a church for all people. Little Trinity has always been a church whose life is rooted in the word of God, the Holy Bible - it is an Evangelical Anglican Church. For about 100 years, from the 1890s, the motto of the church was \\"holding forth the word of life\\" (Phillipians 2:14). In 1889, the church was enlarged to provide 600 seats for the congregation. Part of the addition was destroyed by fire in early 1961. After 14-months of reconstruction, the congregation returned in March 1962. During this renovation, the floor of the nave was raised to allow for construction of an activity hall on the lower level. Little Trinity has sent dozens of church members overseas to serve the development and spiritual needs of nations around the world. In 2014, a new office space was opened at 403 King Street East, in a revitalized heritage building. The present multi-generational congregation is made up of members of many backgrounds from across the Toronto region. There is a Sunday School programme and a youth programme. Each week, worship services are held on Sunday morning and Sunday evening.

Dunn (1893) 6 R. 67, H.L. is a famous British House of Lords decision on the rules of cross examination. From this case came the common law rule known as the \\"Browne v Dunn rule\\" or \\"The rule in Browne v Dunn\\". The rule in Browne v Dunn basically entails that a cross examiner cannot rely on evidence that is contradictory to the testimony of the witness without putting the evidence to the witness in order to allow them to attempt to justify the contradiction. Therefore, under this rule if a witness gives testimony that is inconsistent with what the opposing party wants to lead as evidence, the opposing party must raise the contention with that witness during cross- examination. This rule can be seen as an anti-ambush rule because it prevents a party from putting forward a case without first affording opposing witnesses the opportunity of responding to it. This not having been done, that party cannot later bring evidence to contradict the testimony of the witness. The decision arose out of a civil case involving the parties James Loxham Browne and Cecil W. Dunn (solicitor). The case stemmed from a document issued by Dunn on behalf of others addressed to Browne. The document indicated that the signatories, all residents of The Vale, Hampstead, requested Dunn apply for an order against Browne to keep the peace. At a subsequent Breach of the Peace hearing, Browne became aware of the document and commenced libel proceedings against all parties. During that hearing the document was never shown to any of the signatories by Browne during his cross examination. During the hearing Browne produced the document citing it \\"a sham\\". The jury eventually found in favour of Browne and ordered damages of 20 shillings. Dunn appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the verdict was set aside. Browne then appealed to the House of Lords. During that appeal it was discovered that a number of the signatories were present at the original trial and none of them was asked if the document was anything but genuine. The rule is best described in the judgment of Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation, who observed: :It has in my experience always been a rule of professional practice that, unless notice has already clearly been given of the cross-examiner's intention to rely upon such matter, it is necessary to put to an opponent's witness in cross-examination the nature of the case upon which it is proposed to rely in contradiction of his evidence, particularly where that case relies upon inferences to be drawn from other evidence in the proceedings. Such a rule of practice is necessary both to give the witness the opportunity to deal with that other evidence, or the inferences to be drawn from it, and to allow the other party the inference sought to be drawn.Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 16. Supreme Court (NSW, Australia). Lord Herschell originally explained it as: :... I cannot help saying that it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit. My Lords, I have always understood that if you intend to impeach a witness you are bound, whilst he is in the box, to give him an opportunity of making any explanation which is open to him; and, as it seems to me, that is not only a rule of professional practice in the conduct of a case, but is essential to fair play and fair dealing with witnesses. The practical necessity is obvious, as Wells J noted in Reid v Kerr:Reid v Kerr (1974) 9 SASR 367 at 373-4. Supreme Court (SA, Australia). :... a judge (or a jury) is entitled to have presented to him (or them) issues of facts that are well and truly joined on the evidence; there is nothing more frustrating to a tribunal of fact than to be presented with two important bodies of evidence which are inherently opposed in substance but which, because Browne v Dunn has not been observed, have not been brought into direct opposition, and serenely pass one another like two trains in the night. The rule has been adopted in most common law countries, including South Africa, Australia and Fiji, and it remains one of the primary rules of consideration during cross-examination. In Australia the rule in Browne v Dunn overlaps with section 46 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). In New Zealand it has been codified as section 92 of the Evidence Act 2006.

She is best known for her Western film roles opposite Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, and Gene Autry and for her two-year tenure as inquisitive amateur sleuth Pam North on the television and radio series Mr. and Mrs. North. Early life Britton was born September 26, 1920, in Long Beach, California. Her involvement with stage productions began when she was 14. She attended Polytechnic High School and Long Beach City College, majoring in speech with the intention of working as a speech and drama teacher. While in school, she began to show an interest in acting and working on local stage productions. Britton was a Republican, and she campaigned for Dwight D. Eisenhower in both 1952 and 1956.Hollywood Trivia by David P. Strauss, 1984; Greenwich House. Pg. 104 Career In 1941, while appearing in a Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade, a photo of Britton was used on the front page of a local newspaper. A talent scout took notice, and she was soon signed to a Paramount Pictures contract. (Another source says that a talent scout spotted her as the lead in the production of The Old Maid at her college, and \\"three weeks later she was signed by Paramount Pictures as a stock player.\\") =Film= That same year, she appeared in her first two films: the William Boyd Western Secrets of the Wasteland and Louisiana Purchase starring Bob Hope. Her first major film appearance was in a small role in the John Wayne film Reap the Wild Wind (1942). During the 1940s Britton starred in three films for which she is most recognized today, two of which co-starred Randolph Scott. The first was the 1945 film Captain Kidd with Scott, followed by The Virginian in 1946 opposite Joel McCrea. The third was the 1947 Randolph Scott film Gunfighters. She teamed with Scott again in the 1948 Western Albuquerque, and that same year she starred opposite Gene Autry in Loaded Pistols.

The goal of fire prevention is to educate the public to take precautions to prevent potentially harmful fires, and be educated about surviving them. It is a proactive method of preventing emergencies and reducing the damage caused by them. Many fire departments have one or more Fire Prevention Officers, which may also be a routine duty of firefighters. In the general sense of preventing harmful fires, many aspects are discussed in the articles Fire protection and Fire safety. In the United States, national work on best practices is in the Vision 2020 program. Target audiences =Students= Children are the primary target of fire prevention knowledge. Firefighters will often visit schools and teach students the basics of fire prevention and fire safety, including how to evacuate from a burning building and how to prevent fires by avoiding dangerous activities such as playing with matches. =Elderly and disabled people= Elderly and disabled people are potentially at greater risk in emergency situations as a result of poor mobility or not understanding the danger they are in. Fire prevention outreach often involves ensuring that these groups have a clearly defined plan of what to do in the event of an emergency and easy access to emergency exits. = Landlords = In many jurisdictions, landlords are responsible for implementing fire prevention and fire safety measures in accordance with various laws. Lessons Fire prevention education can take the form of videos, pamphlets, and banners. Often, the messages and lessons are simple tips. Common lessons taught during fire prevention seminars include: =Stop, drop and roll= Stop, drop and roll is often taught as part of fire prevention education efforts as it is both a simple technique to learn, and an effective way of extinguishing burning clothing. It is particularly suited to children who may panic if their clothing catches fire and they do not know how to put it out. =Smoke detector installation and maintenance= Generally taught more to adults (particularly homeowners), a core part of fire prevention outreach involves encouraging people to ensure that they have an adequate number of smoke detectors installed in their homes, and that they are kept in good working order and tested regularly. These steps can significantly reduce deaths in household firesSmoke Alarms in Reported U.S. Home Fire www.nfpa.org U.S. Experience with Smoke Alarms, NFPA Fire Analysis and Research, Quincy, MassachusettsSmoke Detectors Village of Greendale, Wisconsin, particularly at night when people are sleeping.Smoke Alarm Fact Sheet The Fire Marshall’s Public Fire Safety Council, Ontario Public Fire Safety Council Smoke detectors commonly make a persistent beeping sound when their batteries run low, and a key part of fire prevention outreach involves encouraging people to replace batteries promptly instead of just removing them to make the beeping stop. =Wet pipe sprinkler systems= A wet-pipe sprinkler system is an automatic sprinkler system in which the supply valves are open and the system is charged with water under supply pressure at all times. For this reason, they are the quickest at getting water on the fire and are the simplest to maintain. Wet pipe systems are installed where indoor temperatures can he maintained at or above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Below that temperature, there is the danger of freezing pipes. If the outside temperature is below freezing and the interior temperature is less than forty degrees Fahrenheit, the steel sprinkler piping, which rapidly conducts heat and rapidly loses it, will drop below freezing. The frozen area may be isolated and near an opening or uninsulated portion of the building. It may be a small area, but it could be enough to put the whole system out of service. =Abandoned cooking and appliances= Teaching people not to leave stoves, ovens, toasters, clothing irons, barbecues, and candles unattended can help to reduce fires as a result. =Firefighters are here to help= One of the most critical jobs of a firefighter is search and rescue. For young children, it is important that firefighters are seen as people they can follow and trust. A firefighter in bunker gear breathing with an air tank could be an unfamiliar sight, especially to a child. One way a child can get used to or trust a firefighter is seeing a firefighter dress, step by step, seeing that they are a person wearing a uniform and protective equipment. Furthermore, being able to walk up and touch the firefighter can reassure the child that he or she is a real person. (This has been implemented by many fire departments across the US during Fire Prevention Week.) =Discouraging playing with fire= Though fire can be a source of fascination for young children, the potential for accidents as a result is high. Fire prevention often aims to teach children not to play with fire so that they do not accidentally cause a conflagration. =Reduction of false alarms= Much of fire prevention education also involves advice on how to reduce false alarms. False alarms have the potential to waste manpower and resources, which may be needed desperately at a real emergency. In addition, firefighters responding to calls in fire engines are at increased risk of traffic collisions when driving under emergency conditions. In 2008 the state of New York found that 18% of firefighter deaths in the line of duty had occurred whilst responding to calls. Fire prevention inspections Many fire departments have fire prevention divisions, which consist of groups of firefighters who conduct building inspections to make sure they are compliant with fire codes; they also visit schools and daycare centers to make presentations about arson, malicious false alarms, and fire safety. Fire Prevention Officers may also conduct tours of their fire house for visitors. They demonstrate what each of their apparatuses does, and sometimes will don their bunker gear to show what a firefighter wears into a fire. A typical fire prevention division consists of a Chief Fire Prevention Officer, below whom are Fire Prevention Officers. Those in the Fire Prevention Division have their own insignia, such as epaulets with two thin bars that read \\"FIRE PREVENTION OFFICER\\" below them; crescents on their helmets; and collar pins. Depending on its budget, a Division may have its own fire vehicle. In Canada the national Fire Protection division is known as FIPRECAN, and is the national voice for fire protection and education in Canada. FIPRECAN is a non-profit charitable agency founded in 1976. They educate the public themselves as well as forming a partnership with fire services. David Johnston, the former Governor General of Canada, is one of the patrons. Fire Prevention Canada primarily promotes and educates by: * Working with all levels of the government * Working with fire services to promote fire prevention week activities * Working with other fire prevention and safety organizations * Partnering with the Federal Government of Canada On their website Fiprecan.ca, many safety educational materials can be found. These forms are downloadable and printable. All of the information is free of charge. A few of the available topics are listed below. * Cooking precautions * Babysitters guide * Escape plan * Fire extinguishers * Smoke alarm * Farm safety October 3-9 is fire protection week in Canada. Various fire organizations and fire professionals from all across the country attend, along with a number of students and teachers. Songs and entertainment regarding to fire safety is also available making fire education fun. Guest speakers are also a large part of fire protection week. Children also generally receive prizes. In Alberta, Canada, Alberta Industrial Fire Association is a dominant fire safety educator. They host events year-round ranging from conferences, to skill competitions. A number of presentations can be found on their website aifpa.org regarding a wide variety of topics such as a) Awareness and Planning b) Safety Products c) General Tips Alberta Industrial Fire Association was founded in 1989 by Len Freeman and Brian Lamond. Alberta Industrial Fire Association's mission statement is: To promote awareness of industrial fire protection and emergency services by information sharing, joint problem solving to minimize damage, loss and injury throughout the industry in the Province of Alberta. Fire Prevention Week Fire Prevention Week is observed in the United States in October. *2009 - October 4–10 Theme: \\"Stay Fire Smart! Don’t Get Burned\\" *2010 - October 3–9 Theme: TBA Many fire departments observe \\"Fire Prevention Month\\" for all of October.

She was the youngest child and fifth daughter of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom. Her mother was the second daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Marie died of diphtheria and was buried with her mother, who died a few weeks later of the same disease. Infancy Marie with her elder siblings Irene, Alix and Ernest in about 1876 She had six older siblings, Victoria, Elizabeth, Irene, Ernest, Friedrich, and Alix. Marie was known as \\"May\\" in the family. When she was a baby, her mother remarked in a letter that \\"little sister Maly\\" bore a strong resemblance to her dead brother Friedrich (\\"Frittie\\") at the same age \\"with such quick eyes and two deep dimples in her cheeks.\\" A few weeks later, Alice wrote that baby \\"Maly\\" had fair skin, light brown hair and deep blue eyes. As she grew older, she smiled frequently and Alice thought she more strongly resembled her older sister Victoria, with \\"fair hair, marked eyebrows and speaking eyes.\\" She and her sister Alix, two years older, \\"made a pretty contrast.\\" Her mother thought her youngest child was \\"enchanting\\" and as a toddler the little girl called her mother \\"my 'weetheart.\\"Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1885. Alix was her constant companion. The two girls were dressed alike and shared the nursery.Mager (1998), p. 56 The family enjoyed a trip to the seaside in the summer of 1877 and the two youngest girls were a source of delight to their mother. Sending photos taken then to her mother, Queen Victoria, Alice wrote that \\"May has not such fat cheeks in reality; still it is very dear. The two little girlies are so sweet, so dear, merry, and nice. I don't know which is dearest, they are both so captivating.\\"Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1885 Diphtheria Marie in the summer of 1878 at Southampton Tragedy struck the grand ducal family in 1878. As her sister Victoria described the scene later, the family had been gathered together on the evening of 5 November when she developed a stiff neck. Victoria reported her symptoms to their mother, who thought it might be mumps and said it would be \\"comical\\" if they all caught it. Victoria felt well enough to read Alice in Wonderland to her younger siblings, while her mother sat nearby chatting with her friend Katie Macbean, who was filling in for an absent lady-in-waiting. Marie leaped up and begged her mother to let her have more cake. Her siblings asked Miss Macbean to play the piano so they could dance. They danced for half an hour and went to bed in high spirits. The next morning Victoria was diagnosed with diphtheria; at three in the morning on 12 November, six-year-old Alix was diagnosed with the disease. Princess Alice ordered a steam inhaler be brought to her room to prevent the seriously ill Alix from choking to death. Hours later, Princess Marie ran into her mother's room, crawled into bed with her and kissed her. By afternoon, Marie as well was displaying the symptoms of the disease, suffering from a high fever. White spots and a white membrane covered the back of her throat. The next day her sister Irene became ill and on the day of 14 November her brother Ernest and father Louis also became ill with diphtheria. Alice and the doctors nursed the family round the clock. On the morning of 16 November, Marie choked to death from the membrane covering her throat. Her mother, awakened by the doctors, hurried to the nursery, only to find her daughter dead. Alice sat by her daughter's body, kissing Marie's face and hands, trying to work up the strength to tell her ill husband. She watched as Marie's coffin was wheeled off to the family mausoleum. For weeks, Alice concealed Marie's death from the other sick children, who asked about her and tried to send their little sister toys. Elizabeth, who had been sent to stay with her paternal grandmother, was the only child who escaped infection. The sick children were finally told at the beginning of December that Marie had died. Ten-year-old Ernest at first refused to believe the news and then broke down in tears. His mother hugged and kissed him, despite the risk of infection. On 7 December Alice recognized the symptoms of diphtheria in herself. She died on the morning of 14 December, murmuring \\"From Friday to Saturday -- four weeks -- May -- dear Papa.\\"Mager (1998), pp. 52-56 Alice was interred beside her daughter. A statue by Joseph Boehm was placed on the tomb of Alice holding Marie in her arms.Mager (1998), p. 58 It is commonly believed that Marie's niece, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, the third daughter of Alix and her husband Nikolai II of Russia, was named for her and the Dowager Empress of Russia, Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark).

Created by writer Garth Ennis and artists John McCrea and Steve Dillon, the team first appeared in Hitman #18 (September 1997). The team is named after the military designation for \\"mentally unfit for duty\\". History The team is based in The Cauldron, the Irish section of Gotham City, and is led by Sixpack. They apparently have some sort of heroic history (though this is questionable, owing to the fact that several of their members seem prone to complicated hallucinations) prior to the events of Hitman. The team is headquartered on an artificial island in a sewer. As of the start of the series, the team is split up, although they are all still located within Gotham City. Friendly Fire, Shakes, and Jean de Baton-Baton had retired; the Defenestrator was in Arkham Asylum after throwing a cop through the same window fourteen times; Dogwelder and Flemgem were still stalking the streets of Gotham.Hitman #18 Sixpack was a regular at Noonan's Sleazy Bar, believing his drunken dreams of superhero work were real. The team reforms to provide critical support for Tommy Monaghan and his crew during the \\"Ace of Killers\\" storyline. Collectively, they kill many mafia soldiers that were trying to kill Tommy, Natt the Hat, Detective Tiegel and Catwoman. The group later aids Tommy during his encounter with the Czarnian mercenary anti-hero Lobo. Specifically, they aid Tommy in creating material blackmailing a stunned Lobo with the help of Bueno Excellente which prevents Lobo from taking revenge against any of them.Hitman/Lobo: That Stupid Bastich Sixpack makes several solo appearances in Hitman as comic relief and an ally in some battles. In their last appearance, the team was starting to split up again after Friendly Fire pointed out how pathetic they were and that all they did was meet once a month and achieve nothing. Sixpack is left distraught when Friendly Fire points out, in anger, that all his 'superhero' missions are just drunken dreams. However, when the demonic Multi-Angled Ones arose in Gotham, Section 8 rallied to fight them. Their attempt was completely unsuccessful: most of the team die or accidentally kill themselves. However, the Many-Angled Ones become interested in Sixpack when the flames from an explosion don't touch him, and when he tells them that he'd be willing to die standing against them because \\"that's what superheroes do\\". The demons are left amused and a deal is made where Sixpack will leave with them and try to battle against them for his own soul, in exchange for leaving Earth alone. Sixpack has a statue built in a park in his honor of his sacrifice (a parody of the end of Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?), though he is shown still alive (and sane) in New York City at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, implying that his \\"battle for his soul\\" is facing his addiction to alcohol. Bueno Excellente survived the battle as well and avenges their loss on the scientist responsible for releasing the Many Angled Ones.Hitman #51–52 In June 2015, DC began publishing \\"All-Star Section Eight\\", by Ennis and McCrea.Review:All-Star Section Eight #1, by Matt Little, at Comic Book Resources; published June 10, 2015; retrieved June 11, 2015 When Sixpack has a near-death experience, the Phantom Stranger reveals that the dead members of Section Eight were sent to Limbo, with the exception of Dogwelder, who was apparently condemned to Hell because, \\"he welded dogs to people, for ******'s sake!\\" Members *Sixpack: Team leader, whose special ability is grotesque drunkenness and beating villains with broken-off liquor bottles; he talks in a stream of comic clichés. He thinks he is a real superhero and does not seem to realise that all his superheroic encounters are just drunken dreams, and gets upset when he's told they are not real. A regular at Noonan's Sleazy Bar, he fights against the vampires in No Man's Land and at the Battle of Noonan's Bar in \\"The Old Dog\\". *Bueno Excellente: An obese, sweaty, and bald Latino in an overcoat who \\"defeats evil with the power of perversion\\". Generally, the only things he says are \\"Bueno\\" or \\"Excellente\\", often preceded by a creepy chuckle. That Stupid Bastich reveals that he has a career in porn films. He has also become a small internet meme and in the two-issue miniseries JLA/Hitman it is revealed that Bueno Excellente had apparently date-raped Kyle Rayner by slipping something into his drink. This is only mentioned in passing as Kyle does not remember the incident. *The Defenestrator: A large, burly man in a denim jacket, black sunglasses, with black hair who obsessively carries around a window through which he forcefully throws criminals and the occasional unlucky policeman. His assaults on police officers landed him in Arkham Asylum. His appearance, name, and his death (and last words) are direct parodies of Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. *Dogwelder: A thin, silent man in a welder's mask who spot welds dead canines to evildoers. When Sixpack tries to bring him back to the team, Dogwelder almost welds him on general instinct. *Friendly Fire: A large, hapless man in a red cowl, Friendly Fire would easily be the most powerful of Section 8's heroes if he were to shoot anything other than allies with the potent bolts of energy he fires from his hands. He is the most defeatist member of the team and the only one who will state how pathetic the team is (though he apologises to Sixpack for revealing the truth), but he still wore his costume even in retirement. He blew his own head off when trying his hardest to shoot the right target. *Jean de Baton-Baton: A bizarrely gaunt walking French caricature who defeats enemies with \\"the power of Frenchness\\", as expressed by savage beatings with a baguette and occasionally blinding others with rings of garlic and onions. *Flemgem: A sickly, thin, bald man in a green suit and a purple domino mask who has the ability to produce and expel large volumes of phlegm, which can blind, suffocate, or simply disgust evildoers. *Shakes: A thin, hairy vagrant who upsets people through stutters and an overall shaking palsy. He is a frequent accidental target of Friendly Fire. He dies trying to take out the Many-Angled Ones, when he grabs a grenade and runs to a petrol station. Following Sixpack's accidental return to alcoholism, he assembles a new Section 8 to combat a mysterious (and possibly imagined) threat. Sixpack convinces Bueno Excellente to reenlist, brings in five new members, and attempts to fill the vacant eighth position with someone from the Justice League. * Baytor: The Demon Lord of Criminal Insanity, and caretaker of Noonan's Bar. * Dogwelder II: The preceding Dogwelder's gear was acquired by a pawn shop, where it possessed an African-American man, and transformed him into the new Dogwelder. * The Grapplah!: A man with grappling hooks and guns who is also \\"an annoying tool who won't shut his stupid mouth\\". * Powertool: A rational, construction-themed vigilante with a drill in his helmet's faceplate. * Guts: An ambulatory and female mass of internal organs arranged in a vaguely humanoid shape. * 3 Unnamed New Members In Other Media *James Gunn mentioned on Twitter he considered to have Dogwelder in The Suicide Squad but did not feel the character should be expressed cinematically.https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1300162042100211712https://screenrant.com/suicide- squad-2-movie-james-gunn-dogwelder/ During production of the movie, fans petitioned to have Dogwelder in the movie, with McCrea giving his support for it.https://bleedingcool.com/comics/john-mccrea-supports-petiton-to-get-james- gunn-to-put-dogwelder-in-suicide-squad-2/ References External links *DCU Guide: Section 8 *Cosmic Teams: Section 8 *Dogwelder cited as one of Comic Book Resources' \\"Reasons To Love Comics\\" * \\"The Top Ten Lamest Superheroes of All Time\\" from PopCultureAddict.com (#6, Dogwelder) 1997 comics debuts DC Comics superhero teams Internet memes Characters created by Garth Ennis ","title":"Section 8 (comics)"},{"id":"2980450","text":"Wallace King was an African American blackface minstrel performer from the 19th century.

In 2015 the school was renamed the Center for Swedenborgian Studies and it affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union (GTU). It continues to be physically located at and share faculty with PSR and PSR itself is one of the long-time member schools of the GTU. The CSS also offers studies in New Religious Movements, Western esotericism, and mysticism. Certifications and Programs One of the reasons the school physically moved to PSR/GTU was that it could then partner locally with the well-established schools of the GTU that offered myriad courses and degrees especially including MDiv (Masters of Divinity) degrees. However the CSS also offers distance learning options allowing students to attend accredited schools throughout North America for academic and professional certification. The CSS can then focus its energy on Swedenborgian Studies scholarship and training. Certificate of Swedenborgian Studies (Academic): The CSS is a 6-course certificate program for current GTU M.A. and PhD students. It is also available to M.Div. students currently at one of the GTU member schools or non-GTU scholars who are not preparing for a vocation in the Swedenborgian Church. Certificate of Swedenborgian Ministries Studies (Vocational): The CSMS comprises 21 units of coursework (or 7 3-unit courses), of which: * 6 units must be Swedenborgian Exegesis, * 3 units must be Introduction to Swedenborgian Thought, and * 3 units must be Swedenborgian History. * The other nine units may be drawn from any other courses offered in Swedenborgian Studies. About the Faculty The regular faculty are responsible for the Swedenborgian course offerings, but also partner with the faculty of the Graduate Theological Union and Pacific School of Religion to teach core curriculum classes to the larger student body. :Faculty :Rev.

The wars ultimately led to a defeat for the Fon of Bafut, forcing him into exile, and making the Fondom of Bafut part of the German protectorate of Kamerun. Timeline 1889: The German explorer Eugene Zintgraff visits the town of Bafut after visiting Bali Nyonga, a neighboring fondom and rival to Bafut. Breaches of etiquette by Eugen Zintgraff with respect to the Fon of Bafut Abumbi I was looked upon as deliberately hostile acts instigated by the Fon of Bali Nyonga. 1891: German-led forces from Bali Nyonga attacked Mankon - an ally of Bafut. The attack was a reprisal of the death of two of Eugene Zintgraff's messengers sent to Bafut to demand ivory. The town of Mankon was burnt down by the force on January 31, 1891. Warriors from Bafut and Mankon attacked the attacking force on their return journey and inflicted heavy losses on them. This is the Battle of Mankon. 1901 - 1907: The German Schutztruppe, initially under the Schutztruppe commander von Pavel raided Bafut several times in 1901, 1904–1905 and 1907. This resulted in the exile of the Fon of Bafut Abumbi I to Douala for a year. He was reinstated under German rule as no suitable proxy rulers could be found. The military headquarters of Abumbi I during the Bafut Wars at Mankaha in Bafut now houses a war memorial to the Bafut people. The guest house (which was the residence for the Fon built by the Germans) at the present palace of the Fon houses a museum. The museum houses a special section on the Battle of Mankon, with the skulls of four dead German soldiers, their arms and ammunition. Commentary Prof. Benny Ambrose Akonteh, Ph.D., notes as follows: > Bota Island \\"It is important to recognize that perhaps as early as the 19th > century Bafut was an expansionary empire that invaded and subjected > neighboring kingdoms such as Babanki Tungo, Big Babanki, Bambili, Bafreng, > Bambui, and the Mbunti (Lower Mezam) to its rule.

Crest No. 35 Squadron has as its emblem an erect Rapier. Below this crest, on a scroll is inscribed Drutpraharnayudha. A Canberra of the No. 35 Squadron. The Rapier emblem is clearly visible History No 35 squadron was raised in Pune on 10 August 1958 equipped with Canberra B(I) 58 under the command of Wg Cdr NB Naik. It became the fourth unit to operate the Canberra bomber in the Indian Air Force and was initially tasked with high altitude bombing and interdiction as well as reconnaissance roles. The unit also appears to have had a secondary responsibility of high altitude weather research. No. 35 Sqn has been involved in all of India's major military operations, from the liberation of Goa to Operation Safed Sagar during the Kargil War, when it was deployed Kashmir Valley and the Rann of Kutch. It was re-equipped with modified Canberra B(I) 58 and MiG-21Ms for dedicated EW role. In 1978, the unit was moved to AFS Bareilly. Since the 1980s, No.35 Squadron has played an important role in collaborating with DRDO in the evaluation of Electronic Warfare (EW) systems and armaments. The unit's Canberra flight was withdrawn in 1997 and re-equipped with EW-equipped MiG-21Ms. The unit also fills an important training role. In 2001 the Squadron phased out it Canberra B(I) 58. The squadron is currently in the process of upgrading its equipment from the MIG21 BIS aircraft.Indian Air Force [Bharatiya Vayu Sena] In addition to providing support to offensive air operations, the Rapiers play a crucial role in providing flying effort towards EW related training for the IAF's own air defense units and currently operates from Bakshi-Ka-Talab. Goa Operations The squadron's first operation was in 1961 during the annexation of Goa when it flew against DDabolim Airport in Portuguese-held Goa. Flying from Pune, No. 35 was deployed along with No. 16 in the opening missions against the airfield on 18 December when 12 Canberras of No. 35 led by Wg. Cdr. N.B. Menon struck the runway at Dabolim with 1000lbers. The flight was, however, under orders not to strike terminals and facilities. There appears to have been plans for strikes against Diu Airport, but appears to have been called off due to proximity of friendly forces. No.35 Sqn's Canberras were first moved north during the confrontation with China. In the event that no air action was authorized during the conflict in November 1962, no combat sorties were flown by any Canberra units. 1965 Indo-Pak War The squadron's first sustained combat operations occurred during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. The squadron then based at Halwara under Wg Cdr AS Bakshi went on alert in late August 1965. Over a ten-day period, beginning 1 September 1965, the squadron flew 69 operational sorties. The most intense missions against Mauripur, Kasur, and Sargodha being flown between 7 and 13 September. The Squadron flew with distinction (Sqn Ldr JP Gupta earning a Mention-in-Despatches for bombing Kasur). 1971- Bangladesh Liberation War The war in 1971 provided this young squadron an opportunity to perform to its full potential. During the war, No.35 Sqn's Canberras flew day and night missions on both fronts. A total of 92 operational sorties amounting to 900 hours were undertaken by the squadron during the conflict. The highlight of war was its bombing of the oil refinery at Karachi - resulting in, according to a recce pilot, \\"the biggest blaze ever seen over South Asia.\\" While the squadron lost an aircraft and two pilots (Flt Lt SC Sandal and Flt Lt KS Nanda) over Karachi, the raid earned Wg Cdr KK Badhwar a Vir Chakra. Over the course of the conflict the squadron earned one Ati Vishisht Seva Medal, five Vir Chakras, six Vishisht Seva Medals, one Vayu Sena Medal and three Mention- in-Despatches. The Squadron went on alert during Operation Safed Sagar in the summer of 1999. The squadron deployed a flight each to support offensive and defensive operations by Western and South Western Air Command (SWAC). No.35 Sqn's aircraft deployed to bases in Kashmir as well as to the Rann of Kutch. No 35 Sqn was last in news as the unit, which took over the Mig-25 Fleet when No.102 Squadron (Trisonics) was disbanded. The Canberra Flight of 35 Sqn has been dissolved and the Mig21-bis will also be retired over a period of time.

Statement  A divisor on a Riemann surface C is a formal sum \\\\textstyle D = \\\\sum_P m_P P of points P on C with integer coefficients. One considers a divisor as a set of constraints on meromorphic functions in the function field of C, defining L(D) as the vector space of functions having poles only at points of D with positive coefficient, at most as bad as the coefficient indicates, and having zeros at points of D with negative coefficient, with at least that multiplicity. The dimension of L(D) is finite, and denoted \\\\ell(D). The linear system of divisors attached to D is the corresponding projective space of dimension \\\\ell(D)-1. The other significant invariant of D is its degree d, which is the sum of all its coefficients. A divisor is called special if ℓ(K − D) > 0, where K is the canonical divisor.Hartshorne p.296 Clifford's theorem states that for an effective special divisor D, one has: :\\\\ell(D)- 1 \\\\le d/2, and that equality holds only if D is zero or a canonical divisor, or if C is a hyperelliptic curve and D linearly equivalent to an integral multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor. The Clifford index of C is then defined as the minimum d − 2r(D) taken over all special divisors (except canonical and trivial), and Clifford's theorem states this is non-negative. It can be shown that the Clifford index for a generic curve of genus g is equal to the floor function \\\\lfloor\\\\tfrac{g-1}{2}\\\\rfloor. The Clifford index measures how far the curve is from being hyperelliptic. It may be thought of as a refinement of the gonality: in many cases the Clifford index is equal to the gonality minus 2.Eisenbud (2005) p.178 Green's conjecture A conjecture of Mark Green states that the Clifford index for a curve over the complex numbers that is not hyperelliptic should be determined by the extent to which C as canonical curve has linear syzygies. In detail, one defines the invariant a(C) in terms of the minimal free resolution of the homogeneous coordinate ring of C in its canonical embedding, as the largest index i for which the graded Betti number βi, i + 2 is zero. Green and Robert Lazarsfeld showed that a(C) + 1 is a lower bound for the Clifford index, and Green's conjecture states that equality always holds. There are numerous partial results.Eisenbud (2005) pp. 183-4. Claire Voisin was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics for her solution of the generic case of Green's conjecture in two papers.Green's canonical syzygy conjecture for generic curves of odd genus - Claire VoisinGreen’s generic syzygy conjecture for curves of even genus lying on a K3 surface - Claire Voisin The case of Green's conjecture for generic curves had attracted a huge amount of effort by algebraic geometers over twenty years before finally being laid to rest by Voisin.Satter Prize The conjecture for arbitrary curves remains open.

The RPCGA was founded by members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States. History =Background= The first American presbytery was formed in Philadelphia in 1706. In 1716 it became the Synod of Philadelphia (Synod of the Trinity). In 1729, the Synod of Philadelphia adopted the Westminster Confession and the Larger and Shorter catechisms as its confession of faith. In 1788, the Synod adopted the official name of the \\"Presbyterian Church in the United States of America\\" and held its first meeting in 1789. In 1857, the New School movement became divided over the issue of slavery and formed the United Synod of the Presbyterian Church. In 1861, the Old School movement of the South withdrew from the national church and formed the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America, a continuing church of the former body. Near the end of the American Civil War, the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America and a few smaller synods formed the Presbyterian Church in the United States. In 1972, a conservative movement removed itself from the Presbyterian Church in the United States to form the Presbyterian Church in America. In 1982, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod merged with the Presbyterian Church in America. =Establishment= In 1983, a few churches in the North Georgia Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in America withdrew from the denomination over purity of doctrine and ecclesiastical practices, calling themselves Covenant Presbytery. In 1985, Covenant Presbytery formed the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States as a continuing church. In 1990, the Reformed Presbyterian Church divided into four presbyteries and changed its name to the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the Americas. The following year three of the four presbyteries chose to depart, citing the Reformed Presbyterian Church in America's failure to establish and maintain a system of church discipline and inability to finalize on a constitution. After the departure, the Western Presbytery dissolved itself with several churches electing to join with the Westminster Presbytery. One member church left the Hanover Presbytery (which chose to stand alone to this day) and also joined the Westminster Presbytery. During this time, the Westminster Presbytery sought counsel with representatives of several other denominations, some of whom requested that the presbytery join with their denomination. Its first general assembly adopted the Book of Church Order utilizing large parts of the original from the Westminster Assembly. Boundaries for four presbyteries were laid out, with churches established in each.  Theology  The RPCGA is a conservative Protestant Christian body and continuing church. It is also confessional. The church upholds the teaching of Sola scriptura, receiving it as the inspired and inerrant Word of God. A literal interpretation of the Bible is followed and clearly demonstrated in its stances on creationism, homosexuality and same-sex marriage, feminism, and liberalism. It forbids the \\"teaching or practice\\" of charismaticism, dispensationalism, Arminianism, altar calls, abortion, homosexuality, neo-orthodoxy, modernism, humanism, feminism, evolution, Roman Catholicism, and liberalism. It holds to Young Earth creationism. In addition to the Bible the RPCGA adopts the Book of Church Order containing the Westminster Confession and Larger and Shorter catechisms as its subordinate standards. The church's teachings forbid women in church office and rejects compulsory military service for women.

Early career Born in Philadelphia, Bob first made his name as a ventriloquist on NBC on the Today Show in the 1950s, while still in his teens. He appeared in 1953 on CBS on Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour and was able to get his first regular television job hosting his own program on WTAR in Norfolk, Virginia. The \\"Bob and Chauncey Show\\" paired McAllister with a wise-cracking dummy (\\"Chauncey\\"). This led to his being hired on at WJZ-TV Channel 13 in Baltimore, Maryland in 1963 on The Bob McAllister Show, a half- hour program of comedy character and puppet sketches, magic acts, pantomime, cartoons, and sight gags intended to revive the absurd visual surrealism of Ernie Kovacs' television work. The Bob McAllister Show was a big success and led to an offer from WNEW-TV Channel 5 in New York to host his own program there, where it premiered on September 9, 1968. The New York version of the show was not as successful as the Baltimore broadcast, and time constraints and budget restrictions led to its cancellation on Friday, September 5, 1969, http://www.tvparty.com/lostny2mcallister.html after which it went into reruns. Wonderama McAllister was concurrently brought in as host of the syndicated popular show Wonderama, produced by WNEW-TV, to replace the departing Sonny Fox. McAllister's version of the show premiered Sunday, August 13, 1967, and became Metromedia TV's most popular children's series. It included material similar to that on The Bob McAllister Show with the added attractions of game shows that he selected children in the audience to participate in. These included twisting the tops off cans to see whether snakes or a bouquet of artificial flowers sprung out; the child who opened the sole can with the bouquet won the grand prize. Bob gave each snake-receiver a consolation prize — usually a toy or a board game — for answering a trivia question correctly. The musical theme of McAllister's Wonderama was an orchestral arrangement of the song \\"I Ain't Down Yet\\" from Meredith Willson's Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Audience children typically waved their arms in a diagonal criss-cross fashion over their heads to the beat of the music when it opened and closed each show. McAllister also hosted reproduced Wonderama shows at various locations, including the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park in Jackson Township, New Jersey, and the Harvard Club of New York. He also found the time to host a few children's television specials for WNEW-TV during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The weekday afternoon version of Wonderama was not as successful as the original Sunday afternoon/Sunday morning format and was dropped on Friday, August 21, 1970, returning to its Sunday morning schedule where it continued until Sunday morning, December 25, 1977. Characters Characters McAllister played on Wonderama and The Bob McAllister Show included the following: * The Crazy Magician, whose attempts at magic usually ended in disaster. * Prof. Fingelheimer, a quirky German- accented inventor who sang a nonsensical but catchy song before showing off his latest contraption: This song bore a resemblance to the Boodleheimer song by Stuart Hample, originally published in The Silly Book in 1961. * A janitor who furnished a can of \\"instant\\" whatever and used it to facilitate chores. * Mike Fury, a superhero who boasted about his supernatural deeds of daring-do and created \\"explosions\\" by taking a bite of his \\"Super Onion\\" and exhaling forcefully. He also taught children healthy hygienic habits (tooth-brushing, washing, nose-blowing, etc.) by setting a good example for them as \\"a Goody.\\" * Zip Code, a Beatnik folk singer * Thurman, a laid-back farm boy * Salamander Dilly, an artist who stroked a brush across a blank canvas, creating an image through a \\"blue screen\\" technique, a superimposed video special effect that gradually \\"wiped\\" the image onto the canvas along with the path of the brush. His name was a playful spoof on that of surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. * Seymore the Snake, a puppet providing humorous commentary about the show's zany goings-on. Other shows In 1973, McAllister hosted a TV special, Herbie Day at Disneyland, which exhibited Herbie the Love Bug of Walt Disney Pictures fame before an excited crowd at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. This special was produced in conjunction with the personified Volkswagen Beetle's latest feature film, Herbie Rides Again. In 1975, Monty Hall, impressed by McAllister, flew him out to Los Angeles to host a pilot for a new ABC game show called Carnival. By all accounts, the pilot was well-done, but it was never picked up as a series. He was forced to leave Wonderama following the series' Christmas Day 1977 broadcast. In the fall of 1978, McAllister briefly returned to children's television as the host/performer and interviewer of ABC TV's Kids Are People Too, a show that took its name from the title of McAllister's closing Wonderama theme. However, the show that he was hired to emcee was aimed at teens, not children, and this led to creative disputes with the producers and network executives. In November 1978, Bob McAllister was fired from Kids Are People Too! and he was replaced by Michael Young and later Randy Hamilton as the program's host. Later years McAllister would spend the remainder of the 1970s and 80s performing at corporate banquets and picnics and, for a time, served as co-owner of a roller skating rink at THE MALL in New Rochelle, New York. He tried a return to children's television with an in-school educational program called Tuned In, produced by WNET for PBS in the early 1980s. He played the teacher, Mr. Graff, who involved his pupils in television production. Bob received recognition in the magic field with numerous awards, including the prestigious \\"Magician of the Year\\" award from the Society of American Magicians.

The CPN-AMI platform provides many tools to work on Petri nets, such as verifying and model-checking tools.Principles of Information Systems: Computer science Originally, simple Petri nets were created through graphic design, but research conducted internally at LIP6 revealed that it was needed to automate such tasks.Business Database Systems: Computer science, Database management PetriScript was designed to provide some facilities in modeling places-transition and coloured Petri nets within the CPN-AMI platform. Petriscript's main purpose is to automate modeling operations on Petri nets by merging, creating, and connecting nodes. It supports almost everything needed, such as macros, loops control, lists, and string and arithmetic expressions, and blocks intervention of the user as much as possible. Its syntax is Ada-like. The following script produces a FIFO with three sections: define(FIFO_SIZE,3) define(FIFO_BASE_X,100) define(FIFO_BASE_Y,100) define(FIFO_STEP,120) int $wave := 0; for $wave in 1..FIFO_SIZE loop create place \\"Slot_\\" & '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave, y FIFO_BASE_Y); create place \\"Empty_\\" & '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave, y FIFO_BASE_Y + 100, marking \\"1\\"); end loop; for $wave in 1..FIFO_SIZE+1 loop create transition \\"t\\" & '$wave -1' & \\"_to_\\" & '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave - FIFO_STEP / 2, y FIFO_BASE_Y + 50); if $wave < FIFO_SIZE+1 then connect \\"1\\" transition \\"t\\" &'$wave -1' & \\"_to_\\" & '$wave' to place \\"Slot_\\" & '$wave'; connect \\"1\\" place \\"Empty_\\" & '$wave' to transition \\"t\\" &'$wave -1' & \\"_to_\\" & '$wave'; end if; if $wave > 1 then connect \\"1\\" transition \\"t\\" &'$wave -1' & \\"_to_\\" & '$wave' to place \\"Empty_\\" & '$wave - 1'; connect \\"1\\" place \\"Slot_\\" & '$wave - 1' to transition \\"t\\" &'$wave -1' & \\"_to_\\" & '$wave'; end if; end loop; set transition \\"t0_to_1\\" to (name \\"FIFO_Start\\"); set transition \\"t\\" & 'FIFO_SIZE' & \\"_to_\\" & 'FIFO_SIZE + 1' to (name \\"FIFO_End\\"); Which produces the following graph: 400px Here is another example that shows the power of PetriScript: define(X,250) define(Y,350) define(radius,50) define(R,150) define(SECTIONS,15) define(INNER_ANGLE,360/SECTIONS) define(OUTER_ANGLE,360/(2*SECTIONS)) int $i := 0; int $j := 0; for $i in 1..

It is so named because the supplicants gather at the altar located at the front of the church building. Most altar calls occur at the end of an evangelical address.  Background  Altar calls are a recent historic phenomenon beginning in the 1830s in America. During these, people approached the chancel rails, anxious seat, or mourner's bench to pray. One of the most famous 19th century revivalists, Charles Grandison Finney, \\"popularized the idea of the 'altar call' in order to sign up his converts for the abolition movement.\\" In many Churches of the Wesleyan-Arminian theology, the altar call, in addition to being an invitation for people to experience the New Birth, is also often used to implore believers to experience the second work of grace, known as entire sanctification. Notable examples in history of using alter calls include Billy Sunday and D. L. Moody. The Reformed Churches object to the use of the altar call for a variety of reasons. They argue that the Bible does not refer to any similar practice. Others believe it is intimidating and therefore creates an unnecessary and artificial barrier to those who would become Christians but are then unwilling to make an immediate public profession under the gaze of an assembly. Others object in that they may mislead people into confusing outward conduct with spiritual change. In doing so, they argue, altar calls may actually give people false assurance about their salvation. In addition, Carey Hardy argues that they change \\"the essence of the gospel\\", create believers with false professions of faith, and do not \\"follow the biblical method for public identification\\".

Located at the intersection of New Lots and Van Sinderen Avenues at the border of Brownsville and East New York, Brooklyn, it is served by the L train at all times.  History  This station opened on July 28, 1906. The Canarsie-bound platform was closed for renovation from December 2, 1963 to April 2, 1964, and the Manhattan-bound platform was closed for renovation from April 2 to July 23, 1964. The entire project cost $214,700. As part of the project the wooden platforms were replaced with concrete platforms, and canopies and fluorescent lights were installed. The station was renovated again in 2006-2007 at a cost of $10.58 million. The station renovation included the installation of new platform edges with yellow tactile warning strips, beige windscreens and red canopies (both with green frames), and the installation of artwork. Station layout The station entrance beneath the bridge for the tracks. This elevated station has two tracks and two offset side platforms. The platforms have windscreens and canopies at their centers and woven-wire fences with dark gray steel frames at either ends. This station's 2007 artwork is called 16 Windows by Eugene Tung. It features eight stained glass windows on each platform windscreen. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform depict people doing morning activities like eating breakfast and tooth brushing while those on the Canarsie-bound platform depict people doing evening activities like eating dinner and getting ready for bed. This coincides with normal peak direction rush hour service in the subway as most people board trains on the northbound platform going to Manhattan in the morning and disembark from trains on the southbound platform coming from Manhattan in the evening. To the south, the Canarsie Line lowers to run at-grade to East 105th Street and Canarsie–Rockaway Parkway. To the north, it becomes an elevated structure to Livonia Avenue until just west of Broadway Junction. =Exit= The station's only entrance is via a ground- level station house beneath the tracks on the southwest corner of Van Sinderen and New Lots Avenues. Inside is a token booth, turnstile bank, and two staircases to the Canarsie-bound platform and one to the Manhattan-bound one, all at their centers.

Biography  He never commanded an army or rose to the position of a general, but he was a notable figure in the wars of the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century, when personal prowess had still a considerable share in deciding combat. His native town and its district, which lie between Badajoz and Madrid, produced many of the most noted conquistadores of America, including the Pizarro family. Diego himself served in his youth in the Granada War. His strength, daring, and activity fitted him to shine in operations largely composed of night marches, escalades, surprises and hand-to-hand combat. The main scene of his achievements was Italy, and he betook himself to it—on his own showing—not in search of glory, but because he had killed a relation of his own, Ruy Sanchez de Vargas, in a street fight arising out of a quarrel about a horse. He fled to Rome, then under the rule of the Borgias. Diego was a distant relation to the cardinal (Bernardino López de Carvajal), a favorite of Pope Alexander VI, who was in conflict with the barons of the Romagna and took Diego into his service. He remained a soldier of the pope until he killed a man in a personal quarrel and found it necessary to pass over to the enemy. He then became acquainted with the Colonnas, who appreciated his services. The wars between Ferdinand V of Castilla (the Catholic king) and Louis XII gave him a more creditable opening. The Spanish general Gonzalo de Córdoba employed him and trusted him: and he took part in the wars of Italy, on the frontier of Navarre, and once against the Turks on the Danube, till 1530. He was dead at Bologna in 1534 by a fall while engaged in a jumping-match with some of the younger officers of the army. His body was carried to his native town Trujillo, and buried in the church of Santa María la Mayor in 1545. In the Brief Summary of his life and deeds attributed to him, and printed at the end of the Chronicle of the Great Captain, published in 1584 at Alcalá de Henares, he lays no claim to having done more than was open to a very athletic man. In Don Quixote, the curate holds Diego up as an example of a real hero about whom one should read rather than about the lies in the tales of chivalry (Part I Chapter XXXII). He had a son, also named Diego García de Paredes, who became a Conquistador and founded several cities in Venezuela.

It uses a directional antenna at night. WDAE broadcasts using the iBiquity HD radio system during daytime hours, and repeats the HD Radio signal for FM listeners via WBTP-HD3 (95.7-3). 620 AM is a Regional broadcast frequency.

History =WDAE AM 1250 history= On May 15, 1922, WDAE first signed on at 833 kilocycles, as the radio outlet of the Tampa Times, an afternoon daily newspaper. WDAE was one of the earliest radio stations in Florida, according to FCC records. WQAM in Miami takes credit as being first, going on the air in May 1921. In Jacksonville there was also an early station with the call sign WCAN, although those call letters were deleted a short time later and it's not currently known if it ever got on the air. WDAE, as most early radio stations, broadcast on several frequencies during its beginning years, settling on AM 1250 by 1941.Broadcasting Yearbook 1942 page 118 Through the 1940s and 50s, WDAE was a CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band remotes during the Golden Age of Radio. In the 1960s and 70s, WDAE was a popular Top 40 station, which also aired the popular talk show \\"Desperate & Dateless\\" on Friday nights with host Rosemary Haddad and producer Sam Cardinale. But in the 1980s, as Top 40 listening switched to FM, WDAE changed to an oldies format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page B-55 By the 1990s, it had moved to adult standards and later began simulcasting the adult contemporary music format of co-owned 100.7 FM WUSA (now WMTX) in November 1990. In March 1994, WDAE switched to classic country as \\"Country Gold Froggy 1250\\" with former WUSA personalities whose on-air names became I.B. Green, Jimmy Hoppa and Davey Croakett. In 1999, the station was acquired by Clear Channel Communications, the previous name of current owner iHeartMedia. Clear Channel switched WDAE to its current all-sports format as \\"The Sports Animal.\\" =WSUN AM 620 history= On November 1, 1927 WSUN first signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-47 For most of its early history, it was owned by the City of St. Petersburg. WSUN used the first directional AM antenna system in the U.S., implemented in order to protect WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, also on 620 kHz. In its early years, WSUN was an ABC Radio affiliate, carrying the network's schedule until the 1960s, when it moved to a full service middle of the road music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page B46 Through the 1970s and 80s, WSUN aired country music.Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-54 It was owned by Plough Broadcasting, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical firm Schering-Plough. In 1988, Cox Broadcasting acquired WSUN and switched it to talk and later to 1950s-based adult standards.Broadcasting Yearbook 1995 page B-92 In 1998, pending a sale, WSUN began simulcasting the audio from Time Warner (Brighthouse networks) local cable TV news station \\"Bay News 9,\\" changing the call letters of AM 620 to WSAA. Cox Broadcasting moved the WSUN call letters and its standards format over to its co-owned station on AM 910 in nearby Plant City, Florida (now WTWD). =WDAE moves to 620= On January 1, 2000, three Tampa Bay radio stations, including WDAE, were involved in a frequency swap. WSUN had previously vacated AM 620, moving to AM 910. WDAE and its sports format moved from 1250 to 620. \\"Radio station's move to bump Bay News 9\\", St. Petersburg Times (December 2, 1999)] Business-formatted WHNZ, which Clear Channel had bought from Paxson Communications in 1998, switched from AM 570 to WDAE's previous home at 1250. And Clear Channel put a news/talk format on AM 570, changing the call letters to WTBN, which stood for Tampa Bay News. Salem Communications bought WTBN the following year, installing a Christian radio format. In late 2012, WDAE became the Tampa Bay home of ESPN Radio, as rival sports station 1040 AM WHBO switched affiliation to the new NBC Sports Radio Network. On November 28, 2018, WDAE branded as \\"95.3 WDAE\\", utilizing the FM translator in its branding.WDAE Moves Focus Away From AM Rdaioinsight - November 28, 2018 =Sports team associations= WDAE is the flagship station for the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. It is also the Tampa Bay home of the University of Florida Gators college football and basketball games. Each year, WDAE carries the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg auto race. The station had been the flagship station for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football. Beginning with the 2017 season, the team's broadcasts move to co-owned active rock station 97.9 FM WXTB. WDAE continues to air interviews with players and coaches during game weeks.InsideRadio.com/Bucs-iHeartDeal WDAE had also been the flagship radio station for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (which is now on sister station 970 AM WFLA). WDAE had also broadcast the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League (now on sister station 1250 AM WHNZ). =Chris Thomas= When WDAE became a sports talk station in 1997, one of the hosts to help build the station was WFLA-TV Channel 8 sports anchor Chris Thomas (real name Christian Thomas Olrick). He hosted the \\"Chris Thomas Show\\" on WDAE from 1997 until 2004, when he died from cancer. Thomas was a listener favorite, often getting in mock on-air feuds with WDAE's afternoon host, Steve Duemig. The two men were friends in real life. As part of his tongue-in-cheek on-air persona, Thomas often gave himself nicknames, such as The Mediocore Sports Hunk. He also used many sound drops, such as the ferret from the Budweiser frogs commercials, or various other animals, giving them names, such as Clevis and Clovis. Despite his popularity, WFLA-TV declined to renew Thomas's contract in 2002, publicly expressing a desire to move to a younger sportscaster. However, some fans have speculated his openly hostile relationship with the Glazer family, owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a major sponsor of Channel 8, plus an off the air alcohol-related incident six months earlier led to the station's desire to part ways with Thomas. Thomas battled alcoholism most of his adult life. In January 2003, he was involved in a drunk driving accident with Buccaneers cheerleader Michelle Betancourt. However, despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, he remained a beloved figure in the Tampa Bay sports community. After Thomas died in February 2004, the WDAE studio was renamed the Chris Thomas Studio.

The north half of the building was designed by the firm of Burnham & Root and built starting in 1891. The tallest load-bearing brick building ever constructed, it employed the first portal system of wind bracing in America. Its decorative staircases represent the first structural use of aluminum in building construction. The south half, constructed in 1893, was designed by Holabird & Roche and is similar in color and profile to the original, but the design is more traditionally ornate. When completed, it was the largest office building in the world. The success of the building was the catalyst for an important new business center at the southern end of the Loop. The building was remodeled in 1938 in one of the first major skyscraper renovations ever undertaken—a bid, in part, to revolutionize how building maintenance was done and halt the demolition of Chicago's aging skyscrapers. It was sold in 1979 to owners who restored the building to its original condition, in one of the most comprehensive skyscraper restorations attempted as of 1992. The project was recognized as one of the top restoration projects in the US by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1987. The building is divided into offices from to in size, and primarily serves independent professional firms. It was listed for sale in 2007. The north half is an unornamented vertical mass of purple-brown brick, flaring gently out at the base and top, with vertically continuous bay windows projecting out. The south half is vertically divided by brickwork at the base and rises to a large copper cornice at the roof. Projecting window bays in both halves allow large exposures of glass, giving the building an open appearance despite its mass. The Monadnock is part of the Printing House Row District, which also includes the Fisher Building, the Manhattan Building, and the Old Colony Building. When it was built, many critics called the building too extreme, and lacking in style. Others found in its lack of ornamentation the natural extension of its commercial purpose and an expression of modern business life. Early 20th- century European architects found inspiration in its attention to purpose and functional expression. It was one of the first buildings named a Chicago Architectural Landmark in 1958. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and named as part of the National Historic Landmark South Dearborn Street – Printing House Row North Historic District in 1976. Modern critics have called it a \\"classic\\", a \\"triumph of unified design\\", and \\"one of the most exciting aesthetic experiences America's commercial architecture produced\\".  History  = North half (1881–1891) = The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop. Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\". Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property values, and railroad companies were buying up land further south for new terminal buildings, creating further speculation in the southeastern end of the Loop. Brooks commissioned Burnham & Root to design a building for the site in 1884, and the project was announced in 1885, with a brief trade journal notice that the building would cost $850,000 ($ in dollars). The Chicago building community had little faith in Brooks' choice of location. Architect Edwin Renwick would say: Early sketches show a 13-story building with Ancient Egyptian ornament and a slight flaring at the top, divided visually into five sections with a lotus-blossom decorative motif. This design was never approved, as Brooks waited for the real estate market in the south Loop, still mostly warehouses, to improve. Where Root was known for the detailed ornamentation of his designs (as seen in the Rookery Building), Brooks was known for his stinginess and preference for simplicity. For the Monadnock, Brooks insisted that the architects refrain from elaborate ornamentation and produce instead \\"the effect of solidity and strength, or a design that will produce that effect, rather than ornament for a notable appearance.\\" In an 1884 letter to Aldis, he wrote: While Root was on vacation, Burnham had a draftsman create a \\"straight up-and-down, uncompromising, unornamented facade.\\" Objecting at first, Root later threw himself into the design, declaring that the heavy lines of an Egyptian pyramid had captured his imagination and that he would \\"throw the thing up without a single ornament\\". In 1889, a new plan was announced for the building: a thick-walled brick tower, 16 stories high, devoid of ornamentation and suggestive of an Egyptian pylon. Brooks insisted that the building have no projections, for which reason the plan did not include bay windows, but Aldis argued that more rentable space would be created by projecting oriel windows, which were included in the final design. The Monadnock's final height was calculated to be the highest economically viable for a load-bearing wall design, requiring walls thick at the bottom and thick at the top. Greater height would have required walls of such thickness that they would have reduced the rentable space too greatly. The final height was much dithered over by the owners, but a decision was forced when the city proposed an ordinance restricting the height of buildings to . To protect future income potential, Aldis sought a permit for a 16-story building immediately. The building commissioner, although \\"staggered by the sixteen story plan\\", granted the permit on June 3, 1889. The decorative cast aluminum staircases, shown here in 1893, were the first use of aluminum in building construction. With its 17 stories (16 rentable plus an attic), its load-bearing walls were the tallest of any commercial structure in the world. To support the towering structure and reinforce against wind, the masonry walls were braced with an interior frame of cast and wrought iron. Root devised for this frame the first attempt at a portal system of wind bracing in America, in which iron struts were riveted between the columns of the frame for reinforcement. The narrow lot allowed only a single, double-loaded corridor, which was appointed with a wainscot of white Carrara marble, red oak trim, and feather-chipped glass that allowed outside light to filter from the offices on each side into the hallways. Floors were covered with hand-carved marble mosaic tiles. Skylit open staircases were made of bronze-plated cast iron on upper floors. On the ground floor, they were crafted in cast aluminum—an exotic and expensive material at the time—representing the first use of aluminum in building construction. The building was constructed by the firm of George A. Fuller, who trained as an architect but made his mark as the creator of the modern contracting system in building construction. His firm had supervised construction of the Rookery, and later built New York's Flatiron Building with Burnham in 1902. The Monadnock Block was built as a single structure but was legally two buildings, the Monadnock and the Kearsarge, named for Mount Monadnock and Mount Kearsarge in New Hampshire. Work was completed in 1891. The Monadnock, which Root called his \\"Jumbo\\", was his last project; he died suddenly while it was under construction. = South half and early history (1891–1893) = arcade-like treatment of the upper floors and neoclassical copper cornice Encouraged by the early success of the building, Shepherd Brooks purchased the 68-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) lot adjoining to the south in 1893 for $360,000 ($ in dollars). Aldis recommended the firm of Holabird & Roche, who had designed the Pontiac Building for Peter Brooks in 1891, to extend the Monadnock south to Van Buren. William Holabird and Martin Roche had trained together in the office of William LeBaron Jenney, and in 1881 formed their own firm, which would become one of the most prolific in the city and the acknowledged leader of the Chicago school of architecture. The north half had struggled with cost overruns and Holabird & Roche presented a far more cost-effective design. The design, for two buildings called the Katahdin and Wachusett (also named for New England mountains), connected them to the north half as a single structure at an estimated cost of $800,000 ($ in dollars). Construction began in 1892, under the supervision of Corydon T. Purdy who would later earn accolades as the structural engineer for many famous Chicago and New York skyscrapers. The addition, 17 stories high, preserved the color and vertically massed profile of the original, but was more traditionally ornate in its design, with grander entranceways and more neoclassical touches. The building reflected in its design the transition taking place in skyscraper design from load-bearing walls to steel frame construction . The Katahdin, built first, used the same iron framed masonry construction as the original. The Wachusett was entirely steel framed. Where the north half required great thicknesses of brick in the load-bearing walls, the addition employed only a thin facing of brick and terracotta trim, affording larger expanses of glass and faster, less expensive construction. The south half cost 15 percent less, weighed 15 percent less, and had 15 percent more rentable space than the north half. Connected on every floor except the top one and sharing a common basement, each of the four component buildings was equipped with its own heating system, elevators, stairs, and plumbing to facilitate a separate sale if required. The combined final cost in 1893 was $2.5 million ($ in dollars). When complete, the Monadnock was the largest office building in the world, with 1,200 rooms and an occupancy of over 6,000. The Chicago Daily Tribune commented that the population of most Illinois towns in 1896 would fit comfortably in the building. It was a postal district unto itself, with four full-time carriers delivering mail six times a day, six days a week. It was the first building in Chicago wired for electricity, and one of the first to be fire-proofed, with hollow fire clay tiles lining the structure so that the metal frame would be protected even if the facing brick were to be destroyed. Bird's-eye view of the southeast Loop, looking south from Adams street, in 1898. The completed Monadnock (7) is to the top right. Rand McNally called these buildings \\"some of the most remarkable buildings in the world\\". The Brooks' decision to construct a building of such scale and in such an unlikely location was vindicated by the Monadnock's success—it was the most profitable investment they ever made. The Economist, a Chicago real estate journal, conceded in 1892 that: Early tenants, according to Rand McNally, included \\"great corporations, banks, and professional men ... among them the Santa Fe, the Michigan Central, and the Chicago & Alton Railroads, and the American Exchange National and Globe Savings Banks\\". In 1897, the Union Elevated Railroad Company opened the Union Loop line of the Chicago \\"L\\", the last leg of which ran immediately alongside the Van Buren side of the building. Aldis filed suit against the \\"L\\" in 1901 for $300,000 in damages ($ in dollars), complaining that: Aldis lost the case, but won on appeal, when the Supreme Court of Illinois found that owners of property abutting the \\"L\\" lines could recover damages if the property had been injured by noise, vibration, or the blocking of light, paving the way for many lawsuits to follow. = Modernization (1938–1979) = A boom in new construction after 1926 created stiff competition for older buildings like the Monadnock. Occupancy declined from 87 percent in 1929 to 55 percent in 1937 and the building began to lose money. In 1938, building manager Graham Aldis (Owen's nephew) announced what the Chicago Daily Tribune called \\"the city's largest and most novel modernization job\\" in a move toward halting the destruction of Chicago's aging skyscrapers. Rejecting the term \\"modernization\\", Aldis called his plan \\"progressive styling\\", which he believed would revolutionize the way building maintenance was done to preserve millions of dollars worth of buildings that would otherwise be destroyed. \\"There is no reason why\\", he said, \\"any well-designed office building need be torn down because of obsolescence.\\" Skidmore & Owings, who had pioneered functional design, were retained to lead a $125,000 program ($ in dollars) to restyle the main entrance, remodel the lobby and ground floor shops, modernize all the public spaces, and progressively modernize office suites as demand required. The modernization included covering the mosaic floors with rubber tile and terrazzo, enclosing the elevators and ornamental stairways, and replacing the marble and oak finishes in the corridors and offices with modern materials. By the end of 1938, 35 new tenants had signed leases and 11 existing tenants had leased additional space in the building. In 1966, Aldis & Co., which had managed the building for the Brooks estate for 75 years, was dissolved and the Monadnock was sold for $2 million ($ in dollars) to Sudler & Co., owners of the John Hancock Center, the Rookery Building, and the Old Colony Building. The new owners again modernized the interior, installing carpet, fluorescent lights, and new doors, and undertook a major effort to shore up the north wall which had sunk during construction of the Kluczynski Federal Building across Jackson Street in 1974. By 1977, operating expenses were high, rents were low, and occupancy had fallen to 80 percent. Struggling to make loan payments, the owners were forced to sell the building to avoid foreclosure. It was purchased by a partnership headed by William S. Donnell in 1979 for $5 per square foot ($53.82 per square meter) or approximately $2 million ($ in dollars). = Restoration and later (1979–) = The building Donnell purchased in 1979 had declined badly. The Dearborn entrances had been closed in, the ground floor had been \\"defaced by garish signs\\", and the brick had been painted and was peeling. Inside, the marble wainscoting had been painted over and many of the original oak doors had been replaced with cheaper mahogany. The decorative stair rails had been enclosed, and some stairways and corridors had been closed off completely. Much of the original mosaic tile had been demolished—some floors were carpeted, others tiled in vinyl or terrazzo. Half of the sixteen elevators were still manually operated. \\"It was as if it had been partly updated every ten years throughout its history\\", said Donnell, \\"it was never done over in its entirety.\\" Donnell, who had studied architecture at Harvard, planned to gut the building and construct a new, modern office complex inside the historic shell. Failing to obtain financing for the remodeling, he embarked instead on an incremental, \\"pay as you go\\" project to restore the Monadnock to its original condition in painstaking detail. The project was, according to historian Donald Miller, the most comprehensive skyscraper restoration ever attempted at the time; it took thirteen years to complete. Working from original drawings discovered at the Art Institute of Chicago, and two old photographs, Donnell and John Vinci, one of the nation's leading preservation architects, restored the building to its condition when first constructed, before any modernizations, working piecemeal as offices became vacant. The color of the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by exposure to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen at a cost of $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings. Dearborn Street facade in 2008, showing restored granite entryways, entrances to ground floor shops, and fiberglass replicas of original linen window shades The Dearborn Street entrances were reopened and their massive granite lintels and surrounds cleared of layers of black paint or replaced. A source was found for the molded bricks needed to repair or replace the curved corners. Large plate glass windows at the entrance were removed and smaller double-hung windows were replaced that conformed to the original design. Fiberglass shades resembling the original linen versions were installed to preserve the appearance of the facade. The average cost of the restoration work was $1 million per floor ($ in dollars) in 1989, or $47 per square foot ($505.92 per square meter). Donnell's goal was that the Monadnock would \\"not only look as it originally did, it [would] also live as it used to\\", and he sought tenants for the street-level shops that were similar to their 19th-century occupants. Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, as well as a barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A tobacconist with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, \\"the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces at the turn of the century, the kind of people who bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it.\\" The retail lobby in 2010, showing faithful restoration of the marble, decorative aluminum, and fixtures and the ambient lighting effect of the carbon filament bulbs The restoration was a success both critically and commercially. The building was 80 percent occupied when bought in 1979 and rented for $5.50 per square foot ($59.20 per square meter). By 1982, it was 91 percent occupied and commanded rent of $9 per square foot ($96.89 per square meter). The Monadnock was selected as one of top restoration projects in the country by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1987, noting \\"the outstanding quality of the overall restoration effort\\", and the precision, detail and faithfulness of the interior restoration, in particular the lobby, which \\"serves as a model for preservation nationwide.\\" The restored Monadnock is divided into offices of from to , it was 98.9 percent leased; the 300 tenants are primarily independent professional firms and entrepreneurs. Rents range from $21 to $23 per square foot ($226 to $247 per square meter), plus electricity. The building was offered for sale in 2007, with an expected price of $45 to $60 million. A tentative deal was reached at a price of $48 million in 2008.  Architecture  window bays in the north half. The chamfered brick at the bottom of the window bay is visible in the drawing. Together, the two parts of the building have a frontage of on Dearborn Street with a depth of . The original northern half presents a plain, unbroken vertical mass of purple- brown brick, which is contoured to create a gentle curve at the base of the building and an outward flare to form an austere parapet at the top. The gentle swelling at base and cornice, observed historian Donald Hoffman, \\"came very close to the bell-shaped column the Egyptians had derived from papyrus\\". The corners of the building are gracefully chamfered as they rise to the top and the oriel windows are chamfered at their base. The floor divisions are not marked on the exterior; the unbroken edifice is interrupted only by a series of cantilevered window bays, separated by rows of single thin silled windows set into the vertical face. The entryways are small, single-height portals topped with plain stone lintels. The south half preserves the lines and color of the older building, but is vertically divided by a stringcourse over the second story, emphasizing the building's base, and a large ornamental copper cornice at the roof line. Massive blocks of red granite, thick, frame the large, two-story entrances. The projecting window bays of the original are repeated, but alternate in a pattern of two four-window bays to one recessed strip of windows to create the undulating appearance of the facade that was an early trademark of Holabird & Roche. Carl Condit, historian of the Chicago school, has commented that: The Monadnock rests on the floating foundation system invented by Root for the Montauk Building that revolutionized the way tall buildings were built on Chicago's spongy soil. A layer of concrete, reinforced with steel beams, forms a spread footing extending out under the surrounding streets, spreading the weight of the building over a large area of earth. The building was designed to settle , but by 1905 had settled that much and \\"several inches more\\", necessitating reconstruction of the first floor. By 1948, it had settled , resulting in a step down from the street to the ground floor. The entire east wall is supported on caissons sunk to the hardpan, installed when the subway Blue Line was dug under Dearborn Street in 1940. Combined floor plan for north and south halves, showing typical office plans. The closed corridors were opened to connect the two halves as part of the restoration. The narrow building allows an external exposure to all of the 300 offices, which pass natural light via double hung outside windows through feather-chipped glass transoms and hallway partitions into the single central corridor. Skylights bring sunlight into the open stairwells. The north half corridors are wide and the south half corridors are . In the north half, there are two open stairs in the center at the one third points, with perforated risers, white marble treads, and decorative steel railings. There are two banks of four elevators on the west side of the corridor, one for passengers and the other for freight. In the south half, there is a single bank of elevators on the north half of the length. The southern bank was abandoned and slabbed over on each floor. There is a flight of stairs behind each of these shafts with marble treads, closed cast iron risers, and ornamental balusters. The basic office suite is , consisting of one outer office and two or more inner offices. Heavy internal walls at the quarter and halfway points, the arches of which manifest Root's innovative wind bracing, mark the boundaries of the four original buildings.  Surrounding area  The Printer's Row North Historic District and Library-State/Van Buren 'L' station. The Monadnock is at the left, in front of the Fisher Building and the red CNA Center. The Old Colony Building is on the right. The Monadnock belongs to the Printing House Row District, a National Historic Landmark which includes the Manhattan Building, the Old Colony Building, and the Fisher Building, some of Chicago's seminal early skyscrapers. The Manhattan Building, built by William LeBaron Jenney in 1890, was the first building in Chicago with a complete steel skeleton or \\"Chicago\\" construction, an innovation Jenney had introduced in the Home Insurance Building in 1884. The first 16-story building in America, at the time it was \\"regarded with awe and fear\\". Jenney's masterpiece, the Manhattan was considered a technical triumph in construction. The 17-story Old Colony, built by Holabird & Roche in 1894, was considered one of the structural masterpieces of its time for its revolutionary portal form of bracing. It is the only survivor of a group of Chicago school buildings with rounded corner bays. The Fisher Building, built by Burnham in 1894, was an engineering miracle—the first tall commercial building to be built almost entirely without bricks. Its steel frame and thin terracotta curtain wall allowed two-thirds of the surface to be covered with glass. The district overlaps geographically with the Printer's Row neighborhood, originally the center of Chicago's printing and publishing industry, but now mostly converted to residential housing. The area is also home to the largest public library in the world, the Harold Washington Library, named for Chicago's first African- American mayor, and the Loop campus of Depaul University, America's largest Roman Catholic university. Immediately to the west on Jackson Street is the Union League Club of Chicago, founded in 1879 as a civic organization for \\"upright, law-abiding businessmen\\". To the north are the three buildings comprising Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe's minimalist Federal Plaza: the 1964 Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse, the only courthouse designed by Mies; the 1973 United States Post Office Loop Station; and the 1975 Kluczynski Federal Building, Mies's last project, considered to mark the apex of his career. The triangular, 27-story Metropolitan Correctional Center, a detention center serving the Federal courts in the Dirksen Building and nearby Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Building, is southwest of the Monadnock at Clark and LaSalle. The south leg of the Chicago Transit Authority elevated rail loop runs next to the building on Van Buren Street; the CTA's Brown, Orange, Pink, and Purple Lines are served by the Library-State/Van Buren stop one block to the east. The Jackson street subway station, serving the Blue Line, is on the Dearborn Street side of the building.  Critical reception and historical significance  The south entryway, originally the building's main entrance, showing restored granite lintels in 2009. The vintage barbershop is to the left. Contemporary Chicago critics considered the building too radical a departure from Burnham & Root's previous designs and too extreme in its stark simplicity and disregard for prevailing aesthetic norms, calling it an \\"engineer's house\\" and a \\"thoroughly puritanical\\" example of commercial style. European critics were even less approving. In the words of French architect Jacques Hermant, \\"The Monadnock was no longer the result of an artist responding to particular needs with intelligence and drawing from them all of the possible consequences. It is the work of a laborer who, without the slightest study, super-imposes 15 strictly identical stories to make a block then stops when he finds the block high enough.\\" Other critics saw this lack of style as \\"natural\\" and what made the Monadnock truly modern. New York critic Barr Feree wrote in 1892 that \\"There are no attempts at facades ... no ornamental appendages, nothing but a succession of windows, frankly stating that the structure is an office building, devoted to business, needing and using every available surface.\\" Other critics praised the truthfulness of the building to the ideals of business, which, while \\"not necessarily the highest to which we might aspire to in art ... are the only ideals the business building ought to express\\". Montgomery Schuyler, one of the Monadnock's most enthusiastic defenders, argued that the Monadnock's lack of ornament was not a lack of art, but rather \\"radiated the gravity of modern business life\\". Curt Teich & Co. postcard The Monadnock was widely praised by early twentieth-century German architects, including Mies, who on his arrival in Chicago in 1938 declared that \\"The Monadnock block is of such vigor and force that I am at once proud and happy to make my home here.\\" These European architects found the building's attention to purpose and functional expression inspiring. Bauhaus architect Ludwig Hilberseimer wrote that \\"The false solution—unfortunately too common—of applying meaningless and misplaced adornment is here instinctively avoided. An innate feeling for proportion gives this great building inner consistency and logical purity.\\" Modern critics have praised the Monadnock as one of the most important exemplars of the Chicago school, along with Louis Sullivan's Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building. It has been called \\"a triumph of unified design\\" comparable to Henry Hobson Richardson's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store, and \\"one of the most exciting aesthetic experiences our commercial architecture has ever produced\\". The building was one of the first five selected by the Chicago Commission on Architectural Landmarks in 1958, \\"in recognition of its original design and its historical interest as the highest wall-bearing structure in Chicago\\". The commission went on to note that the \\"restrained use of brick, soaring massive walls, omission of ornamental forms, unite in a building simple yet majestic.\\" In 1973, the Chicago City Council voted unanimously to designate the Monadnock a Chicago Landmark, stating that \\"The two halves of this building provide a unique perspective for examining the history and development of modern architecture. ...

He played 145 matches in Serie A, scoring 29 goals. At international level, he represented Italy on six occasions between 1966 and 1967, scoring two goals, and took part at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Club career Meroni, of Gypsy heritage, began playing football in a small courtyard of 60 square metres, and then moved to the field of the Oratorio di San Bartolomeo in Como. From the age of two he had lost his father. His mother Rosa, a professional weaver, had financial difficulties raising three children: Celestino, Luigi (called Luigino, then Gigi) and Maria. His first job was as a designer of silk neckties, he also devoted himself to painting. His football career began in the Como youth sector, where he also made his debut for the first team, albeit in the second division. He was then sold to Genoa. In the shadow of the Lanterna, Meroni had moments of great notoriety. On the last match of the season, Meroni refused to undergo examinations for doping control, saying that he had forgotten the test in a hotel. Three other players tested positive for amphetamines and Meroni was suspended for the first five games of Serie A in 1963. In 1964, despite the discontent of the Genoa fans, Meroni was sold to Torino, a team coached by Nereo Rocco and on the rise after the decline following the tragedy of Superga. The transfer fee was 300 million lira, a record at the time for a player of only 21 years of age. He was nicknamed la farfalla granata the \\"maroon butterfly\\", with reference to his style of play and anticonformist outfits (he was notorious for his cohabitation as husband and wife with a young divorcee, Cristiana Uderstadt), and the \\"beatnik del gol\\" (the beatnik of goal) for his artistic interests and hippie lifestyle. Along with striker Nestor Combin, he formed a successful attacking partnership, preceding the glorious attacking partnership of Paolo Pulici and Francesco Graziani (i gemelli del gol, the goal twins) at Torino years later. Rumors of his move to cross-city rivals Juventus, for an offer of 750 million lire, triggered a sort of \\"crisis\\" and then popular Torino president Orfeo Pianelli, under the pressure of the fans, declined. In 1967 at San Siro, after one of his famous dribbles, he lobbed the ball from the edge of box into the top corner of the goal, interrupting the unbeaten home run of the Grande Inter of Helenio Herrera, forcing Inter Milan to be defeated after three years of positive results. International career Meroni made 6 appearances for Italian national team between 1966 and 1967, scoring 2 goals. His first call-up for Italy was in a qualifier against Poland in 1966, making his debut on 19 March 1966, in a 0–0 away draw against France. He scored the first goal for the Azzurri in Bologna, 14 June 1966, marking the sixth goal of the Italy–Bulgaria 6–1 friendly match in preparation for the World Cup. He scored a goal in the other friendly, Italy–Argentina 3–0, held in Turin eight days later. He participated in the ill-fated expedition led by coach Edmondo Fabbri at the World Cup in England in 1966, which culminated with the incredible 1–0 defeat to North Korea, and Italy's elimination in the first round. The continuing differences with the coach meant Meroni only played the second game against the USSR. Style of play Nicknamed La Farfalla Granata (\\"The Maroon Butterfly\\", as maroon is colour associated with Torino F.C.), Meroni was a quick, creative, agile, and modern right winger that wore the number 7 shirt. A diminutive, elegant, and highly talented player, with a slender build, who was regarded as one Italy's most promising wingers, his biggest strength was his excellent and unpredictable dribbling ability, which allowed him to trick and beat opposing defenders with feints. Due to his acceleration, speed, mobility, and technical skills, he would often undertake individual runs, coming face to face with the goalkeeper in one on one situations, after dribbling through the entire opposition defence, before scoring. Due to his playing position and unique offensive style of play, which combined searing pace with grace and outstanding technique, Meroni was often compared to George Best throughout his career, a comparison which was also strengthened due to their similar appearance, Beatles–inspired hairstyle, lifestyle off the pitch, and personality. Death Commemorative plaque on the place of the accident, Corso Re Umberto number 46 On 15 October 1967, Meroni died at the age of 24. Shortly after the end of a 4–2 victory over Sampdoria, in which he was sent off, Meroni was hit by a car while recklessly crossing Corso Re Umberto in Turin with his friend and Torino teammate Fabrizio Poletti.

Life Little is known about the life of Macías. His successor and compatriot Juan Rodríguez de la Cámara establishes that Macías was a native of Galicia. H. A. Rennert has determined the time period in which he lived based on a number of references, the earliest and most important of which is Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana’s 1449 letter to the Constable of Portugal Dom Pedro. In the letter, the Marqués mentions Macías as a contemporary of two late-fourteenth century poets, Basco Pérez de Camoes and Ferrant Casquiçio, whose lives are better documented. Don Martín de Ximena y Jurado in the Anales Eclesiásticos de Jaén, provides us with Macías’s probable resting place, the church of the castle of Santa Catalina in Arjonilla, a town near Jaén. Poetry Five poems (or cantigas) in the 1445 Cancionero de Baena are attributed to Macías, and he is the reputed author of sixteen others. Although all of Macías’s known poetry is amatory, the full extent his poetic production is unknown and may have included poems of other types, possibly in Castilian in addition to his native Galician. Legend It is not clear that if by the mid-15th century the poet’s name was already synonymous with love. For example, the Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana letter to Dom Pedro describes Macías as “aquel grand enamorado” (that great lover), and Juan de Mena refers to him in the Laberinto de fortuna (1444). Another allusion to Macías occurs at about the same time in La Celestina where Sempronio says: “aquel Macías, ydolo de los amantes” (that Macías, idol of lovers). These references reflect a legend that had developed around Macías after his death and may, to a greater or lesser extent, have some relation to real events in his life. The first extant version of the Macías legend is a gloss in the Sátira de felice e infelice vida, written between 1453 and 1455 by the same Dom Pedro to whom the Marquis addressed his earlier letter. Macías fell in love with a lady and began to perform services to make himself more deserving of her favor. One day, as the lady crossed a bridge on a beautiful stallion, her horse reared and she was thrown into a river. The fearless Macías then dove in to rescue her from drowning. Time passed and she married another man, but Macías continued to worship her from afar. Years later, he encountered the woman riding her horse and this time asked her to dismount in compensation for the many services he had rendered to her. She did and, after spending some time with Macías, left fearing that her husband would find her there. Moments later, her husband appeared and stabbed Macías with a lance in a fit of jealousy, killing him. In 1499, Hernán Nuñez penned another version in a gloss to a printed edition of Laberinto. According to this tradition, Macías was enamoured of a great lady from the court of the Maestre of Calatrava, leader of one of the most powerful military religious orders in Spain. During Macías’s absence the Maestre arranged the marriage of the lady with a rich hidalgo, so the lovers were unable to consummate their relationship. Macías, who would not desist from his wooing, was imprisoned at Arjonilla, and then murdered by the jealous husband with a lance threaded through a hole in the ceiling of the Macías's prison cell. Macías died singing lyric poems composed in praise of his lady. The last, and perhaps most popular, version of the legend of Macías appeared in the mid-16th century in the Historia de la nobleza del Andalucía by Gonzalo Argote de Molina (in Spanish). Argote’s version is essentially the same as Núñez’s, with the major difference that he gives the Maestre’s name as Enrique de Villena. Don Enrique held the position of Maestre from 1402 to 1414, long after Macías’s death, therefore the addition to the legend in Historia de la nobleza del Andalucía is not thought to be real. Influence on Peninsular literature Statue of Macías, Padrón. The legend of Macías left an indelible mark on Spanish literature. When allegory, inspired by Dante, invaded Spanish literature in the late 15th century, Macías became one of the foremost figures to appear in the many “infiernos de amor” (hells of love) written. These compositions feature voyages through a hell where the narrators encounter lovers tormented for eternity for their intemperate passion. The first of these poems was Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana’s Infierno de los enamorados (Lovers' hell), followed by Juan de Mena’s Laberinto de fortuna (1444), in which Mena puts prophetic words in Macías’s mouth: “Amores me dieron corona de amores/ porque mi nombre por más bocas ande” (Loves gave me a crown of loves/because my name travels most from mouth to mouth). The last of the “infiernos” to mention Macías was that of a famous poet Garci Sánchez de Badajoz, a favorite of the Catholic Monarchs. Despite the moralizing and exemplary nature of these poems, Macías is held up as a paragon of virtue. He appears in these works in the company of model lovers of the classical period, such as Theseus and Orpheus. Macías also appears in the Comedia de la Gloria d’Amor of Huc Bernat de Rocabertí, in the company of famous Castilian and Catalan lovers. Macías was even more famous among the Portuguese. He is held up as a model of virtue and constancy in love in the Cancioneiro de Resende at the end of the 15th century. During the 16th century, Portugal’s great epic poet Luís de Camões also makes reference to Macías in his “redondilha” poems. Although the 15th century was the high-water mark of Macías’s vogue as a symbol of unrequited love, he retained an interest for Spanish authors for hundreds of years thereafter. In the 17th century, artists generally took a more pessimistic view of Macías, whose unsophisticated, emotional nature contrasted with the baroque aesthetic. A notable exception to this trend, Lope de Vega, made Macías the hero of his drama, Porfiar hasta morir. Lope’s contemporary Luis de Góngora, however, was merely amused at the unreasonableness of Macías’s tale, and Calderón de la Barca found Macías useful only as an erudite, but dry, reference. The prevalence of Cartesian thought and the Neoclassical aesthetic in the 18th century was an even more hostile environment for Macías, a symbol of pure, reasonless emotion. However, at the beginning of the 19th century, Mariano José de Larra brings Macías back as the ideal romantic figure in his play Macías. Bibliography *Avalle- Arce, john cena.

In tapes made after the bombings, Salem alleged that an unnamed FBI supervisor knew about the bombing plot, but declined to move forward on a plan that would have used a \\"phony powder\\" to fool the conspirators into believing that they were working with genuine explosives. Federal authorities denied Salem's view of events and the New York Times concluded that the tapes \\"do not make clear the extent to which Federal authorities knew that there was a plan to bomb the World Trade Center, merely that they knew that a bombing of some sort was being discussed. But for the recordings, Emad would have been charged as a co-conspirator.

Later, the Pamphili family line merged with the Doria and Landi family lines to form the Doria-Pamphili-Landi family line. History The Pamphili surname originated in Gubbio and went to Rome under the pontificate of Pope Innocent VIII (1484–1492). The peak of Pamphili power came with the election of Giovanni Battista Pamphili as Pope Innocent X, who reigned from 1644–1655. Like the reign of his predecessor Pope Urban VIII (of the equally papal Barberini family), Innocent X's rule was littered with examples of nepotism. Members of the Pamphili family did exceptionally well from the Innocent X papacy. The following family members were created cardinals: *Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili (1644), the Pope's nephew and son of Olimpia Maidalchini, the Pope's sister-in-law and close adviser. He later renounced his cardinalate to marry Olimpia Aldobrandini, widow of Paolo Borghese *Francesco Maidalchini (1647), nephew of Olimpia Maidalchini *Camillo Astalli (1650 as \\"Camillo Astalli-Pamphili\\"), a cousin of Olimpia Maidalchini whom the Pope had adopted as a Cardinal-Nephew; he was later deprived of this title for disloyalty to Innocent X *Benedetto Pamphili, son of Camillo Pamphili and Olimpia Aldobrandini, created cardinal by Innocent XI in 1681 Like other Italian noble families, the Pamphili bought property (palazzi or \\"palaces\\" and other estates) and created self-styled principalities. Family members regularly had princely titles bestowed upon them by family patriarchs or matriarchs. Olimpia Maidalchini received the honorific title of Princess of San Martino, effectively turning the small enclave of San Martino into a principality in its own right. After he left the cardinalate to marry, Camillo Pamphili was given the titles of Prince of San Martino and Prince of Valmontone (he bought the Valmontone comune in 1634 from the Barberini family). =Family tree= Pamphili family treeThe Families And Descendants Of The Popes by George L. Williams from 1574 to 1760:This line of the Pamphili family ended in 1760 - no male heir of this generation had a male heir Wars of Castro Between 1639 and 1649, the Pamphili fought the Wars of Castro alongside the Barberini against the Farnese dukes of Parma who controlled Castro and its surrounding territories. The conflict raged first under Barberini Pope Urban VIII and later under Pamphili Pope Innocent X. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644 only two months after a peace accord was signed between the papal families and the dukes. Pope Innocent X was elected to replace him. Innocent set about investigating some of the finances related to the conflict which had been administered by the Barberini. A number of Barberini family members were forced into exile but were later reconciled with the papacy and the Pamphili through the marriage of Maffeo Barberini (son of exiled Taddeo Barberini) and Olimpia Giustiniani, a niece of Pope Innocent X. On the orders of Innocent X, Castro was razed on 2 September 1649 by troops of the Papal Army and never rebuilt. Family property Palazzo Pamphilj, by the architects Girolamo Rainaldi and Francesco Borromini, is located in the heart of Rione Parione, south of the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone in Piazza Navona, the Pamphili neighborhood of Rome, named for this reason Isola de' Pamphili. From 1652, on Saturdays and Sundays in August, the piazza was turned into a lake to celebrate the Pamphili family, a festival that was suppressed in 1866. Today, the palace functions as the Brazilian Embassy in Rome. The tomb of Innocent X is located in Sant'Agnese. In 1634 the Pamphilj bought the baronial palace in Valmontone, a town near Palestrina, outside (Rome): Camillo Pamphili was determined to create a sort of new “ideal city”, so the palace and the main church were rebuilt and decorated by important baroque artists, like the architect Mattia de Rossi (who rose to prominence under the mentorship of Bernini), and the painters Pier Francesco Mola, Gaspard Dughet, Guglielmo Cortese, Francesco Cozza and Mattia Preti. Another building in central Rome is the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, which houses the gallery of the same name.

They occurred as a result of heightened tension between the large and growing British Asian communities and the city's white majority, escalated by confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and far right groups such as the British National Party and the National Front.CNN:Far-right accused over UK riots CNN:Race riots not new to Britain Similar ethnic riots had occurred earlier in other parts of Northern England, such as Oldham in May and Burnley in June.Bagguley, P. and Hussain, Y. (2008) Riotous Citizens: ethnic conflict in multicultural Britain, Aldershot, Ashgate. The Upper Globe pub was damaged and stood derelict for many years afterwards. Background Bradford is historically a working class city. Since its rapid growth in the 19th century, there have been several significant waves of immigration, notably Irish (19th century), Poles (1940s–50s) and South Asian people since the 1950s. At the time of the riot, Bradford had the second largest population of South Asians of any UK city, with approximately 68,000 Pakistanis, 12,500 Indians, 5,000 Bangladeshis and 3,000 other Asians. However, the majority of people in the city were white (Ethnicity: 78.3% White, and 19.1% S.Asian according to the 2001 census). While the South Asian population in Bradford had grown, and there were areas which were still predominantly white and other areas which were predominantly South Asian, it is disputed whether segregation had grown over time, whether the phenomenon of white flight applies to Bradford, and whether one can accurately talk of ghettos in Bradford.Finney and Simpson (2009) pp. 122–124 in 'Sleepwalking to segregation'? Challenging myths about race and migration, Bristol: Policy Press. Accessed 2009-05-10. Archived 2009-05-14.

Tensions rose after the National Front attempted to organise a march in the city which was banned by Home Secretary David Blunkett under the Public Order Act 1986. The Anti Nazi League organised a rally in Centenary Square in the centre of the city, which was allowed to proceed. During the course of the rally, held on Saturday 7 July, a rumour was spread by some of the marchers that National Front sympathisers were gathering at a pub in the centre of Bradford. A confrontation then occurred outside the pub in the city centre during which an Asian man was stabbed. According to the appeal court, this incident almost certainly triggered the riot.Red Hot Curry:Sentences Reduced for Bradford Rioters Arun Kundnani: reprinted from IRR However, subsequent research amongst eyewitnesses contests this view with no single event being identifiable as a flashpoint. Riots The riot was estimated to have involved 1,000 youths. On the nights of 8 and 9 July 2001, groups of between thirty and a hundred white youths attacked police and Asian-owned businesses, in the Ravenscliffe and Holmewood areas. Initially there were 500 police being involved, but later reinforcements increased this to almost 1,000.Bagguley, P. and Hussain, Y. (2008) Riotous Citizens: ethnic conflict in multicultural Britain, Aldershot, Ashgate, page 58. What began as a riot turned into an ethnic-related disturbance, with targeting of businesses and cars, along with numerous attacks on shops and property. A notable point of the rioting was the firebombing of Manningham Labour Club, at the time a recreational centre. A 48-year-old Asian businessman was jailed for 12 years for the arson attack.BBC:Businessman jailed over Bradford riots The club reopened in the spring of 2006 on a different site, approximately one and a half miles away, on Bullroyd Lane, Four Lane Ends (The original site has now been redeveloped into a health and community centre and chemist). The most expensive act of the riot was the arson attack of a BMW dealership, which had previously been attacked in a 1995 disturbance. Aftermath More than 300 police officers were hurt during the riot. There were 297 arrests in total; 187 people were charged with the offence of riot, 45 with violent disorder and 200 jail sentences totalling 604 years were handed down.\\"Last Bradford rioter is sentenced\\", BBC, 21 December 2007, retrieved 21 December 2007. The last rioter was sentenced six-and-a-half years after the events. The number of convictions for riot was unprecedented in English legal history; the next highest amount was five for an investigation in London. The estimated damage was put at £7 million. The heaviest sentence handed out in connection with the riots was that of the aforementioned Mohammed Ilyas, a 48-year-old local businessman, who was found guilty of arson and being reckless as to whether life was endangered. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison on 3 July 2003. The Ouseley Report released 7 March 2005 recommended a \\"people's programme\\" to bring harmony to the city. The government subsequently commissioned the Cantle report which made 67 recommendations. In 2006 Channel 4 produced a non- fictional drama, Bradford Riots, directed by Neil Biswas.

He is often confused with Gil Polo, professor of Greek at Valencia University between 1566 and 1573; but this professor was not named Gaspar. He is also confused with his own son, Gaspar Gil Polo, the author of De origine et progressu juris romani (1615) and other legal treatises, who pleaded before the Cortes as late as 1626. A notary by profession, Polo was attached to the treasury commission which visited Valencia in 1571, became coadjutor to the chief accountant in 1572, went on a special mission to Barcelona in 1580, and died there in 1591. Timoneda, in the Sarao de amor (1561), alludes to him as a poet of repute; but of his miscellaneous verses only two conventional, eulogistic sonnets and a song survive. Polo finds a place in the history of the novel as the author of La Diana enamorada, a continuation of Montemayor's Diana, and perhaps the most successful continuation ever written by another hand. Cervantes, punning on the writer's name, recommended that the Diana enamorada should be guarded as carefully as though it were by Apollo himself; the hyperbole is not wholly, nor even mainly, ironic. The book is one of the most agreeable of Spanish pastorals; interesting in incident, written in fluent prose, and embellished with melodious poems, it was constantly reprinted, was imitated by Cervantes in the Canto de Caliope, and was translated into English, French, German and Latin. The English version of Bartholomew Young, published in 1598 but current in manuscript fifteen years earlier, included both Montemayor's original and Gil Polo's continuation. Yong's translation is said to have suggested the Felismena episode (originally in Montemayor) in The Two Gentlemen of Verona; the Latin version of Kaspar von Barth, entitled Erotodidascalus (Hanover, 1625), is a performance of uncommon merit, as well as a bibliographical curiosity.

The house remained in possession of the Ege family until 1911. Museum history Amidst Poe's centennial in 1909, a group of Richmond residents campaigned for the city to better recognize the writer. Citizens asked the city council to erect a statue of Poe on Monument Avenue, but were turned down because he was deemed a disreputable character. The same group went on to found the Poe Museum.Harry Lee Poe: Edgar Allan Poe: An Illustrated Companion to His Tell-Tale Stories. New York: Metro Books, 2008: 9. The New York Times called 1909 a banner year for acknowledgement of the importance of Poe, mentioning the Richmond museum. In 1911, Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) saved the house and opened it in 1922 as the Old Stone House. The museum is only blocks away from the sites of Poe's Richmond homes and place of employment, the Southern Literary Messenger. It is also a few blocks from the grave of his mother Eliza Poe who was buried in Richmond's Church Hill neighborhood, in the graveyard of St John's Church. Poe never lived in this home.

He visited the museum in 1975 and had his photo taken with the museum's renowned stuffed raven. In 2014, his daughter Victoria Price visited the museum, saying that Poe had been such a part of her life that she thought of him as her uncle. In 2016 Victoria Price returned to Richmond as part of a film festival featuring Poe films. The festival, in addition to a Poe Goes to the Movies Unhappy Hour with Victoria Price at the Poe Museum, presented films at Richmond's historic Byrd Theatre and An Evening with Victoria Price at the Cultural Arts Center in Glen Allen, Virginia.  Exhibits  The Poe Museum's three buildings contain exhibits focusing on different aspects of the author's life and legacy. The parlor of the Old Stone House is used for the display of furniture from the homes in which Edgar Poe and his sister Rosalie Mackenzie Poe lived. Of special interest in this room is a piano that once belonged to Poe's sister and Edgar's childhood bed. The Elizabeth Arnold Poe Memorial Building includes many first and early editions of Poe's works including an 1845 publication of \\"The Raven\\" and one of only 12 known existing copies of Poe's first collection Tamerlane and Other Poems.Lloyd Rose: \\"Yo, Poe: In Richmond, a museum rises from the dead.\\" The Washington Post, May 10, 1998. Manuscripts and rare early daguerreotypes and portraits are also exhibited there. The North Building is dedicated to exploring Poe's mysterious death. Among the highlights of the collection displayed are Poe's vest, trunk, walking stick and a lock of his hair. There are over 26 published theories on Poe's death, but the museum postulates that the 19th century practice of Cooping could have been a contributor to his death. A courtyard area behind the museum includes a garden inspired by Poe's poem \\"To One in Paradise.\\" The Enchanted Garden has a fountain, a shrine, and several gardens inspired by Poe's writing, such as a rock inscribed with a character's name from \\"A Tale of The Ragged Mountains\\" and a brick wall similar to the one described in \\"William Wilson.\\" The garden is also home to the two resident cats, Edgar and Pluto.

Each player selects one of the nine IRIS characters; each character is visually distinct, but does not have differing abilities that affect gameplay. A player may choose to play as two classes: Assault and Support. The main difference between Assault and Support is that Support can replenish teammates' ammo. The player also chooses a main weapon, a side arm, and an item. Each round, a player is selected automatically to be the Hidden, usually based on how much damage they dealt to the Hidden in previous rounds. All the other players play as the IRIS, whose goal is to work as a team to hunt down the Hidden and contain it. After the time limit hits, or either side kills the other, the round will end, and a new Hidden may be selected depending on a number of variables including who won the previous round, who dealt the most damage, etc.  The Hidden  As the Hidden, the player is given several extra abilities not available to the IRIS; The Hidden is nearly invisible, with only a little distortion of the background indicating his presence, sticking to walls, and the ability to detect enemies' auras from a distance. Other abilities include pouncing and cannibalizing corpses of slain enemies to replenish health.

Coin of Artabazos. Satrap of Dascylium, Lampsakos, Mysia, circa 356 BC Artabazos II (in Greek Αρτάβαζος) (fl. 389 – 328 BC) was a Persian general and satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia. He was the son of the Persian satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia Pharnabazus II, and younger kinsman (most probably nephew) of Ariobarzanes of Phrygia who revolted against Artaxerxes II around 356 BC. His first wife was an unnamed Greek woman from Rhodes, sister of the two mercenaries Mentor of Rhodes and Memnon of Rhodes. Towards the end of his life, he became satrap of Bactria for Alexander the Great. Revolt of Datames In 362 BC, Artabazos was sent by Artaxerxes II to capture Datames, the satrap of Cappadocia, who had joined in the Satraps' revolt to which participated Artabazus' brother, Ariobarzanes. However, Artabazos was defeated by Datames. Artaxerxes II ultimately prevailed, and Ariobarzanes was crucified and Datames assassinated. Rebellion against Artaxerxes III Following the capture and death of his brother, Artabazos was made satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, but in 356 BC he refused obedience to the new Persian king, Artaxerxes III. Artaxerxes had ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of Asia Minor, as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt. The order was ignored by Artabazus, who asked for the help of Athens in a rebellion against the king. Artabazos then became involved in a revolt against the king and against other satraps who acknowledged the authority of Artaxerxes III. Artabazos was at first supported by Chares, an Athenian general, and his mercenaries, whom he rewarded very generously. The gold coinage of Artabazos is thought to have been issued specifically to reward the troops of Chares. The Satrap of Mysia, Orontes I, was also on his side. Later, Artabazos was also supported by the Thebans, who sent him 5,000 men under Pammenes. With the assistance of these and other allies, Artabazos defeated the King in two great battles. However, Artaxerxes III was later able to deprive Artabazos of his Athenian and Boeotian allies by counter-bribing them, whereupon Artabazos was defeated by the king's general, Autophradates, and was taken prisoner. Mentor and Memnon, two brothers-in-law of Artabazos, who had supported him, still continued the revolt, as they were aided by the Athenian mercenary leader, Charidemus. Together they were able to free Artabazos. =Exile in Macedonia at the court of Philip II (352–342 BC)= After this, Artabazos seems either to have continued his rebellious operations or at least started a fresh revolt. However, eventually, he had no choice but to flee with Memnon and his family. They went into exile and took refuge at the court of Philip II of Macedonia in Pella, together with their 11 sons and 10 daughters. Artabazos, who was 37, and his family were exiled at the court of Philip II for about ten years, from 352 to 342, and during that time Artabazos became acquainted with the future Alexander the Great. Barsine, daughter of Artabazos, and future wife of Alexander, grew up at the Macedonian court. Return to Persia During the absence of Artabazos, Mentor of Rhodes, his brother-in-law, was of great service to the king of Persia in his war against Nectanebo II of Egypt. After the close of this war, in the summer of 342 BC, Artaxerxes gave Mentor the command against the rebellious satraps of western Asia. Mentor took advantage of this opportunity to ask the king to grant a pardon to Artabazos and Memnon. The king agreed and both men and their families were able to return to Persia. In the subsequent reign of Darius III Codomannus, Artabazos distinguished himself by his loyalty and commitment to the new Persian king. He took part in the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, and afterwards accompanied Darius on his flight from Alexander's Macedonian armies. =Hellenistic satrap of Bactria= After the final defeat and death of Darius III in 330 BC, Alexander recognised and rewarded Artabazos for his loyalty to the Persian king by giving him the satrapy of Bactria, a post he held until his death in 328 BC. Family Claire Bloom as Barsine, daughter of Artabazos II, and Richard Burton as Alexander the Great, in the 1956 film Alexander the Great. Artabazos' daughter, Barsine, may have married Alexander and may have been the mother of Heracles. Another daughter, Artacama, was given in marriage to Ptolemy; and a third daughter, Artonis, was given in marriage to Eumenes. In 328 BC, Artabazos resigned his satrapy, which was given to Cleitus the Black. Artabazos also had a son named Pharnabazus (fl. 370–320 BC). Family tree of the later Pharnacids.

Satna - Civil Line Square History =From antiquity to the mutiny of 1857= At nearby Bharhut are the remains of a 2nd-century BC Buddhist stupa, first discovered in 1873 by the archaeologist Alexander Cunningham; most of the finds from this site were sent to the Indian Museum. The Mahabharata associates this site with rulers of the Haihaya, Kalchuri or Chedi clans. The chiefs of Rewash, descended from Baghel Rajputs (who were in turn descended from the Solanki), ruled over Gujrat from the tenth to the thirteenth century. Vyaghra Deo, brother of the ruler of Gujrat, is said to have made his way into northern India about the middle of the thirteenth century and obtained the fort of Marpha, 18 miles north-east of Kalinjar. of Bandhavgarh (now in the tehsil of the same name in Umaria district), which, until its conquest in 1562 by Akbar the Great, was the Baghel capital. In 1298, general prince Ulugh Khan, acting under order of his brother Sultan Alauddin Khalji, drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujrat out of his country. This is believed to have caused a considerable migration of the Baghels to Bandhavgarh. From then until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhavgarh were engaged in extending their possessions and so they escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans. In 1498–99, Sikandar Lodi failed in his attempt to take the fort of Bandhavgarh. The Baghel King Ramchandra (1555–92) was a contemporary of padshah (emperor) Akbar the Great. Tansen, the great musician, was in the court of Ramchandra and from there Akbar summoned him to his Mughal court. After the death of Birdhabra, Ramchandra's son Vikramaditya acceded to the Rajput throne of Bandhogarh as a minor Raja, giving rise to civic disturbances. Akbar's generals intervened, capturing and dismantling the Bandhogarh fort in 1562. From then, the town of Rewa, along with the Sultanate of Malwa were became a part of the Great Mughal Empire. Following the Treaty of Bassein (1802), the British made overtures of alliance to the ruler of Rewa, but the latter rejected them. In 1812, during the time of Raja Jaisingh (1809–35), a body of Pindaris raided Mirzapur from Rewa territory. As a result, Jaisingh was called upon to accede to a treaty, in which he acknowledged the protection of the British Government, and agreed to refer all disputes with neighboring chiefs to their arbitration and to allow British troops to march through, or be cantoned within, his territories. Gupta era's Famous Bhoomra Shiv Temple in Satna District During the mutiny of 1857, Maharaja Raghuraj Singh helped the British in quelling the uprisings in the neighboring Mandla and Jabalpur district, and in Nagod which is now a part of Satna district. For his part the king was rewarded by restoration of the Sohagpur (Shahdol) and Amarkantak parganas, which had been seized by the Marathas in the beginning of the century.

At present Maharaja Ragvendra Pratap Singh judeo coronation held on 2013 and his son is Yuvraj Prathu Pratap Singh judeo and Maharajkumar Punya Pratap Singh. Nagod state Until the 18th century, the state was known as Unchahara from the name of its original capital. The chiefs of Nagod were Parihar, Rajputs belonging traditionally to Mount Abu. In the seventh century, Parihar Rajputs drove out the Gaharwar rulers and established themselves in the country between Mahoba and Mau. In the ninth century, they were repulsed eastwards by the Chandels, where Raja Dhara Singh seized the fort of Naro from the Teli Rajas in 1344. In 1478 Raja Bhoj obtained Unchahara, which he made the chief town. It remained so until 1720, when the capital was moved to Nagod by Raja Chainsingh. Later, the Parihars lost all their territories to the Baghels and Bundelas except the limited territory that they held before 1947. Following the treaty of Bassein in 1820, Nagod was held to be a tributary to Panna and was included in the sanad granted to that state in 1807. In 1809, however, a separate sanad was granted to Lal Sheshraj Singh confirming him in his possessions. For his loyalty during the 1857 mutiny, Chief Raghvendra Singh was rewarded by the British who granted him eleven villages, which had formerly belonged to the confiscated state of Bijeraghogarh. Bhoomra Shiv Temple in Unchahara is an exceptional example of 5th centuery indian architecture. it was made during Gupta Era. Nagod chiefs had the title of Raja and received a 9 gun salute. Maihar state Maihar State was a princely state in India during the British Raj. The state had an area of 1,050 square kilometres (407 sq mi), and a population of 63,702 in 1901. The state, which included the Tons River, consists mainly of alluvial soil covering sandstone, and is fertile except in the hilly district of the south. A large area was forested, and lumber provided a small export trade. The state was founded in 1778 by Rajput of the Kachwaha clan, who were granted land by the ruler of the nearby state of Orchha. From 1788 to 1790 Maihar State was occupied by Banda. The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new Bagelkhand Agency in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency. The state suffered severely from famine in 1896–1897. Maihar became a station on the East Indian Railway (now the West Central Railway) line between Satna and Jabalpur, 156 kilometres (97 mi) north of Jabalpur. Extensive ruins of shrines and other buildings surround the town. As of 1940 it had a population of 79,558 and an area of 412 square miles. In 1948 Maihar was merged into India. Kothi state Kothi State was a princely state of the British Raj. It belonged to the Bagelkhand Agency of Central India. Its capital was at Kothi, in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh. It was a relatively small Sanad state of about 438 km2 with a population of 19,112 inhabitants in 1901. The state's territory divided neighbouring Sohawal State in two parts.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 70. Kothi State was founded at an uncertain date by a Rajput ruler who expelled the former Bharr ruler of the area. Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century, and in much the same manner as neighboring Sohawal, Kothi became a British protectorate initially subordinate to Panna State. However, a separate sanad was granted to Rais Lal Duniyapati Singh in 1810. The last ruler of Kothi signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950. Sohawal state Sohawal State was a princely state of the Bagelkhand Agency of the British Raj. It was a relatively small sanad state of about 552 km2 with a population of 32,216 inhabitants in 1901. Its capital was at Sohawal, a small town —2,108 inhabitants in 1901— located in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh. The state was divided in two sections, separated by territory belonging to Kothi State and, on its northern side, it formed a small enclave within neighbouring Panna State. Sohawal State was founded in the mid sixteenth century by a ruler named Fateh Singh. It had originally been much larger, but lost significant territory within the first centuries of its existence. Sohawal became a British protectorate, initially subordinate to Panna State, but a separate sanad was granted to Rais Aman Singh in 1809. During the 1830 - 1833 interregnum, Sohawal came under direct British administration.[2] The last ruler of Sohawal signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950. * Chaube Jagirs (five feudatory estates). =Modern history= The Satna District is part of the region of Bagelkhand, a large part of which was ruled by the state of Rewa. A small part of Satna was ruled by feudatory chiefs, holding their states under the British Raj. Satna's name comes from the Satna River (or Sutna) which originates at Sarang Ashram (Sutikshna Ashram), situated near Sarangpur village in the Panna district. Previously, Sutna was the name of the railway station, the town being Raghurajnagar, but gradually the name of the station became associated with the city that is now Satna. During the Ramayana Era, Lord Rama stayed in the region of Chitrakoot, half of which is in the outskirts of Satna, the other in Uttar Pradesh. Once a British headquarters, the Baghelkhand Agency was established in Satna in 1872 (and abolished in 1931). Col. D.W.K. Barr prepared plans to develop Satna during the years 1882–88 and Sir Donald Robertson supervised construction of roads and other amenities according to those plans in 1888–94.

The University grew in size quite rapidly; St Salvator's College was established in 1450, St Leonard's College in 1511 and St Mary's College in 1537. Some of the college buildings in use today date from this period as does St Salvator's Chapel. At this time much of the teaching was of a religious nature and was conducted by clerics associated with the cathedral. Foundation The University of St Andrews owed its origin to a society formed in 1410 by Laurence of Lindores, abbot of Scone, Richard de Cornell, archdeacon of Lothian, and the later bishop of Dunblane, William Stephenson, among others. In 1411 the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw, issued a charter which attracted the most learned men in Scotland as professors. In 1413 Avignon Pope Benedict XIII issued six bulls confirming the charter and constituting the society a university. Lectures took place in various parts of the town until 1430, when Wardlaw allowed the lecturers the use of a building called the Paedagogium, or St Johns, granted by Robert of Montrose to that end. Bishop Kennedy founded and richly endowed St Salvator's College in 1450, the foundation being confirmed by Pope Martin V; seven years later it gained the right to confer degrees in theology and philosophy, and by the end of the century was regarded as a constituent part of the university. In 1512 Prior John Hepburn and Archbishop Alexander Stewart founded St Leonard's College on the site of the buildings which at one time served as a hospital for pilgrims. In the same year Archbishop Stewart nominally changed the original Paedagogium into a college and annexed to it the parish church of St Michael of Tarvet; but its actual erection into a college did not take place until 1537, when it was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Assumption. The outline of the ancient structure has survived, but various restorations have much altered its general character. It forms two sides of a quadrangle, the library and principal's residence standing on the north and the lecture rooms and the old dining-hall to the west. At its foundation in 1538 St Mary's was intended to be a College for instruction in Divinity, Law, and Medicine, as well as in Arts, but its career on this extensive scale was short-lived. Under a new foundation and erection, confirmed by Parliament in 1579, it was set apart for the study of Theology only, and it has remained a Divinity College ever since. Development During the 17th to 19th centuries, the university underwent many changes. The distinctive red gowns which are still in use today were adopted in 1672 and towards the end of the seventeenth century a move to Perth was considered and eventually rejected. In 1747 St Salvator's and St Leonard's were merged to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. During the nineteenth century student numbers were very low and the university having to close was a very real possibility. In the 1870s there were fewer than 150 students, and perhaps partly in response to this the university was, in 1897, strengthened by the foundation of University College in Dundee which became a centre of medical and scientific excellence. In 1876, the University Senate decided to allow women to receive an education at St Andrews at a level roughly equivalent to the MA men were able to take at the time (two years before University College London would become the first university in the UK to admit women on equal terms to men). The scheme came to be known as the 'L.L.A. examination' (Lady Literate in Arts), required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level, and entitled them to hold a diploma from the University. In 1889 the Universities (Scotland) Act made it possible to formally admit women to St Andrews, and from this point onwards, the L.L.A was recognized as a university degree, although not on equal footing to the MA. Agnes Forbes Blackadder became the first woman to graduate from St Andrews on the same level as men of the time in October 1894, gaining her MA, going on to receive an MD from Glasgow University and becoming an eminent dermatologist in London. She entered the university in 1892, making St Andrews the first university in Scotland to admit women undergraduates on the same level as men. In response to the increasing number of female students residing in St Andrews, the first women's hall was built in 1896, and was named University Hall. University of Dundee The affiliation of Dundee ended in 1967 when the college, which had been renamed Queen's College, became a separate and independent institution as the University of Dundee - the loss of teaching facilities for clinical medicine caused the University's Bute Medical School to form a new attachment with the University of Manchester. Today the university is growing rapidly and in relatively sound financial health. Alongside the loss of the main body of the medical school, the independence of Queen's College also resulted in a number of other 'prestige subjects', such as Law and Dentistry, no longer being taught at the University. University Library The University library, which now includes the older college libraries, was founded in 1612 at the institution of King James VI, who with other members of the Royal Family donated 228 works for that purpose.A note on the early history of St Andrews University Library, by R.V. PringleSt Andrews University Library, Sources for Library History, 1 : A revised transcript of the 'Foundation List' of 1612-13, by R.V. Pringle It was situated in a purpose-built building on the site of the old Pedagogy, later remodelled in 1764, and improved in 1829 and 1889 - 1890. The lower hall in the older part of the building was used for University meetings, examinations and academical ceremonials, and at times as a provincial meeting-place for the Scots Parliament. When the constitution of the colleges was remodelled in 1579 St Mary's was set apart for theology; and in 1747 the colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard were formed into the United College. The co-educational St Leonards School now occupies the buildings of the former St Leonard's College. Modern Period St Salvator's Chapel, by Malcolm McFadyenThe modern buildings, in the Jacobean style, were erected between 1827 and 1847. University College, Dundee, became in 1890 affiliated to the University of St Andrews. The House of Lords set aside this arrangement in 1895, but a re- affiliation took place in 1897. In 1887 - 1888 a common dining-hall for the students was established; in 1892 provision was made within the university for the instruction of women; and for the board and residence of women students a permanent building was opened in 1896. To the south of the library medical buildings, erected by the munificence of the 3rd Marquess of Bute, were opened in 1899. It was during the principalship of Dr James Donaldson, who succeeded John Tulloch (1823–1886), that most of the modern improvements were introduced. The University retains ownership of the tiny St Leonards college chapel, and candle-lit services take place weekly during term-time. The United College occupies the site of St Salvator's College, but the old buildings have been removed, with the exception of the college chapel, now used as the university chapel, a fine Gothic structure, containing an elaborate tomb of Bishop Kennedy and John Knox's pulpit; the entrance gateway, with a square clock tower (152 feet high); and the janitor's house with some classrooms above. Since 2006 the university have allowed equal rights to The St Andrews Pagan Society, but under some strict rules. In 2009 Louise Richardson was installed as principal and vice-chancellor of the University. Not only was she the first woman to hold that position, but she is an Irish-American Catholic. She stated \\"I don’t believe that talent resides predominantly among males, or among the upper classes\\". Dr Sally Mapstone succeeded her as principal and vice-chancellor on Richardson's appointment to the University of Oxford. \\"In Scotland, New Leadership Crumbles Old Barrier\\" article by Raymond Bonner in The New York Times March. 27, 2009 References See also * Governance of the University of St Andrews * General Council of the University of St Andrews University of St Andrews St Andrews History of education in Scotland University of St Andrews St Andrews ","title":"History of the University of St Andrews"},{"id":"2980887","text":"James Robert Rhind, architect, was born in Inverness, Scotland in 1854 and trained as an architect in his father's local practice.

His designs were selected for 7 libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind’s libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features.

They continue to serve on the faculty of the school. The original McGill Institute building was on Government Street, in downtown Mobile. In 1952, the school moved to Old Shell Road, across the street from Bishop Toolen School for Girls. Bishop Toolen School for Girls was founded in 1928 by Bishop Thomas J. Toolen and was administered by the Sisters of Loretto until it merged with McGill Institute in 1972 to form the co-educational McGill–Toolen Catholic High School. The original McGill Institute building, demolished in 1955. In December 2007, the Mobile Register reported that supporters of the school raised $10.3 million to renovate the campus and add a new science building and student center. The science facility was opened in 2009, giving every science teacher their own classroom and lab space. The student center is a two-story building fronting Lafayette Street and includes a cafeteria, chapel, and student plaza. It was completed in 2016. Sports and traditions McGill–Toolen is sometimes called \\"McT\\" for short. The school colors are orange and black, and the mascot is a yellowjacket.

He was also the last legitimate member of the House of Barcelona, the former royal house of Aragon. When political power was denied to him, he turned to writing. He was persecuted by of Aragon and of Castile owing to his reputation as a necromancer. Life He was born in Torralba de Cuenca, in Castile. After the death of his father, Pedro de Aragón y Villena, Enrique went to the Aragonese court. There he was raised by his aristocratic grandfather, Alfonso de Aragón, first marquess of Villena, who claimed descent from James II of Aragon and Blanche of Naples. At court he met the leading literary and intellectual minds of his era and became skilled in mathematics, chemistry and philosophy. The Aragonese queen, Violant of Bar, aware of Villena's academic gifts, invited him to study at the royal court of Barcelona, where Villena met the leading authors of Catalan literature. This experience further solidified Villena's already promising future. However, Villena encountered difficulty towards the end of the fourteenth century when his grandfather began losing power in the Castilian court. By 1398, Alfonso had lost his position as marquess of Villena. This loss did not rest well with either Alfonso or Villena. Alfonso spent the next many years attempting to re-instate his grandson as marquess of Villena. Meanwhile, Villena straightforwardly declared himself Marquess of Villena, signing all official documents in this name, though this was not legally correct. Historians believe Villena traveled to Castile during the first years of the fifteenth century, took residence there, and married María de Albornoz, a wealthy heiress from Cuenca, Spain. Continuing this rise towards aristocratic prominence, Villena soon received titles as count of Cangas and Tineo, offered to him by his cousin, King Henry III of Castile, who had taken Villena's wife for a mistress. However, in 1404, Villena resigned from the court to pursue world travel. That same year, Villena tried to become master of the Order of Calatrava, a prestigious religious and military order. Pursuing this position, Enrique divorced his wife, claiming impotence, and renounced his position as count so he could officially become a friar of Calatrava. The King of Castile mandated that the (commanders) of Calatrava promote Enrique as master of the Order. This position, however, did not suit Villena well for, although intelligent, he was not politically competent. Authorities soon stripped him of his leadership position. Fortunately for Villena, he received a token of good fortune when his cousin, Infante Ferdinand of Castile, became King of Aragon in 1412. Villena enjoyed several years of tranquil peace as Fernando's personal assistant. However, upon Ferdinand I's death in 1416, Villena returned to Castile and spent the next several years at his wife's estates in Cuenca taking care of family affairs. He obtained the lordship of Miesta, and, conscious of his unsuitability for warfare or political life, dedicated himself to literature. He also had affairs with other aristocratic ladies. As a result, he had two daughters born out of wedlock. One of them lived from 1430 to 1490, was baptized as Elionor Manuel, and entered under the name of Isabel de Villena a convent in Valencia. There she became abbess in 1463 and wrote a Vita Christi that was published posthumously by the new abbess in 1497. During 1420 to 1425 not much is known about Villena other than that he wrote Arte cisoria and various treatises during this time. From 1426 to 1429, Alfonso the Magnanimous stripped Villena of his promised inheritance as Duke of Gandía, giving the position instead to his own brother. Thus, facing financial straits, Villena depended on his nephew for economic support until his death from gout in 1434. Legend Enrique de Villena had various talents and interests, many of which are exemplified in his writing. In Arte de Cisoria (The Art of Carving), Villena meticulously describes the tools used, the steps taken, and the rules of etiquette while table carving. His knowledge came from personal observation and experience working at the court of Castile for his cousin and nephew, Henry III and John II of Castile, respectively. Villena's comprehension of 15th century medicine is seen in his work Tratado de la fascinación o de aojamiento (Treatise on the Evil Eye). In addition to describing the origin of the evil eye, he offers traditional and \\"present\\" methods for the prevention, diagnosis and cure of the illness. Further medical knowledge and research is seen in his work Tratado de la lepra (Treatise on Leprosy). In Villena's Tratado de la consolación (Treatise on Consolation), we see his understanding of psychology. Although a Treatise on Astrology is wrongly attributed to Villena, it is said that he devoted much of his time to the studies of alchemy, astrology, philosophy and mathematics. This led to his widespread reputation as a necromancer. Like Roger Bacon and other figures, he was reputed to have constructed a brazen head able to answer his questions.. Upon Villena's death in 1434, the king ordered Bishop Lope de Barrientos to investigate his library. Barrientos had many of Villena's books burned, strengthening the public's assumption that he was involved in witchcraft. A few of the remaining books went to the poet Santillana, while the rest of them went to the king. Works Don Enrique de Villena's literary achievements are quite diverse. Perhaps Villena's most successful work among Spanish readers was his interpretation of Los doce Trabajos de Hércules (The Twelve Works of Hercules). Twelve Works draws on Greek mythology for its subject matter and Christian literary traditions for its allegorical significance, a synthesis that Villena makes throughout the work. Written in Catalan and then adapted into Castilian, the work contains obvious and didactic moral messages which Villena found applicable and important within the framework of contemporary Spain. Twelve Works is divided into twelve chapters, and each of those into four parts. Villena justifies his adaptation of foreign myth through the common idea that good fiction is able to both delight the reader and, through that delight, lead the reader to virtuous action. Written in 1417, Twelve Works of Hercules made Villena's literary reputation, perhaps because it lacks the erudition and theoretical complexity of the later treatises. Villena's Arte de Trovar is valued least for its literary merit. Described as \\"frustrating and sterile\\" (85), Arte de Trovar is a treatise on the rules and proper prosody of troubadour poetry. The work, like Villena's other treatises, is erudite and difficult, concerning itself with complex laws of meter and versification, which were laid down as a result of lesser poets violating the structures of the \\"gay science\\" of Troubadour poetry. These poetic structures were viewed by Villena as a \\"true and immutable order of things\\", and the genius of the poet was to make his words or stories conform to the laws of this order. Arte de Trovar attests to the important cultural exchange between Catalonia and the Provençal region of southern France (the home of troubadour lyric poetry), and conveys a sense of nostalgia on Villena's part for the chivalric and highly decorous world of troubadour subject matter. Arte de Trovar was completed between 1417 and 1428. Also of importance are Villena's translations of Virgil's The Aeneid and Dante's Divine Comedy into Castilian. Villena was the first translator and one of the first to translate in prose, respectively, Dante's poem into another vernacular language and Virgil's epic poem into a Romance language (1427–28), and was faced with the difficulty of maintaining the subtlety and depth of The Aeneid while appealing to a largely unlearned audience that was used to easily decipherable allegorical stories. Along with an initial section of \\"advice for the beginning reader\\", the text comments as to how the examples of the ancient text may still be practically applied to contemporary Castilian society. Along with his interest in Virgil, Villena's translation of Dante's Divine Comedy reflects, perhaps, a shifting interest from the courtly poets discussed in Arte de Trovar to a divinely inspired Christian poet based on Roman models. Villena also translated Petrarch's sonnets. These translations of classical literature were widely read by a growing community of literary nobility, a social circle in which Villena was among the most important members. Esotericism Villena's esoteric works include his Treatise on Astrology and Treatise on the Evil Eye. In the first, Villena appropriated biblical discourse citing several passages of Peter Comestor's paraphrased bible Historia Scholastica which acquiesce in astrology and magic. He defends magical and astrological representations of Jewish cult objects like the Tabernacle and the Temple, represents Moses as an astrologer and practitioner of talismanic magic and identifies Zoroaster as his source and founder of magic.https://fh.mdp.edu.ar/revistas/index.php/magallanica/article/view/1514/2220 This kind of esoteric discourse would be formulated at length by Marsilio Ficino at the end of the 15th century under the label of Prisca Theologia. In addition, in his Treatise on the Evil Eye Villena defended Jewish cabalistic practices to cure the evil eye, preceding several years the interest of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola in kabbala during the Italian Renaissance.http://revistamelancolia.com/index.php/melancolia/article/view/3/3 Legacy Villena's deep interest in science and his great knowledge of astrology and other religious mystical systems gave him the reputation of a necromancer during his lifetime. This brought some of his works into question. Despite this, modern critics now see Villena as one of the most important Castilian intellectual leaders of the 15th century. Villena exemplified characteristics of vernacular humanism in his translations and adaptations of the classical works. He encouraged Italian humanist thought and took some of the first steps to incorporate Latin culture and intellect into the culture of Castile. This started a movement to convert classical works into modern vernacular languages so that they could be read and enjoyed by more than just Latin scholars. Villena was a strong believer in poetry's necessary role in creating the intellectual elite. This is shown in the way he seeks to instruct his readers on various aspects of morality in his texts. He tries to influence the Castilian court and aristocracy on virtue and etiquette. His most significant classical translation, Virgil's Aeneid, was among the first complete translations of this work into a romance language. It was completed in 1428. He translates the work and provides commentary that enables readers to grasp the obscurity of the text and gives literal interpretations of specific information in order to teach the Castilian society the proper behaviors of courtiers. Typical of vernacular humanism, Villena's commentary and translation of the Aeneid exhibits Villena's feeling that reading and intellectual curiosity are important in the education of the elite. The accusations of necromancy and the heavy influence Italian Humanism had on his writing made him a bit controversial. The controversy surrounding Villena's personal character spread his popularity by the interest it sparked in authors who followed. Villena often appears as a character in literature. In El doncel de don Enrique el Doliente, Mariano José de Larra portrays Villena as an evil figure. Lope de Vega's Porfiar hasta morir illustrates Villena as more of a hero figure who works for justice. There is not one portrayal of Villena's personal character accurate enough to give us a complete understanding of what he was really like. His literary accomplishments have survived time, but the uncertainty surrounding his life still remains a mystery. However, he is viewed as an intellectual pioneer who exhibited civic virtue and wrote with poetic eloquence.

Shoring comes from shore, a timber or metal prop.\\"shore, n. 3.\\" def, 1. Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 Shoring may be vertical, angled, or horizontal.  Techniques  =Buildings= Single steel raking shore system specifically for tilt slab shoring. Raking Shores In this method, inclined members called rakers are used to give temporary lateral support to an unsafe wall. One or more timbers slope between the face of the structure to be supported and the ground. The most effective support is given if the raker meets the wall at an angle of 60 to 70 degrees. A wall-plate is typically used to increase the area of support. Foundations Shoring is commonly used when installing the foundation of a building. A shoring system such as piles and lagging or shotcrete will support the surrounding loads until the underground levels of the building are constructed. Commonly used shoring equipment includes post shores, shoring beams, and timber jacks. =Trenches= Schematic sketch of a modern steel trench shore being lowered into a trench. During excavation, shoring systems speed up excavation and provide safety for workers since trenches can be prone to collapse. In this case, shoring should not be confused with shielding. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse where shielding is only designed to protect workers when collapses occur. Concrete- structure and stone-building shoring, in these cases also referred to as falsework, provides temporary support until the concrete becomes hard and achieves the desired strength to support loads. Hydraulic Shoring Hydraulic shoring is the use of hydraulic pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or plywood, either being 1-1/8\\" thick plywood, or special heavy Finland Form (FINFORM) 7/8\\" thick. Beam and Plate Beam and Plate steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations. Soil Nailing Soil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements - normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface. =Shoring in Ships= Shoring is used on board when damage has been caused to a vessel's integrity, and to hold leak-stopping devices in place to reduce or stop incoming water. Generally consists of timber 100 mm x 100 mm and used in conjunction with wedges, to further jam shoring in place, pad pieces to spread the load and dogs to secure it together. also used on board is mechanical shoring as a quick, temporary solution, however it isn't favoured due to its inability to move with the vessel. Proud This consists of a timber member jammed on a pad piece on either the deck or deck head depending on water levels in the compartment and a strong point, this is called the proud. Then there is a horizontal timber cut to size to fit between this and what it is shoring up, e.g. a splinter box, bulkhead or door. Timber wedges are then used to tighten up the structure if necessary. Vertical Shoring This is to support a hatch or splint box on the deck, consisting of a vertical timber between the deck and deck head, with to wedges used opposing each other to tighten it. pad pieces are used to spread the load on weak structures.

In animal breeding, it is the process of removing or segregating animals from a breeding stock based on specific trait. This is done to exaggerate desirable characteristics, or to remove undesirable characteristics by altering the genetic diversity of the population. For livestock and wildlife, culling often refers to the act of killing removed animals based on their individual characteristics, such as their sex or species membership. In fruits and vegetables, culling is the sorting or segregation of fresh harvested produce into marketable lots, with the non-marketable lots being discarded or diverted into food processing or non-food processing activities. This usually happens at collection centres located at, or close to farms. Origin of the term The word comes from the Latin colligere, which means \\"to collect\\". The term can be applied broadly to mean sorting a collection into two groups: one that will be kept and one that will be rejected. The cull is the set of items rejected during the selection process. The culling process is repeated until the selected group is of proper size and consistency desired. Pedigreed animals In the breeding of pedigreed animals, both desirable and undesirable traits are considered when choosing which animals to retain for breeding and which to place as pets. The process of culling starts with examination of the confirmation standard of the animal and will often include additional qualities such as health, robustness, temperament, color preference, etc. The breeder takes all things into consideration when envisioning their ideal for the breed or goal of their breeding program. From that vision, selections are made as to which animals, when bred, have the best chance of producing the ideal for the breed. Breeders of pedigreed animals cull based on many criteria. The first culling criterion should always be health and robustness. Secondary to health, temperament and conformation of the animal should be considered. The filtering process ends with the breeder's personal aesthetic preferences on pattern, color, etc. =The Tandem Method= The Tandem Method is a form of selective breeding where a breeder addresses one characteristic of the animal at a time, thus selecting only animals that measure above a certain threshold for that particular trait while keeping other traits constant. Once that level of quality in the single trait is achieved, the breeder will focus on a second trait and cull based on that quality. With the tandem method, a minimum level of quality is set for important characteristics that the breeder wishes to remain constant. The breeder is focussing improvement in one particular trait without losing quality of the others. The breeder will raise the threshold for selection on this trait with each successive generation of progeny, thus ensuring improvement in this single characteristic of his breeding program. For example, a breeder that is pleased with the muzzle length, muzzle shape, and eye placement in the breeding stock, but wishes to improve the eye shape of progeny produced may determine a minimum level of improvement in eye shape required for progeny to be returned into the breeding program. Progeny is first evaluated on the existing quality thresholds in place for muzzle length, muzzle shape, and eye placement with the additional criterion being improvement in eye shape. Any animal that does not meet this level of improvement in the eye shape while maintaining the other qualities is culled from the breeding program; i.e., that animal is not used for breeding, but is instead neutered and placed in a pet home. =Independent levels= Independent levels is a method where any animal who falls below a given standard in any single characteristic is not used in a breeding program. With each successive mating, the threshold culling criteria is raised thus improving the breed with each successive generation. This method measures several characteristics at once. Should progeny fall below the desired quality in any one characteristic being measured, it will not be used in the breeding program regardless of the level of excellence of other traits. With each successive generation of progeny, the minimum quality of each characteristic is raised thus ensuring improvement of these traits. For example, a breeder has a view of what the minimum requirements for muzzle length, muzzle shape, eye placement, and eye shape she is breeding toward. The breeder will determine what the minimum acceptable quality for each of these traits will be for progeny to be folded back into her breeding program. Any animal that fails to meet the quality threshold for any one of these criteria is culled from the breeding program. =Total Score Method= The Total Score Method is a method where the breeder evaluates and selects breeding stock based on a weighted table of characteristics. The breeder selects qualities that are most important to them and assigns them a weight. The weights of all the traits should add up to 100. When evaluating an individual for selection, the breeder measures the traits on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most desirable expression and 1 being the lowest. The scores are then multiplied by their weights and then added together to give a total score. Individuals that fail to meet a threshold are culled (or removed) from the breeding program. The total score gives a breeder a way to evaluate multiple traits on an animal at the same time. The total score method is the most flexible of the three. it allows for weighted improvement of multiple characteristics. It allows the breeder to make major gains in one aspect while moderate or lesser gains in others. For example, a breeder is willing to make a smaller improvement in muzzle length and muzzle shape in order to have a moderate gain in improvement of eye placement and a more dramatic improvement in eye shape. Suppose the breeder determines that she would like to see 40% improvement in eye shape, 30% improvement in eye placement, and 15% improvement in both muzzle length and shape. The breeder would evaluate these characteristics on a scale of 1 to 10 and multiply by the weights. The formula would look something like: 15 (muzzle length) + 15 (muzzle shape) + 30 (eye placement) + 40 (eye shape) = total score for that animal. The breeder determines the lowest acceptable total score for an animal to be folded back into their breeding program. Animals that do not meet this minimum total score are culled from the breeding program. Livestock and production animals Livestock bred for the production of meat or milk, may be culled by farmers. Animals not selected to remain for breeding are sent to the slaughterhouse, sold, or killed. Criteria for culling livestock and production animals can be based on population or production (milk or egg). In a domestic or farming situation the culling process involves selection and the selling of surplus stock. The selection may be done to improve breeding stock, for example for improved production of eggs or milk, or simply to control the group's population for environmental and species preservation. In order to increase the frequency of preferred phenotypes, agricultural practices typically involve using the most productive animals as breeding stock. With dairy cattle, culling may be practised by inseminating cows—considered to be inferior—with beef breed semen and by selling the produced offspring for meat production. With poultry, approximately half of the chicks of egg-laying chickens are males, who would grow up to be roosters. These individuals have little use in an industrial egg-producing facility as they do not lay eggs. For this reason, the hatchlings are culled based on gender. The majority of male chicks are killed shortly after hatching. =Culling sick animals= Culling of farmed animals is considered a necessary practice to prevent the spread of damaging and fatal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu, Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\\"mad cow disease\\"). Wildlife In the United States, hunting licenses and hunting seasons are a means by which the population of game animals is maintained. Each season, a hunter is allowed to kill a certain amount of wild animals, determined both by species and gender. If the population seems to have surplus females, hunters are allowed to take more females during that hunting season. If the population is below what is desired, hunters may not be permitted to hunt that particular species, or only hunt a restricted number of males. Populations of game animals such as elk may be informally culled if they begin to excessively eat winter food set out for domestic cattle herds. In such instances the rancher will inform hunters that they may hunt on their property in order to thin the wild herd to controllable levels. These efforts are aimed to counter excessive depletion of the intended domestic winter feed supplies. Other managed culling instances involve extended issuance of extra hunting licenses, or the inclusion of additional \\"special hunting seasons\\" during harsh winters or overpopulation periods, governed by state fish and game agencies. Culling for population control is common in wildlife management, particularly on African game farms and Australian national parks. In the case of very large animals such as elephants, adults are often targeted. Their orphaned young, easily captured and transported, are then relocated to other reserves. Culling is controversial in many African countries, but reintroduction of the practice has been recommended in recent years for use at the Kruger National Park in South Africa, which has experienced a swell in its elephant population since culling was banned in 1995. =Arguments against wildlife culling= Culling acts as a strong selection force and can therefore impact the population genetics of a species. For example, culling based on specific traits, such as size, can enforce directional selection and remove those traits from the population. This can have long-term effects on the genetic diversity of a population. Additionally, culling can act as a selection force intentionally implemented by humans to counteract the selection force of trophy hunting. Hunting typically enforces selection towards unfavorable phenotypic traits because of the strong hunting bias for specific traits, such as large antler size. Culling \\"low-quality\\" traits can counteract this force. Animal rights activists argue that killing animals for any reason (including hunting) is cruel and unethical. = Birds = Double crested cormorant Some bird species are culled when their populations impact upon human property, business or recreational activity, disturb or modify habitats or otherwise impact species of conservation concern. Cormorants are culled in many countries due to their impact on commercial and recreational fisheries and habitat modification for nesting and guano deposition. They are culled by shooting and the smothering of eggs with oil. Another example is the culling of silver gulls in order to protect the chicks of the vulnerable banded stilt at ephemeral inland salt lake breeding sites in South Australia. The gulls were culled using bread laced with a narcotic substance. In the Australian states of Tasmania and South Australia, Cape Barren geese are culled to limit damage to crops and the fouling of waterholes. Cape Barren Geese remain one of the rarest geese in the world, though much of their habitat is now regarded as secure. = Seals = New Zealand fur seal In South Australia, the recovery of the state's native population of New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) after severe depletion by sealers in the 1800s has brought them into conflict with the fishing industry. This has prompted members of Parliament to call for seal culling in South Australia. The State Government continues to resist the pressure and as of July 2015, the animals remain protected as listed Marine Mammals under the state's National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. = Sharks = Great white shark Shark culling occurs in four locations : New South Wales, Queensland, KwaZulu-Natal and Réunion. Between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in New South Wales—also during this period, a total of 15,135 marine animals were caught and killed in the nets, including whales, turtles, rays, dolphins, and dugongs. From 2001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in Queensland.https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/queensland-government- kills-sharks-faces-court-challenge \\"Queensland Government Kills Sharks, Faces Court Challenge\\". maritime-exeecutive.com. September 4, 2018. Retrieved December 2, 2018. In a 30-year period up to early 2017, more than 33,000 sharks were killed in KwaZulu-Natal's shark-killing program—during the same 30-year period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed. Authorities on Réunion kill about 100 sharks per year. All of these culls have been criticized by environmentalists, who say killing sharks harms the marine ecosystem. In 2014, a controversial policy was introduced by the Western Australian state government which became known as the Western Australian shark cull. Baited hooks known as drum lines were to be set over several consecutive summers to catch and kill otherwise protected great white sharks. The policy's objective was to protect users of the marine environment from fatal shark attack. Thousands of people protested against its implementation, claiming that it was indiscriminate, inhumane and worked against scientific advice the government had previously received. Seasonal setting of drum lines was abandoned in September 2014 after the program failed to catch any great white sharks, instead catching 172 other elasmobranchii, mostly tiger sharks. = Deer = White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been becoming an issue in suburbs across the United States of America due to large population increases. This is thought to be caused mainly by the extirpation of most of their major predators in these areas. In response to these population booms, different management approaches have been taken to decrease their numbers mainly in the form of culls. Culls of deer are often partnered with exclusions with fencing and also administering contraceptives. White-tailed deer buck The effectiveness of these deer culls has been debated and often criticized as only a temporary fix to the larger problem of deer overpopulation and argue that the use of culling will increase fertility of remaining deer by reducing competition. Those in favor of the culls argue that they can be used to combat the selection pressure that is imposed by hunting that creates smaller antler and body sizes in deer. People in favor of the culls recommend that they not be random and actively select for smaller individuals and bucks with smaller antlers, specifically \\"button bucks\\" or bucks with only spiked antler in their first year as opposed to forked antlers. Culling of deer can also have benefits in the form of disease prevention and in places that the white-tailed deer is an invasive species such as New Zealand culling of deer has added benefits for native species. Diseases are density dependent factors and decreases in the density of the deer populations through culling causes diseases, such as Chronic wasting disease and lyme disease, to spread less quickly and effectively.  Culling in zoos  Many zoos participate in an international breeding program to maintain a genetically viable population and prevent inbreeding.Conservation Breeding Programmes. World Association of Zoos and Aquariums Animals that can no longer contribute to the breeding program are considered less desirable and are often replaced by more desirable individuals. If an animal is surplus to a zoo's requirements and a place in another zoo can not be found, the animal may be killed. In 2014, the culling of a young, healthy giraffe Marius raised an international public controversy. Zoos sometimes consider female animals to be more desirable than males. One reason for this is that while individual males can contribute to the birth of many young in a short period of time, females give birth to only a few young and are pregnant for a relatively long period of time. This makes it possible to keep many females with just one or two males, but not the reverse. Another reason is that the birth of some animal species increases public interest in the zoo. Germany's Animal Welfare Act 1972, orders that zoo animals cannot be culled without verification by official veterinary institutes of the Landkreis or federated state. In the UK, there is no general prohibition on euthanasia and this is allowed when overcrowding compromises the well-being of the animals.  Culling and ethics  Jaak Panksepp, an American neuroscientist, concludes that both animals and humans have brains wired to feel emotions, and that animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and happiness from their lives.Masson, Jeffrey Moussaieff. 2004. The Pig Who Sang to the Moon: The Emotional World of Farm Animals. New York: Ballantine Books. For this reason, there are those who believe that culling animals is morally wrong. Culling has been criticized on animal rights grounds as speciesist—it has been argued that killing animals for any reason is cruel and unethical, and that animals have a right to live. Some argue that culling is necessary when biodiversity is threatened. However, the protection of biodiversity argument has been questioned by some animal rights advocates who point out that the animal which most greatly threatens and damages biodiversity is humanity, so if we are not willing to cull our own species we cannot morally justify culling another.Brown, Les. 1988. Cruelty to Animals: The Moral Debt. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan.Clarke, Paul A.B. and Linzey, Andrew (eds.). 1990. Political Theory and Animal Rights. Winchester, MA: Pluto Press. =Non-lethal alternatives= There exist non-lethal alternatives which may still be considered culling, and serve the same purpose of reducing population numbers and selecting for desired traits without killing existing members of the population. These methods include the use of wildlife contraceptives and reproductive inhibitors. By using such methods population numbers might be reduced more gradually and in a potentially more humane fashion than by directly lethal culling actions. Wildlife contraceptives are largely in the experimental phase as of this writing. These include such products as Gonacon, an adjuvant vaccine which delivers a high dosage of a competitor ligand of the hormone GnRH to female mammals (e.g. whitetail deer). The complex formed of GnRH and the Gonacon molecule promotes production of antibodies against the animal's own GnRH, which themselves complex with GnRH. This encourages an extended duration of the drug's effects (namely, reduction of active/unbound GnRH in the animal's system). Though the endocrinology behind Gonacon is sound, the need for multiple lifetime doses for full efficacy make it a less- guaranteed and less-permanent solution for wildlife than lethal culls. Even among domestic animals in controlled conditions, Gonacon cannot ensure 100% reduction in the occurrence of pregnancies. Reproductive inhibitors need not act on the parental individuals directly, instead damaging reproductive processes and/or developing offspring to reduce the number of viable offspring per mating pair. One such compound called Nicarbazin has been formulated into bait for consumption by Canada Geese, and damages egg yolk formation to reduce the viability of clutches without harming the adult geese.

The school has been awarded Blue Ribbon School status. History  Founded in 1963, Christiana High School is one of three high schools in the Christina School District (the other two being Newark High School and Glasgow High School). It is located outside of Newark. It is in close proximity to the University of Delaware. Curriculum Starting in the 2005/2006 school year, students are required to take four credits each of English, science or history, and math. The only core credit requirement not changed is social studies, where a total of three credits are still required. Like all other high school students in Delaware, Christiana High School students are required to have 1.5 credits of Phys. ed. /Health. Two years of a foreign language (French or Spanish) are required, and so is one year worth of computer literacy. Miscellaneous requirements for graduation include a senior research project and one credit of community service. Christiana High School helps students try to specialize in their future profession by having them follow a career pathway. Students are required to take at least three credits worth of a specific area of study. For example, students wishing to focus on agriculture in the future should take at least three of the thirteen agriscience classes offered. Christiana High School was also ranked 31 out of a total 33 Delaware High Schools For Academics. AP Classes include English, physics, psychology, calculus, world history, environmental science, biology, and chemistry. In 2004, Christiana High School and other high schools in the same district created “learning communities” for freshmen. This concept helps freshmen adjust from middle school to high school. Freshmen are split up into groups that are led by four core subject teachers, a concept reminiscent of middle school. However, the freshmen also have four more classes that are outside the small groups. This mixture of middle and high school allows the freshmen to become used to the new lifestyle by the time they are sophomores. In addition to the “learning communities”, Christiana High School has also been defined as being a “Culinary and Hotel Management Institute” by the district. This is due to the high number of business and culinary classes present in the school. Classes include culinary arts, hotel management, business, financial record-keeping, JDEG (Jobs for Delaware Graduates), etc. During May 2007, the Music Department led by Mr. Jeffrey Dombchik and Mrs. Wendy Dobroski attended the \\"All American Music Festival\\" in Florida. Their trip included the Parade Band Marching through MGM Studios and the concert band performing in front of three judges, the chorus and show choir also performed in front of judges. Ashley Inman received a specialty award for best drum major. During the entire trip, they stayed for a total of five days, traveled to and from via charter bus and visited: Blizzard Beach, MGM Studios, Planet Hollywood, Magic Kingdom, and Universal Studios. Each student received a medal and trophies are now in the possession of the schools. Students  As of the 2005 school year, there were approximately 1,500 students in Christiana High School. There are a little over a hundred students who have made Christiana High School their choice school. This allows these students to live outside of the district yet still attend Christiana High School. There is also an 8% drop out rate among students (2009). Faculty There are 106 instructors who are a part of the school staff, or approximately 16 students per teacher. A sizable minority of the staff (30%) has more than twenty years of teaching experience.

The company grew to become the largest wireless messaging company in the world, with more than 10 million pagers in service, and $1 billion in revenues, before the paging industry's rapid decline in the late 1990s. Operations Based in Dallas, PageNet held the distinction of building and operating the most extensive one-way paging network in the United States, growing to more than 90 offices across the United States. The company extended operations to Canada and Brazil. The company was known for its low-cost strategy and aggressive marketing tactics, although in its later years it positioned itself as a technology innovator as well. Financial difficulties PageNet's fortunes began to decline in the late 1990s, when the company spent nearly $1 billion to purchase additional spectrum and build out a new network designed to offer advanced services, such as voice paging and two-way paging. Products developed by Motorola for PageNet's network were unsuccessful, as was a reorganization of the company engineered by McKinsey & Company. Ironically, PageNet had an opportunity to purchase the network that went on to support the successful BlackBerry service, but decided to team with Motorola instead. As PageNet sank under the weight of its investment, the one-way paging market collapsed—with millions of former paging customers switching to digital cellular and PCS services, which cut prices dramatically while offering new features such as nationwide calling plans and text messaging.

Griswold, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 603 (1870), was a US Supreme Court case in which the Chief Justice of the United States, Salmon P. Chase, speaking for the Court, declared certain parts of the Legal Tender Acts to be unconstitutional. Specifically, making United States Notes legal tender was unconstitutional. The lawsuit originated when one Mrs. Hepburn attempted to pay a debt to Henry Griswold on a promissory note, which was made five days prior to the issuance of United States Notes that the case questioned. Griswold sued Hepburn in the Louisville Chancery Court on the note and refused Hepburn's tender of United States notes to satisfy his claim. She then tendered the notes into the Chancery Court, which declared her debt satisfied. The Court of Errors of Kentucky reversed the chancery court's judgment, and Hepburn appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment of the Court of Errors. The Supreme Court found that while the federal government was authorized to coin money, that power was distinct from the power to make paper legal tender, which was not authorized under the US Constitution. It also found that the treatment of notes as legal tender represented an impairment to enforcing the obligations of contracts. The Constitution prohibits the several states from impairing the obligations of contracts. While the court found no similar constraint upon the federal government, it held that such an impairment would violate the spirit of the Constitution. The dissent argued that the government was threatened by the war, and making the notes legal tender provided the government with the necessary supplies to continue to fight the war. The majority affirmed that the government holds the power to wage war, but making notes legal tender was not a necessary consequence of that power. It continued that making United States Notes legal tender was unnecessary to fighting a war. All that the federal government needed to do was to make them \\"receivable for government dues.\\" That argument is similar to the theory of chartalism. The majority opinion was explicitly overruled by Knox v. Lee and other Legal Tender Cases, , in which Chase dissented.

He worked as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the 2015–16 NBA season. High school and college career Murray played competitively at Glendora High School in California. As a senior, he led the nation with his 44.3 scoring average. Murray scored 3,053 points in high school, the highest total ever in the state at that time in 3 years. Murray missed his Freshman year due to injury. Murray played on the 1989 McDonald's All-American Boys Game for the West roster. Murray played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. In 98 games at UCLA, Murray averaged 18.3 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 1.5 APG and made the Pac-10 all- conference team twice. As a junior, he averaged 21.4 points and 7.0 rebounds and led the Pac-10 in three-point shooting at 50%, helping to lead the team to the Elite Eight.

Professional career =Spurs, Bucks, Blazers, and Rockets= Murray was selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 1992 NBA draft with the 18th overall selection. Just seven days after being drafted, on July 1, 1992 Murray was dealt twice in the same day. He was first traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for guard/forward Dale Ellis and then dealt by the Bucks to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Alaa Abdelnaby. During the 93-94 season, he led the NBA in three point average at 45.9%. Murray spent two-and-a-half seasons with Portland before being dealt to the Houston Rockets on February 14, 1995, with guard Clyde Drexler in exchange for forward Otis Thorpe, the rights to Argentinian forward Marcelo Nicola and a 1995 first- round draft choice.

Tracy saw action in three playoff games where he posted numbers of 18.3 PPG, 0.7 APG and 3.0 RPG. Those numbers were far better than the ones he had when he played in his first playoff series in 1993–94 with Portland where in 2 games played he averaged 3.0 PPG, 0.5 APG, and 1.5 RPG. He most notably scored 50 points against the Golden State Warriors on February 10, 1998. Only seven other Washington players have scored 50 or more points in a game, including Michael Jordan, Bradley Beal, and Gilbert Arenas, who are the only players to have since accomplished the feat. =Nuggets, Raptors and Lakers= After his tenure with Washington concluded he joined the Denver Nuggets through a transaction which had him going from the Wizards to Denver for forward Popeye Jones and a future second-round draft choice on September 25, 2000.

Murray played in 38 games with the Raptors following the deal. That season the Raptors qualified for the NBA playoffs and Murray participated in 2 games for his team. He averaged 1.0 PPG and had 1 steal in 2.5 MPG. In the next year Tracy played in 40 games for Toronto but after the season Murray was dealt again, this time to the Los Angeles Lakers along with the draft rights to guard Kareem Rush for guard Lindsey Hunter and the draft rights to forward Chris Jefferies on June 26, 2002. =Back with the Blazers= After playing one season at the Staples Center for the Los Angeles Lakers he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers on September 15, 2003 and played his last 7 games of his NBA career with the same team for whom he played the first game of his NBA career.

Achirimbi II was the tenth Fon (\\"King\\") who ruled over the town of Bafut and adjoining areas (the Fondom of Bafut) in a semi-autonomous fashion. His reign lasted from 1932 to 1968, and included the time of handover from the British protectorate of British Cameroon to the independent country of Cameroon. He was preceded by Abumbi I and succeeded by Abumbi II. He alienated himself from other Fons by being sympathetic to the British cause. He was awarded a Certificate of Honour in 1946 by the British government 'as a record of the valuable services rendered by him to his own country and people and to the British Government... and loyal services given to the Administration in the maintenance of good order'. Achirimbi II took advantage of his favourable standing with the administration and sought compensation for loss of sovereignty to arrogate to himself the residual powers the sub-chiefs or the Atangchuo, had retained over land matters and other disputes. He was befriended by the famous naturalist Gerald Durrell, who visited Bafut on his animal-collecting expeditions twice – in 1949 and 1957. The Fon helped Durrell substantially in these expeditions. The books written by Durrell about these expeditions - The Bafut Beagles and A Zoo in My Luggage - portray the Fon mostly in a humorous fashion, lampooning his polygamy, anglophile perspective, and high tolerance for alcohol, but also in more flattering ways as well. The Fon awarded Durrell the ceremonial dress and staff during his second expedition. Fon Achirimbi II is famous for having remarked about the choice to join independent Cameroon or independent Nigeria from the British Cameroons in 1961, saying it was a choice between the \\"Fire and the Deep Sea\\". He was considered by many as being progressive and willing to experiment with new ideas. He was treated with respect by both colonial administrators and nationalist politicians.

Sunifred conquered Cerdanya in 835 and Urgell three years later (838). In the dynastic struggles that accompanied the three years between Louis the Pious' death (840) and the Treaty of Verdun (843), Bernard of Septimania, the Count of Barcelona (and many other marches and counties, including Septimania, Girona, Narbonne, Béziers, Agde, Melgueil, Nîmes, and Toulouse) aligned with Pepin II of Aquitaine, while Sunifred, his brother Sunyer I, Count of Empúries, and their sons (sometimes referred to as the Bellonid Dynasty or Bellonids) placed their allegiance with Charles the Bald. In 841, the Moors invaded Barcelona and marched against Narbonne through the region of Cerdanya. Sunifred stopped them cold in battle, an event which certainly influenced Charles the Bald's respect for him. For in 844, Charles reclaimed Toulouse from Pepin II, captured Bernard of Septimania, and had him executed. In exchange for his fealty, Charles gave Sunifred the dead count's honours of Barcelona, Girona, and the march of Gothia. Sunifred also augmented his domains when Conflent fell into his hands, as reigning count of Cerdanya, on the death of Bera II. Throughout his reign, he was aloof of William of Septimania, son of Bernard, who had risen in 844 against Charles the Bald. In 848, William was named count of Toulouse and Empúries by Pepin II. He quickly moved to eliminate Sunifred and Sunyer. Both brothers died in 848 and some of their counties were assumed by William. Sunifred supposedly died of natural causes, but the cause of Sunyer's death is unknown.

He was born at Zaragoza. His youth was passed under the care of his uncle, and, after studying at Milan, he graduated in philosophy at the University of Catania. In 1723 he took minor orders, but abandoned his intention of entering the church and took up his residence at Naples, where he read assiduously. Business took him to Spain in 1733, living in Monzón and he became known in Madrid as a scholar with a tendency towards innovations in literature. La Poetica, 6 Reglas de la poesia en general y de sus principales especies (1737) proved that this impression was correct. He at once took rank as the leader of the literary reformers, and his courteous determination earned him the respect of his opponents. In 1747 he was appointed secretary to the Spanish embassy in Paris and, on returning to Madrid in 1750, was elected to the Academia Poetica del Buen Gusto, where, on account of his travels, he was known by the sobriquet of El Peregrino. He became master of the mint and treasurer of the royal library. He died at Madrid, after a short illness, on May 19, 1754. Luzán was not the pioneer of Franco-Italian theories in Spain, but he was their most powerful exponent, and his Poetica is an admirable example of destructive criticism. The defects of Lope de Vega and Calderón are indicated with vigilant severity, but on the constructive side Luzán is notably weak, for he merely proposes to substitute one exhausted convention for another. The doctrine of the dramatic unities had not the saving virtues which he ascribed to it, and, though he succeeded in banishing the older dramatists from the boards, he and his school failed to produce a single piece of more than mediocre merit. His theories, derived chiefly from Muratori, were ineffective in practice; but their ingenuity cannot be denied, and they acted as a stimulus to the partisans of the national tradition.

Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Ashton Kutcher, Rosario Dawson, Lucie Arnaz, and Henry Winkler play supporting roles. Isacsson's first and only feature film, Down to You paired Prinze and Styles a year after their respective starring roles in the successful high school-set romantic comedies She's All That and 10 Things I Hate About You. Despite being the second-highest grossing film at the domestic box office its opening weekend, the film received poor response from critics and failed to recoup its $35 million budget.  Plot  While attending college in New York City, sophomore Al and freshman Imogen begin dating. After three months they have fallen in love. Imogen, an aspiring artist, arranges a private showing at an art gallery for Al's birthday, after which the two have sex for the first time. Al's roommate Monk, who has become a pornographic film actor and director, tells him that love is illusory and fleeting, and Monk's co-star Cyrus flirts with Al. Al loses a bet and must perform as an extra in one of Monk's films. This causes an argument between Al and Imogen, who wants to spend time with him before she goes to France for the summer. Al abandons the film in favor of spending the night with Imogen. While in France, Imogen is asked by her cousin if she and Al will marry. This unnerves Imogen since she is only nineteen, and she acts differently toward Al on her return. Al's father, who hosts a cooking show, wants to do a father- and-son show after Al graduates, but Al would rather pursue his dream of becoming a chef of French cuisine. Concerned that he and Imogen are drifting apart, Al arranges a picnic in the countryside; on the way back, Imogen drives drunk and crashes into a tree. Seeing the accident as a sign, they try to improve their relationship. Though they seem happy, Monk predicts that this is a precursor to a breakup. When Imogen declines to have sex one night, Al feels emasculated and has a sexual fantasy about Cyrus. Imogen fears that she may be pregnant, and though she turns out not to be, this further strains their relationship. At one of Monk's parties, Cyrus tries to seduce Al, but he declines. Meanwhile, Imogen spends time with musician acquaintance Jim; when Al learns that she has agreed to design Jim's album cover, they argue and she leaves upset. The next day, she confesses that she had sex with Jim afterward. After a tearful breakup, she moves to San Francisco to finish school. Al graduates but becomes depressed. Monk is too preoccupied with his new work as an author and lecturer to comfort him, and their friendship dissolves. After a period of isolation, Al starts dating again and has a casual relationship with Cyrus, but she eventually moves away. He enrolls in the French Culinary Institute but feels unmotivated and drops out, and is reduced to bar-hopping with his single friend Eddie. Drunk and missing Imogen, he tries to purge himself of his feelings for her by drinking a bottle of her shampoo, resulting in his hospitalization. Al's parents throw a party with his friends to lift his spirits. Monk apologizes to Al, and they mend their friendship. Imogen appears, and they spend time catching up; she has become a cover artist for a San Francisco-based book publisher. She confesses that she misses him, and gives him a book titled Down to You with her cover artwork depicting the two of them in love. They rekindle their romance, deciding that they met too young but can start over. Al takes a job at a four-star restaurant in San Francisco and surprises Imogen with a romantic evening.

Reception  Down to You opened at number 2 at the US box office and made $7.6 million in its opening weekend, behind Next Friday. It went on to gross $24.4 million worldwide, below its $35 million budget. The film received negative reviews from critics. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it an \\"F\\" grade, calling the dialogue \\"embarrassing in its coy and wistful hungry-heart neuroticism\\" while criticizing the lead actors' performances and Isacsson's writing: \\"Making his first feature, writer- director Kris Isacsson treats the most squishy-sincere rituals of first love with a quivering sense of discovery. Obviously, it's a discovery to him. For the audience, it's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as Annie Hall.\\" In the New York Times, A. O. Scott described it as \\"scrubbed, wholesome and bland\\", opining that Isacsson \\"seems aware that a feature film requires narrative complication: not even really good-looking people can be happy all the time. But he flees from anything that might involve real human emotion, or for that matter any credible human activity other than looking good.\\" Brendan Kelly of Variety wrote that \\"Prinze and Stiles have genuine screen charisma to spare, and there's something oddly appealing about this mushy romantic tale, but first-time feature writer- director Kris Isacsson doesn't have the skills to raise it far above its formulaic foundation.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of only 3% for the film, with an average rating of 3.19/10 based on 59 critics' reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Down to You is ruined by a bland, by-the-numbers plot and an awful script\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 13 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\".  Soundtrack  A soundtrack album was released simultaneously with the film, featuring twelve songs from the soundtrack. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave it two stars out of five in an unfavorable review, describing some songs and artists as similar-sounding imitations of more well-known ones from other recent romantic comedy soundtracks. He singled out Belle Perez as \\"the poster child for all this weightless pop/rock, following up her earnest greeting with 'This is me/Life should be/Fun for everyone.' Indeed, it should, and if you're in your late teens, maybe it is. But much of the Down to You soundtrack tries to be ingenuous and only manages to be callow.\\" He singled out the closing track, Sam Phillips' \\"I Need Love\\", as a highlight, but opined that it made the rest of the album seem even less impressive in comparison. =Track listing= Additional songs used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album include:  References   External links   2000 films 2000 romantic comedy films American films American romantic comedy films English-language films Miramax films 2000 directorial debut films 2000 comedy films ","title":"Down to You"},{"id":"2981213","text":"History of Political Philosophy is a textbook edited by American political philosophers Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey.

It contains the shrine of St. Geneviève, the patron saint of Paris. The church also contains the tombs of Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine. Jean-Paul Marat is buried in the church's cemetery. The sculpted tympanum, The Stoning of Saint Stephen, is the work of French sculptor Gabriel-Jules Thomas. Renowned organist, composer, and improviser Maurice Duruflé held the post of Titular Organist at Saint-Étienne- du-Mont from 1929 until his death in 1986.  History  The rood loft viewed from the south-west. The Church of Apostles Peter and Paul was built during the reign of King Clovis, who was buried here with his wife Clotilde as well as Saint Genevieve. Later, it was rededicated as the abbey church of the royal Abbey of Sainte-Genevieve. The abbey church also served as the parish church for the surrounding area until it became too small to accommodate all the faithful. In 1222, Pope Honorius III authorized the establishment of an autonomous church, which was devoted this time to St Etienne, then the patron saint of the old cathedral of Paris.\\"Historical account\\" Saint-Etienne-du-Mont The nave, showing the rood screen, pulpit and ceiling details The organ Soon, the new building was overwhelmed by an increasingly dense population: the Sorbonne and many colleges were located on the territory of the parish. It was enlarged in 1328, but a complete reconstruction became necessary from the 15th century. In 1492, the nearby Génovéfain monks donated a portion of their land for the construction of the new church. This involved several steps. Under the direction of architect Stephen Viguier, the apse and the bell tower was sketched in 1494, and the first two bells were cast in 1500. The choir of flamboyant Gothic was completed in 1537 and the following year, it was the turn of the frame to be raised. The loft was built around 1530–1535. In 1541, Guy, Bishop of Megara, blessed the altars of the chapels of the apse. The same year, the parish awarded contracts for the windows and statues from Parisian artisans. The nave, from the Renaissance period, was not hunched before 1584. The first stone of the facade was laid in 1610 by Marguerite de Valois, who had agreed to do so in a personal donation of 3000 pounds. The church was dedicated on 25 February 1626 by Jean-François de Gondi, first archbishop of Paris, Cardinal de Retz's uncle. Nevertheless, developments continued: in 1636, the organ was installed, the work of Pierre Pescheur. When the organ was damaged by fire in 1760, it was rebuilt by Cliquot. Further work was carried out in 1863 by Cavaillé-Coll, and the present instrument is the work of further revision by Beuchet-Debierre in 1956 In 1651, a new pulpit was installed. It was also adjusted for the local wardens and housing for the priests. During the 17th and 18th century, the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont enjoyed great prestige. It was the scene of grand processions where the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve went to Notre Dame and subsequently returned to his church. It also housed the remains of Pierre Perrault, the painter Eustache Le Sueur and Blaise Pascal. Those of Racine and Isaac de Sacy Lemaistre were also transferred in 1711 from Port-Royal in Saint-Etienne. During the French Revolution, the church was first closed and then turned into a \\"Temple of Filial Piety.\\" Catholic worship was restored in 1801, benefiting from the Concordat. The following year, the demolition of the abbey church of Sainte- Genevieve Abbey and the breakthrough Street Clovis made St. Stephen an independent building. Under the Second Empire, the church was restored by Victor Baltard: the front was raised and the statues destroyed by the revolutionaries, were returned. Baltard also built the chapel of catechisms. The 19th century was marked by many events. On 10 January 1805 Pope Pius VII celebrated Mass in the church. In 1833, Frederic Ozanam, a parishioner of St. Stephen, founded with friends the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. On 3 January 1857 Bishop Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour, was assassinated with cries of \\"Down with the goddesses!\\" by the priest, Jean-Louis Verger, opposed to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. A plaque at the entrance to the nave marks the grave of the prelate, who was to inaugurate the novena of St. Genevieve. The occultist Eliphas Levi was indirectly involved in this tragic event. On 23 August 1997 Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass there during the visit to Paris on the occasion of World Youth Day.  Timeline  Building works included: * 6th century: first chapel was formed from the crypt of St. Geneviève Abbey * 13th century: separate church built on the north side of chapel * 1491: bell tower was built * 1537: chancel was built * 1545: gallery was built (see image of church interior) * 1580: vaults of the nave and the transept were built * 1624: bell tower was raised * 1807: demolition of the Abbey church  Features  Today the church is characterized by its curved axis of the nave to the transept, the rood screen (the sole surviving example in Paris) of finely carved stone by Father Biard (1545), his chair designed by Laurent de La Hyre and sculpted by Claude Lestocart and its organ case (1631) (the oldest in the capital). The church also contains the shrine containing the relics of St. Genevieve until 1793 (when they were thrown in the sewer), the tomb of Blaise de Vigenere, of Blaise Pascal, of Racine, and Mg Sibour. Huysmans described it in the Connecting (1895) as one of the most beautiful churches in Paris.

It is the only church designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh to have been built; hence, it is also known as The Mackintosh Church.  History  In 1896, the Free Church of St Matthew, Glasgow, commissioned a new church and hall from the experienced Glasgow architectural practice of Honeyman and Keppie, to be located within the developing area of Springbank, near Maryhill. John Honeyman allocated the job to his young, talented, trainee architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The site was an awkward one, being on a corner plot and butted by tenements and a large warehouse. In keeping with their beliefs, the Free Church required simplicity in design. A memorial stone was laid on 23 June 1898 and the church held its first service on 10 September 1899. Although he designed an Anglican Cathedral for Liverpool, as part of a competition, it was never built, so Queen's Cross was the only Mackintosh church to be completed. Building started shortly after Mackintosh finished his competition design for the Glasgow School of Art. It is built at Queen's Cross, at the junction of Garscube Road and Maryhill Road in Glasgow's Maryhill area.Glasgow’s Crosses, Glasgow History, 28 May 2016 Mackintosh Design View from south-east. = Exterior= Unlike many churches in Glasgow, Mackintosh's church doesn't have a huge towering spire, and is rather squat and more like a Norman Castle, called 'Modern gothic' by other architects. The main south-west tower was modelled on one at Merriot in Somerset which Mackintosh visited in 1895. = Interior = The west window and balcony over the south aisle, seen from the main balcony. Although the stained glass windows are not 'spectacular' compared to other churches and cathedrals, they are distinctly Mackintosh in design. The style is still used on many Mackintosh-style windows and stained glass souvenirs available today. The roof is made up by the most striking timber-lined barrel-vaulted roof, which spans the entire forty feet of the nave. The pulpit is carved in Mackintosh designs - it is repeated five times around the curved front. It has been suggested that it represents the wings of a bird protecting young shoots - sown on fertile ground. The design contains gothic influences, such as the magnificent stained glass blue-heart window, and pre-Reformation style elements, such as the replica of the original rood beam, which is unique in Scotland. It is even possible to find Japanese influences in the double beams and pendants inside the church.Video interview at Queen's Cross Church with Stuart Robertson , Director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society (February, 2008)  Home of Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society  Church hall. After the church was decommissioned in the 1970s, unlike many churches which were converted to theatres, apartments or demolished and because of the popularity of Mackintosh's work, the church became home of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, which owns and operates the church as a tourist attraction. The adjoining church hall provides tearoom facilities, and there is a display area under the balcony with many artifacts including replicas of the chairs he designed for the Willow Tearooms.

A native of Burlington, Vermont, she moved with her parents and eight siblings to Phoenix, Arizona in 1898. In 1920 she was elected deputy county treasurer of Coconino County; she later became county treasurer. She became the first woman to serve as State Auditor, to which she was elected in 1926. Frohmiller served until 1950 when she ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor against Howard Pyle. Arizona Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater wrote in his memoir With No Apologies that Frohmiller was 'an attractive lady... who had earned quite a following as a result of her long and excellent service as state auditor'. He also observed that the voters of Arizona weren't ready for a woman governor in 1950 and may have been right. Frohmiller lost the election to Pyle, who became the first Republican Governor of Arizona since John Calhoun Phillips in 1928, despite the fact that at the time of her nomination she seemed to be the front-runner. Frohmiller retired to Prescott, Yavapai County, Arizona, and died on November 25, 1971.

It is the oldest police force in the Commonwealth of Nations outside the United Kingdom. The Royal Gibraltar Police, previously the Gibraltar Police Force, was formed in 1830, only nine months after Sir Robert Peel founded the Metropolitan Police in London. It was Peel who sent one of his officers to Gibraltar to form the Gibraltar Police Force. The force was granted the \\"Royal\\" prefix by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992. The force works with the Gibraltar Defence Police (GDP), Her Majesty's Customs (Gibraltar), Border and Coastguard Agency (Gibraltar), HM Prison Service and the military Joint Provost and Security Unit. Personnel strength and deployment The force, referred to locally as the RGP, currently numbers over 220 officers, who are divided into a number of units. These include CID, Drug Squad, Special Branch, Firearms Unit, Scene of Crime Examiners, Traffic Department, Marine Section and the Operations Division. From its inception, up until 1999 when St. John Ambulance Brigade took over, the Gibraltar Police provided the territory's only emergency ambulance service, using officers seconded from the Operations Division. The RGP also acted as immigration officers at all entry points until the early 1990s. The current headquarters is at New Mole House Police Station, Rosia Road. The Previous HQ used to be at 120 Irish Town. There are plans to turn this into a Police Museum. There is a sub-station at Casemates Square. New Mole House, Royal Gibraltar Police headquarters Uniform In general the uniformed officers of the Gibraltar force follow British police models in their dress. On foot patrol male constables and sergeants, like their counterparts in England and Wales, Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda, wear the traditional headgear of the \\"bobby on the beat\\", correctly known as the \\"custodian helmet\\", which is similar to some Army helmets and was adopted by the Metropolitan Police of London in 1863 to replace the top hat formerly worn, other forces then following suit. The helmet is traditionally made of cork covered outside by felt or serge-like material that matches the tunic. As in many police forces of England and Wales, the Brunswick star is used as the basis for the force badge, with a central device representing Gibraltar. The badge appears also as the helmet plate.Gibraltar.gov.gi - Judiciary and Law.

Invented in Canada, it is the main product of MindTrap Games, Inc., who license the game for manufacture by various companies including Outset Media, Blue Opal, the Great American Puzzle Factory, Pressman Toy Corporation, Spears Games and Winning Moves. Players are given a puzzle from a card and a limited amount of time to solve it. Each correct answer advances the player or team along a track printed on the scorecard; they win by being the first to reach the end. The original game contained only logic and lateral thinking puzzles, while later editions added other types of brain teasers including tangrams and stick puzzles. Lateral thinking problems are identified by a diamond on the question side of the card, indicating that answering team are allowed to ask \\"yes/no\\" questions about the puzzle scenario. These puzzles often give unnecessary information in order to distract the answerer from a simple, common sense solution, and play on common assumptions. Some questions play on words or pictures and some on everyday trivia. Many scenarios and characters reoccur throughout the puzzles, including murders and other crimes investigated by \\"Detective Shadow\\" (and perpetrated by villains including \\"Sid Shady\\" and \\"Sam Sham\\"), and tricks performed by magician \\"Dee Sceptor\\". The questions are worded in Canadian- English, with Canadian terminology and spelling, and are not localized for the American, UK or Australian markets.

He is regarded as the father of Arkansas Power and Light Company and other electric utilities now part of Entergy; he helped mold the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway and the Kansas City Southern Railway into a major transportation system. His work with local and federal government leaders during World War I and the Great Depression gained him national recognition and earned him positions in state and federal agencies. He also established Arkansas' first commercial broadcast radio station.  Early life and family  Couch was born in Calhoun, a tiny community in Columbia County in southern Arkansas. The eldest of six children, he assisted his parents and younger siblings with the endless work associated with a small cotton farm. His father was also a Methodist minister. When Couch was seventeen, his father's health deteriorated, and the family moved to nearby Magnolia, the county seat of Columbia County. During this time, he was instructed by a future governor of Texas and president of Baylor University, Pat Neff,\\"Harvey Couch, Utility and Rail Magnate Dies: Was Example of Farm Boy Who Made Good in Big Way\\", Minden Herald, Minden, Louisiana, 1 August 1941, p. 1. at Southwestern Academy in Magnolia, also known as Magnolia Academy. He left school early to help with the family finances and assist his mother, the former Marie Heard, with his younger siblings. His first paying job was to start the boiler every morning at Lum Barnett's cotton gin, for which he received 50 cents daily. After working in several clerical positions at local small businesses, Couch saw a newspaper advertisement seeking mail clerks; the pay was $75 per month, significantly higher than his then salary of $20. Passing the entrance exam in Shreveport, Louisiana, qualified Couch to enter the United States Post Office's Railway Mail Service, for which he would sort mail in one of the many railway postal cars which criss-crossed the nation. Couch initially worked on a Railway Post Office route on the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway between St. Louis and Texarkana, then a Memphis and Texarkana run over the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, before getting an assignment in Louisiana south of his home town of Magnolia. On 4 October 1904, Couch married Jessie Johnson of Athens in Claiborne Parish east of Minden, a small city in Webster Parish in which he had business interests. Together they had five children. His brother, Peter Couch, worked with him on various business ventures and held executive positions in several of his companies. Prior to working for Couch, lifelong friend and business attorney Hamilton Moses was a law partner of future U.S. senator Joe T. Robinson. The Democrat Couch was the father-in-law of Pratt C. Remmel, the only elected Republican to have served as mayor of Little Rock in the 20th century. Remmel's wife (and Couch's daughter), Catherine Couch Remmel (1918-2006), is honored by the naming of Lake Catherine near Hot Springs. His sons were Johnson Olin Couch (1905-1958), Kirke A. Couch, Harvey Couch, Jr. (1908-1963), an officer of the Union National Bank in the capital city of Little Rock, and William Thomas Couch.  Business career  While still working on the Railway Post Office route from McNeil, Arkansas, into north Louisiana, Couch was exposed to the development of the long-distance telephone. Believing he could earn money distributing telephone service, he formed a partnership with the postmaster of Bienville, Louisiana, Ben Cheen. In the spring of 1903 they completed 15 miles of telephone line construction from Bienville to Arcadia, Louisiana. After buying out Cheen's share of the business for $1,000, Couch and friend Dr. H. A. Longino formed the North Louisiana Telephone Company. By 1910 the company had constructed more than 1,500 miles of line, serving 50 exchanges in four states. In 1911, at age 34, Couch sold the company to Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, giving him a profit of more than $1 million. His business interests in Louisiana brought Couch into political alliance with Huey Pierce Long Jr., the flamboyant governor and United States senator. By the time North Louisiana Telephone Company had been sold, Couch was already exploring the possibilities of developing a similar interconnected electric utility system. Both Malvern and Arkadelphia had awarded franchises for citywide electric utilities, and in both cities, the utility companies were in decline, and only provided night-time service. Couch proposed a partnership with Arkansas Land & Lumber Company, a large sawmill operation in Malvern, whereby sawdust and waste material purchased from the sawmill would be used to fuel boilers, producing steam for two 550-kilowatt turbines to generate electric power. The new system, a predecessor of Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP&L;), became operational on 18 December 1914, providing Malvern and Arkadelphia with 24-hour electric service for the first time. In 1916, AP&L;'s second generating plant opened in Russellville, seat of Pope County in north-central Arkansas. The plant was adjacent to a coal field which provided a steady supply of fuel. Under leadership of Couch, AP&L; continued purchasing city utility systems and building electric transmission lines throughout Arkansas. As demand for electric power increased, Couch began formalizing plans for hydroelectric development on the Ouachita River. The first of several such dams, Remmel Dam, was completed in December 1924. Carpenter Dam followed in 1933. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed Blakely Mountain Dam in 1952, after Couch's death. Damming the Ouachita River transformed Arkansas's countryside and created three large lakes. Lake Catherine and Lake Hamilton in Garland County, popular lakes for public recreation, were named after Couch's only daughter, and close friend and company lawyer Hamilton Moses. Revenue generated by construction of Remmel Dam was in excess of $25,000 per year. Inexpensive energy produced by these new projects helped lure several major industrial plants to Arkansas. Pine Bluff received the state's first textile mill, the International Paper Co. opened a paper mill in Camden, and other companies followed. In the 1920s, Couch had set his sights on buying electric companies in other states. In 1923, he merged four independent companies in Mississippi into Mississippi Power and Light. Two years later, he formed Louisiana Power and Light, which provided power to his Mississippi customers from northern Louisiana's natural gas fields. Meanwhile, in 1922, Sidney Mitchel of Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO), a subsidiary of General Electric, had merged several competing electric utilities in New Orleans into New Orleans Public Service, an EBASCO subsidiary. Mitchel began turning his attention to other territories, and eventually began competing with Couch. The two men ultimately merged their resources. In 1925, Electric Power and Light Corporation, an EBASCO subsidiary headquartered in New Orleans, was formed with Couch as its president. It was the parent company for Arkansas Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, Mississippi Power and Light and New Orleans Public Service. As the electric utility industry continued to prosper and expand, Couch began to devote some attention to his earlier interest, locomotives and the railway. A group of investors, led by Couch, gained control of the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway and the Louisiana Navigation & Railway Company for a total of $27 million. Following Interstate Commerce Commission approval, Couch became president of the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1927, and merged all three railways into the K.C.S.-L.&A.; System. He created a syndicate of ownership and operators, among those, younger brother Peter Couch, assumed the role of vice-president and general manager. Couch finally had his railway empire that he dreamt of as a child. This organized system, spanning four states, provided direct access from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. Thousands of jobs were created through railway employment and small businesses that sprouted with the birth of new communities that formed along the railway thoroughfares.  World War I  In addition to his business interests, Harvey Couch contributed through a variety of public service roles, some of which were during times of national crises. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson created councils of defense at the state level to aid the Council of National Defense. Couch served under Arkansas Governor Charles H. Brough as Fuel Administrator for the Arkansas Council of Defense. Overcoming the problematic coal shortages that plagued the state, Couch was able to provide coal for Arkansans and create a profit. He contributed all the money, $27,749.06, to the Arkansas Council of Defense, more than half its income. There were 71,862 Arkansas soldiers that served in the military during World War I. The defense council assisted the United States Employment Service in Arkansas, with the money Couch generated, to help ensure that soldiers from Arkansas would have a job when they returned home. Thousands of cards containing work information were sent to businesses, soldiers, and their relatives to help ensure that the soldiers would find work at a place that best fit both parties. In some cases, soldiers still posted overseas were sent letters confirming they had jobs waiting on them back home.  The Great Depression  The Great Depression led to a greatly expanded government effort to encourage business. One such program was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), established under President Herbert Hoover in 1932. Harvey Couch was selected as one of seven directors on the RFC's board. Couch's mission was to finance public works projects and decrease the number of unemployed Americans, which in 1932 was 13 million. Because the government set strict rules in paying back the federal loans, many applicants weren't granted project approval. Three large projects that did receive approval took many years to generate jobs: the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge; the waterworks system of Pasadena, California, and the Colorado River Aqueduct to Los Angeles. Overall, the RFC failed its mission to create much- needed jobs. But, under Couch, small projects received funding and thousands of jobs were created during the winter of 1932–33. One of the United States New Deal programs was the creation of the Public Works Administration in 1933, which was a magnification of Couch's public works sector inside the RFC. Broadcasting pioneer Couch founded WOK, the first broadcast radio station in Arkansas. Meant to service the Pine Bluff area, its signal reached large parts of the country. In 1921, Couch visited Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and radio station KDKA, a pioneer of modern broadcasting. On the trip he also met Lee de Forest, inventor of the wireless radiotelephone and the vacuum tube. Couch bought equipment and decided to set up a radio station in his home state, \\"to advertise Arkansas and, incidentally, AP&L;\\". He saw great potential benefits for his company and Arkansas. AP&L; had already been planning to create a radio system so its generating plants around the state would have easy communication. Couch demonstrated the radio in November 1921 to the Pine Bluff Rotary Club. WOK, \\"Workers of Kilowatts\\", went live the night of 18 February 1922. Immediately, AP&L; started promoting WOK, and acquired more broadcasting equipment. There were no commercials on the station; it was fully supported by the utility company. In coming months, the station had many firsts in Arkansas: first broadcast sermon, first broadcast sports event, first broadcast music concert, first remote church broadcast. Couch extolled WOK (and radio in general) for \\"bringing all parts of the country in close touch\\". He promoted WOK all over Arkansas, including in many hotels (which were installing radios in lobbies), the Arkansas State Fair and even in prisons. Listeners enjoyed the lack of commercials, but WOK became a financial drain on the utility company and required much employee time. In June 1923, broadcasting ceased, with the expectation it would resume in the fall. The station's license was renewed in September 1923 for another three months, but WOK remained silent. Couch later donated the radio equipment to the former Henderson-Brown College in Arkadelphia.  Honors and titles  Couch was nominated for governmental positions by Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from Baylor University and was a 33rd degree Mason. Couch donated the Harvey C. Couch School (also listed on the National Register) to his native Calhoun in 1928. He has also been awarded honorary degrees from: Hendrix College, Baylor University, Peabody College, Subiaco College, and Future Farmers of America Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Couch into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1997. The Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas inducted Couch into the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame in 2008. Magnolia Business Park in Magnolia, Arkansas, was formally renamed \\"Harvey Couch Business Park\\" during a ceremony at the entrance to the park on 19 November 2012. Four of Couch's grandchildren attended the ceremony. The entrance road was renamed Harvey Couch Boulevard, and a brick pedestal with a plaque and a likeness of Couch was placed at the park's entrance on U.S. Route 82. The plaque cites his importance as an entrepreneur, industry executive and public servant.  Final chapter  In February 1940, Couch developed a severe case of influenza, but insisted on attending the Democratic National Convention that summer in Chicago even though he had not recovered. After the convention, he traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., where he suffered a heart attack. After several months of recuperation, he returned to Couchwood, his vacation estate near Jones Mills, between Malvern and Hot Springs. The severity of Couch's condition was concealed from the public, and he continued as director of Arkansas' Infantile Paralysis Campaign against polio even as his condition worsened. Harvey Couch died at Couchwood from complications of cardiovascular disease. At 11 a.m. on the day of his funeral at Lakeside Methodist Church in Pine Bluff, all trains on his railroad network halted their route for a minute of silence in his honor. Diesel locomotives and a number of the cars from Couch's beloved K.C.S.-L.&A.; system, including the Southern Belle passenger train, which had 120 mph capabilities and air-conditioned compartments, were diverted to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to serve as a funeral train to carry Couch's body from funeral services in Pine Bluff to Magnolia for burial there in Magnolia Cemetery.  Couchwood  Couchwood is Couch's island estate on Lake Catherine. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt both spent time on the island as guests. Couchwood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is Couchwood Historic District, a larger area. There are five red cedar log-houses on the estate: the Big House, Calhoun, Little Pine Bluff, Remmelwood, and the Traincar. Today, the island estate acts as a retreat for descendants and visitors.

Prior to its civil usage, the facility was George Air Force Base, from 1941 to 1992 a United States Air Force flight training facility. The airport is home to Southern California Aviation, a large transitional facility for commercial aircraft. As a logistics airport, it is designed for business, military, and freight use. There are no commercial passenger services at this facility except for FBO and charter flights.  Facilities  Southern California Logistics Airport (SCLA) covers and has two runways: * Runway 17/35: , surface: asphalt/concrete * Runway 03/21: , surface: asphalt/concrete Southern California Logistics Centre, immediately adjacent to SCLA, offers a wide variety of new warehouse and distribution facilities, ranging from to over . The SCLA Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) facility offers urban warfare training, and has served over 15,000 U.S. military personnel during the past ten years. History George Air Force Base in 1994 The federal government was responsible for helping the Victor Valley recover from the closure of George Air Force Base in 1992. The conversion of the former George Air Force Base to SCLA was designed to provide major corporations with logistics needs, access to a global intermodal logistics gateway to the Western United States. Located near Interstate 15 in California's Victor Valley, the complete intermodal business complex is approximately north of downtown San Bernardino, and north of San Bernardino International Airport. In July 2000, SCLA received foreign trade zone status from the United States Department of Commerce. The designation was intended to make it much easier for the Victor Valley Economic Development Authority to convince international carriers to use the airport as a base for shipping foreign products to Southern California. During that same period, the Department of Transportation approved a $4.9 million grant for the SCLA to extend its main runway from to to accommodate international jet transports. The airport authority required the extension to ensure that cargo planes could depart fully loaded in summer heat. The longer runway was also required for the efficient use of the facility as the main transportation hub for the 70,000 troops a year traveling to and from the Army National Training Center at Fort Irwin. At , SCLA's runway 17/35 is the second longest public- use runway in the United States, surpassed only by that of the Denver International Airport runway 16R/34L. The fiscal year 2002 military spending bill earmarked to allow the U.S. Army to continue using the SCLA to transport troops en route to training exercises at Fort Irwin. The airport has proven to be one of the most efficient and safest locations for travel to and from the Army's National Training Center for the troops who rotate through each year. Company D of the 158th Aviation Regiment is a general support aviation company that moved in under a five-year contract the Army signed with SCLA and the city of Victorville. The unit is part of the 244th Aviation Brigade of Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Victorville's aircraft boneyard In late 2006, SCLA became home to Air Tanker 910, a heavily modified McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which is on contract to the California Department of Forestry (CALFIRE). Tanker 910 uses SCLA as its re-loading base for fires occurring anywhere in California. A Lockheed L-1011 TriStar in storage at the airport The 2007 Autonomous Vehicle Competition took place on the former George Air Force Base. DARPA selected the location because its network of urban roads best simulated the type of terrain American forces operate in when deployed overseas. N118UA, United Airlines' \\"Friend Ship\\" 747-400, arrived at the boneyard on November 9, 2017, and is currently stored. It was the final United 747 to carry passengers, flying its final revenue flight on November 7, 2017. On November 2, 2018, the Presidential Plane of Mexico named TP-01 (registered as XC-MEX) of the Mexican Air Force arrived here to be sold off to its new owner by the order of New President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. On March 27, 2019, the first of two 747-8i (N894BA) flew from SCLA to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, for conversion into a presidential transport VC-25B. It was one of two built for the Russian airline Transaero, but the airline went bankrupt before taking delivery of the 747s. The cost of converting both aircraft is estimated to be $4.68B. In 2019 Southwest Airlines used the airport to store its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX after the airplane was grounded by the FAA. On 14 February 2020, the Guinness World Record for the longest- distance wheelie in an airplane was set in a Cessna 172 on the airport's runway 17. The pilot kept the plane's nose wheel from touching the asphalt surface for a distance of 14,319 feet. In March 2020, in response to the sharp drop in air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, several airlines contracted with boneyard operator ComAv to store over 200 disused aircraft and to keep them clean and in working order while they are in storage. As of 30 March 2020, Southwest Airlines had parked 50 active Boeing 737-700 aircraft at Victorville. Boneyard SCLA is home to ComAv Technical Services, who operate the \\"boneyard\\" storage facility at SCLA with a capacity of over 500 aircraft. The aircraft maintenance and storage company operates a 240-acre facility with enough space to store more than 500 planes, plus hangars that can be used to maintain several more. Currently about 275 planes are in storage at SCLA. The dry desert environment at SCLA is conducive to long-term preservation of aircraft. Accidents and incidents * 7 June 2001: The copilot of a Learjet 24A, registration number N805NA, inadvertently induced a lateral oscillation and lost directional control of the aircraft during touch- and-go landing practice with the yaw damper disengaged. After dragging the right-hand tip tank on the runway, the aircraft landed hard, collapsing the main landing gear and sliding off the runway. The aircraft was substantially damaged but its three occupants were not injured. The accident was attributed to the copilot's inadvertent loss of control and the pilot in command's failure to adequately supervise the copilot.

The storm was named for Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby, a naval instructor who, based on his astronomical studies, had predicted extremely high tides in the North Atlantic Ocean on October 1, 1869, which would produce storm surges in the event of a storm. Effects The hurricane caused extensive destruction to port facilities and communities along the Bay of Fundy coast in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia as well as Maine, particularly Calais, St. Andrews, St. George, Saint John, Moncton, Sackville, Amherst, Windsor and Truro. Much of the devastation was attributed to a two-metre storm surge created by the storm which coincided with a perigean spring tide; the Bay of Fundy having one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. The Saxby Gale storm surge produced a water level which gave Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia, the honor of having the highest tidal range ever recorded. It is also thought to have formed the long gravel beach that connects Partridge Island, Nova Scotia, to the mainland. The storm also produced waves which, combined with the storm surge, breached dykes protecting low-lying farmland in the Minas Basin and the Tantramar Marshes, sending ocean waters surging far inland to inundate farms and communities. Sailing ships in various harbors were tossed about and/or broken up against wharves and breakwaters which were also destroyed. Farmers trying to rescue livestock from fields along shorelines drowned after dykes were breached. There were at least 37 deaths between Maine, New Brunswick, and New York. The gale destroyed miles of the newly completed Windsor and Annapolis Railway along the Minas Basin near Horton and Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Naming of the storm The storm (which pre-dated the practice of naming hurricanes) was given the name \\"Saxby\\" in honor of Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby, Royal Navy, who was a naval instructor and amateur astronomer. Lt. Saxby had written a letter of warning, published December 25, 1868, in London's The Standard newspaper in which he notes the astronomical forces predicted for October 5, 1869, which would produce extremely high tides in the North Atlantic Ocean during the height of hurricane season. Lt. Saxby followed this warning with a reminder published on September 16, 1869, to The Standard in which he also warns of a major \\"atmospheric disturbance\\" that would coincide with the high water level at an undetermined location. Many newspapers took up Saxby's warning in the coming days. In a monthly weather column published October 5, 1869, in Halifax's The Evening Express, amateur meteorologist Frederick Allison relayed Lt. Saxby's warning for a devastating storm the following week. Despite the warning, many readers throughout the United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland and the United States dismissed Saxby since there were frequent gales and hurricanes during the month of October. The fact that the high tides occurred throughout the North Atlantic basin was unremarkable and astronomically predictable, except for their coinciding with the hurricane which struck the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy to produce the devastating storm surge. Lt. Saxby's predictions were considered quite lunatic at the time. Some believed that his predictions were founded upon astrology, which was not the case. =Letter to the Editor, Dec. 25, 1868= =Letter to the Editor, Sept. 16, 1869= =Op-Ed Column, Oct. 1, 1869=  See also  *List of tropical cyclones *List of Atlantic hurricanes *List of New England hurricanes References * The Saxby Gale * The SAXBY GALE of 1869 * Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) – The Saxby Gale of 1869: A case study of flood water levels in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada * Meteorological Service of Canada (Canadian Hurricane Centre) – 1869, The Saxby Gale, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia * The Weather Network – Saxby Gale 1860s Atlantic hurricane seasons 1869 Saxby 1869 Saxby 1869 Saxby 1869 Saxby 1869 Saxby 1869 Saxby Saxby Gale Saxby Gale October 1869 events 1869 natural disasters 1860s meteorology ","title":"1869 Saxby Gale"},{"id":"2981371","text":"Aha!

AD 390), was a Christian philosopher, and the author of a treatise De Natura Hominis (\\"On Human Nature\\"). According to the title of his book, he was the Bishop of Emesa (in present-day Syria). His book is an attempt to compile a system of anthropology from the standpoint of Christian philosophy; it was very influential in later Greek, Arabic and Christian thought. Nemesius was also a physiological theorist. He based much of his writing on previous work of Aristotle and Galen, and it has been speculated that he anticipated William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood.See the following for further information regarding blood circulation: *George Ripley And Charles A. Dana. Nemesius- Bishop Of Emesa IN \\"The American Cyclopaedia\\". *George Jackson Fisher A Brief Historical Sketch of Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood IN Popular Science Monthly Volume 11, July 1877. *CHAUNCEY D. LEAKE, THE LURE OF MEDICAL HISTORY: A NOTE ON THE MEDICAL BOOKS OF FAMOUS PRINTERS In: CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN MEDICINE Vol. XXXII, No.2, February, 1930, page 107. *HERMANN PETERS and WILLIAM NETTER (1899) Pictorial history of ancient pharmacy - Chapter II - Pharmacy in the Middle Ages. page 21: Quotation: Nemesius, in his work \\" De Natura Hominis\\" (300 A.D.), gives a theory of the circulation of the blood, which, imperfect though it be, is a step forward in the direction of the modern doctrine. Other views included a five-theory hierarchy of Divine Providence. These theories are developed from an earlier Platonic theory. Nemesius was one in a succession of advocates, from Herophilus and Erasistratus onward, of the idea that different cavities of the brain were responsible for different functions. His Doctrine of Ventricle Localisation of Mental Functioning is a reconciliation of Platonic doctrines on the soul with Christian philosophy and also emphasized Greek scientific interpretation and knowledge of the human body. Biography Little information is available on Nemesius' life except that he was the bishop of Emesa. Even his date is uncertain, though a rough indication is given by some internal evidence that points to a time after the Apollinarian controversy and before the strife that is connected to Eutyches and Nestorius (the second quarter of the fifth century). There is evidence that supports that he was well read in the writings of Galen and may have had some medical training. What remains very unclear in his writing is the interplay between the Christianity of his published writings and the Hellenism of his education. It is noteworthy that a bishop should be so interested in Hellenistic thought. De Natura Hominis Nemesius is best known for his book De Natura Hominis (\\"On Human Nature\\" or \\"On the Nature of Man\\"). Nemesius' book also contains many passages concerning Galenic anatomy and physiology. Establishing that mental faculties are localized in the ventricles of one's brain was the main principles of his work. Nemesius is also well known for his theories of Divine Providence, a theory that has been debated over the years. It was inspired by Plato. Nemesius considers providence as somewhat of a concern with particulars and those of universals. He states that it is the work of Divine Providence as the reason why everyone looks different from one another. He states that without divine providence nobody would be recognizable from the other. =First Theory of Providence= This theory of Nemesius, states that the structure of the universe is a whole, termed a \\"world-soul.\\" The world-soul consists of the heavenly gods (the stars, the planets, and the earth). It also includes the immortal, rational parts of the souls of the mortal creatures. He leaves the mortal creation parts of the souls and bodies up to the heavenly gods. The next three theories of divine providence that Nemesius suggests are arranged as a Hierarchy. =Hierarchy of the three levels of providence= The primary providence is that of the supreme God. It is concerned with the heavens and the rational souls. The secondary providence is recognizable by the influence of heavenly bodies on the order of the coming of perishable things and the preservation of natural things. The tertiary providence in the hierarchy concerns daemons concerning the actions of man. =Fourth Theory of Providence= In Nemesius' fourth theory of providence he describes that there are certain things that can be attributed neither to mind nor to the nature of things. The mind is concerned with the things that we are responsible, and providence is concerned with those things that we are not responsible for. =Fifth Theory of Providence= Nemesius' final theory of providence regards those who say that God is concerned for the continuity of things, but not with the particular of things. Doctrine of Ventricle Localisation Nemesius also contributes a Doctrine of Ventricle Localisation of Mental Functions. This doctrine, as a following of earlier platonic theory, identifies that all sensory perception were received in the anterior area of the brain. This area is now known as the Lateral-Ventricles. This area was then later termed the sensus communis and is the region where all sensory perceptions were held in common. These were held by a force identified as the faculty of imagination. The middle or also known as the Third Ventricle was termed the region of the faculty of intellect. This is the area that was responsible for controlling the judging, approving, refuting, and assaying of the sensory perceptions which are gathered in the lateral ventricles. The third faculty was identified as memory, and the storehouse of all sensory perceptions after they had been judged by the faculty of intellect. Nemesius believed that the faculties operated through the agent of an animal spirit produced after it had been carried through a network of arteries. This network was referred as the Rete Mirabile and is located at the base of the brain. Nemesius' doctrine of Ventricle Localisation of mental functions was greatly acknowledged but was later attacked by Brengarioda Carpi, and then by Vesalius and Varolio in 1543 and 1573.  Subsequent influence  In the sixth century, little attention seems to have been paid to De Natura Hominis. Maximus the Confessor is the first writer to quote the work, in his Ambigua (written between 628 and 634). The ecclesiastical writer Anastasios Sinaites incorporated excerpts into his \\"Questions and Answers\\". Then, in 743 John of Damascus incorporated extensive excerpts in his writing De fide Orthodoxa, though without naming Nemesius as the author. The Byzantine author who most used Nemesius' work was the eleventh-century writer Michael Psellos. For many subsequent centuries, De Natura Hominis was attributed to Gregory of Nyssa. This erroneous attribution was common in the Middle Ages in the Syriac, Armenian, Greek and Arabic traditions, as well as in the Latin-speaking scholarly world of the West. So, among others, Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas assumed that Gregory was the author. Gregory's high reputation contributed to the popularity of the work, which is reflected in the number of manuscripts: there are, for example, over one hundred Greek manuscripts known. De Natura Hominis was itself translated into Latin by Alphanus of Salerno in c1080. This translation was used in the twelfth century by scholars such as Adelard of Bath, William of Conches and William of St Thierry, and then by Albert the Great in the thirteenth century. A second Latin translation was made by Burgundio of Pisa in c1165. This was used by Peter Lombard, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas. De Fide Orthodoxa by John of Damascus includes various sections that draw heavily on De Natura Hominis; it was translated into Latin by Burgundio of Pisa in c1153.A modern edition of this text is John of Damascus, De fide orthodoxa (versions of Burgundio and Cerbanus), ed EM Buytaert (1955) By these various channels, Nemesius' thought had a great impact on medieval discussions concerning the passions.

Synthesis Germane is typically prepared by reduction of germanium compounds, notably germanium dioxide, with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, sodium aluminium hydride. The reaction with borohydrides is catalyzed by various acids and can be carried out in either aqueous or organic solvent. On laboratory scale, germane can be prepared by the reaction of Ge(IV) compounds with these hydride reagents.W. L. Jolly \\"Preparation of the volatile hydrides of Groups IVA and VA by means of aqueous hydroborate\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1961, volume 83, pp. 335-7.US Patent 4,668,502 A typical synthesis involved the reaction of Na2GeO3 with sodium borohydride. :Na2GeO3 \\\\+ NaBH4 \\\\+ H2O → GeH4 \\\\+ 2 NaOH + NaBO2 Other methods for the synthesis of germane include electrochemical reduction and a plasma- based method.US Patent 7,087,102 (2006) The electrochemical reduction method involves applying voltage to a germanium metal cathode immersed in an aqueous electrolyte solution and an anode counter-electrode composed of a metal such as molybdenum or cadmium. In this method, germane and hydrogen gases evolve from the cathode while the anode reacts to form solid molybdenum oxide or cadmium oxides. The plasma synthesis method involves bombarding germanium metal with hydrogen atoms (H) that are generated using a high frequency plasma source to produce germane and digermane. Reactions Germane is weakly acidic. In liquid ammonia GeH4 is ionised forming NH4+ and GeH3−. With alkali metals in liquid ammonia GeH4 reacts to give white crystalline MGeH3 compounds. The potassium (potassium germyl KGeH3) and rubidium compounds (rubidium germyl RbGeH3) have the sodium chloride structure implying a free rotation of the GeH3− anion, the caesium compound, CsGeH3 in contrast has the distorted sodium chloride structure of TlI. Use in semiconductor industry The gas decomposes near 600K to germanium and hydrogen. Because of its thermal lability, germane is used in the semiconductor industry for the epitaxial growth of germanium by MOVPE or chemical beam epitaxy. Organogermanium precursors (e.g. isobutylgermane, alkylgermanium trichlorides, and dimethylaminogermanium trichloride) have been examined as less hazardous liquid alternatives to germane for deposition of Ge-containing films by MOVPE. Safety Germane is a highly flammable, potentially pyrophoric,Brauer, 1963, Vol.1, 715 and a highly toxic gas.

The ship was sponsored by Mrs. F. Perry Schofield and commissioned on 11 May 1968, Comdr. Earl H. Graffam in command. The ship was named after US Navy Admiral Frank Herman Schofield. The original First Lieutenant was LTJG Lee “Red” Witham. Schofield received four battle stars for service in Vietnam. Operational history =Pacific= Following shakedown, Schofield conducted training exercises, both independently and with her squadron, Destroyer Squadron 23, out of her home port of Long Beach, California. With the new year, 1969, she participated in 1st Fleet exercises; and, at the end of March, she headed across the Pacific for her first WestPac deployment. On 24 April, the guided missile escort ship joined the 7th Fleet. On 7 May, she commenced operations with in the Gulf of Tonkin. A week later, she put into Subic Bay; then, after upkeep, she joined other 7th Fleet units in Operation Sea Spirit, a combined SEATO exercise terminated on 3 June following the collision of and . On 17 June, Schofield moved back into the Gulf of Tonkin, remaining into July. On the 6th, she departed the area and headed for Japan where she participated in a joint United States Navy-Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force exercise; then, toward the end of the month, she again set a course for the South China Sea. Schofield returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on the 27th and, for the next two weeks, operated with . A visit to Hong Kong followed. On 22 August, she returned to Subic Bay; and, in early September, she moved north for patrol duty in the Taiwan Strait. On the night of the 8th, she steamed to the assistance of caught in heavy seas away and unable to transfer fuel to her engine. By the time Schofield arrived, the minecraft was dead in the water. At daybreak, however, Schofield took Warbler in tow and headed for Kaohsiung, whence she returned to patrol duty. Three days later, Schofield continued north to Japan; participated in Hunter-killer Group exercises; then sailed for Hong Kong, where, for two weeks, she served as station ship. On 23 October, she returned to Japan; and, on 6 November, she headed home. =SS Connecticut rescue= Arriving at Long Beach on 21 October 1969, Schofield remained in port for most of the remainder of the year. In January 1970, she resumed her antisubmarine warfare exercises off the California coast. Early on the morning of the 9th, the exercises with her squadron and were interrupted to assist a merchant tanker, , reported to be sinking approximately away. En route to the scene, Schofield refueled Hornet helicopters delivering rescue personnel and equipment to the tanker. Two of Schofield's men, EMCS P. L. Kidd and BT1 A. E. Personette, were transferred to the tanker. The tanker's master commended the work in saving the ship. When Schofield arrived on the scene late in the afternoon, the situation was under control. That evening, the exercises were resumed. At mid-month, Schofield returned to Long Beach and entered the naval shipyard there for a yard period which took her into March. Squadron exercises, target ship duty, missile firing exercises, and a reservist training cruise followed. In July, she again entered the shipyard for boiler overhaul work; and, in October, she resumed her 1st Fleet operating schedule. On 7 January 1971, Schofield headed west. Into February, she conducted exercises in Hawaiian waters, then returned to the west coast for Operation Admixture, a joint United States-Canada exercise. During the exercise, Schofield added mothership duties for the experimental hydrofoil, , to her helicopter inflight refueling, plane guard, and escort responsibilities. The exercise was completed on 4 March. Schofield then returned briefly to Long Beach; and, on the 11th, she departed the California coast for the western Pacific. Steaming in company with ASW (Antisubmarine Warfare) Group 3, she joined the 7th Fleet on the 26th. On 3 and 4 April, she operated off the Vietnamese coast; and, on the 7th, she arrived in Subic Bay. Five days later, the group got underway for Singapore, whence they proceeded into the Indian Ocean for antisubmarine warfare exercises. At the end of the month, the ships sailed for Hong Kong; and, on the 11th, they got underway for Japan. After repairs at Yokosuka, Schofield participated in the first major United States task force exercise in the Sea of Japan in several years; then, on 17 June, she sailed for home. Proceeding north, she participated in antisubmarine warfare exercises between Attu and Kamchatka. On 5 July, she arrived at Long Beach. In August, she began preparations for her first major overhaul. On 1 September, she shifted her home port to San Diego; and, on 8 September, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extended overhaul which took her into 1972. The overhaul was completed on 6 June 1972, and Schofield sailed to her new home port, San Diego. The next three months were spent in refresher training and various exercises, including two successful launchings of her TARTAR missiles at the Pacific Missile Range. =Vietnam= On 9 September, Schofield departed San Diego for her third tour with the 7th Fleet. After brief stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, Guam, and Subic Bay, she joined TU 77.0.1 in the Tonkin Gulf on 8 October. She received her first bombardment mission of the deployment 20 days later and fired all night. On 30 October, she departed the area for Kaohsiung and a period of upkeep. She was back on station in the Tonkin Gulf from 9 November to 8 December for another line period. She then visited Hong Kong and Sasebo before returning to the firing line on New Year's Day, 1973. Schofield acted as a picket ship until mid-January when she was assigned to provide fire support. She fired daily missions until the 26th when she departed for Subic Bay. She returned to Yankee Station on 13 February and learned that, due to the cessation of hostilities, her WestPac deployment was to be reduced one month. On 15 February, she sailed for Yokosuka and San Diego, arriving at her home port on 9 March. During a period of restricted availability between April and September, Schofield received extensive helicopter facilities to enable her to operate the SH-2 LAMPS (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) helicopter. She held sea trials in October, firing exercises in early November; and, on the 23d, she was underway for the western Pacific. Schofield participated in exercises at Pearl Harbor and Midway Island before entering Subic Bay on 18 December. Four days later, she departed for Singapore with orders to continue from there to the Indian Ocean and conduct surveillance operations. She returned to San Diego on 6 June 1974. Fate Schofield was decommissioned on 8 September 1988 and stricken from the Navy register on 25 January 1992.

The work can be dated about the 5th- century CE even if a 4th-century date is sometimes proposed. The provenience is regarded as Syria, even if also Egypt or Asia Minor are possible origins. Author and date The author is unknown, even if the work declares to be the legacy left by Jesus Christ himself to his Apostles before the Ascension, and to give his own words and commands as to the government of the Church. The late dating, to the 4th or more likely the 5th century CE, may be discerned in the interpolations in the prayers, possibly in the reference to the chief deacon, for elsewhere no single deacon is distinguished by name until the close of the 4th century, in the reference to the Epiphany, which is first heard of elsewhere at the beginning of the 4th century. The suggestion has been hazarded that the last revision was due to the school of Apollinaris of Laodicea (died about 390 CE).

Scriptores Syri ; t. 163-164, Louvain 1975 In 1984 Robert Beylot published the first critical edition of the Ge'ez translation.Robert Beylot Le Testamentum Domini éthiopien, Louvain 1984 Content The Testamentum is usually incorporated in the collection of Church Orders named Clementine Octateuch. Of this the Testament forms the first two books; and according to the title it contains the \\"testament, or words which Our Lord spake to His holy Apostles when He rose from the dead\\". The division into books, however, is clearly not original. It falls into three distinct parts: an apocalyptic introduction, a \\"church order\\" proper, and a conclusion of the same apocalyptic character as the introduction. * The Introduction (book 1:1-18) professes to contain the record of the revelation of Himself by the Lord to his Apostles, with whom are Martha, Mary and Salome, on the evening after his resurrection. He is represented as unfolding to them, at their request, the signs of the end, and giving them instruction on various other topics. Incidentally, the fact becomes plain that this section is composed from the standpoint of Asia Minor and Syria, that it dates from soon after the time of Maximin (235-38) and Decius (249-51), and that it springs from a Christian community of a strictly morally rigorous type. * The Church Order (book 1:19book 2:24) follows the general lines of the Canons of Hippolytus and similar documents. It describes the Church and its buildings (1:19) ; the office of the bishop and his functions (1:19-27) : the mystagogic instruction (1:28) common to this and the Arabic Didascalia, where it occurs in an earlier form, and based in part upon the Gnostic Acts of Peter; the presbyter (1:29-32); the deacon (1:33-38); confessors (1:39); the \\"widows who have precedence in sitting\\" (1:40-43), apparently the same persons who are spoken of elsewhere as \\"presbyteresses\\" (1:35,2:19); the subdeacon (1:44) and the reader (liturgy) (1:45), the order of whose offices seems to have been inverted; virgins of both sexes (1:46); and those who possess charismata or spiritual gifts (1:47). Next come the regulations for the laity, including the whole course of preparation for and admission to baptism (2:1-8), confirmation (2:9), and the Eucharist (2:10) after which there follows a series of miscellaneous regulations for Easter and Pentecost (2:11-12), the agape (2:13), the funds of the Church (2:17-20), the visitation of the sick (2:21), the use of psalmody (2:22), the burial of the dead (2:23), and the hours of prayer (2:24). * The Conclusion (book 2:25-27) brings us back to the injunctions of the Lord as to the keeping of these precepts, a special charge to John, Andrew and Peter, and a statement that copies of the Testament were made by John, Peter and Matthew, and sent to Jerusalem by the hands of Dosithaeus, Sillas, Magnus and Aquila. Doctrine There is much that is peculiar to the Testament or characteristic of it. First and foremost is its ascription to the Jesus himself, which we can hardly be mistaken in regarding as an attempt to claim yet higher sanction than was claimed by the various compilations which were styled \\"apostolic\\", the so-called Church Orders. The whole tone of the Testamentum is one of highly-strung asceticism, and the regulations are such as point by their severity to a small and strictly organized body. They are \\"the wise\\", \\" the perfect\\", \\"sons of light\\"; but this somewhat Gnostic phraseology is not accompanied with any signs of Gnostic doctrine, and the work as a whole is orthodox in tone. They are set in the midst of \\"wolves\\", despised and slighted by the careless and worldly: there is frequent mention of \\"the persecuted,\\" and of the duty of \\"bearing the cross\\" There appears to be no place for penitence for serious sins excepting in the case of catechumens, and there is a notable \\"perfectionist\\" tone in many of the prayers. Charismata, and above all exorcisms, occupy a very important place: there is a vivid realization of the ministry of angels, and the angelic hierarchy is very complete. Great stress is laid upon virginity (although there is not a sign of monasticism), upon fasting (especially for the bishop), upon the regular attendance of the whole clerical body and the \\"more perfect\\" of the laity at the hours of prayer. The Church buildings are very elaborate, and the baptistery is oblong, a form found apparently only here and in the Arabic Didascalia. Amongst the festivals mentioned are the Epiphany, Easter and Pentecost. With regard to the prayers, they are based upon forms common to this and other Church Orders, but have many lengthy interpolations of an inflated and rhapsodic kind. The bishop appears to rank far above the presbyters (more conspicuously so, for example, than in the Canons of Hippolytus), and the presbyters are still divided into two classes, those who are more learned and those who are of mature age. The deacons have functions in the Eucharist and about the altar which point to an early date; they have also much administrative work of an important kind, and especial provisions are made for the care of the sick and the dead, and the burial of those who perish by shipwreck. One of the deacons is to be chosen as \\"chief deacon\\" (Protodeacon, 1:19, 1:34), and is charged with the care of pilgrims. There are no doorkeepers or singers, who begin to appear about 340 CE. The honour given to confessors is very conspicuous, and points back to an early date. But remarkable above all is the position given to women. We have \\"widows having precedence\\" or presbyteresses, three in number, deaconesses, virgins, and widows who are in receipt of the alms of the Church; and the first-named occupy a place of very great dignity, which is almost unequaled elsewhere (excepting in the earlier form of the apocryphal and Montanistic Acts and Martyrdom of Matthew), and which was formally condemned by the Council of Laodicea.

Life and career Born in Kaifeng, China on September 7, 1932, Previte was the great-granddaughter of James Hudson Taylor, the founder of China Inland Mission. As a young girl, Previte was a student at the Chefoo School at Yantai in Shandong, China and spent three years in a Japanese concentration camp at Weihsien Compound during World War II, from which she was liberated by American paratroopers on August 17, 1945. Over 50 years later, in 1997, she began to seek out and thank, in person, each of the soldiers who had been involved in liberating the camp. At the age of 14, Previte lost her left hand in a revolving saw accident.

LBF is a global marketplace for rights negotiation and the sale and distribution of content across print, audio, TV, film and digital channels. The 50th event was due to take place in 2020 but was cancelled as a precautionary measure against coronavirus contagion. The London Book Fair 2016. Few minutes before opening. Olympia, London UK Start In 1971 Lionel Leventhal organised The Specialist Publishers’ Exhibition for Librarians, with 22 exhibitors displaying titles on tabletops. Subsequently, now with business partner, Clive Bingley the scope and influence of the event grew and began to encompass bigger and more general publishers. In 1975, the initials LBF made their first appearance when the fair was renamed SPEX'75: The London Book Fair. By 1977 SPEX had been dropped and the title London Book Fair was born. Until 2006 the London Book Fair had been held at the Olympia exhibition centre, but it moved to the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London's Docklands that year. Due to generally unfavourable feedback from attendees over the new location, such as the inconvenience of transport links or the infrastructure of the location, as well as the intervention resulting from other exhibitions and their wandering visitors, the book fair returned to west London in 2007 and took place at Earls Court Exhibition Centre from 16 to 18 April. After 2007, the London Book Fair was held at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. In 2015 the LBF came back and took place in Olympia London on 14–16 April 2015 as part of London Book and Screen Week. After the success of the 43rd edition, in 2016, the London Book Fair stayed in Olympia. The London Book Fair has grown in size and importance over the years and is now considered as second only to the Frankfurt Book Fair as \\"a mecca for European publishers, booksellers, rights agents and media trend-spotters\\". Within a history of 42 years leading in the book market and exhibition, more than 25,000 publishers, booksellers, literary agents, librarians, media and industry suppliers from over 100 countries now attend the fair, according to the figures given by Jacks Thomas, Director of the London Book Fair.\\"Who Attend?

The fair itself covers a wide range of interests and markets within the publishing industry, including rights negotiation and the sales and distribution of content across print, audio, TV, film and digital channels, as well as more traditional forms of print publishing. There are many activities during the whole week of the London Book Fair, ranging from business meetings between publishing companies, introductions of titles to readers and visitors, announcement for prizes and awards, and many workshops and seminars to discuss current issues and trends in the industry.\\"Hessell Tiltman Prize for History\\" , The London Book Fair.

With the development of digital technologies and an increasing level of engagement from people, especially children and young teenagers, many authors and publishers are looking for a new way to tell stories that can help readers have more interaction with the fantasy and gain new knowledge during the games. Several famous professionals from the gaming industry have been to the fair and given speeches about their ideas, concepts that help both publishing and gaming industries to push the boundaries and create a new form of media convergence.\\"Jo Twist of Uk_ie was talking gaming at #LBF15\\", The London Book Fair Video.

London Book and Screen Week Launched in 2014, London Book and Screen Week was designed to celebrate the importance of the book and the written word at the heart of creative content across all formats. Comprising a week of events, the pinnacle of the week was the London Book Fair for the 43rd edition. Taking place in a variety of venues across the capital, London Book and Screen Week welcomed all those involved in writing, reading and creating content for book and screens in all formats from e-reader to silver screen. It incorporated, among other things, the Publishing for Digital Minds Conference, the recently launched Tech Tuesday, writers from this year's Market Focus and a direct-to-consumer creative writing event. The week focused on the business of publishing and storytelling from concept to consumer, shining a spotlight on authors, industry leaders, screenwriters, agents, publishers, retailers, etailers, developers, technology gurus and start-ups. Controversy In 2012, the London Book Fair appointed China's censoring organization, the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP), to choose which Chinese authors would be represented at the event. Chinese authors such as Nobel Prize winner Gao Xingjian were not invited. A representative of the British Council, a large financial supporter of the book fair, applauded the decision, saying that the chosen authors were more representative because \\"they live in China and write their books there\\", in contrast with \\"other writers who have left.\\" The exiled Chinese writer Ma Jian used red paint smeared across his face and a copy of his banned book Beijing Coma while he protested the event. He was also \\"manhandled\\" while attempting to present a copy of the book to Liu Binjie at the fair. A number of international and UK media covered the China Market Focus 2012 programme, including Isabel Hilton from The Guardian.

Acrocorinth, looking north towards the Gulf of Corinth. Acrocorinth (), \\"Upper Corinth\\", the acropolis of ancient Corinth, is a monolithic rock overseeing the ancient city of Corinth, Greece. In the estimation of George Forrest, “It is the most impressive of the acropoleis of mainland Greece.” With its secure water supply, Acrocorinth's fortress was repeatedly used as a last line of defense in southern Greece because it commanded the Isthmus of Corinth, repelling foes from entry by land into the Peloponnese peninsula. History The Acrocorinth was continuously occupied from archaic times to the early 19th century. Along with Demetrias and Chalcis, the Acrocorinth during the Hellenistic period formed one of the so-called “Fetters of Greece” – three fortresses garrisoned by the Macedonians to secure their control of the Greek city-states. The city's archaic acropolis was already an easily defensible position due to its geomorphology; it was further heavily fortified during the Byzantine Empire as it became the seat of the strategos of the thema of Hellas and later of the Peloponnese. It was defended against the Crusaders for three years by Leo Sgouros. Afterwards it became a fortress of the Frankish Principality of Achaea, the Venetians, and the Ottoman Turks. Three circuit walls formed the man-made defense of the hill. The highest peak on the site was home to a temple to Aphrodite. The temple was converted to a church, which in turn was converted to a mosque. The American School's Corinth Excavations began excavations on the Acrocorinth in 1929. Currently, it is one of the most important medieval castle sites of Greece.  Myths and legends  In a Corinthian myth related in the 2nd century CE to Pausanias, Briareus, one of the Hecatonchires, was the arbitrator in a dispute between Poseidon and Helios, between the sea and the sun: His verdict was that the Isthmus of Corinth belonged to Poseidon and the acropolis of Corinth (Acrocorinth) to Helios. The Upper Pirene spring is located within the encircling walls. \\"The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus. The latter knew, so runs the legend, that Zeus had ravished Aegina, the daughter of Asopus, but refused to give information to the seeker before he had a spring given him on the Acrocorinthus.\\" Gallery Acrocorinth map (EN).jpgMap of Acrocorinth Carl Anton Joseph Rottmann - Corinth with Akrocorinth - WGA20150.jpg\\"Corinth with Acrocorinth\\" by Carl Anton Joseph Rottmann, 1847 Corinth, Acrocorinth.jpgView of Acrocorinth walled gates, as rebuilt by the Venetians.

When an attempt is made to gaze contralaterally (relative to the affected eye), the affected eye adducts minimally, if at all. The contralateral eye abducts, however with nystagmus. Additionally, the divergence of the eyes leads to horizontal diplopia. That is, if the right eye is affected the patient will \\"see double\\" when looking to the left, seeing two images side-by-side. Convergence is generally preserved. Causes Vestibulo-ocular reflex The disorder is caused by injury or dysfunction in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), a heavily myelinated tract that allows conjugate eye movement by connecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF)-abducens nucleus complex of the contralateral side to the oculomotor nucleus of the ipsilateral side. In young patients with bilateral INO, multiple sclerosis is often the cause. In older patients with one-sided lesions a stroke is a distinct possibility. Other causes are possible. Variants A rostral lesion within the midbrain may affect the convergence center thus causing bilateral divergence of the eyes which is known as the WEBINO syndrome (Wall Eyed Bilateral INO) as each eye looks at the opposite \\"wall\\". If the lesion affects the PPRF (or the abducens nucleus) and the MLF on the same side (the MLF having crossed from the opposite side), then the \\"one and a half syndrome\\" occurs, with paralysis of all conjugate horizontal eye movements other than abduction of the eye on the opposite side to the lesion.

Operational history 5690 was built at Crewe in March 1936 and named Leander after HMS Leander, which in turn was named after the Greek hero Leander. From March 1936 it was based at Crewe North shed where it remained until 1947 when it was transferred to the former LMS engine shed at Bristol (Barrow Road). After nationalisation in 1948, it was renumbered 45690 by British Railways. After being withdrawn in 1964, Leander was sold to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales. Preservation Rescued by Brian Oliver in May 1972, it was restored by the Leander Locomotive Society at Derby and later kept at the Dinting Railway Museum, Glossop. After later purchase by and running on the Severn Valley Railway, Leander was sold to Dr Peter Beet, and restored to running condition on the East Lancashire Railway in LMS Crimson Lake livery. As of 2008, Leander was owned by Chris Beet (Engineering and Rail Operations Manager, National Railway Museum) and operated by the West Coast Railway Company from their Carnforth MPD base. In 2008, Leander provided motive power for the Scarborough Spa Express heritage service. It also spent October at the Great Central Railway \\"Steam Railway\\" gala, alongside BR Standard 7 Britannia Class No. 70013 Oliver Cromwell and LNER Peppercorn Class A1 No. 60163 Tornado. In September 2010, Leander visited the Severn Valley Railway (SVR) for their 40th anniversary Autumn steam gala alongside fellow visiting locomotives and former Severn Valley based engines GWR 2251 Class 0-6-0 No. 3205, GWR 3700 Class 4-4-0 No. 3717 City of Truro, GWR 4575 Class 2-6-2T No. 5542 and SR West Country Pacific 4-6-2 No. 34070 Manston. Leander departed from the SVR at the beginning of October hauling the Severn Valley Limited to Blackpool North one way only as the locomotive was en route to the East Lancashire Railway for a few weeks stay during their Autumn Steam Gala. Shortly afterwards, Leander returned to Carnforth and mainline operation. In April 2012, Leander was withdrawn early for overhaul due to its poor condition. Chris Beet managed the overhaul, assisted by the team at West Coast Railway Company from their Carnforth MPD base. It returned to operation in October 2014, painted in BR Lined Black, the livery that it carried between 12 April 1949 and 15 November 1952, and which was also carried by 46 other members of the class from August 1948. Its first revenue earning run was to be over Shap Summit to Carlisle and back along the Settle & Carlisle line on 24 January, but it failed its FTR exam so its first revenue earning run was over Shap Summit to Carlisle, Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Manchester and Preston on 7 March 2015.

He defected from Cuba and moved to Spain in 1999. He settled in Spain for five years, becoming one of Europe's most successful bodyguards. In 2005 Fernández moved to Miami, Florida and as of 2006 he was waiting to get U.S. residency under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Defection from Cuba Fernández, 44 in 2006, emigrated from Cuba in 1999 after becoming disillusioned with Castro's government. As part of Fidel and Raúl Castro's inner circle, Delfín Fernández asserts that he learnt everything from why the Cuban leader incinerates his dirty underwear to his cravings for pricey Spanish ham. Fernández claims that he was once sent to Spain to bring $2,500 worth of the pata negra delicacy back to Cuba because Fidel Castro had a penchant for imported cured Spanish hams and a paranoia about assassination. Fernández said that chief bodyguard, Bienvenido \\"Chicho\\" Pérez, had told him that Castro had his underwear burned to foil any assassination plots with chemicals during laundering. His disillusionment with the government, he said, and his ambitions for a better life compelled him to defect. Fernández made a series of allegations, including a claim that Raúl Castro had stolen millions of pounds from government coffers. He claimed that Fidel Castro and his brother, Raúl, assembled incriminating dossiers on foreign businessmen who wanted to invest in Cuba. Fernández recorded every word and movement of high-profile visitors to Cuba with a high-tech array of hidden microphones and video cameras. He worked for Cuba's Department 11, set up to infiltrate hotels and travel agencies. There he acted as a spy under the cover of his official title as Operations Manager for the Guitart hotel chain, where he claimed that guests could be open to blackmail. He also stated that he bugged the hotel rooms of foreign politicians and businessmen under orders from Raúl. Fernández said he carried suitcases with cash out of Cuba for the Castro brothers. Fernández said he defected in Spain in 1999 on a trip to Europe to drop off Raúl's daughter, Mariela Castro Espín, in Italy to visit her father-in-law and pick up a Rottweiler in Germany for Fidel. According to former CIA analyst Brian Latell, a senior researcher at the University of Miami's Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies and someone described by the Miami Herald as \\"helping shape public opinion about Cuba's future\\",Analyst's new job: visualizing Cuba after Castro dies Miami Herald Fri, Jun. 02, 2006, \\"A lot of the stories he told me were fascinating, and I found almost all of them to be highly credible.\\" Fernández has been an outspoken critic of the Cuban government since he defected.  Bodyguard  Fernández settled in Spain for five years, becoming one of Europe's most successful bodyguards. Among his clients in Spain: actors Antonio Banderas and his wife, Melanie Griffith, soccer star David Beckham, Spanish actresses Ana Obregón and Esther Cañadas, former Spice Girl Emma Bunton, bullfighter Francisco Rivera Ordóñez and several high-profile businessmen. Before his defection, Fernández claims that one of his key tasks was to spy on wealthy visitors to the island, including film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson. In 2004 he worked minding Hollywood star Antonio Banderas in Spain. = Sports star scandal = According to David Smith of the Observer, Fernández who worked for David Beckham for three months when he first moved to Madrid and in 2004 would sell personal information about his ex-boss's affairs with Rebecca Loos for £500,000. Fernández admitted he had been approached by paparazzi, who would follow Beckham everywhere. But he insisted that he had always turned down their lucrative cash offers to spill the beans. Fernández said that he saw Beckham kissing Rebecca Loos in the back of his car and that he drove them to the Santa Mauro hotel in Madrid three times. He said, \\"I could see them kissing in the rear-view mirror. The car had dark tinted windows so nobody could see in from the outside. After that there were three more occasions I drove them to hotels in the early hours.\\" Fernández said that when they had their privacy Beckham and his assistant were \\"all over each other like teenagers\\". Victoria (Posh Spice) Beckham was said to be in tears over tabloid reports that her husband, \\"Becks,\\" had been having a torrid affair with his former aide, Rebecca Loos. Beckham had been photographed clubbing with Loos who used to work for his management company.  Public life  The Spanish media have embraced him, writing dozens of articles about his life as a Castro insider and bodyguard. He was also a consultant on an investigative book, Conexión Habana, by Spanish authors. After living in Spain for five years he arrived in Miami where he had a spot on a TV show on WJAN-Channel 41. There, as a regular television guest, he caught the imagination of the Cuban community with his disclosures of Castro's habits and idiosyncrasies and the workings of his inner circle. Oscar Haza, a popular Spanish language talk show host on Channel 41, has invited Fernández on his show, A Mano Limpia, at least six times, firing up the ratings when he's a guest, said Channel 41 news director Miguel Cossío. The ratings were so strong that Channel 41 offered to let Fernández be a permanent guest on a new daily weekday show, Arrebatados, at 6 p.m., hosted by Maria Laria.

His flight on the 2006 Discovery STS-116 mission made him the fourth person born in the United Kingdom to go into space. Personal life Patrick was born in Saltburn-by- the-Sea in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, in 1964 to Gillian and Stewart Patrick.https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/patrick_nicholas.pdf His mother came from the Isle of Skye in Scotland. He grew up in both London and Rye, New York, and eventually became a United States citizen in 1994. Patrick is married to a paediatrician originally from Peru and has three children. Education and early career Patrick was first educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge (receiving an undergraduate degree in Engineering in 1986). During his university years, he learned to fly as a member of the Royal Air Force's Cambridge University Air Squadron. After Cambridge, he worked for four years as an engineer for the Aircraft Engines Division of General Electric, in Lynn, Massachusetts in the United States. Patrick then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving a master's degree (1990) and a PhD. (1996), both in Mechanical Engineering. Afterwards, he joined Boeing's Commercial Airplane Group in Seattle. Space career =NASA career= Nicholas Patrick on STS-130 is pictured outside the cupola Patrick was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1998 and reported to NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) for astronaut training in August 1998. His initial training included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station systems, and physiological, survival, and classroom training in preparation for T-38 flight. Patrick has logged over 308 hours in space, having completed his first space mission as a member of the crew of STS-116 – a construction and logistics mission to the International Space Station. He occasionally serves as a CAPCOM; for example, he worked with the Orbit 2 team for STS-120. Patrick notably put the finishing touches on the Tranquility node during STS-130. In July 2004, Patrick served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 6 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for ten days. In August 2007, he served as the commander of the NEEMO 13 mission, living underwater for another ten days. Patrick retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps in May 2012. NASA Spaceflight Experience STS-116 Discovery ( 9–22 December 2006): The seven-member crew on this 12-day mission continued construction of the ISS outpost by adding the P5 spacer truss segment during the first of four spacewalks. The next two spacewalks rewired the station's power system, preparing it to support the addition of European and Japanese science modules by future shuttle crews. The fourth spacewalk was added to allow the crew to coax and retract a stubborn solar panel to fold up accordion-style into its box. Discovery also delivered a new crew member and more than two tons of equipment and supplies to the station. Almost two tons of items no longer needed on the station returned to Earth with STS-116. Mission duration was 12 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes. Owing to both his Scottish ancestry and his endorsement of the Careers Scotland Space School, Patrick requested a Scottish flag that had been flown at the Scottish Parliament to go with him on STS-116 Discovery. It is now kept on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. STS-130 Endeavour (8 to 21 February 2010): This mission launched at night, carrying the International Space Station's final permanent modules: Tranquility and Cupola. Tranquility (or Node 3) is now the life-support hub of the station, containing exercise, water recycling, and environmental control systems, while the Cupola provides the largest set of windows ever to grace a spacecraft. These seven windows, arranged in a hemisphere, provide a spectacular and panoramic view of our planet and a direct view of station robotic operations. During the 13-day, 18-hour mission, Endeavour and her six-member crew traveled more than 5.7 million miles and completed 217 orbits of the Earth, touching down at night at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. =Blue Origin career= Patrick joined Blue Origin in 2012.

A total of 230 cars were built, arranged in married pairs. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The first R27s entered service on November 15, 1960. In early 1989, twenty-seven R27s were rebuilt and painted in the fox red paint scheme that also appeared on the R30s, with the intention to operate these cars for several more years. The unrebuilt R27s were replaced by the R68As, with the last unrebuilt train running on May 10, 1989. Almost all overhauled R27s were retired the same year due to reliability problems and the lack of air conditioning on the cars. The R27 cars were retired in the early 1990s; none of the R27 fleet were preserved, since they were identical to the later R30/R30A fleet. Description The R27s were numbered 8020–8249. The R27s were a continuation of the R16 style, except that the cars used the IRT R26-style pink hard fiberglass all-longitudinal seating instead of the mixed combination seating found on the older R16s, as well as removing the \\"porthole\\" style front windows found on the R15, R16, and R17. The R27s were coupled together as pairs. These cars, along with their identical R30 and R30A sister cars, replaced the oldest BMT Standards (including all 50 of the trailer cars), the ME-1s purchased and transferred from the SIRT, the MS Multi-section cars, and the IRT Lo-Vs that were modified to be used on B-division shuttles. The cars also permitted all borrowed IND equipment such as the R1/9s used on the #2 Fourth Avenue Local extension to Astoria–Ditmars Blvd, and the R10 cars used on the #15 Jamaica Line to be returned to their respective lines on the IND division, and also helped to stabilize the BMT division to a certain extent. The R27s were the first cars to not use the numerical route designations used on former BMT lines; the cars ushered in letter designations for such routes (continuing where the IND designations ended). The IND routes either then or previously in use ran from A to HH; the BMT designations now ran from J to TT. After the merger in late 1967, many IND and BMT routes were joined together by some lines. There were two versions of the R27: Westinghouse (WH)-powered equipped cars (8020–8135) and General Electric (GE)-powered cars (8136–8249). History The first train of R27s, consisting of cars 8027–8024, 8021–8020, and 8028–8029, were placed into or entered service on the route on November 15, 1960. The R27s were initially assigned to the QT and QB routes. Once the R27s arrived in sufficient numbers, they provided all weekend service on the BMT Southern Division. Most R27s were transferred to the BMT Eastern Division after November 1967, although they would appear in the northern and southern divisions as well as on many IND routes as well. =Overhaul= In early 1989, 24 selected GE-powered R27s and 3 WH-powered R27s were rebuilt and painted in the fox red paint scheme, similar to the 162 GE-powered R30s and other Redbird trains in the subway system, as part of the Clean Car Program. The overhaul of the 27 cars cost $100,000 per car. 14 cars known to be rebuilt were 8042, 8091, 8126, 8145, 8158–8159, 8172–8173, 8177, 8186, 8224–8225, 8236, and 8241. They ran on the until being retired in early 1990. =Retirement= The R27s were replaced by the R68As in 1989 and 1990 (they were indirectly replaced by rebuilt R38s and unrebuilt R30s, which started appearing on the C in late 1988). The last un-rebuilt R27 train ran on May 10, 1989, which marked an end to graffiti on subway cars since 1972. The overhauled R27s were planned to run for many years to come, but all cars except 8042 were instead retired by the summer of 1989 due to reliability problems and the lack of air conditioning on the cars. 8042 was the last R27 to operate; it was mated to R30 car 8513 and ran on the C until the early 1990s. After retirement, most cars were sent to what is now Sims Metal Management's Newark facility to be scrapped and processed. Some cars were retained as movie props, but were ultimately scrapped as well. However, car 8145 was retained as a school car until 2011. Initially held for the New York Transit Museum, it was stored at the Pitkin Yard, but towed to the 207th Street Yard in summer 2013, and finally sent to Sims Metal Management in Newark, New Jersey to be scrapped on October 22, 2013.

Pedro Caballes during the Laguna Campaign of the Philippine-American War. On April 11, 1899, upon capturing Santa Cruz, General Henry W. Lawton then sought out to capture the town of Pagsanjan from the Filipinos. The expedition began at 6 a.m. A battalion of sharpshooters was sent ahead of the command as an advance guard, and as they came within 1.5 miles (2 km) of Pagsanjan, they were fired upon by a small force of Filipinos from hastily built breastworks blocking the road. The sharpshooters returned fire and caused considerable losses to the Filipinos. An artillery piece was then brought up and fired two shrapnel rounds into the breastworks, which were soon abandoned by most of the Filipinos. Some Filipinos remained in the breastworks after the bombardment and were driven out as well after the sharpshooters gave the breastworks another heavy volley. General Lawton and his command then went on to capture Pagsanjan with no further resistance.

She is best known for her role on the CBS drama television series Lou Grant (1977–1982), which earned her three Golden Globe Award nominations and five Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Life and career Kelsey's professional career began with stage appearances in her home of Minneapolis, Minnesota. With her good looks and striking mane of red hair she landed small roles on television shows like Emergency! and The Rookies, and the television movie The Picture of Dorian Gray (1973). Her first recognition came with an appearance on an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as a rival to Sue Ann Nivens (played by Betty White), where she met Ed Asner on the set, with whom she later worked on the spin-off show Lou Grant. Her appearance on The Mary Tyler Moore Show led to prominent guest appearances on shows like M*A*S*H, The Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, Spencer's Pilots, Quincy M.E., The Rockford Files, the television films The Last of Mrs. Lincoln (1976) Something for Joey (1977), Eleanor and Franklin (1976), Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years (1977), and the miniseries Captains and the Kings (1976). She also appeared in the episode \\"The Mask of Adonis\\" from the 1977 series Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected (known in the United Kingdom as Twist in the Tale). Her big break came when producers of the television series Lou Grant decided that the actress playing the female reporter on the show was too young and perky. After three episodes, they recast the part with Kelsey in the role of Billie Newman, the crusading reporter for the fictional Los Angeles Tribune, which also co-starred Asner. Kelsey won five consecutive Emmy Award nominations (1978 through 1982) for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, losing four times to her Lou Grant costar Nancy Marchand and once to Kristy McNichol in Family. She also made several appearances on the various iterations of the Pyramid (game show), including assisting a contestant in winning $100,000. Six years after Lou Grant went off the air in 1982, Kelsey was primed for stardom by NBC as the lead in the sitcom Day by Day (1988) as a woman who runs a daycare center out of her home. The show ran for two seasons. Kelsey continued to make guest appearances in television series and TV movies through the late 1990s, notably in the TV movie The Babysitter's Seduction and on several episodes of Murder, She Wrote. After television work stopped trickling in, Kelsey returned to her native Twin Cities area, where she has continued her career in regional theater productions, memorably in the title role of Mary Stuart at the Park Square Theater, a performance for which Talkin' Broadway described her as \\"beautiful, feminine, determined and regal throughout, even when she's giggling with her lady-in-waiting. She affects every man who comes to see her.\\"Talkin' Broadway, \\"A nipped and tucked Mary Stuart takes off at Park Square\\" In 2009, she revisited her television past, playing Sue Ann Nivens for a week in a Minneapolis theatre company's restaging of The Mary Tyler Moore Show scripts, including the episode in which she originally appeared.

The highway extends north from an interchange with in the vicinity of Woodinville north through Snohomish, Lake Stevens, Arlington, Sedro-Woolley, and Nooksack to become (BC 11) at the Canada–US border in Sumas. Three other roadways are briefly concurrent with the route: in Arlington, in Sedro-Woolley, and near Deming. A spur route in Sumas serves trucks traveling into British Columbia. Before SR 9 was created, several other roads used the route of the current highway. The first was a roadway extending from the current southern terminus to Snohomish established by 1895 and another road between Arlington and Sedro- Woolley by 1911. The current SR 542 concurrency was first established in 1925, when a branch of from Bellingham to Mount Baker was added to the state highway system. These roads were combined and several other roads were added to create Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A), which originally ran from Woodinville to Blaine in 1937. A branch of SSH 1A connected the mainline to the Canada–US border in Sumas, but was later included into SSH 1A when the Blaine to Sumas segment was deleted in 1953. A highway renumbering in 1964 introduced the sign routes that would be co-signed with the existing system until 1970, one of which would replace SSH 1A, SR 9\\\\. SSH 1A / SR 9 extended south to Woodinville until 1965, when it was shortened to , later SR 522, which wasn't complete yet. SR 9 was not complete between Lake Stevens and Arlington until after 1966. Between 2004 and 2009, nine complete construction projects, arranged by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), have improved the roadway. The projects ranged from expanding the current weigh station at the Soper Hill Road intersection in 2005 to realigning the highway between Nooksack and Sumas in 2006 to eliminate 90-degree turns. WSDOT is also widening SR 9 in Snohomish County from 2 lanes to a four-lane divided highway. Between 2009 and 2013, WSDOT plans to complete six other projects in Snohomish County to improve the corridor from SR 522 to Bryant. Some projects include widenings, adding a roundabout at , realignments south of Snohomish and the addition of web cameras. Route description SR 9 begins less than north of the King–Snohomish county line near Woodinville at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 522\\\\. The roadway continues south as Woodinville–Snohomish Road, while SR 522 connects the area to Seattle, Bothell, and Monroe. SR 9 travels north along the west side of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant and a community park in Maltby. The four-lane highway continues north and intersects SR 524 at Turners Corner before turning northeast towards Clearview and Cathcart. SR 9 travels along the eastern ridge that overlooks the Snohomish River valley and has several sections with median barriers to form a divided highway. Shortly after passing Cathcart, terminates at the road. SR 9 passes Harvey Airfield and crosses another BNSF rail line and the Snohomish River to enter Snohomish. North of the Snohomish River Bridge, the highway encounters a diamond interchange with 2nd Street and Riverview Road and turns northeast to intersect Bickford Avenue, which once was (US 2). Curving north out of Snohomish, the route interchanges with US 2 in a modified diamond interchange, with a westbound US 2 offramp routed onto New Bunk Foss Road. In suburban West Lake Stevens near the Lake Stevens shoreline, ends at the highway. After the intersection, the roadway had an estimated daily average of 25,000 motorists in 2007, making this stretch of road the busiest on the whole highway. SR 9 also forms the western boundary of Lake Stevens and the eastern boundary of Marysville while passing a weigh station and the junction. After Lake Cassidy, the road intersects and continues into North Marysville, where the roadway passes over the Snohomish County Centennial Trail. After intersecting at a roundabout, and several residential subdivisions near the Arlington High School, the highway enters downtown Arlington as Hazel Street. After a brief concurrency with , SR 9 crosses the Stillaguamish River and passes Bryant to enter a heavily forested area and leave Snohomish County. Lake McMurray, a community located in southern Skagit County. Entering Skagit County, the highway continues northwest through a large forest to Lake McMurray, where it intersects and encounters the Lake McMurray Store, established in 1889. The road passes through Big Lake and its community of the same name before intersecting at a roundabout east of Mount Vernon. Turning northeast to Clear Lake, the route crosses the Skagit River into Sedro- Woolley. In Sedro-Woolley, the street becomes concurrent with and is named Moore Street. At the end of the concurrency, the road turns north as Township Street, paralleling another BNSF rail line, at Cascade Middle School. Continuing north out of the city and into rural areas, SR 9 crosses the Samish River and exits Skagit County. The highway enters Whatcom County in a valley located east of Lake Whatcom. Passing Acme and crossing the Nooksack River, the roadway becomes concurrent with at a roundabout in Deming. Traveling west with SR 542 along the Nooksack River, the road splits at another roundabout in Cedarville and continues north through a series of 90-degree turns in a plain located near the Sumas River. In Nooksack, the route becomes Nooksack Avenue and encounters , named Main Street, which travels west to Everson. North of Nooksack, SR 9 intersects in a rural area and travels northeast along the Sumas River to Sumas. In Sumas, ends at SR 9 and a spur route that serves trucks branches off and SR 9 terminates at the Canada–US border. The road continues north from the Canada–US border, through Abbotsford, BC to (BC 1), as . =Spur route= Within Sumas, SR 9 has a short spur route that is used by trucks travelling into Canada. SR 9 Spur starts at SR 9 (Cherry Street) and travels east as Garfield Street and north as Sumas Avenue to the Canada–US border, where it becomes Boundary Avenue and reconnects back to SR 9's continuation in Canada, Highway 11 (BC 11) in Abbotsford, BC. After the Cherry Street intersection, an estimated daily average of 1,800 motorists used the roadway in 2007. History The current route of SR 9 began as a road extending from Grace (today Woodinville) north to Snohomish, first appearing in an 1895 map. The Snohomish to Arlington segment was not built until after SR 9, but between Arlington and Sedro-Woolley, there was a highway by 1911. The first section of the roadway to be included in the state highway system was the current concurrency, which became a branch of extending from Bellingham to Mount Baker in 1925. Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A) was established in 1937 and ran from (PSH 2) in Woodinville north to Sumas and west to in Blaine. A branch of SSH 1A connected the main highway to the Canada–US border. Much of the highway was not complete at the time, leading to calls from the Associated Clubs of the North End to accelerate construction to provide an alternate connection to Canada. Between Lynden and Nooksack, SSH 1A was realigned in 1951 and in 1953, SSH 1A between Blaine and Sumas was deleted. A section between Snohomish and Lake Stevens was moved to a new, straightened roadway that opened on September 12, 1952. became concurrent with SSH 1A in 1957 when it was extended east through Arlington to Darrington. A third concurrency was added in 1961 when was extended west, concurrent in Sedro-Woolley, to Fredonia. During the 1964 highway renumbering, a new system of highways, sign routes, was introduced and was co-signed with the existing primary and secondary state highways. SSH 1A became SR 9, but SSH 1A was still signed until 1970. In 1965, SSH 1A / SR 9 was shortened from Woodinville to in Grace, which was not complete yet. By 1966, the highway was not complete between Lake Stevens and Arlington and in 1970, SR 202 became . Since 2004, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has completed nine construction projects on SR 9. The Lake Stevens weigh station, located on the west side of the highway at the Sopher Hill Road intersection was expanded to serve two trucks at once in late 2005. The (US 2) interchange was modified to use New Bunk Foss Road as an onramp and traffic signals were added in January 2006. The roadway was repaved between Snohomish and Lake Stevens and also guardrails and turn lanes were added in 2006.< On November 22, 2006, WSDOT opened a new alignment of SR 9 between Nooksack to Sumas that bypassed three 90-degree turns. A roundabout was added to the intersection east of Mount Vernon in summer 2007. Between SR 522 and , the highway was widened from a 2-lane road to a four-lane divided highway in 2008. A curve on the roadway north of Arlington was straightened in late 2008 and turn lanes were added to two intersections near Bryant. Future developments Between 1980 and 2000, the population of Snohomish County grew by 80 percent, resulting in increased congestion on the two-lane SR 9\\\\. Accidents have increased from an average of 325 collisions per year in the 1990s to 450 collisions per year between 2000 and 2007. Since late 2005, WSDOT has been improving the corridor with six projects located between and the Skagit County line that are scheduled to be completed by 2013. South of Snohomish, WSDOT is improving the highway in multiple ways including new intersections and alignments, new web cameras and new turn lanes. Between and Clearview, the 2-lane road is being widened to a four-lane divided highway starting in 2011. The intersection south of Arlington was scheduled to be rebuilt as a roundabout in 2011. The roundabout option was chosen over a traffic signal in early October 2009. A route development plan is currently being designed for the highway between SR 522 and Schloman Road north of Arlington. During a project to widen SR 9 in Lake Stevens, a left-turn lane to Lake Stevens Road was removed in 2009 and residents located on the road have protested. The intersection of SR 9 and SR 204 in Lake Stevens is planned to be replaced with a series of roundabouts to be complete by 2023. WSDOT plans to widen SR 9 near downtown Snohomish to four lanes by building a second bridge over the Snohomish River to carry southbound traffic. The $142 million project is projected to be completed in 2025.

It serves the network protocol 9P and runs as a user space daemon, like most Plan 9 file servers. Fossil is different from most other file systems due to its snapshot/archival feature. It can take snapshots of the entire file system on command or automatically (at a user-set interval). These snapshots can be kept on the Fossil partition as long as disk space allows; if the partition fills up then old snapshots will be removed to free up disk space. A snapshot can also be saved permanently to Venti. Fossil and Venti are typically installed together.  Features  Important features include: *Snapshots are available to all users. No administrator intervention is needed to access old data. (This is possible because Fossil enforces file permissions; users can only access data which they would be allowed to access anyway; thus a user cannot snoop on another's old files or look at old passwords or such.) *Data in permanent snapshots (sometimes called archives) cannot be modified. Only the non-permanent snapshots can be removed. To access a snapshot, one would connect to a running fossil instance (“mount” it) and change directory to the desired snapshot, e.g. /snapshot/yyyy/mmdd/hhmm (with yyyy, mm, dd, hh, mm meaning year, month, day, hour, minute). To access an archive (permanent snapshot), a directory of the form /archive/yyyy/mmdds (with yyyy, mm, dd, s meaning year, month, day, sequence number) would be used. Plan 9 allows modifying the namespace in advanced ways, like redirecting one path to another path (e.g. /bin/ls to /archive/2005/1012/bin/ls). This significantly eases working with old versions of files. Fossil is available on several other platforms via Plan 9 from User Space.  History Fossil was designed and implemented by Sean Quinlan, Jim McKie and Russ Cox at Bell Labs and added to the Plan 9 distribution at the end of 2002. It became the default file system in 2003, replacing Kfs and the previous Plan 9 archival file system, dubbed The Plan 9 File Server, or \\"fs\\". fs is also an archival file system which originally was designed to store data on a WORM optical disc system. The permanent storage for fossil is provided by Venti, which typically stores data on hard drives, which have much lower access times than optical discs.

The family was created for The Gary Davies Show with Gary Davies on Piccadilly Radio in 1983 when Hawkins wrote a poem about a family's day trip to Blackpool. This soon developed into a series. In 1986, Hawkins was made producer of The Phil Wood Show, on which he performed more Bradshaws material. Hawkins would go on to sell cassettes of his Bradshaws episodes, which he still does to this day, as well as doing stand-up, acting and more. The Bradshaws series has been re-released as a 25 volume C.D. collection. The series has gained great popularity in the North and abroad. It has been said that some people still ask who the voice actors are even though all the characters are voiced by Hawkins.The Bradshaws Website Broadcast Some episodes were also made into a television series by Granada TV. The series can be heard as a strand of the Billy Butler show on BBC Radio Merseyside, on the Chorley-based Station Chorley FM, and on 7 Waves Radio 92.1. The show is now also played on Tameside Radio 103.6 FM, Cheshire's Canalside Radio 102.8fm, Crewe and Nantwich based station The Cat 107.9 FM and Wythenshawe FM 97.2 after a fan petition on change.org achieved the required 9 signatures to get the show back on air. Setting The Bradshaws is set in a Cosy Terraced House with outside loo in the fictional Manchester suburb of Barnoldswick (any relation to the actual town of Barnoldswick, is apparent only in the name as the characters refer to Manchester as being their local town on many occasions) in the era of pounds, shillings and pence (probably sometime in the 1960s), there is almost always a brass band playing two or three streets away (Hawkins thought that some quiet brass band music in the background would help make the series feel warm and cosy ). The Bradshaws are a normal working-class family with little money, although they are able to afford a few luxuries (such as Alf's Woodbines). Plus, Audrey and Alf's faces are never seen in the TV series (though Audrey's is briefly seen in 'Puddled'). Main characters =Audrey= Audrey is the stereotypical housewife. She likes entering competitions and winning holidays to Venus The Bradshaws Boxed set and Torimonalisus (she mispronounced Venice and Torremolinos). Audrey is considerably less intelligent than Alf and often shows this through complete lack of common knowledge. For example, she seems to think that the coalman and Michael Morris's Mam are just 'friends', even though the other characters find it obvious that they are having an affair (see Minor Characters). Audrey (seemingly) cooks very badly. When she made steak and kidney pudding for Billy and Alf's tea she left it boiling dry resulting in burnt pastry (which tasted like cardboard according to Alf). Audrey has a sister called Pamela, whom Alf hates. She always has a best trifle dish and wears an apron. =Alf= Alf is a male shoulderless pig (according to Audrey), he eats corned dog (which he calls it whereas Audrey refers to it by its actual name). The only times where he is obviously nice to Billy is when he is drunk; he smokes and gets Billy to fetch him either: a box of matches (swan vestas), corned beef and much more. His face is never seen and appears to be quite a huge man who has very little money, he sarcastically calls Audrey mock affectionate names such as \\"sweet little thistle\\" and hated Poshy/Oswald (see below for more detail). =Billy= William \\"Billy\\" Bradshaw is perhaps the most popular character in the series. He loves both his parents (though Alf can be very mean to him on occasions), Billy, like Michael, is a puppet who acts as a son to two adults, Billy enjoys going to the flicks and would like a pet of some sort, either a dog, zebra or \\"Zedgie\\" (an imaginary animal that Alf made up). Billy is Michael's best friend, Michael is allowed bubble gum, which makes Billy jealous and envious, Billy often tries to get some bubble gum, however his parents refuse to give him some. =Poshy/Oswald= Poshy or Oswald was Billy's kitten, Audrey and Billy both originally referred him to a he at first, But after Audrey took the cat down to a woman's house. It was then realised Poshy/Oswald was now a girl, she only appears in three episodes. In the episode 'Open Wide', Poshy escaped from the Bradshaws home and ran to (possibly) Winefred Dutton's and never appeared again, Billy and Audrey were both worried. Alf in a selfish way, was pleased that Poshy had run away. She did make a cameo in the end of Audrey Tries Her Luck, where when Alf was making a depressed Audrey a brew, saw through the window Oswald with a scruffy tom cat. sitting on the wall. He then jokingly said Hey up! Oswald's found his dad. =The Dog= The Dog is nameless, it is not a major character in the series but is still used in the house. The dog appears to be a brindle Bull Terrier, the dog usually wears Alf's hats, seeing that he puts them on it; it turns its head to see what goes in the house and appears to \\"threaten\\" Poshy, the kitten. Minor characters The minor characters are never heard to speak (although Michael occasionally announces his presence with his mouth organ). =Michael Morris= Michael Morris is Billy Bradshaw's best friend, he wears a pair of Clinic Glasses for his lazy eye(or as Alf calls it 'friendly eyes' because they keep looking at each other). Michael is based on a school friend of Buzz Hawkins (who was also called Michael Morris).The Bradshaws Live Show at the Lowry =Betty Morris= Betty Morris is the mother of Michael Morris. She is having an affair with the coal man (although Audrey refuses to believe this). Betty and Audrey often love to go out for a game of housey housey (bingo). =Mr Morris= Mr Morris is the Father of Michael Morris (although Michael's real father is the Coalman), Mr Morris is tight-fisted and bald, he has stolen Alf's tools several times. =Uncle Wally One-Ball= Uncle Walter is Audrey's Uncle, he got a Gunshot to a 'sensitive' area in The Great War and now drags his leg, he used to go by the stage name Bert Scroginbottom he played the banjolele and wrote his own songs. He was destined for stardom but he accidentally left his kitbag in the NAAFI with all his songs inside and it was stolen by a buck- toothed private named Formby.The Bradshaws Live show at the Lowry =Pamela= Auntie Pamela is Audrey's sister. She is constantly knitting tank tops for Billy and Alf although they never fit properly. As a matter of fact, Alf wears one that she knitted for Billy. Pamela also makes knitted swimming trunks for Billy. Although Pamela and Alf are often trying new ways to annoy each other, there is a rumour that they like each other. In one episode she keeps calling Alf Alfred. =God= God features in many episodes. According to Alf (who should not be believed as he is an agnostic) the moon is a hole in the sky for God to spy on people and the sun is his reading light. He turns it on for filling in his diary. God seems to show a strong dislike for Alf, as shown by the numerous times that bad things happen to him. This may be because Alf kept some rude magazines that Audrey told Alf to bin.

It was invented by Witold Litwin in 1980. It has been analyzed by Baeza-Yates and Soza-Pollman. It is the first in a number of schemes known as dynamic hashing such as Larson's Linear Hashing with Partial Extensions, Linear Hashing with Priority Splitting, Linear Hashing with Partial Expansions and Priority Splitting, or Recursive Linear Hashing. The file structure of a dynamic hashing data structure adapts itself to changes in the size of the file, so expensive periodic file reorganization is avoided. A Linear Hashing file expands by splitting a pre-determined bucket into two and contracts by merging two predetermined buckets into one. The trigger for a reconstruction depends on the flavor of the scheme; it could be an overflow at a bucket or load factor (number of records over the number of buckets) moving outside of a predetermined range. Linear Hashing has also been made into a scalable distributed data structure, LH*. In LH*, each bucket resides at a different server. LH* itself has been expanded to provide data availability in the presence of failed buckets. Key based operations (inserts, deletes, updates, reads) in LH and LH* take maximum constant time independent of the number of buckets and hence of records. Algorithm details Records in LH or LH* consists of a key and a content, the latter basically all the other attributes of the record. They are stored in buckets. For example, in Ellis' implementation, a bucket is a linked list of records. The file allows the key based CRUD operations create or insert, read, update, and delete as well as a scan operations that scans all records, for example to do a database select operation on a non-key attribute. Records are stored in buckets whose numbering starts with 0. =Hash functions= In order to access a record with key c, a family of hash functions, called collectively a dynamic hash function is applied to the key c. At any time, at most two hash functions h_i and h_{i+1} are used. A typical example uses the division modulo x operation. If the original number of buckets is N, then the family of hash functions is h_i(c) \\\\mapsto c \\\\pmod{N \\\\cdot 2^i} =File expansion= As the file grows through insertions, it expands gracefully through the splitting of one bucket into two buckets. The sequence of buckets to split is predetermined. This is the fundamental difference to schemes like Fagin's extendible hashing. For the two new buckets, the hash function h_i is replaced with h_{i+1}. The number of the bucket to be split is part of the file state and called the split pointer s. =Split control= A split can be performed whenever a bucket overflows. This is an uncontrolled split. Alternatively, the file can monitor the load factor and performs a split whenever the load factor exceeds a threshold. This was controlled splitting. =Addressing= Addressing is based on the file state, consisting of the split pointer s and the level l. If the level is l, then the hash functions used are h_l and h_{l+1}. The LH algorithm for hashing key c is a := h_l(c) if a =Splitting= When a bucket is split, split pointer and possibly the level are updated according to s := s+1 if s \\\\ge N\\\\times 2^l: l+=1, s=0 =File contraction= If under controlled splitting the load factor sinks below a threshold, a merge operation is triggered. The merge operation undoes the last split, also resetting the file state. =File state calculation= The file state consists of split pointer s and level l. If the original file started with N=1 buckets, then the number of buckets n and the file state are related via n = 2^l+s =LH*= The main contribution of LH* is to allow a client of an LH* file to find the bucket where the record resides even if the client does not know the file state. Clients in fact store their version of the file state, which is initially just the knowledge of the first bucket, namely Bucket 0. Based on their file state, a client calculates the address of a key and sends a request to that bucket. At the bucket, the request is checked and if the record is not at the bucket, it is forwarded. In a reasonably stable system, that is, if there is only one split or merge going on while the request is processed, it can be shown that there are at most two forwards. After a forward, the final bucket sends an Image Adjustment Message to the client whose state is now closer to the state of the distributed file. While forwards are reasonably rare for active clients, their number can be even further reduced by additional information exchange between servers and clients Adoption in language systems Griswold and Townsend discussed the adoption of linear hashing in the Icon language. They discussed the implementation alternatives of dynamic array algorithm used in linear hashing, and presented performance comparisons using a list of Icon benchmark applications. Adoption in database systems Linear hashing is used in the Berkeley database system (BDB), which in turn is used by many software systems such as OpenLDAP, using a C implementation derived from the CACM article and first published on the Usenet in 1988 by Esmond Pitt.

Like all hares and rabbits, it is a member of the family Leporidae of order Lagomorpha. It is a solitary individual except where several males court a female in the breeding season. Litters of four to five young are born in a form, a shallow depression in the ground, hidden among vegetation. This jackrabbit has two described subspecies: L. townsendii townsendii occurring west of the Rocky Mountains and L. townsendii campanius occurring east of the Rocky Mountains. Description The white-tailed jackrabbit is a large species of hare and the largest species called \\"jackrabbit\\", although two larger hares (the Arctic and Alaskan hares) are found further north in North America. This jackrabbit has an adult length of , including a tail measuring , and a weight between . From winter to spring, weight tends to increase due to pregnancy in females, but decrease due to the stresses of reproductive competition in males. Thus, females in Iowa went from averaging in winter to in spring and males from averaging in winter to in spring.Kline, P. D. (1963). Notes on the biology of the jackrabbit in Iowa. Proc. Iowa Acad. Sci, 70, 196-204. At the northernmost extremity of its range, it can be almost twice as large as in the middle of its range. In Saskatchewan, rare specimens have been recorded over . It has distinctive, large, grey ears with black tips which are chestnut brown and white on the inside; and the long, powerful hind legs characteristic of hares. The back, flanks and limbs are dark brown or greyish- brown and the underparts are pale grey. The ear, from the notch, measures from and the hindfoot measures . The tail is white with a dark central stripe above. Females are slightly larger than males. In northern populations, this hare moults in the autumn and becomes white all over except for its ears. They generally make no sound, but will emit a shrill scream if they are injured or caught. Distribution and habitat The white-tailed jackrabbit is native to western and central parts of North America. Its range includes British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario in Canada and Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois in the United States. It is found in plains and prairie and in alpine meadows with scattered coniferous trees up to an elevation of about 3,000 m (10,000 ft) in Colorado. The white-tailed jackrabbit is slightly larger than the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and where their ranges overlap, they are segregated by their habitat, as the former tends to live in higher altitudes and the latter in more arid lowland habitats. Whitetails are often seen in urban parks and on suburban parks in Western Canada. People often come across bunnies alone during the day in spring and mistakenly assume they are abandoned by their mothers. The Edmonton Humane Society has issued public statements asking that bunnies not be brought into animal shelters. White-tailed jackrabbit in the snow at Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge (Wyoming) Behaviour Great Sand Dunes National Park The white-tailed jackrabbit is nocturnal and lies up during the day in a form, a shallow depression in the ground hidden under vegetation, emerging at dusk to feed. The forms of this species range from long, wide, and up to deep.Jackson, H.H.T. 1961. Mammals of Wisconsin. University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 504. Often, discernible paths lead away from the form and others among the plants at often-visited feeding sites. In winter snow, the forms are interconnecting, cave-like structures. This jackrabbit is a solitary species and feeds on grasses and other green plants, including cultivated crops. In southern Colorado, from summer through fall into winter, the diet varied from 70% (summer) to 4% (winter) forbs, 43% (fall) to 4% (winter) grasses and 76% (winter) to 7% (summer) scrubs. During the winter its diet includes buds, twigs and bark feed on off of low shrubs. It tends to be more selective in its feeding habits than the black-tailed jackrabbit which disadvantages it where their ranges overlap. It has good eyesight, excellent hearing, and sensitive whiskers and is probably able to detect olfactory clues as to whether another jackrabbit is ready to breed. The breeding season is variable and depends upon latitude and environmental factors; it extends from February to July in different parts of the range. Several males may compete aggressively for the attention of a female by charging at each other, leaping, and jostling. Ovulation by the female takes place after copulation. The gestation period is about 42 days and in preparation for the birth, the female prepares a fur-lined nest under dense vegetation. A litter consists of up to 11 young, although four or five is a more typical number. The leverets weigh about . They have their eyes open and are fully furred at birth and soon begin to move around. They start to forage around two weeks old and are weaned at four weeks. They are sexually mature around seven months old, but do not breed until the year after their birth. Ecology White-tailed jackrabbits influence the composition of the turf through their selective grazing activities. They are important prey species for various mammalian predators. Red (Vulpes vulpes) and grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) occasionally capture one, though not many large adults. They are perhaps most important prey for mid-sized carnivores such as the American badger (Taxidea taxus), the coyote (Canis latrans), and the bobcat (Lynx rufus) and small supplemental prey for larger ones such as the mountain lion (Puma concolor) and the gray wolf (Canis lupus).Lim, B. K. (1987). Lepus townsendii. Mammalian Species, (288), 1-6. Snakes sometimes attack them (usually young ones) and bird predators include eagles, hawks, and owls. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are the only avian predators large enough to regularly take full-grown white-tailed jackrabbits, though ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) may occasionally take an adult, though these latter two species and other largish raptorial birds typically attack young.Olendorff, Richard R.

They attempt to evade detection by crouching in the vegetation where their cryptic colouration makes them difficult to observe. They may slink away, but if detected, they bound away at speed, adopting a zigzag course. They can run up to 55 km/hr (34 mi/hr) and leap up to . They are also hunted and eaten by humans. Status The white-tailed jackrabbit is assessed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN in its Red List of Threatened Species because it has an extensive range and is fairly common across most of its range. The population size may be declining slightly, but not at a rate that would justify listing this hare in a more threatened category. In Wyoming, however, it has become scarce in Grand Teton National Park, where it has not been seen recently. Briefly reputed to have been extirpated in Yellowstone National Park, where it was at one time abundant, it is now clear from observations, roadkilled specimens, and historical records that white-tailed jackrabbits are still present in the park. The causes of the decline in populations in Wyoming is unclear.

She later served in the Ohio and New York naval militias and on the Great Lakes until decommissioned in 1940. Civilian yacht The steam yacht Hermione was designed by Glasgow naval architect George L. Watson and built by Fleming & Ferguson, Paisley, Scotland, in 1891 for James and Richard Allan of the Allen Line, Glasgow. In June 1895 she was chartered to the American businessman Robert Goelet. The yacht was later sold to the American politician and manufacturer, Henry L. Pierce. Spanish–American War Hermione was purchased by the United States Navy on 2 April 1898, renamed Hawk, and commissioned three days later, Lt. John Hood in command. She sailed from Key West in late April 1898 to join the North Atlantic Squadron in blockading Cuba during the Spanish–American War. On 23 May she accompanied Admiral Sampson's flagship out from Key West. Two weeks later she attacked and destroyed enemy ship Alphonso XII, which carried cargo for Cuba. In late summer she departed for Norfolk where she decommissioned on 14 September 1898. Naval militia service Recommissioned in 1900, she was loaned to the Ohio Naval Militia where she served for nine years.

Kol (died about 1173) was a Swedish prince who, together with his brother Burislev was a contender for the throne of Sweden from 1167 until his violent death a few years later. The struggle was a stage in the rivalry between the House of Sverker, to which Kol and Burislev belonged, and the House of Eric. Background In most older literature Kol is called Kol Sverkersson, based on an unverifiable assumption that he was a son of King Sverker I of Sweden. The only source that says anything about his parentage is, however, a medieval genealogy copied by Olaus Petri in the 16th century: \\"Suercherus Rex senior ... genuit Carolum Regem et Johannem ducem et Sunonem Sijk ... Johannes dux genuit Koll Regem, Ubbe fortem et Burislevum Regem\\".Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters äldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 341. In other words, the genealogy claims he was a grandson of Sverker and a son of Prince John, and that his brothers were Ubbe the Strong and King Burislev. digitized July 9, 2008 A medieval list of donations indicates that the mother of Kol was called Ragnhild. She might have been a relative of the jarl Guttorm who donated land to Vreta Abbey on her behalf.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Till frågan om den äldsta Erikskulten i Sverige\\", Historisk tidskrift 68, 1948, p. 318. The suggestion that he was a son of Sverker is based on a Danish source which mentions that Sverker had a son Boleslaw (Burislev). This son has been identified by some historians (such as Nathanael Beckman in Svenskt biografiskt lexikon) as the throne contender by the same name, and thus Kol has also been assigned Sverker I for a father. Strife for kingship Prince John was killed in an incident by the Swedish peasantry around 1152. Since he was a young man at his death, his sons must still have been infants. Kol's uncle Charles VII of Sweden was killed by Canute I of Sweden on Visingsö in 1167. Now Kol was recognized at least in parts of Sweden, presumably in Östergötland which was the basis of the dynasty's power. He held the throne in opposition to Canute for a few years, in tandem with his brother or uncle Burislev. The short chronicle of the Westrogothic law relates the few known details: \\"[King Canute I] won Sweden with his sword and killed King Kol and King Burislev, and had many battles against Sweden and was victorious in them all\\".Mats G. Larsson, Götarnas riken: Upptäcktsfärder till Sveriges enande. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 185. A little more is known about Kol from medieval donation lists. He owned land in Frönäs on Öland and donated it to his mother Ragnhild, who in turn gave it to Vreta Abbey when she entered the abbey as a nun. A papal letter from 1171 or 1172 mentions a \\"K.\\" who was king of the Swedes and Geats; it is not clear whether Kol or Canute (Knut) is meant.Hans Gillingstam, \\"Kol\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=11708 Kol was probably killed in battle or murdered by Canute's men around 1173. A 14th-century source claims that he was killed at Bjälbo. After his death, his kinsfolk donated land to Vreta Abbey for his soul, indicating that they were able to keep properties after Canute's victory.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters äldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 321. Though some sources affirm that Kol actually was King of Sweden for a few years, the Swedish Royal Court does not recognize him as such in its official list of rulers.

This allows them to respond to an emergency call faster, as they arrive at the fire engine faster than by using a standard staircase. The fire pole was invented in the 1870s by David Kenyon, in Chicago, Illinois.  Overview  The fireman's pole is found in multi-level fire stations, if the firefighters' living quarters are located upstairs. When they are dispatched to an emergency, the firefighters descend to the ground floor, put on their firefighting gear, and board the fire engine as quickly as possible. The pole may run through a hole in the floor, or it may be accessed from a balcony. To use a pole, a firefighter grasps it with their hands, then clamps their legs around it, and then replaces their tight hand grip with a looser hand or arm grip to allow themselves to descend, using their legs to control the speed. This is somewhat similar to the technique used for fast-roping.  History  Vancouver firemen using firepoles to leave their dormitory, 1910 Until 1878, spiral staircases or sliding chutes were common, but not particularly fast. Fire houses were also equipped with spiral staircases so horses would not try to climb the stairs into the living quarters. Captain David B. Kenyon of Chicago's all-black Engine Company No. 21 worked in a three-story fire station. The ground floor contained the firefighting equipment, the floor above was for recreation and sleeping, and the top floor was the hayloft to store the winter supply of hay for the fire engines' horses. During transport, the hay was secured to a wagon using a wooden binding pole, which was stored in the hayloft when not in use. Firefighter George Reid slid down the pole to respond to a call for help once, which inspired Kenyon to create a permanent pole. In 1878 Kenyon convinced his chief to make the necessary hole in the building and install the pole, after agreeing to pay for any necessary maintenance. The company crafted a pole out of a Georgia pine beam by shaving and sanding it into a 3-inch diameter pole which they gave several coats of varnish and a coat of paraffin. Despite being the butt of many jokes, others soon realized Company 21 was usually the first company to arrive when called, especially at night, and the chief of the department ordered the poles to be installed in all Chicago fire stations. In 1880 the first brass pole was installed in the Worcester Fire Department.  Safety issues  Firepoles in a fire station in Munich Losing one's grip on the pole can result in falling from a great height; the firefighter may hit an object such as a door extending from a truck; poor speed control can result in injured or even broken legs upon impact with the floor; and burns can occur due to friction if the skin rubs against the pole. If the pole runs through an unprotected hole in the floor, there is a risk of a person falling through it, as well as exhaust fumes rising into the living quarters. For these reasons, fire stations built since the 1970s are often built with the living quarters downstairs, and some older fire stations have had their poles removed. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association has called for the removal of all poles from US fire stations due to safety hazards. The fire service in New Zealand has already removed most of them. However, due to the strong tradition, time advantages and new safety features, poles are common worldwide even in newly built stations. Slide poles can be made safer. Cushions can be placed around the base of the pole to soften landings. Exhaust control systems can stop fumes from rising upstairs. To prevent accidental falls, the pole can be guarded by railings, baskets, a door or a weight- activated trapdoor that opens only when weight is applied to the pole.  Other uses  Firepoles are seen in popular films, including Ghostbusters and Bridget Jones's Diary feature, and in the Batman 1960s TV series, where they appear in Batman's Wayne Manor as access to the Batcave below. In the Korean sitcom High Kick!, Lee Min Yong's room is connected with the rest of the house by a fireman's pole. A fireman's pole was an important prop in the set of The Dean Martin Show. The show always began with Dean Martin using it to descend onto the stage. In season one of the Disney Channel television series JONAS, the Lucas family lives in a converted fire station in New Jersey, complete with three firepoles that connect the studio space of Kevin, Joe, and Nick Lucas (the fictional band JONAS) with the family space on a lower level of the house. Some airbases in Germany were also equipped with firemen's poles to expedite travel from second-floor ready rooms to their aircraft in the event of a scramble. The military and law enforcement tactical teams also use a similar sliding descent, known as fast-roping, to quickly descend from helicopters on large-diameter ropes. Gloves must be worn to prevent friction burns. Firemen's poles are also major gameplay elements in such video games as Montezuma's Revenge, Oxygen Not Included, and the second Commander Keen trilogy. Small – in diameter and height – poles are a common element in children’s playground equipment. Pole dancers and acrobats show similar gliding down on poles with typically less diameter.

He acted in concert with his kinsman Kol against King Canute I of Sweden, then head of the House of Eric. The two pretenders, who were brothers, half-brothers, or uncle and nephew, may never have controlled much more than the Province of Östergötland, which was the base of the dynasty. Boleslaw is believed either to have been murdered by King Canute's men, or to have fled to Poland in or before 1173. Background Boleslaw was a descendant of the old King Sverker I of Sweden (d. 1156), but the exact pedigree is not clear. Sverker married, as his second wife, Richeza of Poland. From this marriage a son called Bulizlaus (Boleslaw, Burislev) was born, as apparent from a Danish administrative document. He was named for his maternal grandfather Bolesław III Wrymouth. Older Swedish historians, such as Natanael Beckman who wrote a biographical article in Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, therefore claimed that Boleslaw and Kol were sons of Sverker. However, according to a medieval genealogy, Boleslaw, Kol and a third brother called Ubbe the Strong were in fact the sons of King Sverker I's son John. On the basis of this, Swedish historians such as Nils Ahnlund and Adolf Schück have claimed instead that there were two different Boleslaw, uncle and nephew; thus the contenders were indeed sired by John, who died a young man in c. 1152.in \\"Från Viby till Bjälbo, studier i Sveriges historia under 100-talets senare hälft\\", Fornvännen 1951 p. 199 A medieval list of monastic donations indicates that a certain Ragnhild was the mother of Kol and probably Boleslaw, and consequently the wife of John. She is known to have survived him and presumably raised her children during the turbulent years following John's and Sverker I's deaths, before entering Vreta Abbey as a nun.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Till frågan om den äldsta Erikskulten i Sverige\\", Historisk tidskrift 68, 1948, p. 318. Civil war Boleslaw is mentioned in the regnal list appended to Västgötalagen together with Kol: \\"King Canute I won Sweden with his sword and killed King Kol and King Burislev, and had many battles against Sweden and was victorious in them all.\\"Mats G. Larsson, Götarnas riken: Upptäcktsfärder till Sveriges enande. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 185. Otherwise, he appears in fewer medieval sources than his brother whose name occurs in several king- lists. According to annotations by the 17th-century scholar Johannes Messenius, Kol fell in battle, but Boleslaw continued the struggle against Canute with some success. However, when he carelessly stayed at the mansion of Bjälbo he was assaulted by Canute's troops and killed. Still later traditions have it that Kol and then Boleslaw were killed in battle at Blodåkrarna (the Blood Fields) close to Bjälbo, in 1169.Adolf Schück, \\"Från Viby till Bjälbo, studier i Sveriges historia under 100-talets senare hälft\\", Fornvännen 1951 p. 212. Most probably, however, the struggle came to an end in 1172–73, since Canute reportedly reigned for 23 years after his victory.Mats G. Larsson, Götarnas riken: Upptäcktsfärder till Sveriges enande.

This hypothesis is based on an annal entry which mentions a Princess Cecilia, mother of Eric the Saint, as the sister of Kol and Ulf (Ubbe).

It was described by John O. Westwood in 1854 and has worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical habitats, including India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Puerto Rico. Description In the male, the head, thorax and abdomen are clothed with light and dark brown hair. Forewings are reddish brown with the veins streaked with black. The interspaces with pale streaks, more or less fuscous suffusion on outer area. Hindwings are smoky brown. Wings rather short and broad. Ecology The characteristic of the species is that it spins its cocoon all its larval life, decorating it with small twigs, bark and thorns from the trees on which it feeds. (For this reason, it is sometimes known as the large faggot worm). After hatching, the larva climbs to the top of its host tree and begins feeding on the tender shoots. The Eumeta crameri larva renovates its case three times during the two- to three-month larval stage, doing it progressively faster each time. Case renovation consists of replacing the twigs and thorns that make up the case with longer materials, with one piece noticeably longer than the others. The larva approaches 3 cm in length when entering the pupa stage. Adult male moths are reddish brown with wings. Females lay about 500 eggs that incubate for 10 to 15 days. As the larvae grow, they prefer older leaves and bark of a variety of hosts: acacia (wattle), tea, mimosa, Australian pine, eucalyptus, gmelina, lychee, thuja, Rangoon creeper, strawberry guava and many other species. Some host species of commercial significance, such as acacia and tea, are particularly susceptible to Eumeta crameri. As a result, this species is frequently dealt with as a pest. Some plantations are treated with aerial insecticides to protect the host plants. Plantation environments are more susceptible to the larvae than natural habitats.

It is the second book in his The Icewind Dale Trilogy. Plot summary Following the events of The Crystal Shard, Bruenor leads his friends Drizzt Do'Urden, the barbarian Wulfgar, and a surprisingly enthusiastic Regis, on a quest to reclaim Mithril Hall, the ancient stronghold of his clan. However, Regis has an ulterior motive for coming along; namely to elude the dangerous assassin Artemis Entreri, sent by Pasha Pook of Calimshan to recover the magical ruby that Regis stole from him. Just as the companions are setting out, Entreri arrives in Ten-Towns, soon locating Regis' abandoned home and finding Catti- brie there. The young woman finds herself hopelessly outmatched and paralyzed by fear, telling him all about Regis and the companions' quest. Entreri allows her to live, confident that she will not dare to interfere with his plans. Afraid for her friends, and desperate to regain her honor, she follows after both the companions and Entreri, hoping to warn her friends. On the way to Luskan, Entreri realizes that he is being followed and captures Catti-brie again, this time taking her along as a prisoner to use against the companions. Meanwhile, the companions reach Luskan, and seek out a map of the Northlands to aid in their quest. However, Dendybar the Mottled — an ambitious wizard from the Hosttower of the Arcane — has heard of the Crystal Shard and believes that Drizzt still possesses it, and plots to take it for his own ends. He forges an uneasy alliance with Entreri so that both may achieve their goals, and sends his apprentice Sydney with Entreri, along with his golem (Bok) and a soldier named Jierdan. The companions travel across the Northlands towards Silverymoon, encountering barbarian tribes, an eccentric wizard family (the Harpells) and the soldiers of Nesme, who react to Drizzt with hostility, forcing the companions to divert across the Evermoors, also known as the Trollmoors, an ordeal that almost makes an end of them. Upon reaching Silverymoon, Drizzt is again shunned, but the companions are directed by Lady Alustriel to the Herald's Holdfast, where they obtain the final clues to the location of Mithril Hall. During her time as a captive, Catti-brie slowly overcomes her fear of Entreri, and begins to play on the volatile relationships between Entreri and his allies, creating an opportunity for her to escape as the evil group closes in on the companions. Reunited with her friends, Catti-brie accompanies them into the ancient Dwarven stronghold, discovering that the duergar who forced Bruenor's clan out are still there, working the mines for their own ends. Within the upper chambers of Mithril Hall, the two groups clash, and Drizzt and Entreri find themselves face-to- face. The meeting between Drizzt and Entreri marks the beginning of a long- running and deadly feud between the two. The two warriors are evenly matched in battle, and each sees a twisted mirror image of himself in the other; Drizzt the drow with a human soul, and Entreri the human who should have been born a drow. During the battle, a cave-in separates the two groups but results in Drizzt and Entreri being trapped together deep in the complex. They are forced to work together to escape, an experience which heightens both their resentment of the other's ideology, and their respect for one another's prowess. Although initially tasked with the capture of Regis and the return of the ruby for his master Pasha Pook, Entreri finds himself so challenged by Drizzt's very existence that he later uses Guenhwyvar's statue, stolen from Drizzt, to further bait the drow into following him so that they can duel to find out who is the better warrior. Bruenor, Wulfgar, Regis and Catti-brie, believing Drizzt to have perished, continue their quest with heavy hearts; Bruenor decides that they will only scout the upper levels, and begins to doubt the wisdom of trying to retake Mithril Hall. They find the Hall of Dumathoin, recovering the magical bow Taulmaril (the Heartseeker) which later becomes Catti-brie's signature weapon. On their way out, they find themselves attacked by duergar, and forced into a battle with the shadow dragon Shimmergloom, the master of the duergar. It is only because of Bruenor's heroic sacrifice that the dragon is slain and his friends survive. Shortly afterwards, Drizzt is reunited with his friends, although Entreri takes advantage of the situation to finally capture Regis and make his escape, taunting Drizzt to follow him. The story ends with Catti-brie making arrangements for Clan Battlehammer to reclaim the hall, along with help from Wulfgar's tribe and the dwarves of Citadel Adbar, whilst Drizzt and Wulfgar begin their chase to rescue Regis from the clutches of Entreri.

Mellen's father was the local minister, and his mother the daughter of the first parish minister. He graduated from Harvard College in 1784. He moved to Barnstable, where he worked as a tutor for the family of James Otis Jr., and studied law with Shearjashub Bourne. He was admitted to the bar in 1788, and established a practice in Sterling. This was unsuccessful, and he next opened a practice in Bridgewater. There he met Sally Hudson of Hartford, Connecticut, whom he married in 1795. The couple had six children, four of whom survived him. Still not meeting with financial success, he briefly joined his brother's law practice in Dover, New Hampshire before finally settling in Biddeford in the Massachusetts District of Maine.

Marriage Conway was born at Brill, an English-garrisoned Cautionary Town near Rotterdam in the Netherlands, while her father Sir Edward Conway (later Viscount Conway) was Governor there. She was named in honour of the town. She married (as his fourth wife), Sir Robert Harley in 1623, who served as her father's aide in the Parliament of England, while her father was Secretary of State of England. Letters Some of Lady Harley's 375 letters to her husband and her son Sir Edward Harley survive and show her to be an educated literary woman, at home in several languages. She was able to keep her husband informed of local political affairs when he was absent from home at Brampton Bryan in northwest Herefordshire, attending Parliament or for other reasons, and organised the collection on information locally for the Parliamentary Committee on Scandalous Ministers. She was deeply religious, and her letters frequently repeat religious sentiments and encouraged her family in their chosen Puritan practices. The letters also contain passages relating to personal details of their family life. English Civil War During the English Civil War, in the absence of her husband and sons, Lady Harley defended her home, Brampton Bryan Castle, during a three- month siege by Royalist troops until the troops withdrew because they were needed at Gloucester. She then compelled her tenants to level the Royalist siege earthworks. She also dispatched 40 troops to raid a local Royalist camp at Knighton. Death Lady Harley died of a cold on 29 October 1643, after bravely defending her castle. This was probably as a result of the hardships endured during the siege.

A. Salvatore, the third book in The Icewind Dale Trilogy. Plot summary The dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden and Wulfgar the barbarian race to Calimport to rescue their friend Regis—who is being held as a captive, along with Drizzt's magical panther Guenhwyvar, by Artemis Entreri—and his stolen gem from the vengeance of Pasha Pook, Regis's former boss whom Regis betrayed by stealing his hypnotizing gem. While Drizzt and Wulfgar's chase continue, it is shown to us that Bruenor is not dead. It turns out that after Bruenor jumped onto the back of Shimmergloom, he survived the fall and fire due to having hold of Drizzt's scimitar, Icingdeath. Having been invulnerable to the fire, besting the dragon, he crawled back to the surface. Breunor then fails to sneak past the duergar and fights through scores of them before facing off against a giant spider. Lady Alustriel finds the poisoned and near-dead dwarf, heals him back to health, reunites him with Catti-brie and sends both of them after Drizzt and Wulfgar by supplying them with a burning chariot. Meanwhile, Drizzt and Wulfgar are on the sea, chasing Entreri by boat with the help of his good Captain Deudermont. In the middle of a fight with pirates, Bruenor and Catti- brie arrive and \\"The Companions of the Hall\\" are united once again. Later, the heroes arrive in Calimport and storm in into Pasha Pook's palace, only to find wererats, Pasha Pook's new-found allies led by Rassiter. Bruenor, Catti-brie and Wulfgar fight the horde of wererats while Drizzt finally duels Artemis Entreri. The two of them duel both in the sewers and in the streets of Calimport but the duel is left unfinished when the wounded Entreri, in an effort to escape, calls to everyone that Drizzt - who had been hiding his appearance with the help of a magical mask acquired earlier - is a drow. Bruenor, Catti-brie and Wulfgar come to the rescue of Drizzt, protecting him from the frightened and angry crowd. In the throne room, Pook imprisons Drizzt and his friends in Tarterus with the help of a demonic artifact called \\"The Taros Hoop\\". Just when there seems to be no hope, Regis comes along, taking the wand that controls the portal and helping his friends. Our heroes try a desperate attempt to break free from the demodands but Catti-brie becomes unconscious, floating in the air because of the circular plane that is Tarterus. Drizzt sends everyone and rescues Catti-brie by fighting savagely with hordes of demodands. In the end, Pasha Pook dies by the claws of the freed Guenhwyar, the six companions are united once again, soldiers from the surrounding dwarven kingdoms, barbarian tribes, and human cities reclaim Mithral Halls and all turns out well. Entreri is still alive and plans his vengeance against Drizzt. The novel holds several key events and introduces a number of important characters like Captain Deudermont of the Sea Sprite. Also, this novel is the starting of Drizzt's romantic feelings for Catti-brie- he even kisses her during Drizzt's rescue in the demonic plane (although Catti-brie was unconscious at that time.)

A. Salvatore. The first book in The Icewind Dale Trilogy, it was his first published novel. Plot summary Even in the remote far northern region of Icewind Dale, the renegade dark elf ranger Drizzt Do'Urden is not fully accepted, except by the dwarves whom he had eventually befriended. He roams the tundra, hunting down yeti and giants that threaten the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. When the Dale's native barbarians band together to slaughter the people of Ten-Towns, whom they view as invaders, Drizzt, with his drow stealth and ranger's knowledge of the terrain, discerns their plan and relays the information to his friends, the halfling Regis and the dwarf Bruenor. Regis, on the council of Ten-Towns, uses persuasion and a magical hypnotic ruby pendant to convince the stubborn leaders of the towns to work together to thwart the barbarian attack. Because of the warning and their unified efforts, Ten-Towns and the dwarves successfully repel the barbarian attackers. Drizzt personally meets the barbarian king, Heafstaag, in combat. He wounds Heafstaag many times, including a stab to the stomach that should have been fatal, but the king manages to survive and escape after wounding Drizzt. Meanwhile, Bruenor clashes with a young barbarian standard bearer, who breaks the shaft of his banner over the dwarf's head to no effect. Bruenor then slams the youth with his shield, rendering him unconscious. After the battle, Bruenor saves him from being killed in cold blood by the townspeople, instead taking the young man, Wulfgar, son of (the late) Beornegar into his care. Bruenor also defends the wounded and unconscious Drizzt, slamming Kemp to the ground and breaking the nose of his lieutenant when he finds them kicking the injured drow. Bruenor tells the people of Ten Towns that if not for Drizzt Do'Urden, they would now be dead, which grants Drizzt a measure of acceptance and respect in Icewind Dale. Five years pass, with Wulfgar indentured to the dwarves. Bruenor teaches him to smith and mine, and comes to love him like a son. Though Wulfgar initially resents the dwarves and his indenture, he grows to respect and even love Bruenor, like his own father who had died years past. During this time, the failed wizard Akar Kessel, left to die in the Spine of the World, finds Crenshinibon, the Crystal Shard, a magical, sentient crystal with the ability to lend power to its wielder, make tower sanctuaries in the likeness of itself, and insinuate itself into the minds of others, including that of its wielder. Crenshinibon, obsessed with gaining power, twists Akar Kessel's mind into doing its will. Kessel, oblivious to the manipulation, decides to conquer Icewind Dale for his own. He enslaves the goblins and orcs of the nearby mountains, building them into his own army, their wills completely destroyed by Crenshinibon. He even manages to gain control of Heafstaag, and through him the tribes of barbarians. He also acquires the services of a balor demon named Errtu to be his general, though the demon has more interest in obtaining Crenshinibon for himself than in serving Akar Kessel. Near the end of Wulfgar's indenture, Bruenor forges Aegis-fang, a magical warhammer, for his adopted son. He then takes Wulfgar to be trained in the ways of battle, choosing Drizzt as the young man's instructor. Despite his ambivalence about training under a drow, Wulfgar quickly comes to respect and admire the dark elf, and Drizzt turns the young man into a formidable warrior. The two of them clear out an entire lair of verbeeg (the least of the giant species, around a height of ten feet), led by a frost giant named Biggrin with only the help of Drizzt's magical black panther companion Guenhwyvar. Wulfgar then leaves to hunt down a white dragon, Ingeloakastimizilian, more commonly known as Icingdeath. Drizzt tracks him, and the two of them kill the dragon. Drizzt finds a scimitar in the treasure hoard and claims it for his own, eventually naming it after the dragon. As Akar Kessel moves on Ten-Towns, his armies sweeping aside the disorganized defense with little trouble, Wulfgar takes the horns of Icingdeath and challenges Heafstaag for kingship. He wins the challenge, killing the old king. Drizzt, sensing the demon Errtu, and recognizing the balor from his days living in the deep underground drow city of Menzoberranzan, calls the demon and faces it alone with Guenhwyvar. With the aid of the fire-banishing properties of the scimitar Icingdeath, he manages to defeat Errtu, banishing it to the abyss for one hundred years. After defeating the demon, Drizzt uses his stealth and Guenhwyvar's unnatural eyes to find his way into the Crystal Tower, Cryshal-Tirith, where he fights his way past Akar Kessel's orcs and trolls to face the wizard himself. The wizard, sure of victory, imprisons the drow in a cage of magical light, and taunts him with images of the barbarians joining the battle for Ten-Towns, thinking that Heafstaag still led them. However, Wulfgar leads his people not against Ten-Towns, but against Kessel. With the help of Regis, a halfling prisoner in the tower, Drizzt escapes his cage, and follows Kessel through a portal to the top of a mountain. There, after a short battle, the magical heat of Crenshinibon destabilizes the snow cap, and an avalanche kills Kessel and takes Drizzt back down the mountain. Crenshinibon, buried under the avalanche and blocked from the light of the sun (its power source) and weakened by Regis' destruction of Cryshal-Tirth, loses its control over the remaining orcs and goblins, who are ultimately slaughtered. Bruenor, faking mortal injury, tricks Drizzt into agreeing to search for Mithral Hall, Bruenor's boyhood home. Development In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then managing editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but asked if he could rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in a different part of the Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was \\"set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I thought that was the Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north.\\" Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said \\"not a chance\\". Reception Banophernalia gave 3 stars for The Crystal Shard.

More recently, V. Laurent (\\"L'Assassinat d'Alexis IV, empereur de Trebizonde\\", Archeion Pontou, 20 (1955), pp. 131-143) has narrowed the date of his death to September/October 1429. He was the son of Emperor Manuel III and Gulkhan-Eudokia of Georgia.  Reign  Alexios IV had been associated in authority and given the title of despotes by his father as early as 1395. Nevertheless, the two quarreled as Alexios was impatient to assume supreme power; William Miller compared this to \\"the first three sovereigns of the House of Hanover\\" for whom \\"the heir- apparent always quarrelled with his father.\\"William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 73 When his father died in 1417, Alexios was accused by some of having expedited his death. Alexios inherited a conflict with the Genoese, who defeated the fleet of Trebizond and seized a local monastery, which they converted into a fortress. By 1418 he had signed a peace agreement and paid reparations to the Genoese until 1422. A new dispute arose over the emperor's obligations in 1425 and was not resolved until 1428. Relations with the Republic of Venice were generally better.Miller, Trebizond, p. 79 After the death of Tamerlane, most of Asia Minor descended into chaos. Kara Yusuf, ruler of the Kara Koyunlu or \\"Black Sheep\\" Turks, devastated much of Armenia and defeated the Emir of Arsinga and the chieftain of the Ak Koyunlu or White Sheep Turks. Alexios sought to avoid hostility by marrying off daughters to his powerful Muslim neighbors. One daughter was married to Kara Yusuf's son Jihan Shah in c.1420, and Alexios agreed to pay his son-in-law the same amount of tribute that had previously been due to Tamerlane.Miller, Trebizond, p. 80 Another daughter was possibly married to Ali, son of Kara Yülük Osman, the ruler of Ak Koyunlu, though Osman himself was likely the groom. Alexios' marital policy also extended to his Christian neighbors, and his daughter Maria of Trebizond was married off to the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos in 1428. According to George Finlay, Alexios IV spent much of his time in pursuit of pleasure and accomplished relatively little,Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 398 although there is no evidence in contemporary sources for this claim. Following tradition, he granted his eldest son, John IV, the courtly title of despotes in 1417. Despite this, relations deteriorated between father and son, and in 1426 John murdered Alexios' Treasurer, alleging an affair between him and the Empress Theodora Kantakouzene. He also attempted to kill his parents but the nobles intervened and prevented him, and John fled to Georgia.Miller, Trebizond, p. 81 When Alexios IV's wife Theodora died in 1426, he was so distraught that Bessarion wrote him no less than three , which help to shed some light on this otherwise dark period lacking in sources. Due to John's disloyalty and usurpation, Alexios IV made his younger son Alexander of Trebizond despotes. Eventually John left Georgia for the Genoese colony at Caffa, where he enlisted a galley and its crew to help him recover his position in Trebizond. One day in October 1429, the galley and its crew landed John near Trebizond; Alexios IV marched out to meet his son, only to be murdered during the night by nobles who had been won over by John.Miller, Trebizond, p. 82 Alexander fled Trebizond; the Venetian traveller Pero Tafur encountered him in Constantinople around October of that year, living with his sister Maria.A. Vasiliev, \\"Pero Tafur, a Spanish Traveler of the Fifteenth Century and his Visit to Constantinople, Trebizond, and Italy\\", Byzantion, 7 (1932), p. 98 According to a new publication, he was killed in 1428. Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorlugu\\" Vol.3 (2018) pp.165-173 ()  Burial  According to Anthony Bryer, John IV felt remorse for his father's death and one of the three indications Bryer provides is a free-standing tomb he had constructed outside of the Chrysokephalos cathedral, into which he moved his father's remains from its burial spot inside the cathedral.Bryer, \\"'The faithless Kabazitai and Scholarioi'\\", in Maistor: Classical, Byzantine and Renaissance Studies for Robert Browning, Ann Moffatt editor Byzantina Australiensa, 5 (1984), p. 324 Due to a Turkish tradition that the tomb housed the body of a Turkish hero of the last siege of Trebizond, it was spared until 1918. In 1916, during the Russian occupation of Trebizond, Fyodor Uspensky excavated the tomb, finding one skeleton facing face, and a second one interred afterwards. The older skeleton Bryer, following Uspenskij's report, identified as Alexios'.Bryer, \\"'The faithless Kabazitai'\\", p. 325 On the Russian withdrawal from Trebizond, the older skeleton was entrusted to Chrysanthos Philippides, then Metropolitan of Trebizond; the tomb outside the Chrysokephalos was destroyed by the Turks. During the 1923 Exchange of Populations, Chaldian antiquary George Kandilaptes collected as much of these bones and brought them to Greece, where they were stored in the Byzantine Museum in Athens. Then in 1980 the remains of Alexios IV Megas Komnenos were brought with much ceremony to a final resting place in New Soumela, near Kastania in Imathia. Bryer comments that \\"Alexios IV's is probably the only surviving skeleton of a Byzantine emperor\\", only to correct himself in a footnote that the remains of St Theodora, John Tzimiskes, and the thirteenth- century Dukai of the Despotate of Epirus might also survive.Bryer, \\"'The faithless Kabazitai'\\", p. 326 and n. 58  Marriage and children  In 1395, Alexios married Theodora Kantakouzene. They would have at least five children:Michel Kuršanskis, \\"La descendance d'Alexis IV, empereur de Trébizonde. Contribution à la prosopographie des Grands Comnènes\\", Revue des études byzantines, 37 (1979), p. 247 *John IV of Trebizond (c. 1403 - 1459). *Maria of Trebizond (c. 1404 - 1439).

Married Jahan Shah. Two further daughters have been attributed to Alexios by later genealogists; however, both have also been attributed to John IV by other genealogists. Michel Kuršanskis has argued these marriages never really happened, and their existence is based on a misreading of an interpolation to Chalcondyles.Kuršanskis, \\"La descendance d'Alexis IV\\", pp. 244f These daughters are: *Theodora of Trebizond, wife of Ali Beyg of the Ak Koyunlu. *Eudokia-Valenza of Trebizond, wife of Niccolò Crispo, Lord of Syros.

An Eclipse Award Trophy is presented to the winner in each division that is made by a few small selected American foundries with expertise in studio bronze casting. It is then mounted on the hand-crafted native Kentucky walnut base to comprise the Eclipse Award on which a brass plate recites the award winner. The equivalent in Australia is the Australian Thoroughbred racing awards, in Canada the Sovereign Awards, and in Europe, the Cartier Racing Awards. 1971–present The Eclipse Awards were created by three independent bodies in 1971 to honor the champions of the sport.Thoroughbred Racing Associations Although widely viewed as a national standard, they are not an official national award as Thoroughbred racing in the United States has no sport governing body. The Eclipse Awards selections are made by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, Daily Racing Form and the National Turf Writers Association who select all finalists at the end of the year. Those same voters then vote any of the three finalists in each category. Winners are announced in January of the next year. J. B. Faulconer, the first full-time publicity director at Keeneland, is credited with starting the Eclipse Award program. The Lexington, Kentucky artist and sculptor Adalin Wichman designed the Eclipse Award, each of which is individually cast in the traditional lost wax method and is hand finished. The Eclipse Awards are supported by official partners which in recent years has expanded significantly and in 2019 The Jockey Club became one of them. 1936–1971 Prior to creation of the Eclipse Awards, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of America and the Daily Racing Form each published their own opinion of annual champions. 1887–1935 For more than a century, annual champions have been chosen by various bodies and these have been compiled and condensed with Eclipse Award winners by The Blood-Horse magazine.The Bloodhorse.com Champion's history charts Majority owner The Jockey Club states that \\"BloodHorse magazine is the flagship publication\\" and that its \\"mission is to serve the Thoroughbred owner and breeder with integrity.\\" According to ESPN, The Blood-Horse is the thoroughbred industry's most-respected trade publication.ESPN - August 5, 2003 Retrieved February 19, 2012 The National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Website is among the initiatives and organizations supported by The Jockey Club.

Background and family Lady Anna was the fourth daughter of James Cunningham, 7th Earl of Glencairn and Margaret, daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy, a family noted for its early commitment to Protestantism. Her sister was the memoirist Lady Margaret Cunningham. She married James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton on 30 January 1603. They had two sons, James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton (1606–1649) and William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton (1616–1651) and three daughters, Lady Anne Hamilton (married Hugh, 7th Earl of Eglinton), Lady Margaret Hamilton (married John, Earl of Crawford and Lindsay) and Lady Mary Hamilton (died 1633, married James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Queensberry). Historical importance Her historical importance is as a defender of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland against Charles I attempts to convert the whole of Scotland to Anglicanism and her active leadership in the National Covenant resistance movement. Her son, James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, had sided with Charles I. When he attempted to land an army on the Scottish Coast in 1639, she organised the defences, raised a cavalry troop, and \\"came forth with pistol which she vowed to discharge upon her son if he offered to come ashore.\\"A Historical Dictionary of British Women, eds Cathy Hartley and Susan Leckey (Routledge, 2003) A correspondent of the time, Edward Norgate, wrote, \\"She goeth in armour and with a pistoll by her side readie charged, and wishes him there, saying shee would burie the bullets in his bowells.\\"HMC 6th Report: Hood (London, 1877), p. 347. The cavalry rode under a banner showing a hand repelling a prayer book with the motto For God, the King, Religion and the Covenant. This was at the time of the Battle of Berwick on 5 June 1639. The struggle with Charles I led to the Scots' right to a free church assembly and a free parliament. Her great-great-grandson was Sir William Hamilton the husband of Emma, Lady Hamilton who is best known as the mistress of Lord Nelson.

All variations are triple-step patterns of gliding character in a \\"step-together- step\\" pattern. The word came from ballet terminology. Varieties There is a large variety of chasses across many dances. Variations include: * The direction may be sideways, diagonal or even curving. * Sizes of steps may vary. This also concerns the second, \\"Together\\", step: the moving foot may land right beside the standing foot or leave some space, or even barely move from its previous position. * Timing may vary. Typical timings in ballroom dances are qqS (1/4, 1/4, 1/2) and SaS (\\"slow-and-slow\\", 3/8, 1/8, 1/2). * Footwork may vary. The chassé in waltz dancing has several defined forms or figures. Ballet A slide with both legs bent either forwards, backwards or sideways and meeting in the air straightened. It can be done either in a gallop (like children pretending to ride a horse) or by pushing the first foot along the floor in a plié and springing into the air where both legs meet stretched. Ballroom A number of specific dance variations in the International Style ballroom dances are named \\"chassé\\". *Tipple chassé *Scatter chassé *Chassé from promenade position *Progressive chassé *Progressive chassé to right *Turning chassé *Cross chassé *Tipsy chassé, also called simply \\"tipsy\\" *Diagonal chassé *Chassé roll *Chassé turn *Quick chassé, a chassé done on count q&q;, rather than qqS *Chassé reverse turn *Chassés to right and left *Chassé cape Ice dancing or roller dancing In ice dancing, chassés are basic dance steps which appear, for example, in many compulsory dances. The International Skating Union rules define the following variants:ISU technical regulations * Simple chassé: a step in which the free foot is placed on the ice beside the skating foot, which is then lifted close to the new skating foot with the blade parallel to the ice. The two steps are skated on the same lobe, usually stepping from outside to inside edge. * Cross chassé: a chassé in which the free foot is placed on the ice crossing behind the skating foot when skating forward, or in front when skating backward. * Slide chassé: a chassé in which, instead of lifting the new free foot after the step, it slides off the ice in front when skating forward, or in back when skating backward. Line dancing In line dancing the term chassé is used for a triple-step sequence in any direction (forward, side, back, diagonally, or curving). For instance, if the chassé is to be done to the right, the right foot steps right, the left foot is placed next to the right, with the weight being transferred to the left foot so that the right foot can complete the chassé by stepping to the right. The call is usually \\"step, together, step\\". The step is often called \\"the shuffle\\" by line dancers, but that has several unrelated meanings in other dance contexts.

Sea apples are filter feeders with tentacles, ovate bodies, and tube-like feet. As with many other holothurians, they can release their internal organs or a toxin into the water when stressed.  Physiology  Sea apple at Nusa Kode Pseudocolochirus violaceus amongst other invertebrates Sea apples are holothuroids, and as such share many of the same physical characteristics. A few notable characteristics are discussed below. For more information about the physiology of holothuroids in general, see the appropriate sections in the main article Sea cucumbers. =Anatomy and feeding= The ovate body of an adult sea apple can grow up to long. A central mouth-like cavity is surrounded by feathery tentacles, which add additional length. Sea apples, like many echinoderms, have rows of tube feet which help them move over and adhere to structures. The bodies and tentacles of sea apples come in many different colorings. The Australian species has a primarily purple body, red feet, and purple and white tentacles. The sea apple feeds primarily on plankton, which it filters from the water with its tentacles. It alternately brings each tentacle to its mouth, scraping off the captured plankton. Sea apples usually feed at night at which time their delicate tentacles are less at risk from predators. =Defense= When disturbed, sea apples, like other holothuroids, can violently extrude their entrails from both ends. In addition, sea apples can release a toxic saponin called holothurin into the water as a defense mechanism. In addition, if threatened or in an unsuitable environment, sea apples can consume large amounts of surrounding seawater to swell to nearly double their original size, this allows them to be moved to a new area by water currents, and much more quickly than they could walk. Problems in captivity Pseudocolochirus violaceus Because of their interesting appearance and behaviour, sea apples are often widely desired as specimen for display marine aquaria. They are considered reef safe as far as their compatibility with other species. However, they can be considered unsafe for reef aquaria for multiple reasons: = Starvation = Sea apples often starve to death in display aquaria. Levels of plankton in aquaria are often lower than optimal, and sea apples are often seen attempting to feed not only at night, as in their natural habitat, but also in the daytime. With only low levels of food available, these sea apples often starve, becoming progressively smaller as this happens. To try to circumvent these problems, hobbyists attempt to give the sea apple specimens supplemental feedings of plankton and liquid food. =Harassment and predation= Sea apples are often harassed by many aquarium inhabitants. Crustaceans, such as hermit crabs, and fish often peck or pick at sea apple's feathery tentacles. This may be for predatory purposes, or simply to steal trapped particles and plankton from the tentacles. Occasionally, sea apples use their defense mechanisms in response to harassment. The release of their toxin can poison other aquarium inhabitants, and is one of the reasons they are not commonly seen in aquariums.\\"Saltwater Invertebrates for Marine Reef Aquariums: Sea Apple.\\" Aquarium Fish: Tropical Freshwater Fish and Saltwater Fish for Home Aquariums. 2008. .

Jethro Tull Abrahams was born in Luton, Bedfordshire. He played on the album This Was recorded by Jethro Tull in 1968, but conflicts between Abrahams and Ian Anderson over the musical direction of the band led Abrahams to leave once the album was finished. Abrahams wanted to pursue a more blues/rock direction, while Anderson wanted to incorporate more overt folk and jazz influences. He was replaced first by Earth guitarist Tony Iommi who would leave Tull after only a few weeks to return to his band, which would later evolve into Black Sabbath, and then by Martin Barre who remained with Jethro Tull until the band initially ceased in 2011. Blodwyn Pig and later career Abrahams went on to found Blodwyn Pig and the group recorded two albums, Ahead Rings Out (1969) and Getting to This (1970) before breaking up in 1970. Abrahams soldiered on with the short-lived Wommett, then the Mick Abrahams Band and has continued to release albums by himself and with reunited versions of Blodwyn Pig. He has worked as a driver, lifeguard and financial consultant, occasionally playing gigs, especially to support causes in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Abrahams caused some controversy in Tull fan circles for his formation of a band called 'This Was' in the late 1990s, which reunited the members of the first incarnation of Jethro Tull (with the exception of Anderson) to perform songs from that era of Jethro Tull's music. Tull fans disapproved but Anderson apparently was not too offended, as in recent years Abrahams and Anderson have guested on each other's records. Abrahams has also participated in Jethro Tull reunions, as well as one-off projects and gigs over the years. According to his website, Abrahams suffered a heart attack in November 2009 and would have to recuperate before resuming work. In April 2010 his website revealed that he was suffering from Ménière's disease, which would hold him back from performing at least for another year. In December 2013, he posted an update referring to his continuing health problems and mentioning that he hoped to release an album in 2014. In 2015, Abrahams announced a new studio album called Revived!, with several guests – among them, his replacement in Jethro Tull, Martin Barre.

In the summer of 2005, she took part in the first hugely successful You're a Star series, in which she raised over forty thousand euro for Galway-based charity, Cope. The following month she co-presented season four of the hit entertainment series. She co-presented live coverage of the St. Patrick's Day Parade for three years. She then presented a bilingual English-Irish current affairs programme on RTÉ One called Pobal. She has appeared as a guest presenter on travel programme No Frontiers and co-presented season one of RTÉ's entertainment series Class Act with Aidan Power. In 2007, she guest presented RTÉ's daytime programme The Afternoon Show with Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh. She presented series five of TG4's flagship show Paisean Faisean with co-presenter Bláthnaid Ní Dhonnchadha. In October 2008, Síle joined her older sister Gráinne as co-presenter of Seoige on RTÉ One. After only one season together, RTÉ subsequently dropped the show leaving both sisters \\"very shocked\\".\\"Family drama for shell-shocked Seoiges\\" Independent (Ireland) In September 2009, she started as a co-presenter on RTÉ's The Afternoon Show. She has since disappeared off Irish screens and can be heard on Newstalk radio, which signed her up in an attempt to increase its appeal to listeners in the West of Ireland. She made headlines in January 2012 as Ryan Tubridy interviewed personalities Lorraine Keane, Andrea Roche and Michael O'Leary on The Late Late Show when she tweeted: \\"Just wondering ... are the days of the likes of Peter Ustinov, Spike Milligan and Germaine Greer gone forever?\\" Personal life Síle married Glen Mulcahy in a lavish ceremony in 2005.ShowBiz Ireland In January 2009, it was announced that the couple had separated and the marriage was over. In February 2012, she spoke about her battle with thyroid cancer. She was diagnosed the previous September and had a gland removed before being dosed with radioactive iodine. On 29 April 2018, Síle got engaged to long-term partner Damien O'Farrell, which she shares a son Cathal.

The Fon had multifarious functions: *He controlled external relations and internally he made laws. *All justice was done in his name, he was the final court of appeal and had power of life and death over his subjects. *As chief priest he offered sacrifices to his ancestors and interceded with them for the welfare of the people. He presided at important festivals, the most important being the Abin e Mfor, the dance of the Fon. The Fon was assisted and advised by titled royals. The most prominent among them was the Mamfor, the mother of the Fon, either his real mother or a sister. In addition there were two fraternal assistants called Ndimfor (the elder brother) and Muma (younger brother). However, none of these royals served as regent in the case of the Fon's death or indisposition. The body which actually shared power with the Fon and deputised for him was the council of elders or Kwifor. Kwifor means holder or supporter of the Fon but its role was far more pervasive. Membership was restricted to commoners who had attained the rank of Bukum (sing. Nkum). The strength of Kwifor lay in its role as a council of kingmakers and was thus a check on royal power. The Fon acknowledged this and tried as much as possible to avoid confrontation. The Kwifor The Kwifor assisted the Fon in the judicial investigation of serious cases which could not be dealt with at family, quarter or village levels. When investigations were completed the Fon delivered judgement but Kwifor would undertake its execution. One may broadly divide the chiefdom into two in order to understand its local administration: *Firstly, there were semi-autonomous settlements, each with its locally appointed Atangchuo (planner of war). These were linked to the centre through tribute paid in the form of the specialised product (palm oil, raffia wine, fish, etc.) for which the village was noted. *Secondly, there were those settlements mostly around the palace and directly under the authority of the Fon. These settlements had no hereditary chiefs but instead each had an appointed head, Tanukuru (father of the village), appointed by the Fon from among the bukum. In some cases a son of the Fon might be appointed. The Tanukuru, along with the other bukum, constituted a governing council - the Butabunukuru.

The texts explore the Passion narrative, as traditionally presented, from the point where Christ enters the Garden of Gethsemane to his death and burial. Hallgrímur began composing the work in 1656, while serving as pastor of Saurbær in Hvalfjörður. It took him three years to complete, the final poem being written in May 1659; the first edition was published seven years later, in 1666. By the end of the century they had become so popular in Iceland that five editions had been published. Since that time, they have been reprinted more than 75 times, a unique achievement in Icelandic literature. The poems were translated into many other languages, including Latin, English, Chinese and Danish. The first English edition was published in 1913. In the 1950s a new translation was made by Arthur Charles Gook. This new translation received the imprimatur of the Bishop of Iceland, Sigurbjörn Einarsson, and is published by Hallgrímskirkja. In addition, a selection of texts were translated by Anglican Bishop Charles Venn Pilcher and published in a pamphlet entitled \\"Thirty-One Meditations on Christ's Passion\\"; this translation, although incomplete, is regarded as more faithful to Hallgrímur's Lutheran theology. The Passíusálmar quickly became an important part of Icelandic religious expression, being sung or read during Lent in every Icelandic home; today, they are broadcast on the radio during that time of year. They have been set to music by many composers of Icelandic church music, including Þorkell Sigurbjörnsson and Jón Hlöðver Áskelsson, but use outside Iceland is rare.

The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and refers to the generic nature of diagrams containing labelled nodes and (sometimes directed) paths between them. The archetypical example of a boxology is a corporate \\"org chart\\", which describes lines of control through the corporation.

Revenue service 5593 was built in 1934 by the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, Works number 24151, and part of Lot 118, to a design by William Stanier. In May 1936 it was named Kolhapur after Kolhapur, a princely state in western India. Kolhapur's right hand side nameplate, as preserved. Initially built with a low degree superheat domeless boiler, 5593 received a domed boiler in April 1937. 5593 hauled the train carrying Winston Churchill from Liverpool on his return from talks with President Roosevelt in 1942. After nationalisation in 1948 it was renumbered 45593 by British Railways in December of that year. It was allocated to various sheds during the 1950s and 1960s, including Longsight, Carlisle Upperby, Willesden, Aston, Burton, Patricroft and Newton Heath. On 23 March 1965 5593 was transferred to Leeds Holbeck and was kept there in good condition to work railtours over the Settle-Carlisle Railway.

Its major development occurred in the late nineteenth century, when it became a winter vacation destination for tourists from the North and Midwest. Its development was halted or slowed by the Great Fire of 1901, the Florida Land Bust of the 1920s, and the economic woes of the 1960s and 70s. Since the late 20th century, the city has experienced steady growth, with a new federal building constructed in downtown in 2003. Since 1940, Jacksonville has also been a major port for the United States Navy. The city is a thriving metropolis with over a million citizens. Due to its consolidated city-county government structure, it has the largest municipal population among Florida cities, as well as the largest land area of any city in the contiguous United States. Jacksonville's Main Street and boulevard, circa 1903 Early days =Ancient history= Archaeological evidence indicates 6,000 years of human habitation in the area. Pottery has been found dating to 2500 BC, nearly the oldest in the United States and second to artifacts of the Savannah River area. In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical record period, the area was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup of the Timucua indigenous Native Americans. At the time of contact with Europeans, most Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa, centered on Fort George Island near the mouth of the St. Johns River. They had a complex society, well-adapted to the environmental conditions of the area. =Colonial and territorial history= Fort Caroline shown in an old etching In 1513, Spanish explorers landed in Florida and claimed their discovery for Spain (see Spanish Florida). The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish missionaries and explorers from this period. In February 1562, French naval officer Jean Ribault and a 150 settlers arrived seeking land for a safe haven for the French Huguenots, Protestants suffering religious persecution in France. Ribault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River before moving north and establishing the colony of Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Ribault returned to France for supplies, but tensions from French Wars of Religion had broken out during his absence. His return to Florida was delayed as a result. Without leadership or provisions, the colonists abandoned Charlesfort. In 1564 Ribault's former lieutenant, René Goulaine de Laudonnière, launched a new expedition to found a colony on the St. Johns River. On June 22, 1564, the settlers established Fort Caroline atop the St. Johns Bluff. Laudonnière made an alliance with the local tribe of Timucua Indians, the Saturiwa. He also forged friendly relations with their competitors, the Utina tribe, who lived upriver to the south (around what is now Palatka and the Lake George area). Ribault intended to resupply Fort Caroline in early 1565, but was again delayed. As a result, the colony faced famine, three mutinies, and eventually warfare with the Utina. Ribault finally reached the fort with a relief expedition in the summer, and assumed command of the settlement. In the meantime, the Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés had established the colony of St. Augustine 35 miles to the south, with the express mission to displace the French. When he arrived, Ribault launched a naval expedition of 200 sailors and 400 soldiers to dislodge the Spanish, but a storm at sea incapacitated them for several days and caused numerous deaths. On September 20, 1565, Menéndez marched his men overland to Fort Caroline, defended by 200 or 250 people, and killed everyone except for 50 women and children and 26 men who escaped. The Spanish picked up the survivors of Ribault's fleet, and summarily executed all but 20. The Spanish took over Fort Caroline, renaming it as San Matteo. In 1568 the French and Spanish confronted each other again here, when Dominique de Gourgues burned it to the ground. The Spanish rebuilt the fort, but abandoned it in 1569. The Spanish next built Fort San Nicolas further upriver to protect the rear flank of St. Augustine. \\"San Nicolas\\" served as their name for the Jacksonville area, a placename which survives in the neighborhood of St. Nicholas. The fort was located on the east side of the St. Johns, where Bishop Kenny High School now stands. The fort was abandoned in the late 17th century. France and Spain were defeated by the British in the French and Indian War. During the war the British had defeated the Spanish in Cuba and occupied the island, whereas Florida had hardly seen any fighting. As part of the negotiations between the two nations in the aftermath of the war, Spain would cede Florida to Great Britain in exchange for the return of Cuba. The British agreed and Florida was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1763. The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named the \\"Cow Ford\\", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British divided Florida into the two colonies of British East Florida and British West Florida.A History of Florida By Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman Bennett page 77 The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of Florida's natural wealth were published in England. A large number of British colonists who were \\"energetic and of good character\\" moved to Florida, mostly coming from South Carolina, Georgia and England though there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of Bermuda. This would be the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now Duval County, Baker County, St. Johns County and Nassau County. The British built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result of these initiatives northeastern Florida prospered economically in a way it never did under Spanish rule. Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today including trial-by- jury, habeas corpus and county-based government.A History of Florida By Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman BennettThe Land Policy in British East Florida by Charles L. Mowat 1940 The British gave control of the territory back to Spain in 1783. Americans of English descent and Americans of Scots- Irish descent began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South Carolina. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities, the Spanish were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to migrate into Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present English- speaking settlers who had lived in Florida since the British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as Florida Crackers.Ste Claire, Dana (2006). Cracker: Cracker Culture in Florida History. University Press of Florida. The Spanish also accepted slaves from the newly created United States if they converted to Catholicism. Between 1812 and 1814 during the War of 1812 between the US and Britain, the US Navy assisted American settlers in Florida in \\"The Patriot War\\", a covert attempt to seize control of Florida from the Spanish. They began with invasions of Fernandina and Amelia Island. Spain sold the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821 and, by 1822, Jacksonville's current name had come into use, to honor General Andrew Jackson. It first appears on a petition sent on June 15, 1822 to U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, asking that Jacksonville be named a port of entry. The city is named for Andrew Jackson, military governor of the Florida Territory and eventual President of the United States. U.S. settlers led by Isaiah D. Hart wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832. Remembered as the city's most important founding father, Hart is memorialized with the Isaiah D. Hart Bridge over the St. Johns. =Civil War= Military prison in Jacksonville during the American Civil War. During the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle leaving Florida and aiding the Confederate cause. Throughout most of the war, the US Navy maintained a blockade around Florida's ports, including Jacksonville. In October 1862 Union forces captured a Confederate battery in the Battle of St. Johns Bluff and occupied Jacksonville. Throughout the war Jacksonville changed hands several times, though never with a battle. On February 20, 1864, Union soldiers from Jacksonville marched inland and confronted the Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee. The battle was a devastating loss for the Union and a decisive victory for the Confederacy. Soldiers on both sides were veterans of the great battles in the eastern and western theaters of war, but many of them remarked in letters and diaries that they had never experienced such terrible fighting. The Confederate dead were buried at Oaklawn Cemetery in nearby Lake City. The Union losses caused Northern authorities to question the necessity of further Union involvement in the militarily insignificant region of northern Florida. On the morning of 22 February, as the Union forces were still retreating to Jacksonville, the 54th Massachusetts was ordered to counter-march back to Ten-Mile Station. The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th Massachusetts arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately three miles to Camp Finnegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of ten miles. It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance. The US Transport Maple Leaf was sunk at Jacksonville, April 1, 1864. The U.S. Transport General Hunter was sunk in the St. John's River, April 16, 1864, close to where the Maple Leaf was sunk. By the end of the war in 1865, a Union commander commented that Jacksonville had become \\"pathetically dilapidated, a mere skeleton of its former self, a victim of war.\\" Post Civil War =Winter resort era= 1893 bird's eye view of Jacksonville, with steamboats moving throughout the St. Johns River Following the Civil War, during Reconstruction and afterward, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous of the Gilded Age. Visitors arrived by steamboat and (beginning in the 1880s) by railroad, and wintered at dozens of hotels and boarding houses. The 1888 Subtropical Exposition was held in Jacksonville and attended by President Grover Cleveland, but the Florida-style world's fair did not lead to a lasting boost for tourism in Jacksonville. The area declined in importance as a resort destination after Henry Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railroad to the south, reaching Palm Beach in 1894 and the Miami area in 1896. This drew tourism to the southern Atlantic Coast. =Yellow fever epidemics= Jacksonville's prominence as a winter resort was dealt another blow by major yellow fever epidemics in 1886 and 1888. During the second one, nearly ten percent of the more than 4,000 victims died, including the city's mayor.John Wilson Cowart, Crackers and Carpetbaggers: Moments in the History of Jacksonville, Florida In the absence of scientific knowledge concerning the cause of yellow fever, nearly half (10,000 out of 25,000) of the city's panicked residents fled despite the imposition of quarantines. Inbound and outbound mail was fumigated in an effort to reduce contagion. Jacksonville's reputation as a healthful tourist destination suffered. The African-American population did not appear to catch the disease, leading the panicked population into erroneously believing that the black residents were \\"carriers\\" of the Yellow Fever. In fact, blacks had immunity from catching the disease earlier, as children. =Spanish–American War= During the Spanish–American War, gunrunners helping the Cuban rebels used Jacksonville as the center for smuggling illegal arms and supplies to the island. Duval County sheriff and future state governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, was one of the many gunrunners operating out of the city. Author Stephen Crane travelled to Jacksonville to cover the war. 20th century =Great Fire of 1901= On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by the Great Fire—the largest- ever urban fire in the Southeastern United States, which started when hot ash from a shantyhouse's chimney landed on the drying moss at Cleaveland's Fiber Factory. At half past noon most of the Cleaveland workers were at lunch, but by the time they returned the entire city block was engulfed in flames. The fire destroyed the business district and rendered 10,000 residents homeless in the course of eight hours. Florida Governor William S. Jennings declared a state of martial law in Jacksonville and dispatched several state militia units to help. Reconstruction started immediately, and the city was returned to civil authority on May 17. Despite the widespread damage, only seven deaths were reported. Young architect Henry John Klutho had just returned to New York from a year in Europe when he read about the Jacksonville fire and, seeing a rare opportunity, he headed south. Klutho and other architects, enamored by the \\"Prairie Style\\" of architecture then being popularized by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, designed exuberant local buildings with a Florida flair. While many of Klutho's buildings were demolished by the 1980s, a number of his creations remain, including the St. James Building from 1911 (a former department store that is now Jacksonville's City Hall) and the Morocco Temple from 1910. The Klutho Apartments, in Springfield, were recently restored and converted into office space by local charity Fresh Ministries. Despite the losses of the last several decades, Jacksonville still has one of the largest collections of Prairie Style buildings (particularly residences) outside the Midwest. =Motion picture industry= Motion picture scene at Gaumont Studios, circa 1910s. In the early 20th century, before Hollywood, the motion picture industry was based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In need of a winter headquarters, moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville due to its warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of \\"The Winter Film Capital of the World.\\" New York-based Kalem Studios was the first to open a permanent studio in Jacksonville in 1908. Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including Metro Pictures (later MGM), Edison Studios, Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, Vim Comedy Company, Norman Studios, Gaumont Studios and the Lubin Manufacturing Company. Comedic actor and Georgia native Oliver \\"Babe\\" Hardy began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to Jacksonville in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in Technicolor and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, The Gulf Between, was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917. Jacksonville was especially important to the African American film industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of Oscar Micheaux and the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as The Birth of a Nation, Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed \\"splendidly assuming different roles.\\" Jacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W. Griffith to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination. =\\"Gateway to Florida\\"= Map of Jacksonville in 1920 The 1920s brought significant real estate development and speculation to the city during the great Florida land boom (and bust). Hordes of train passengers passed through Jacksonville on their way south to the new tourist destinations of South Florida, as most of the passenger trains arriving from the population centers of the North were routed through Jacksonville. The Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927, Waymarking, Five Points Theater, Jacksonville was the first theater in Florida to show talking pictures. Completion of the Dixie Highway (portions of which became U.S. 1) in the 1920s began to draw significant automobile traffic as well. An important entry point to the state since the 1870s, Jacksonville now justifiably billed itself as the \\"Gateway to Florida.\\" =US Navy= Hotel Roosevelt. A significant part of Jacksonville's growth in the 20th century came from the presence of navy bases in the region. October 15, 1940, Naval Air Station Jacksonville (\\"NAS Jax\\") on the westside became the first navy installation in the city. This base was a major training center during World War II, with over 20,000 pilots and aircrewmen being trained there. After the war, the Navy's elite Blue Angels were established at NAS Jax. Today NAS Jax is the third largest navy installation in the country and employs over 23,000 civilian and active-duty personnel. In June 1941, land in the westernmost side of Duval County was earmarked for a second naval air facility. This became NAS Cecil Field, which during the Cold War was designated a Master Jet Base, the only one in the South. RF-8 Crusaders out of Cecil Field detected missiles in Cuba, precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1993, the Navy decided to close NAS Cecil Field, and this was completed in 1999. The land once occupied by this installation is now known as the \\"Cecil Commerce Center\\" and contains one of the campuses of Florida Community College which now offers civil aeronautics classes. December 1942 saw the addition of a third naval installation to Jacksonville: Naval Station Mayport at the mouth of the St. Johns River. This port developed through World War II and today is the home port for many types of navy ships, most notably the aircraft carrier from 1995 to 26 July 2007, when Big John was towed away, eventually to be mothballed in Philadelphia (see more at https://web.archive.org/web/20071012152907/http://jacksonville.com/usskennedy/). NS Mayport current employs about 14,000 personnel. Jacksonville is also not far from Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in St. Marys, Georgia, which is home to part of the US Navy's nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) fleet. The naval base became a key training ground in the 1950s and 1960s and as such, the population of the city rose dramatically. More than half of the residents in Jacksonville had some tie to the naval base, whether it be a relative stationed there, or due to employment opportunities, by 1970, necessitating the opening of an international airport in the area. =Hotel Roosevelt fire= On December 29, 1963, a fire gutted the first couple of stories of the Hotel Roosevelt on Adams Street, killing 22 people, setting a record for the highest one-day death toll in Jacksonville history. The hotel was later abandoned, with most businesses inside moving to the nearby Hotel George Washington. =Floating nuclear power plants= Offshore Power Systems (OPS) was a 1970 joint venture between Westinghouse Electric Company, who constructed nuclear generating plants, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock, who had recently merged with Tenneco, to create floating nuclear power plants at the Port of Jacksonville.Adams, Rod: \\"Offshore Power Systems: Big Plants for a Big Customer\\" Atomic Insights, August 1996Putnam, Walter: \\"Floating nuclear plants may become reality\\" Boca Raton News, November 15, 1981 Construction of the new facility was projected to cost $200 million and create 10,000 new jobs when completed in 1976.\\"Urban waterfront lands\\" Page 136, National Research Council Committee, 1980 Contracts were signed by Public Service Electric and Gas Company with PSE&G; paying for the startup costs for the manufacturing facility. Westinghouse named Zeke Zechella to be president of OPS in 1972.Kerr, Jessie-Lynne: “ALEXANDER P. 'ZEKE' ZECHELLA: 1920-2009” Florida Times-Union, August 18, 2009 OPS obtained 850+ acres (3.4 km2) on Blount Island from the Jacksonville Port Authority (JPA) for $2,000/acre, then installed infrastructure using over 1,000 workers. A total of $125 million was invested in the property and facility, however; no plants were ever built. =Ax Handle Saturday= Because of its high visibility and patronage, the Hemming Park and surrounding stores were the site of numerous civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. Black Sit-ins began on August 13, 1960 when students asked to be served at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworths, Morrison's Cafeteria and other eateries. They were denied service and kicked, spit at and addressed with racial slurs. This came to a head on \\"Ax Handle Saturday\\", August 27, 1960.https://thecoastal.com/flashback/ax-handle- saturday-jacksonvilles-ugliest-hour/ A group of 200 middle aged and older white men (allegedly some were also members of the Ku Klux Klan) gathered in Hemming Park armed with baseball bats and ax handles. They attacked the protesters conducting sit-ins. The violence spread, and the white mob started attacking all African-Americans in sight. Rumors were rampant on both sides that the unrest was spreading around the county (in reality, the violence stayed in relatively the same location, and did not spill over into the mostly-white, upper-class Cedar Hills neighborhood, for example). A black street gang called the \\"Boomerangs\\" attempted to protect the demonstrators. Police, who had not intervened when the protesters were attacked, now became involved, arresting members of the Boomerangs and other black residents who attempted to stop the beatings. Nat Glover, who worked in Jacksonville law enforcement for 37 years, including eight years as Sheriff of Jacksonville, recalled stumbling into the riot. Glover said he ran to the police, expecting them to arrest the thugs, but was told to leave town or risk being killed.Pemberton, John: Florida Times-Union, February 22, 1998, \\"Focus on: Nat Glover\\" Several whites had joined the black protesters on that day. Richard Charles Parker, a 25-year-old student attending Florida State University was among them. White protesters were the object of particular dislike by racists, so when the fracas began, Parker was hustled out of the area for his own protection. The police had been watching him and arrested him as an instigator, charging him with vagrancy, disorderly conduct and inciting a riot. After Parker stated that he was proud to be a member of the NAACP, Judge John Santora sentenced him to 90 days in jail.Weathersbee, Tonyaa: Florida Times-Union, February 4, 2008, \\"The story of a white man who joined the '60s sit-ins\\" =Hurricanes= Jacksonville is one of the few cities on the Eastern coast that have been largely spared from the wrath of hurricanes. Despite the damage and destruction that Hurricane Dora caused in Jacksonville, the very next day, September 11, 1964, over 20,000 fans attended a live concert at the Gator Bowl Stadium by the British rock-and-roll band, \\"The Beatles.\\" The winds were blowing so hard that Ringo Starr's drumset had to be nailed down to the stage. Dora was the only storm in recorded history to affect Jacksonville with hurricane-force winds, though the city has been affected by weaker storms as well as hurricanes that lost intensity before reaching the area. In September 1999, after Hurricane Floyd struck the Bahamas, over one million Floridians were evacuated from coastal areas, many of them from Jacksonville. Mayor John Delaney announced the mandatory evacuation of the Jacksonville Beaches and other low lying neighborhoods early on September 14; in total, nearly 80,000 Jacksonville residents left their homes. Ultimately the storm turned northward 125 miles off the coast, causing only minor damage in Jacksonville and the southeastern US before making ground in North Carolina. In September 2017, Jacksonville experienced record flooding from Hurricane Irma. =Consolidation= Through the 1960s Jacksonville, like most other large cities in the US, suffered from the effects of urban sprawl. To compensate for the loss of population and tax revenue and end waste and corruption, voters elected to consolidate the government of Jacksonville with the government of Duval County. The move was carried out on October 1, 1968, and Hans Tanzler, elected mayor of Jacksonville the year before, became the first mayor of the consolidated government. Jacksonville became the largest city in Florida and the 13th largest in the United States, and has a greater land area than any other American city outside Alaska. All areas of Duval County are considered part of Jacksonville besides the four independent municipalities of Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, although residents of these towns vote in city elections and are eligible for services provided by Jacksonville. Claude Yates began the \\"quiet revolution\\" with the Yates Manifesto and J. J. Daniel was chairman of the Local Government Study Commission. Lex Hester was Executive Director of the commission and the key architect of Jacksonville's consolidated government, transition coordinator and chief administrative officer following consolidation.

He was the first recipient of the Medal of Honor, a new military award first presented by the United States Department of War to six Union Army soldiers who participated in the Great Locomotive Chase in 1862 during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Biography A museum to Parrott in Kenton Parrott was a native of Fairfield County, Ohio. He joined the United States Army in 1861 as a private in Company K, 33rd Ohio Infantry and first saw combat in the Battle of Ivy Mountain. In April 1862, he volunteered to take part in a daring raid with 21 others (later known as \\"Andrews' Raiders\\" because they operated under the command of James J. Andrews). After infiltrating Confederate lines and hijacking the locomotive \\"General,\\" they were captured and imprisoned. Parrott was severely beaten 110 times in an attempt to make him talk. Parrott and 14 others managed to escape, but only six of them reached friendly lines. He was later exchanged and taken to Washington, D.C. meeting President Abraham Lincoln and was presented with the Medal of Honor by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. He served with the Union Army for the remainder of the war. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1863 after the Battle of Stones River and as a first lieutenant in 1864. He returned to Kenton, Ohio after the war and remained a cabinet maker and operated a stone quarry south of Kenton, Ohio. Parrott suffered a heart attack and died while walking home from the county courthouse in Kenton, Ohio. He is buried in Grove Cemetery, on State Route 309, right across the street from Wingfield Crop Insurance, east edge of Kenton, Ohio.

Vreta is thought to have been for King Magnus II (not Magnus I as the stone shows), though his actual burial probably took place elsewhere within the cloister compound, now in ruins.Lindberg, Markus in Meddelanden från Östergötlands länsmuseum 2003 p. 74 Magnus II; Swedish: Magnus Henriksson (c. 1130 – 1161) was a Danish lord and King of Sweden between 1160 and 1161. He is often seen by posterity as a usurper.  Background  The mother of Magnus was Ingrid Ragvaldsdotter, a granddaughter of King Inge I of Sweden. His father was the Danish lord Henrik Skatelår, son of an illegitimate son of king Sweyn II of Denmark. After Henrik's death, Ingrid remarried thrice, with Harald Gille of Norway, then Ottar Birting, and finally Arne from Stårheim. Magnus therefore had kinship ties with the royalty of the three Nordic kingdoms. He was married to his stepsister Bridget Haraldsdotter, a daughter of Harald Gille who had previously been married to the powerful jarl in Västergötland, Karl Sunesson. Magnus is first mentioned in 1148 when he witnessed a document issued by King Sweyn III of Denmark.Gillingstam, \\"Magnus Henriksson\\".  Reign  Magnus was a claimant to the much-competed throne of Sweden. In 1156 he allegedly bribed a trusted servant of King Sverker I to assassinate him.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks krønike, II, p. 133. A few years later, according to a legendary source, he allied with a certain chief in the country, possibly Sverker's son Karl.Tunberg, Sveriges historia till våra dagar, II, pp. 51-2. He then ambushed and killed Eric IX of Sweden (later to be known as Eric the Saint) when he left the church at Östra Aros near Uppsala on May 18, 1160. After this feat Magnus reigned as king over most of Sweden, but apparently not Östergötland, which was ruled by Karl Sverkersson since c. 1158. He is, however, mentioned in the short chronicle of the Westrogothic law, implying that he was recognized in Västergötland.Yngre Västgötalagen, http://project2.sol.lu.se/fornsvenska/ Magnus appointed his brother Ragnvald as jarl and provided refuge to his uterine brother Orm when their brother King Inge the Hunchback was killed in Norway. Otherwise not much is known about his reign, except that he donated land to Vreta Abbey.Gillingstam, \\"Magnus Henriksson\\". Magnus merely reigned for a year. According to the 15th-century historian Ericus Olai, some retainers of Eric the Saint survived the assault in Östra Aros and fled to the north, to Helsingland, where they propagated against the usurper-king. Dissatisfaction with the regicide among the Swedish peasantry soon led to a rising against Magnus.A.M. Strinnholm,Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: Hörbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, pp. 118-9. The near-contemporary Saxo Grammaticus, on the other hand, writes that \\"he fell in a battle that he fought against Sverker's son Karl, whom he also intended to deprive of his crown, after he had first deprived him of his father.\\" Saxo regarded the violent death of Magnus as the divine revenge for the shameful assassination of Sverker.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks krønike, II, p. 133. According to Swedish sources the battle took place in Örebro in 1161. After the fall of Magnus, Karl Sverkersson reigned as King Charles VII of Sweden . His full brothers Knut and Buris served as jarls in the court of Valdemar the Great of Denmark. His uterine brother Nikolas Arnesson was Bishop of Oslo, and an opponent of Sverre of Norway, the son-in-law of Eric IX.Gillingstam, \\"Magnus Henriksson\\". Queen Bridget later remarried with the powerful jarl Birger Brosa (d. 1202) and became the ancestress of a branch of the House of Bjälbo, and the grandmother of John I of Sweden.

Notable people From 1892 to 1897, later Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin attended school in the city. The popular French singers Coralie Clément and Benjamin Biolay, as well as football player hopeful Grégory Bettiol and actor and cellist Maurice Baquet were born in the town. History Villefranche-sur- Saône was founded in 1212 by Guichard IV, count of Beaujeu (), and became in the 14th century the capital of the Beaujolais () province. It endured three sieges in the 15th and 16th centuries. The town walls were taken down early in the 19th century. Economy Industries include wine-trading, metallurgy, textiles, and chemicals. Buildings The church of Notre-Dame des Marais, begun at the end of the 14th and finished in the 16th century, has a tower and spire (rebuilt in 1862), standing to the right of the 15th century façade, in which are carved wooden doors.

It was founded in 1915 and is an International Baccalaureate World School. Elmwood School was the first school in North America to be accredited for all three levels of the IB Program - the Diploma Programme for students in the final two years of secondary school, the Middle Years Programme (MYP) for students aged 11–16, and the Primary Years Programme (PYP) for students aged 3–12. The school is also a member of the National Coalition of Girls' Schools and the Canadian Accredited Independent Schools. The faculty provides education to 400 students aged 4 to 18. Classes are small, with an average class size of 12 and a student to teacher ratio of 7:1. Tuition fees for the 2018–2019 school year are approximately $26,960 for grades 1 to 12 students. The current Head of School is James Whitehouse, who took over the leadership of the school in 2019 after seven years as Deputy Head of the Middle and Senior School. Prior to joining Elmwood, he served as Assistant Head at Seven Kings High School in Redbridge, London, United Kingdom. Like many other private schools throughout the Commonwealth, Elmwood's traditions are based on similar schools in Britain. Senior formal leaders in their graduating year are called prefects, the students wear uniforms, and each student is a member of a house. Recent graduates have matriculated to universities across Ontario, Canada, the United States, the UK and across the globe. Each year, over 80% of graduates receive valuable scholarships to post-secondary institutions such as the Greville Smith Scholarship from McGill University, the National Excellence Award from the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, the Sesquicentennial Scholarship from St. Lawrence University in New York State, the Undergraduate Research Scholarship from the University of Ottawa Faculty of Science, the Richard Lewer Scholarship from Carleton University and the President's Entrance Scholarship from the University of Western Ontario to name but a few. In 2010, Elmwood's class of 43 graduates were offered over $1,000,000 in scholarship awards. The largest single scholarship awarded was in 2009, when $150,000 US was awarded to a student.In 2019, the entire graduating class were Ontario Scholars. Philosophy of education Elmwood School Elmwood is the only school in Ottawa to offer all three International Baccalaureate programs. The PYP, MYP and DP offers a continuum of high quality education that encourages international-mindedness and a positive attitude to learning. The three programs form a coherent sequence of education by promoting the education of the whole person through an emphasis on intellectual, personal, emotional and social growth. The programs are inquiry based and concept driven rather than content driven and are examples of best practices in education. This approach is based on constructivism learning theory which argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning from their experiences. In all three programs, the education of the whole person is manifested through all domains of knowledge, involving the major traditions of learning in languages, humanities, sciences, mathematics and the arts. Facts and statistics Over the past decade, Elmwood School has excelled in math and science. More than 50% of Elmwood's graduates go on to study math, science and engineering at university. This is significant considering that although women now account for a majority of undergraduate students at Canadian universities, female enrolment in engineering, math and science faculties has never exceeded 20%.http://www.cdnwomen.org/PDFs/EN/CWF-GirlsCanada-Report05.pdf Elmwood has long been recognized as a globally diverse learning community. Elmwood's students represent more than 30 different nationalities and many say that one of Elmwood's paramount strengths is its diversity and cultural inclusivity. Elmwood is known for educating children of political and diplomatic figures. Many diplomatic families choose Elmwood for their daughters' education and there are many links with embassies and consulates located in and around Rockcliffe Park. Roughly 20% of the student population are members of the diplomatic community. Academic program Elmwood's high academic standards, small class sizes and multicultural student base combine to create a unique learning environment. Elmwood's faculty draws on best practices, specific to all girls’ education, as they challenge students to be principled, knowledgeable and reflective lifelong learners. Elmwood regularly surpasses the Ontario Ministry of Education and International Baccalaureate curriculum guidelines and enhances students’ learning through field trips, guest speakers, co-curricular activities, and individual opportunities for leadership. =Bilingual certification= Students who follow a prescribed sequence of courses and achieve fluency in both English and French are awarded a Bilingual Certificate. Elmwood also offers opportunities to study Spanish, Latin and Mandarin. =Technology= Elmwood School was one of the first schools in Canada to introduce a 1:1 laptop program in the Senior School. All students from Grades 9-12 and all faculty have their own personal laptop which they can use to enhance their learning. Additionally, many classrooms are equipped with a SMART Board and many students are accustomed to the use of technology. Students in the Junior and Middle Schools use computers in computer labs or utilize mobile laptop carts in the classroom. =Global connections= Elmwood is twinned with St. Charles High School; Seboche, Lesotho. This twinning is helped by the organization Help Lesotho. Alongside being twinned with a school in Africa, Elmwood has two sister schools. Calrossy Anglican School for Girls in Australia and Otago Girls' High School in New Zealand. It is not uncommon to have incoming and outgoing student exchanges. Athletics Although Elmwood School is relatively small in size, it has an arguably diverse athletic program. Teams compete against other Ottawa area schools, both public and private and many teams perform at the highest level. In 2009 the Senior Girls Basketball team were the Ottawa Tier 1 ‘A’ Champions. The grade 7/8 volleyball squad took gold at the Ottawa Independent Schools Athletic Association (OISAA) tournament as did the grade 7/8 soccer team. There is also a high participation rate in the athletics program, with occasionally over 70% of girls in Middle School represented the school on a team. The Junior School has its own Athletics program geared towards the age of its students. Girls compete against other schools in various competitions including swimming and soccer. There is also a gymnastics and ballet program offered as an co-curricular activity Sports offered in Middle and Senior School at Elmwood include, but are not limited to, the following: * Alpine Ski * Badminton * Basketball * Cross-country * Field Hockey * Golf * Handball * Rowing * Rugby * Soccer * Snowboarding * Swimming * Tennis * Touch football * Track & Field * Ultimate Frisbee * Volleyball Duke of Edinburgh Award Elmwood School has one of the more successful Duke of Edinburgh award programs in Canada. The Duke of Edinburgh Award is a universally recognized award and the program is considered one of the best programs for the personal development of young people. It is non competitive, available to all and it offers a progression of growth and personal challenge through the categories of Bronze, Silver and Gold. Elmwood School requires all grade 9 students to participate in the Bronze Award program. The vast majority of students go on to receive their Silver and Gold Awards. Elmwood School has the highest number of Gold Award recipients per capita in Ontario. History Elmwood — originally the Rockcliffe Preparatory School — was founded in 1915 by Theodora Philpot, consisting of only four students, aged four to seven. Philpot was capable of hard work and, even as a respectable married woman with children, had plans that went far beyond her own front door. She was an entrepreneur, and her dream was to create a great school. Philpot's vision rang true with many parents. Even in the first few years, there were exponential increases in enrollment. Within ten years, Elmwood School had a student population of eighty students, served by a faculty of twelve teachers. After founding the school, Theodora Philpot retired to England leaving Elmwood in the hands of Edith Buck. She donated a Bible Box, inscribed with the words \\"Pactum Serva\\" meaning \\"Keep the Faith\\" to the school, and it came with a plea to carry on the work she had started. Modern methods, academic excellence, personal development and strong school spirit are still the ideal cornerstones of the Elmwood experience.Voices from Elmwood School 1915-2000 Janet Uren and Annette Bellamy(Rockcliffe Park, Ont.)

Inspired by a poem by William Wordsworth, I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud also known as Daffodils, the founding Headmistress, Theodora Philpot, adopted it for the Philpot Token Award. Each year, the student who embodies the spirit and ideals of service, fellowship, freedom and fair play is presented with this award. =School hymn= The school hymn is a modified version of To be a Pilgrim by John Bunyan. =Elmwood Centennial 1915–2015= The Elmwood School's centennial celebrations (1915–2015) consisted of a Centennial ‘Kick Off’ celebration on the first day of school (Sept 9, 2015), a Founder's Day celebration (Oct 2, 3, and 4, 2015), a Homecoming weekend for alumnae and current members of our community (Oct 2, 3, and 4, 2015) as well as a Centennial Finale after closing ceremonies on June 17, 2016. In addition, Elmwood held a special Centennial Gala (April 16, 2016) as well as a special Centennial Holly Tea and a Centennial Father Daughter Dinner Dance (Feb 6, 2016). A photographic exhibition was positioned around the school permanently. The Elmwood School history book, ‘Voices,’ previously written for our 85th anniversary, was updated to include events 2000–2015. The yearbooks were digitized and the oldest yearbooks were preserved.Elmwood Centennial 1915-2015 =Elmwood coat of arms= The centennial committee worked with the Chief Herald at the Governor General's office to create an Elmwood Coat of Arms. Her Excellency Sharon Johnston unveiled the coat of arms of Elmwood School, on Thursday, May 7, 2015, at 9:15 a.m., at Elmwood School. The symbol represents Elmwood's proud tradition as well as looks forward to its future. \\"This year, Elmwood is celebrating its centennial. I'm delighted to take part in the celebrations by unveiling a very important symbol that speaks to the school's rich history, values and traditions,\\" said Her Excellency.coat of arms of Elmwood School =Notable alumnae= Many Elmwood students have gone on to have remarkable careers and successful lives. Canada's first female Senator, Cairine Wilson, attended the school and was Head Girl in her final year. The school's Wilson House is named in her honour. Canadian television broadcaster Catherine Clark, daughter of the Right Honourable Joe Clark, also attended Elmwood. Poet Elizabeth Smart, author of the prose poem 'By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept', attended Elmwood from 1922–1929. Children's television writer, Mary MacKay-Smith attended Elmwood in the mid-1960s and was Head of Nightingale House. MacKay- Smith has written for many children's television series including Caillou and Polka Dot Door. Gemini Award-winning Canadian screenwriter Tassie Cameron spent her formative years at Elmwood. She is currently a writer and co- executive producer on the hit CBS/CTV television series Rookie Blue. Tassie and her sister Amy created the 2009 CBC television series Wild Roses. Mimi Lee, an American chemist, served as First Lady of Maryland from 1977 to 1979. Over the years, Elmwood has admitted boys in its early years program, many of which attend Ashbury College in high school. Actor Hume Cronyn, Adrian Harewood (host of Ottawa's afternoon program All In A Day), and entrepreneur Ben Barry are all examples of such 'Old Boys' of Elmwood. Traditions There are many strong traditions that have been upheld at Elmwood over the years. One of the most striking traditions is the practice of the Grade 12 graduates wearing white dresses to their Closing (Graduation) Ceremony rather than the black caps and gowns found at other schools. The graduates traditionally have their photograph taken on the staircase in the Front Hall, the oldest part of the school. The Rose Ceremony is a more recent graduate tradition. Each year a girl in Grade 12 is given a rose by a student in Grade 11. At this time, the graduate's accomplishments and contributions to the school are celebrated through a short testimonial given by a Grade 11 student. If the graduate has a sister in a younger grade, the sister is permitted to make the presentation. Another tradition which has existed for over 20 years is the annual Father Daughter Dinner Dance. This formal event takes place in February and gives Elmwood fathers and their daughters in Grades 6-12 an opportunity to socialize with each other and celebrate the bond between father and daughter. More recently a Mother Daughter weekend has also been added to the social calendar as well as a Junior School Tea for Elmwood's youngest students. House system Elmwood students are divided into four Houses, each named after a prominent and inspirational woman in history: Elizabeth Fry, Helen Keller, Florence Nightingale and Cairine Wilson. =Fry= *Bio: Elizabeth Fry (1740–1845) is remembered for her pioneering work in prison reform in Britain.

His historicity has been called into question. He is dated by some to the end of the 11th century, by others to the 1120s, while more critical historians believe that he is a legendary name belonging to the 10th century. According to some, he was the son of the pagan Swedish king Blót-Sweyn, and, like his father before him, administered the blóts at the temple at Uppsala.Erik, an article in Nordisk familjebok However, Erik does not appear in any Swedish or Danish primary sources.Svenska kyrkans historia (1838) His epithet indicates that the harvests during his reign were good. Snorre Sturluson's account The 13th-century historian Snorri Sturluson wrote in the Heimskringla that Blót-Sweyn and Erik had renounced Christianity and still ruled a largely pagan Sweden: If Erik succeeded Blót-Sweyn he would have been the contemporary of Inge the Elder, and this suggests that Erik could have been the last high priest (goði) of the Temple at Uppsala, and that he was killed or deposed by Inge the Elder. There is nothing in the sources that directly substantiates this, however.Ohlmarks, Åke, Alla Sveriges kungar. Stockholm: Gebers, p. 32; Bernadotte, Carl, et al., Sveriges hundra konungar. Stockholm: Biblioteksböcker 1956, p. 122. The 15th-century Prosaic Chronicle says that he was briefly attracted by the Christian religion but soon rejected it out of fear for a pagan reaction; he was nevertheless slain at Uppsala by his own men.Prosaiska krönikan, p. 233 This source is however highly problematic since it is late and mixes different events and epochs. Medieval genealogies Erik is mentioned in unverifiable sources of legend, especially the Icelandic genealogy Langfeðgatal, which speaks of Kol, son of Blot-Sweyn \\"whom the Swedes call Erik Årsäll\\".Bolin, Sture, \\"Erik, sagokungar\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=34514 In this genealogy he stands as the father of Sverker the Elder. The Westrogothic law gives the name of Sverker's father as Cornube. This may be compared with a Swedish annal entry from the 14th century which mentions King Sweyn as the father of Ulf Jarl Galla, Kol, and Cecilia, the mother of Eric the Saint (d. 1160).Ahnlund, Nils, \\"Vreta klosters äldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 345. That would suggest that either KolThe name of Sverker the Elder's father according to Skáldatal (c. 1300) or Cornube (\\"Grain-Ulf\\") might have been his true name. Erik Årsäll would then be a description of him as a \\"king during whose reign there were good harvests\\".Steinsland, Gro, Den hellige kongen, Oslo 2000. side 54 One of Sverker's sons or grandsons was actually named Kol. The same legends recount that Kaga Church near Linköping was the ancestral church of Sverker's father, and that the graveyard there was initiated for the earlier burial of Kol. Problems of historical identification However, there are several difficulties in identifying Erik Årsäll with Sverker's father. A medieval genealogy of the House of Sverker, found by the historian Nils Ahnlund, mentions the first generation as Kettil Känia (Kettil the non-Christian) who entered his grave-mound while still alive, out of rejection of Christianity. His son was the pagan chief Kol who was baptized right before his death at ripe age. His son in turn was the Christian Kornike (Cornube) who supported the construction of the church of Kaga and sired Sverker the Elder.Ahnlund, Nils, \\"Vreta klosters äldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 341. This does not fit with available data about Erik Årsäll. Moreover, the Swedish annal entry about King Sweyn's children seems to actually allude to the much later Swedish pretender Kol (c. 1170) and his brother Ubbe (Ulf). Finally, some sources identify Erik Årsäll with the historical King Erik Segersäll (d. c. 995), or insert him between this king and his son Olof Skötkonung (d. c. 1022). The identity of Erik Årsäll can therefore not be established with any confidence.

Life and career Born in Grumbach in the Rhine Province, he attended school in Cologne, and later studied economics and social sciences at Frankfurt University, when Franz Neumann was there and at Cologne Handelshochschule (a business college). He graduated in 1926 as a Diplom- Kaufmann (MBA). A year later, he studied for one term at the Sorbonne in Paris and prepared his dissertation on agrarian conditions of France in 19th century and the agrarian program of the French socialist parties. In 1928, he returned to Frankfurt University to study with Wilhelm Gerloff and attained a doctorate with his thesis. In January 1928, Paul Massing met Julian Gumperz and his wife Hede Gumperz. It was not long before Hede had fallen in love with Massing: \\"My relationship with Paul grew like something so natural and so completely uncontrollable that it is almost impossible to recall how it started. Its beginning is clouded and veiled, as is, I suppose, the beginning of all great passions; something that should not be probed or searched for, but left complete and untouched as in sacred keeping.\\" From Frankfurt Massing, followed by his future wife Hede (then, Hede Gumperz), a longtime communist and recently recruited Soviet spy, went to Moscow, where he worked until 1931 at the International Agrarian Institute. When he returned to Germany in 1931, Paul Massing was active with the illegal M-section of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Berlin. He also helped his later wife with her GRU work. In 1933, Massing was arrested by the National Socialists under the Enabling Act. Freed by an amnesty after five-month solitary confinement in Sachsenhausen, Massing wrote his autobiographic novel Schutzhäftling 880, published in 1935 under his pseudonym Karl Billinger, dedicated to all comrades in concentration camps. In the United States, this book was published in part in the New Masses. Massing continued to write about Hitler insisting that Hitler is no Fool!. After his release, he left Germany for Paris and then the United States, but was sent back to Germany and other European countries from time to time to work for the communist resistance. Time spent in Joseph Stalin's Moscow and barely survived led to the later strong criticism of Soviet communism. In spite of this experience, the couple \\"continued to render modest assistance\\" to Soviet intelligence during the years of World War II. Back in the U.S., the Massings lived in an old farmhouse Quakertown, Pennsylvania. When the FBI questioned Hede Massing about Gerhart Eisler, her first husband from 1919 to 1923, who had been an illegal immigrant and an agent for the Comintern to the U.S. in the 1930s, but was now (from 1941) a legal refugee, both began slowly to confess their Soviet work. Hede's memoir of their life in Communist intelligence, This Deception was published in 1951. It shows the hardships they had had to endure and their strange life working first for the GRU and later, the KGB. Paul Massing later left Hede for sociologist Herta Herzog. In 1942, Massing worked at the Institute of Social Research at Columbia University in New York. In August 1942, Paul Massing notified NKVD that his friend, Franz Neumann, had recently joined the Office of Strategic Services. Massing reported to Moscow that Neumann had told him that he had produced a study of the Soviet economy for the OSS's Russian Department.http://spartacus-educational.com/Paul_Massing.htm In April 1943, Elizabeth Zarubina met with Neumann: \\"(Zarubina) met for the first time with (Neumann) who promised to pass us all the data coming through his hands. According to (Neumann), he is getting many copies of reports from American ambassadors ... and has access to materials referring to Germany.\\" Verona File 28734 page 28 From 1948 and for many years, Paul Massing taught political sociology at Rutgers University in New Jersey. His most important work is Rehearsal for Destruction: A Study Of Political Anti-Semitism in Imperial Germany (1950), which was translated into German by Felix Weil and published in 1959 as Vorgeschichte des politischen Antisemitismus ('Prehistory of Political Anti-Semitism') with a preface by Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. In 1977, he returned to Grumbach with Herta Herzog-Massing, but had only two years to live. He is buried at the family plot at Grumbach.

The title is taken from a notable speech in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, quoted in Serling's closing narration at the end of the episode. It was loosely adapted into the first segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie. Opening narration Plot On August 6, 1945, Second Lieutenant Katell has just arrived at the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, and he orders his war- weary soldiers to make a desperate attack on a group of sick and wounded Japanese soldiers holed up in a cave. Seasoned veteran Sergeant Causarano tries to talk him out of it as he knows that the men have had enough of war and that \\"the attack will accomplish nothing but pointless deaths on both sides\\". Katell refuses to listen and stands firm on his orders, intent on proving himself and earning his rank. He berates the platoon, demanding that they shape up. Katell then accidentally drops his binoculars. When he goes to retrieve them, he finds himself in Corregidor fighting in the Imperial Japanese Army as a Japanese man named Lt. Yamuri. The year is now 1942, and he is ordered to attack a group of sick and wounded American soldiers who are holed up in a cave. Having found a new perspective, he tries in vain to dissuade the captain from the attack, arguing that the Americans inside the cave pose no threat and can be bypassed. The Japanese captain bluntly refuses to listen, suspecting that the young man is either sick with jungle fever or has lost his nerve to fight. He tells him to straighten up or stay with the wounded, but Yamuri does not back down. The captain then relieves him of command and moves the company forward to begin the attack anyway. Katell then finds himself back in 1945 as an American soldier. His men tell him that they've just gotten word that the atomic bomb has been dropped. They have been ordered not to attack the cave, but instead to fall back and wait to see how Japan responds. Causarano sardonically assures him \\"I wouldn't fret. I'm sure there'll be other wars, other countries, other human beings you can knock off.\\" As the platoon withdraws, Katell says to himself \\"I hope not. God help us, I hope not.\\" Closing narration Cast * Dean Stockwell as Lt. Katell/Lt. Yamuri * Albert Salmi as Sgt. Causarano * Rayford Barnes as Andrew J. Watkins * Ralph Votrian as Hanacheck * Leonard Nimoy as Hansen * Dale Ishimoto as Sergeant Yamazaki * J. H. Fujikawa as Japanese Captain Some of the cast members became well-known in later science-fiction television series. Dean Stockwell became known to science-fiction fans as Al Calavicci in the television series Quantum Leap, and for another generation, as Cavil in the remake series of Battlestar Galactica. Leonard Nimoy became known as Spock in Star Trek. Adaptation The episode was remade into the first segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), with an updated approach in which the main character played by Vic Morrow is a racist who is upset after he is passed over for a promotion in favor of a Jewish man. He goes into a bigoted rant in a bar, then he is taken on a trip through time. He finds himself a Jewish man during the Holocaust, a black man being lynched by the Ku Klux Klan, and a Vietnamese man being attacked by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. John Landis directed the scene, but Morrow and two young child actors were killed during a helicopter stunt during the Vietnam segment. Landis and the film's producers were put on trial for manslaughter and child endangerment but were found not guilty on all counts. The script called for Connor to be redeemed by saving the two children, but Morrow's death necessitated a darker ending because the available footage did not include the happy ending. However, the original ending was featured in the novelization.

The film was a financial success, debuting at number one at the Australian box office in the week of its launch. Plot Advocate Steve Myers (Billy Connolly) is a disillusioned lawyer who becomes fed-up with the perceived corruption within the judicial system. He quits the law business and buys a small fishing boat and takes up fishing for a living. His fishing boat is struck by lightning and explodes into pieces, burns and sinks. He informs his insurance company, which reviews and then subsequently declines his claim on the grounds that it is not liable as his fishing boat was destroyed due to an \\"Act of God\\". Frustrated that his claim is repeatedly declined, Steve files a claim against God, naming church officials as representatives of God and thereby the respondents. The church leaders, their respective lawyers and their insurance company get together to find a way to settle this dilemma, which catches the fancy of the media. It is in Court that God's representatives will have to admit that the destruction of Steve's fishing boat was actually God's Act, accept and compensate him, or deny it altogether thereby denying God's existence, leaving the onus on Steve to prove his claim. Steve's battle brings media attention leading to a meeting with journalist Anna Redmond (Judy Davis) who helps to raise his public profile, enlisting the support of others who had fallen victim to insurance companies' \\"Acts of God\\" clause. He also faces heavy criticism and protests from religious groups as his profile grows, and he backs the church into a disadvantageous position. However, the attention takes its toll on Steve's family, who are exploited by the media, his ex-wife already crippled by debt as the guarantor of the boat. Steve faces a reality check as his family considers moving to Perth, on the other side of the country. Meanwhile, Anna Redmond comes under fire for a history of disputes and attacks on insurance companies, drawing criticism that the case is little more than a publicity stunt. Facing a drawn out legal battle and the impact it would have on those around him, Steve decides he has won a moral victory, and withdraws from the case but not before convincing the judge that insurance companies' use of the term \\"Acts of God\\" is a misleading term.

Originally producer Ben Gannon had wanted to shoot the scenes around Pittwater north of Sydney, but later settled on the small village of Bermagui, New South Wales on the state's South Coast due to the production values it afforded. Bermagui had been suggested by director Mark Joffe as it was his favourite holiday spot. The fishing boat featured in the film was a charter vessel the 'Tarpin', hired from Bermagui Boat Harbour. Indoor scenes and post-production were located in Sydney. On 15 February Bob Carr, then Premier of New South Wales visited the set, presenting a cheque for $50,000 to Gannon Films as a grant to offset the cost of filming in a regional location. The two-week shoot brought an estimated $250,000 to the local economy. Reception =Commercial= The Man Who Sued God made a debut at number one on its opening weekend with a box office. Within Australia, it earned $8.1 million by the end of that year and ultimately grossed A$8,546,867. =Critical= Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 71% based on 7 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10.

The show was hosted by Nipsey Russell with Lee Menning as co-host. Announcing duties were handled by Gene Wood for the first month and John Harlan for the rest of the run, with Johnny Haymer and Johnny Gilbert as substitutes. This show was the first series produced by Sande Stewart, son of game show producer Bob Stewart. Your Number's Up was put up against the elder Stewart's The $25,000 Pyramid on CBS at 10:00 AM Eastern. Most of the staff from Bob Stewart Productions also worked in the production of this series. Rules Three on-stage contestants, two new challengers and one returning champion, were each given one point at the outset of the game, indicated by diamonds on the front of their podiums. Encircling the contestants' podiums was an electronic wheel with digits 0–9, blank spaces, and a car symbol. The digits and symbols were spaced so that the wheel would stop with either a blank at one contestant's position and a digit at the other two, or a car at one position and blanks at the others. The contestant in control spun the wheel by pulling a lever. If it stopped on two digits and a blank, the contestant with the blank was read the first halves of two riddle-type phrases, each with an acronym to be filled in. An example of these would be as follows: \\"When T.O. speaks...\\" \\"As predicted, the I.O.M....\\" After the contestant selected one of the two phrases, the host read its second half to the other two contestants. (Example: after selecting the first phrase above, the host read \\"...all of the House listens.\\" Answer: Tip O'Neill, who was serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the time.) The first contestant to buzz-in and fill in the acronym correctly scored one point and spun the wheel for the next turn; incorrect guesses deducted one point, but scores could never go below zero. If neither opponent guessed correctly, the contestant who selected the riddle won $50 and spun the wheel, but did not score any points. The first contestant to score six points won the game and $500. If the car symbol appeared under a contestant's pointer, that contestant attempted to guess which digit was hidden under a question mark on a car's license plate. The first three weeks of the series used a new plate for each attempt. Later, a single plate was used, with previous incorrect digits automatically eliminated from each subsequent attempt. Guessing correctly won the contestant the car regardless of the game's outcome. =Audience game= When a contestant answered a riddle correctly, that contestant's digit was added to a board hanging above the stage. At any point during the game, if the last four digits of any studio audience member's phone number appeared on the board (in any order, not necessarily in sequence), that audience member came up on stage to predict which contestant would win the game. A maximum of three audience members could participate in this manner during any one game, with each choosing a different contestant. If an audience member correctly chose the winner, that member won a trip. If a digit was duplicated in an audience member's phone number, they had to wait until all instances of that digit were placed on the board. For example, an audience member with \\"1234\\" needed one of each digit to come on stage, while one with \\"5555\\" needed four 5's to be eligible. =Home Viewer Game= Home viewers, playing the same game as the studio audience, could send postcards in to the correct mailing address if all their numbers were crossed out. Postcards were eventually placed into a rotating drum, and one was selected by the winning contestant (see below). Bonus round The winner drew a postcard sent in by a home viewer, who immediately won $1,000. Prior to the first episode, postcards were obtained via an ad in TV Guide; during the show's run, viewers with telephone numbers whose last four digits appeared on the main game board were eligible to send in cards. The contestant then had 60 seconds to reveal the last four digits of the chosen viewer's phone number. He/she selected a digit 0–9 from a board which resembled a touch-tone phone keypad, with an acronym displayed below each digit, and a clue was read. (Example: T.P.E. delivered the mail by horse - answer: The Pony Express.) If the contestant answered correctly, all instances of the chosen digit in the home viewer's phone number (if any) were revealed and the digit was removed from the board. If the contestant answered incorrectly or passed, a new acronym was put below that digit. The contestant won $100 for each correct answer, or $5,000 for revealing the entire number. If the contestant won the bonus game on any day from Monday through Thursday, the home viewer received an additional $1,000; a Friday win awarded $5,000 more. After the series was canceled, 15 home viewers won $1,000 each in a random drawing from the unused postcards.

Blood-spinning is a medical procedure used to shorten the healing time of an injury. Small samples of the patient's blood are taken and spun in a centrifuge, allowing platelets and blood plasma to be isolated from other blood components. The platelets and plasma are then combined forming platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which has high concentrations of natural growth factors. The PRP sample can then be injected into the patient's injury, which may help reduce pain and improve recovery speeds.  Use in professional sports  This procedure has been deemed controversial at times, especially when used by athletes. In 2005, the World Anti-Doping Agency ruled that blood-spinning could be used to introduce banned substances, and in 2010 the agency went as far as banning the use of intramuscular injections of PRP in competitive athletes amid some concerns that it boosted performance- enhancing growth factors. However, that ban was lifted the following year, after it was concluded that there was a \\"lack of any current evidence concerning the use of these methods for purposes of performance enhancement\\". There is some debate about the effectiveness of the procedure on improving healing times, with some doctors suggesting the evidence is inconclusive or contentious. Numerous professional athletes in a variety of sports have used blood-spinning to help recover from injuries, including professional tennis player Rafael Nadal, professional golfer Tiger Woods, and former NFL player Hines Ward. The practice is allowed by FIFA and has been used in the UK at Tottenham Hotspur, and at Chelsea during José Mourinho's managerial stint at the club.

It is the first novel by the writer Julian Branston and concerns the writing of the novel Don Quixote. The U.S. title refers to a famous episode on Don Quixote where the title character comes upon a windmill and mistakes it for a giant. Plot summary The Eternal Quest covers a short period of time in Spain in the early 17th century during the reign of King Philip III. The events in the novel circle around Miguel de Cervantes and his attempts to complete and publish the first book of Don Quixote. The Eternal Quest provides a fictionalized rendering of that time, including an intrigue to stop Cervantes from publishing his work, set in the then-capital of Valladolid. Branston takes Cervantes’ comic style and grafts it on to his miniaturization of the Don Quixote myth. Although Cervantes himself is a character in this novel, much of the action centers on a character known only as the Old Knight, a soldier in the army of King Philip II and officer under the Duke of Alva who has gone mad from the violence of war. He now believes himself to be a soldier sent on a quest by God. Pedro, a friend of Cervantes and local trader, sees the Old Knight and tells Cervantes about him, inspiring the writer to create a series of short stories, published individually as pamphlets by the local printer Robles, about the comic adventures of a confused, self-proclaimed knight named Don Quixote. These events are set against a backdrop of political intrigue surrounding the impending appointment of a new poet laureate to the “emperor” (King Philip III). The marquis of Denia approaches the duchess, a widow who oversees an academy of poets and artists, to boast that he controls the emperor’s appointments and will decide who the new poet laureate shall be. He is met at the duchess’ mansion by Ongora, a local poet of small talents and great ambitions, who subsequently hatches a plot to disgrace Cervantes and elevate himself into the new royal position. The novel itself then follows three tracks: *The meanderings of the Old Knight through Valladolid, including his encounters with the other characters and his Quixote-like confusion of ordinary objects (e.g., Pedro’s family pot) for great artifacts (the sword of Lancelot); *The efforts by Cervantes to complete his work and maintain his reputation, even as the Old Knight appears to come to life from his pamphlets; and *Ongora’s plot, which involves having the duchess write a satire of Don Quixote in the form of a rejection letter from Dulcinea, with Ongora himself writing a scathing introduction in which he claims to have cuckolded Cervantes, and publishing both anonymously. The Old Knight’s misadventures take on a mystical quality, as he defeats stronger and better-armed enemies and always seems to arrive at scenes in the nick of time to stop some evil from being done. He eventually concludes that Ongora is a warlock and calls him the “Evil Magician of Bad Verse.” When Cervantes sees the satire and introduction, he approaches the duchess directly to offer to work with her on future writings if she will explain the reason for the violence of the introduction (which Cervantes believes was also written by the duchess). The duchess, who had not seen the introduction, then disavows Ongora and offers her financial and political support to Cervantes. Thus spurned, Ongora hires an assassin to kill Cervantes, but this attempt is foiled by the Old Knight, who knocks the assassin out with Pedro’s pot. Ongora eventually slays the Old Knight, who dies in Cervantes’ house, only to come back to life and die permanently with his head on Cervantes’ shoulder in front of the “Holy Grail” (an olive tree in Cervantes’ yard). Ongora tries to exact one last revenge by publishing various poor imitations of Don Quixote to stain Cervantes’ reputation, but these only serve to secure Cervantes' fame. Ongora is banished from the Spanish empire and Don Quixote is published to great acclaim.

Perdue and McCrory remained close, with the two often polling in a statistical tie in what was the closest race for governor in the nation. Perdue ran slightly behind her opponent in polls released the week before the election. Pundits speculated that Perdue was hurt by current Democratic Governor Mike Easley's decreasing popularity due to the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis, and McCrory's efforts to tag her as part of corruption in Raleigh—consultants mentioned Perdue's \\"difficulty of being the candidate of continuity in a change election.\\" =Campaign= Early in 2008, Libertarian nominee Munger called Perdue a \\"Stepford Wife\\" and said the Republican nominees were \\"circus clowns.\\" Prior to May 2008, the North Carolina Libertarian Party and Munger gathered 100,000 signatures of voters in order to qualify to appear on North Carolina's ballot.

Its population as of 1990 was 11,518; its population as of 2000 was 11,169. It is sometimes considered a suburb or small town within Panama City, northeast of the limits of the town of Balboa. Ancon Hill is also the name of a large hill that overlooks Panama City and once served as a form of protection from pirates and sea invasion. The township was originally located around this hill, and was created to house employees of the Panama Canal during its construction. As part of the construction effort, the historic Gorgas Army Hospital was founded and built on the hillside. The first ship to officially transit the canal, , was named after the district. The community continued to serve as housing for employees of the Panama Canal Company until 1980, when parts of it began to be turned over to the Panamanian government under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Modern-day Ancón is a corregimiento (the Panamanian equivalent of a suburb in the United States) of Panama City, serving mainly as a residential area. The Gorgas Army Hospital building is now the Panamanian Oncology Hospital, primarily used for cancer research. The area also houses Panama's Supreme Court, just a few feet away from the Gorgas Army Hospital building, and several Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute buildings for research into tropical biology. Ancón is also a parish (parroquia) of the District of Panama, located in the Panama Canal adjacent area. History The area where the district of Ancón is located was always conceived as a place of transit. From the Spanish arrival on the Isthmus of Panama in 1501, it was thought to build there a road between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, an idea that was materialized with the construction of the Panama Canal.http://www.concejopanama.gob.pa/concejo/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=51&Itemid;=52title=Corregimiento de Ancón - Consejo Municipal de Panamá During the years when the Panama Canal was under the control of the United States, many administrative facilities, military bases, and communities were built in the adjacent areas, forming part of the former Panama Canal Zone. When these areas were reverted to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, several alternatives were proposed to integrate the district to the city of Panama. The current district of Ancón was created when a new political-administrative division for the reverted areas was adopted, by Act No. 18 of August 29, 1979, and later amended by Law No. 1 of October 27, 1982. The areas located in the Pacific sector became part of this district, while those located on the Atlantic side were incorporated into the district of Cristobal, in the province of Colon. They remain characterized by a strong US urban architectural style. Economy Due to its geographical location, the district of Ancón is of great importance for the economy of Panama. In it are located most of the administrative facilities and services related to the Panama Canal. Balboa is home to the port of Panama City. The district also home to the Administrative Unit of Reverted properties of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, established in 2007 as a replacement for the former Inter-Oceanic Region Authority. Many of the buildings belonging to former US military bases are today sites of Panamanian governmental and nongovernmental institutions, such as the City of Knowledge, the main science and technology park in the country, in the area of the former Fort Clayton. Besides its importance in the fields of trade and intermodal transportation, the district is becoming increasingly relevant in terms of services and tourism. Ancón is home to the Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport, the Grand National Transportation Terminal, and Albrook Mall, the largest mall in the country. Amador Causeway Sites of interest The district of Ancón includes the Parque Natural Metropolitano, a vast jungle located a few minutes from the city, and its highest elevation, Ancon Hill. In its urban areas, you can visit several historical sites of the Panamanian capital, the building that houses the headquarters of the Panama Canal Authority, popularly known as the Administration Building. The Amador Causeway, a section of which runs over the sea, joining three small Pacific islands, is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, with marinas, restaurants, bars, and discothèques. There is also the Figali Convention Center, while the Museum of Biodiversity, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry, is currently in construction.http://amadorcausewaypanama.com/amador-causeway-outstretched-arm- panama-city-panamatitle=Amador Causeway, the outstretched arm of Panama City, Panama See also * Postage stamps and postal history of the Canal Zone  References  Corregimientos of Panamá Province Panama Canal Zone Townships Populated places in Panamá Province Panamá District ","title":"Ancón, Panama"},{"id":"2982232","text":"\\"Nothing in the Dark\\" is episode 81 of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone, originally airing on January 5, 1962. This is one of two episodes that were filmed during season two but held over for broadcast until season three, the other being \\"The Grave\\". Opening narration Plot Wanda Dunn, a frail and elderly woman, huddles in a dark basement apartment in an abandoned tenement. She is awakened by an altercation outside, in which Harold Beldon, a young police officer, is shot and falls just outside her door. He cries out that he is dying and pleads for her help, but she is afraid that he is \\"Mr. Death\\" trying to trick her into letting him in. She has no phone to call a doctor, and he continues begging her to help him, so she relents. She is relieved when she touches him and doesn't die, which convinces her that he is not Death after all. She helps him inside and stabilizes his condition. Explaining her reluctance to help him, she describes how she saw Death in the form of a man take an old woman's life just by touching her, and that she has seen him many times since then with different faces. A man knocks on the door, and Harold persuades Wanda to answer him. The man forces the door open and she collapses from terror. When she regains consciousness, the man apologizes amiably and explains he is a building contractor and is tasked to demolish the building in an hour. In an explanation of his role which doubles as an allegory for death as part of the circle of life, he tries to persuade her that his work is both necessary and good, since the building is no longer fit for habitation and demolishing it clears the way for new buildings. He firmly indicates that she has been given due notice, and if she will not leave he will call the police to force her from the premises. She turns to Harold for help, but the contractor doesn't see him, and leaves to get the authorities. It dawns on Wanda that Harold is in fact Death. He explains with a friendly smile that he set up the ruse to gain her trust and convince her that he means her no harm. Wanda continues her protests that she doesn't want to die. But he gently coaxes her, assuring her she has nothing to fear, and finally persuades her to give him her hand. Before she even realizes anything has changed, she finds herself standing beside her own dead body. Wanda and Harold walk arm in arm through the doorway, up the stairs, outside into the sunlight.

It is Latin for On behalf of Marcellus. Background Marcus Claudius Marcellus was descended from an illustrious Roman family, and had been Consul with Servius Sulpicius Rufus, in which office he had given great offence to Caesar by making a motion in the Senate to deprive him of his command. In the Civil War, he supported Pompey, and had been present at the Battle of Pharsalia, after which he retired in exile to Lesbos. But, after some time, the Senate interceded with Caesar to pardon him, and allow him to return. When he yielded to their entreaties, Cicero made a speech, thanking Caesar for his magnanimity; though he had, as he says himself,Epistulae ad Familiares. iv. 4 determined to say nothing; but he was afraid that if he continued silent Caesar would interpret it as a proof that he despaired of the Republic. Caesar, though he saw the Senate unanimous in their petition for Marcellus, yet had the motion for his pardon put to the vote, and called for the opinion of every individual senator on it.

Pete Chalos was the second-longest-serving mayor in the history of Terre Haute, Indiana, serving from 1980 to 1996. Chalos' four consecutive terms as mayor place him behind only Ralph Tucker, who served from 1948 to 1968. Biography Chalos, the son of a Greek immigrant who operated a downtown Terre Haute hat shop and shoeshine parlor that employed future entertainer Scatman Crothers, ran track and cross country at Wiley High School in Terre Haute and later became a teacher and a successful coach in the Vigo County and Clay County public schools. An opponent of Indiana's 1959 law requiring school consolidation, Chalos stated that he favored small community schools. His view of the community school as a gathering place and source of identity for a town was (and is) shared by more than a few older Hoosiers who still bemoan their loss more than 45 years after the law was passed. Chalos was elected to the Terre Haute City Council in 1971, serving eight years, and then won election as Terre Haute's mayor in 1979, serving in that office from 1980 to 1996. During his years in city politics, Terre Haute slowly shed its image as a Midwestern \\"Sin City\\" that had existed for many years since it once was home to a thriving \\"red light district\\" and, for a short time (between September and November 1957), an international gambling syndicate. Chalos sought a fifth term as mayor in 1995, but was defeated by then-Vigo County Sheriff James Jenkins, who went on to win the general election that fall. After leaving office, Chalos remained committed to the community. He took part in the ceremonial opening of Terre Haute's extended First Street corridor, a project which was initially proposed during his years as mayor, in June 2005. In addition, he published four books: \\"Growing Up in Terre Haute,\\" about his childhood; \\"Just a Thought\\"; \\"Mayor\\"; and \\"Speak Out\\". Chalos also authored a column which was published regularly in the Terre Haute Tribune-Star newspaper. Chalos died of natural causes on June 4, 2006. References *\\"P.

Electronic music in STEIM's context is always strongly related to the physical and direct actions of a musician. In this tradition, STEIM supports artists in residence such as composers and performers, but also multimedia and video artists to develop setups which allow for improvisation and performance with individually designed technology.  Background  STEIM has existed since 1969. It was founded by Misha Mengelberg, Louis Andriessen, Peter Schat, Dick Raaymakers, Jan van Vlijmen, Reinbert de Leeuw, and Konrad Boehmer. This group of Dutch composers had fought for the reformation of Amsterdam's feudal music structures; they insisted on Bruno Maderna's appointment as musical director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and enforced the first public fundings for experimental and improvised electronic music in the Netherlands. They were offered a budget for their collective multimedia opera \\"Reconstruction\\" which was premiered in the Holland Festival in 1969. The technology used in this opera was then taken to Amsterdam's Prinseneiland which was STEIM's first location. Soon, in 1971, the studio moved to the Groenburgwal in the city center, where there was more space for workshops and concerts. Since 1986, STEIM has been at the Achtergracht in the city center's southern area. Its premises include three studios, a concert hall, hard and software workshops, offices, and a guesthouse for artists in residence.

As in traditional musical instruments, it is believed here that also in contemporary developments the physical touch of a musician contains essential aesthetic factors. These qualities tend to get lost in the non-realtime use of studio technology, in which the process of music production gets rather rational but bodily involved. The Touch philosophy — which can be considered as STEIM's interpretation of the widely used term interactivity — theoretically subsumes several stages of STEIM's developments, from the analogue touchable \\"Crackle\\" surfaces in the 1970s to today's experimental Gestural MIDI Interfaces.  Structure and people  STEIM is a foundation, financially supported by the Dutch ministry of Culture. It invites international artists in residence of different musical and artistic styles and scenes. Aside from offering support in theoretic and practical development of contemporary musical instruments, STEIM also hosts in-house concerts, exhibitions and workshops. The work in progress of supported artists is presented in open studio events. =Artistic/managing directors= * Peter Schat, 1971-1973 * Michel Waisvisz, 1981-2008 * Dick Rijken, since 2009 =Artistic guest directors= * George Lewis; Joel Ryan; Clarence Barlow, 1985 - ca. 1990 * Nicolas Collins, 1992-1995; * Steina Vasulka, 1996-1997; * Sally Jane Norman, 1998-2000; * Daniel Schorno; Netochka Nezvanova, 2001-2003 * Daniel Schorno, 2003-2004; * Jan St. Werner, 2004-2006; * Mazen Kerbaj; Atau Tanaka, 2006-2008; * Tarek Atoui; Tina Blaine, 2008; * Takuro Mizuta Lippit; 2008-2013 =Artistic residency= * Kasia Glowicka (2011) * Mark Trayle (2010) * Henry Vega (2009/10) * John Richards (2007) * Benton C Bainbridge (1999) * Peter Cusack (1996) * Tom Cora (1992) * Dominic Alldis (1988)  See also  * Netochka Nezvanova - artistic guest director at STEIM, 2001-2003 * V2 Institute for the Unstable Media * WORM, organisation in Rotterdam * iii (Instrument Inventors Initiative), organisation in The Hague References  External links  * *crackle.org — Archive Site of Michel Waisvisz’ works *Spekle, Roland and Michel Waisvisz. “STEIM — A Reconstruction.” STEIM Writings. =Artist projects realised at STEIM= *Golden, Barbara. “Conversation with Laetitia Sonami.” eContact! 12.2 — Interviews (2) (April 2010).

Early life Gold was born in Cleveland, Ohio in a Russian Jewish family, and raised in Lakewood, a community he was later to memorialize in his first book, Birth of a Hero, published in 1951 by Viking Press. He moved to New York City at age 17 after several of his poems had been accepted by New York literary magazines. While there, he studied philosophy at Columbia University and became involved with the burgeoning Beat Generation, which resulted in a lifelong friendship with writer Allen Ginsberg. Career Gold won a Fulbright Scholarship and moved to Paris, where he finished his first novel. After that, he moved around as he wrote, traveling to Haiti and Detroit, and hitchhiking all over the United States. He married Edith Zubrin and had two daughters with her, Ann Gold (b. 1950) and Judith Gold (b. 1952). They later divorced, and he finally settled in San Francisco, where he became an important fixture in the literary scene. In 1958 Gold taught English literature at Cornell University, as Vladimir Nabokov's temporary successor. Genesis West (Vol. 6), was published in the Winter of 1964 with an interview of Herbert Gold by Gordon Lish. Personal life Gold was married to Melissa Dilworth and had three children with her: daughter Nina Gold and twin boys Ari Gold and Ethan. After they divorced, she became involved with concert promoter Bill Graham, and died with Graham in a helicopter crash in 1991. He is a father of five (Ann, Judith, Nina, Ari, and Ethan), and a grandfather of six (Sarah, Sasha, and David Buscho, children of Ann; Sonia and Nora Heidenreich, daughters of Judith; and Ella, daughter of Nina).

The original score was composed by James Horner. The screenplay was adapted by David E. Kelley from the play of the same name by Michael Brady. Plot David Lewis (Peter Gallagher) is so affected by the death of his beautiful wife, Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer), who fell from the mast of their yacht on a sailing trip, that he turns their summer cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts into a permanent home and spends most of his time on the beach there, communicating with Gillian's spirit and unwittingly neglecting his daughter, Rachel (Claire Danes). On the second anniversary of Gillian's death, David invites her sister, Esther Wheeler (Kathy Baker), and her husband, Paul (Bruce Altman), to stay for the weekend. She insists on bringing a friend named Kevin Dollof (Wendy Crewson) whom she hopes David will become romantically interested in. He, however, ignores her in proceeding with a ritualistic celebration of Gillian's birthday. The events of the weekend cause the adults to re-examine their relationships; Esther and Paul have to deal with the problem posed to their marriage by Rachel's provocative friend, Cindy (Laurie Fortier), while, most importantly, David comes to realize that he can be a loving and attentive father to Rachel without betraying the memory of Gillian.

Reception The film currently holds a rating of 14% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews, indicating an overwhelmingly negative critical response. Emanuel Levy in Variety described the film as \\"a bargain-basement Ghost, a hybrid of an earnest, inspirational play and a sleek, calculated Lifetime telepic.\\" Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote: \\"It's not easy for the story's tear-jerking potential to be realized when its characters express their pain as if they were writing greeting cards.\\" The Washington Post wrote that \\"for all the moonlight and magic, the film scares up little in the way of enchantment.\\" Many critics found it difficult to accept the basic premise, that the main character's continued mourning of his deceased wife was so detrimental to those around him. Roger Ebert, in particular, expressed frustration: \\"The movie cannot see that Esther is a deranged nuisance who should mind her own business, that David is entitled to his grief, that Rachel is happy living on the island, and that if Gillian appears to David, so much the better.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Despite its apparent parallels to Ghost, Gillian takes an entirely opposite path. Throughout Ghost, we were made to feel desperate for a reunion of Patrick Swayze's roaming spirit with a mourning Demi Moore. In Gillian, the whole purpose is to get David to give up the ghost.\\" Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle thought the film lacked dramatic impetus: \\"the grieving husband never quite seems crazy enough - and the sister is never angry enough...drama is avoided. Issues are muddy. And everyone stays a nice person... In fact, typical of the film's undramatic choices - it's ungenerous unwillingness to commit to the extreme - the husband knows she [Gillian] is an illusion. So he's not crazy. She's not a ghost. And the sister-in-law, far from evil, is merely concerned. So why are we watching these people?\\" One aspect that garnered unanimous praise was Danes' performance as the troubled daughter. Variety wrote \\"Danes proves again that she's one of the most naturally gifted actresses of her generation.\\" The New York Times described her as \\"especially expressive in the film's later scenes, demonstrating a rare ability to seem fresh and honest when her material quite clearly is not.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote \\"Danes is terrific playing an awkward teenager trying to understand her father's problems while feeling the first stirrings of passion in herself.\\" According to the Washington Post, \\"the gifted actress steals the show.\\" Awards and nominations Claire Danes won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film - Supporting Young Actress.

Summer course on cryptography, MIT, 1996-2001 The pigeonhole principle means that any hash function with more inputs than outputs will necessarily have such collisions; the harder they are to find, the more cryptographically secure the hash function is. The \\"birthday paradox\\" places an upper bound on collision resistance: if a hash function produces N bits of output, an attacker who computes only 2N/2 (or \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{ 2^N}) hash operations on random input is likely to find two matching outputs. If there is an easier method than this brute-force attack, it is typically considered a flaw in the hash function.Pass, R. \\"Lecture 21: Collision-Resistant Hash Functions and General Digital Signature Scheme\\". Course on Cryptography, Cornell University, 2009 Cryptographic hash functions are usually designed to be collision resistant. However, many hash functions that were once thought to be collision resistant were later broken. MD5 and SHA-1 in particular both have published techniques more efficient than brute force for finding collisions. However, some hash functions have a proof that finding collisions is at least as difficult as some hard mathematical problem (such as integer factorization or discrete logarithm). Those functions are called provably secure.

Rationale Collision resistance is desirable for several reasons. * In some digital signature systems, a party attests to a document by publishing a public key signature on a hash of the document. If it is possible to produce two documents with the same hash, an attacker could get a party to attest to one, and then claim that the party had attested to the other. * In some proof-of-work systems, users provide hash collisions as proof that they have performed a certain amount of computation to find them. If there is an easier way to find collisions than brute force, users can cheat the system. * In some distributed content systems, parties compare cryptographic hashes of files in order to make sure they have the same version. An attacker who could produce two files with the same hash could trick users into believing they had the same version of a file when they in fact did not.

Construction Warlber was laid down on 15 October 1953, Bellingham Shipyards, Bellingham, Washington; and was launched on 18 June 1954, as AMS-206; sponsored by Mrs. S. A. Blythe; reclassified as MSC-206 on 7 February 1955; and commissioned at the Naval Station, Tacoma, Washington, on 26 July 1955, Lieutenant (jg) James S. Elfelt in command.  West Coast operations  Following shakedown training, Warbler reported to Commander, Mine Force, Pacific Fleet, and operated locally out of Long Beach for the next year.  Western Pacific service  In August 1956, in company with , the minesweeper set sail for the Far East to assume duties as flagship for Mine Division (MinDiv) 32. Homeporting at Sasebo, Japan, Warbler would remain in the Far East over the next 14 years, participating in numerous mine exercises with the navies of other friendly Far Eastern nations such as South Korea, the Republic of China, the Philippines, and Japan. =Vietnam War service= Highlighting the ship's deployment to the western Pacific, Warbler conducted numerous tours of duty on \\"Operation Market Time\\" patrols off the coast of Vietnam to aid in the interdiction campaign to cut off the flow of arms and munitions to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. A small wooden craft especially designed for coastal minesweeping operations and deployments lasting from a few days to several weeks, Warbler and her sister minesweepers filled the gap between the heavier units of the fleet, like the destroyers and destroyer escorts, and the small craft used for patrol work, until built-for- the-purpose patrol craft could enter the fray. During her \\"Market Time\\" cruises, Warbler boarded many junks, ascertaining cargo and destination; investigated contacts of steel-hulled vessels picked up on radar; and endured what at times appeared to be \\"fearfully strong weather that seemed bent on total destruction\\" of the ship. At times, boarding of junks was an impossibility because of the vagaries of monsoon-type weather. During one \\"Market Time\\" patrol in the spring of 1968, Warbler conducted a joint salvage evolution with the salvage vessel . She located a downed F-100 Super Sabre fighter, and a wayward box of hypodermic needles. The ship also conducted extensive searches for an A-6 Intruder, a medevac helicopter, and two target drones. The minesweeper then cruised off the demilitarized zone (the DMZ) before heading home to Sasebo, via the Nationalist Chinese port of Kaohsiung. With 45 days of \\"Market Time\\" patrols under her belt in 1968, Warbler returned to the coast of Vietnam in January 1969, and patrolled briefly near the port of Vung Tau. Later that autumn, Warbler, in company with her sister-ship Whippoorwill, departed Sasebo on 5 September, bound for Taiwan and Mine Exercise Canned Heat. Unfortunately beset with mechanical difficulties, the ship went dead in the water in the Formosa Strait after attempted repairs at Keelung, Taiwan, had proved ineffective. Eight hours after the ship stopped, answered Warblers call for assistance and passed a tow to the heavily rolling minecraft. By 10 September, after rapid repairs at Kaohsiung, Warbler was ready for sea and participated in the scheduled slate of exercises. At the close of the year, the ship received counter-insurgency practice by tracking high speed patrol boats sent out for exercise purposes by Commander, Mine Flotilla 1. For two months in 1970, Warbler patrolled between Camranh Bay and Nha Trang, investigating suspicious contacts — none of which proved hostile. \\"Our greatest excitement during this patrol,\\" her commanding officer later wrote, \\"was provided by an occasional Soviet merchantman that would steam through our area and find himself shadowed and photographed by the mighty Warbler.\\" Decommissioning – Reserve ship Whippoorwill consequently relieved Warbler of \\"Market Time\\" duties on 19 July 1970, and the latter got underway from Camranh Bay for the succession of port visits. However, two days after leaving the bay, the ship received a message directing her to return to the United States for decommissioning. Departing Sasebo on 17 August, and sailing via Pearl Harbor for an overnight refueling stop, Warbler reached the west coast of the United States on 17 September, in company with , , and . On 1 October 1970, Warbler was decommissioned. Simultaneously placed in service as a Naval Reserve training (NRT) ship and homeported at Seattle, Washington, Warbler commenced her new duties soon thereafter. She trained reservists out of Seattle into the mid-1970s and was placed on the sale list in July 1975. Transfer to the Fijian Navy On 14 October 1975, she was sold to the Republic of Fiji, to serve as HMFS Kiro (MSC-206). On 10 October 1995, she was decommissioned. Disposal In September 1996, the decommissioned Kiro was to be disposed by sinking. The designated position for disposal was , however, the unfavorable weather and the very poor material condition of the ship hampered the attempt to tow her. The mast broke off and fell into the sea just as she was exiting the Suva Harbour channel, and later the towing pad eye was ripped off the deck, due its rotten state. Kiro drifted onto a reef at where she broke in two. The wreck was later doused with fuel and set on fire. She burned continuously for 19 hours leaving only the engines and the very lower part of the hull. Awards Warbler was awarded seven engagement stars for her important services on \\"Market Time\\" patrols.

Beserkley is usually regarded as a power pop and rock and roll label. During the 1970s, the label released albums by Earth Quake, Greg Kihn, Jonathan Richman, and The Modern Lovers, the Rubinoos, and the Tyla Gang. Several other artists appeared on singles, or on compilation albums. From 1980 to its dissolution in 1984, Beserkley was a one-artist label, the artist being Greg Kihn. History The label was founded by Matthew King Kaufman along with members of the Bay Area band Earth Quake. Kaufman was a law graduate who became co-manager of Earth Quake, and helped them sign with A&M; Records in 1970. After experiencing frustration at what he saw as A&M;'s incompetence in handling the band, and winning some compensation for the unauthorized use of Earth Quake's music in the movie The Getaway, he set up Beserkley Records, in 1973. Kaufman produced virtually all of Beserkley's output throughout its existence, often in association with Glenn Kolotkin, less frequently with Kenny Laguna. For the first two years of its existence, Beserkley only put out singles. The first release (in late 1973) was Earth Quake's version of the Easybeats' \\"Friday On My Mind\\". Initially none of the Beserkley singles were especially successful, but in 1975 some were assembled, together with newly recorded tracks, into the album Beserkley Chartbusters Vol. 1. As well as tracks by Earth Quake, this included tracks by power-pop group the Rubinoos, Jonathan Richman and Greg Kihn. Richman's recordings were his first as a solo performer (after the disbanding of the original Modern Lovers) and included the first released version of \\"Roadrunner\\", by Jonathan Richman backed by Earth Quake. Kaufman and Richman had previously worked together on the Modern Lovers' sessions for A&M; in 1972. In 1976, Kaufman licensed those recordings, together with the ones the band had made around the same time with producer John Cale for Warner Bros., and released them on Beserkley as the acclaimed album The Modern Lovers. Though neither Richman nor the Modern Lovers made the American charts, they were quite successful in the UK, with the singles \\"Roadrunner (Once)\\" and \\"Egyptian Reggae\\" making the Top 20. Other 1970s Beserkley acts had less commercial success, although the Rubinoos made the US charts, hitting #45 with a cover of \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\" in 1977. As well, Earth Quake made the lower rungs of the American LP charts with their second of four albums for Beserkley (1976's 8.5, which peaked at #151). Beserkley's records were initially distributed by Playboy Records until about 1977 (and during part of 1976, Playboy itself was distributed by CBS Records, and Beserkley was included in that arrangement, taking it from a small independently distributed label to briefly being a part of the huge CBS distribution system), then by Janus/GRT until 1979 and subsequently by Elektra. In 1978, the label commissioned a multi-artist project of 14 musicians from their roster, including Earth Quake and the Rubinoos. They were recorded playing oldies, both well-known and obscure, and traded lead vocals for each of the recordings, which were released as the LP Spitballs. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said, \\"I assume the title is a takeoff on Nuggets, and I approve of the concept ... I find most of the remakes amusing and one or two amazing. But inevitably, the music is ragged ... and I miss the pure dumb inspiration of the originals.\\" Beserkley's major breakthrough came with Greg Kihn, who sang backup on Earth Quake and Richman records before forming his own band. Beginning with his third album (1978's Next of Kihn), Kihn regularly made the American album charts and received steady airplay on FM radio. By the end of 1980, Kihn was the only artist on the Beserkley roster, and in 1981 he had his first top 40 hit with \\"The Breakup Song (They Don't Write 'Em)\\". Kihn's early 1980s albums Rockihnroll (1981), Kihntinued (1982) and Kihnspiracy (1983) all reached the top 40 on the LP charts, and his 1983 single \\"Jeopardy\\" became Beserkley's biggest-ever hit, peaking at US #2. The label's demise was relatively swift. After several years of success, Kihn's 1984 single \\"Reunited\\" flopped (peaking at #102) and the parent album Kihntagious stalled at #121 on the charts. Beserkley founder Kaufman then essentially dissolved the label and allowed Kihn to sign with major label EMI, where Kaufman would continue to act as Kihn's producer. The Beserkley catalogue was licensed to Rhino Records in 1986, and later to Castle Communications, Sanctuary Records, and BMG Rights Management. The label name was briefly reactivated in 1988 for a lone new album by Mrs. Green, produced by Kaufman and released only in the UK and Germany. Kaufman operated the Son of Beserkley label for a time in the 1990s; his current label is called Fun Fun Fun Recordings.

The couple had three children: Philippe (b. 1921), Élisabeth (1924–2013), and Anne (1928–1948), who was born with Down syndrome. Yvonne de Gaulle set up a charity, ', to help children with disabilities. Yvonne and Charles were married on 6 April 1921. She is known for the quote, \\"The presidency is temporary—but the family is permanent.\\" She and her husband narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on 22 August 1962, when their Citroën DS was targeted by machine gun fire arranged by Jean Bastien-Thiry at the Petit-Clamart. Like her husband, Yvonne de Gaulle was a conservative Catholic, and campaigned against prostitution, the sale of pornography in newsstands, and the televised display of nudity and sex, for which she earned the nickname Tante (Auntie) Yvonne. Later, she unsuccessfully tried to persuade de Gaulle to outlaw miniskirts in France. Yvonne was reputed to be very discreet; as such, despite numerous appearances, she never gave any radio or televised interviews, and the broader public never learned the sound of her voice. Biography =Origins= Yvonne Vendroux came from an industrial family in Calais. The family name actually originated from The Netherlands, changed from the Dutch \\"Van Droeg\\" when the family emigrated during the era of William of Orange (also known as William III of England). William had decided to flood the fields during the 17th century to push back against the advance of troops from King Louis XIV. Yvonne's ancestor then married a Calasienne during the French Revolution. Her father, Jacques, was the president of the Council of Administration of Biscuitry, while her mother, Marguerite (née Forest), came from a family in Ardennes, and became the sixth woman in France to obtain a driver's license. She was the granddaughter of Alfred Corneau, industriel de Charleville-Mézières. Les Vendroux passaient leurs étés dans le château ardennais de l’abbaye Notre-Dame de Sept-Fontaines. Her eldest brother, Jacques Vendroux, (born 1897) became deputy and mayor of Calais. Her younger brother, Jean (born 1901) married Madeleine Schallier (1907-2000), fathered seven children, and died in an auto accident in 1956. Her sister Suzanne Vendroux (February 28 1905 in Calais - December 27 1980 in Worthing, England) married Jean Rerolle (July 12 1897 in Châteauroux - March 23 1978, Neuilly- sur-Seine). on March 5th, 1934 in Fagnon. They had two children, Jacques-Henri (January 21, 1935, 17th arrondissement, Paris) and Marguerite-Marie. =Education= Yvonne's parents provided her with a strict education in keeping with their elevated social status and the nature of the era. She learned to read at home and studied with the Dominican Order of Asnières-sur- Seine (later moving to Périgueux, and was encouraged (as many girls were at the time) to become proficient in needlework. Children were encouraged to use the vousvoyer with their elders, and during World War I, went with their governesses to Canterbury, England, not returning to their parents in France until the end of the year. They were letter settled in Wissant, a seaside community in Calais along the English Channel. =Marriage to Charles de Gaulle= Yvonne met Charles de Gaulle in 1920, then a military captain returning from a mission in Poland. It was secretly arranged by the Vendroux family. Their first date was to the Grand Palais during the fall exhibition to see the painting _The Woman in Blue_ by Kees van Dongen. At a tea shortly after, Charles spilled his cup on young Yvonne's dress. Nonplussed, she laughed, and they continued courting. Charles invited Yvonne to a Saint-Cyr military ball at the Hotel des Réservoirs, in Versailles, in support of the institution where he had studied from 1912-1918. Two days later, Yvonne declared to her parents, \\"It will be him, or no one.\\" They were engaged on November 11, before the end of Captain de Gaulle's leave, and married on April 7, 1921, in the Notre-Dame de Calais church. De Gaulle played on Yvonne's family business when he expressed his joy on the occasion, writing to a friend, \\"I am marrying the biscuits of Vendroux.\\" They honeymooned in Northern Italy, and went on to have three children, a boy and two girls: * Philippe de Gaulle, (born December 28, 1921) * Élisabeth de Gaulle, (married in Boissieu) (May 15, 1924 - April 2, 2013) * Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928 - February 6, 1948) (died of bronchial pneumonia) =War Years= In 1934, the family maintained the \\"Brasserie,\\" property and renamed it \\"la Boisserie,\\" at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. A passionate horticulturist, Yvonne de Gaulle treated the garden as her domain. The high-walled surroundings were initially intended to protect their daughter Anne, with Down Syndrome, from the indiscretion of the public. When Anne passed in 1948 the family founded The Anne de-Gaulle Foundation in her memory at the château de Vert-Cœur, at Milon- la-Chapelle, directed by Georges Pompidou. Pompidou would subsequently become a close friend to the General. During World War II, Philippe joined the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL), while Yvonne de Gaulle and her husband went to London. General de Gaulle had initially advised her to go south with the children. She managed to make it to London by way of a Dutch ferry to Brest, then Falmouth. It was the last ship leaving the port. There they made the acquaintance of Sir Winston Churchill, who provided updates of their daily life until they were able to return home. Spouse of the President Yvonne de Gaulle became the unofficial First Lady of France on December 21st, 1958 when then-General de Gaulle was elected President of the French Republic. The couple took a Citroën to the President's residence, Elysée Palace. Her couturier was Jacques Heim. She was tenacious, conservative, but could also be warm. During her husband's tenure as president from 1959 to 1969, Yvonne de Gaulle led a sterile and measured life. On a typical day, she would enjoy three meals with her husband, reading Le Figaro at breakfast, evening television sessions, and Sunday masses at the palace chapel. She epitomized tradition, moral values, and a deep sense of duty. Her Catholic faith influenced the conservative view of her husband on moral matters; after her arrival at the palace, one of the first things she asked was for a pietà to be supplied to the Musée du Louvre. Later, when husband, invited actress Brigitte Bardot to their residence, she threatened to refuse her on the grounds that she had been divorced. She went on to intervene against the authorization of birth control pills. The couple welcomed Dwight Eisenhower and the Kennedys during their tenure. In 1961, when the American presidential couple John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy was invited by General de Gaulle, she took the initiative to forge links with the American first lady by taking her to visit the childcare school located on Boulevard Brune in the 14th arrondissement. After the Assassination of John F. Kennedy two years later, Madame de Gaulle invited her to rest and avoid media scrutiny in Paris. But soon the French family would have their own brush with uncertainty: on August 22nd, 1962, the de Gaulles were the target an assassination attempt in Clamart, organized by the French Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel, Jean Bastien-Thiry. As de Gaulle's black Citroën DS 19[2] sped through Petit-Clamart it was met by a barrage of submachine-gun fire. De Gaulle and his entourage, which included his wife, survived the attempt without any casualties or serious injuries while the attempt's perpetrators were subsequently all arrested and put on trial. Bastien-Thiry was convicted of leading the attempt in February 1963 at Fort d'Ivry, becoming the last person to be executed by firing squad in France. De Gaulle managed to laugh off the incident without disrespecting police. He was deeply impressed with his wife's stoicism, however, reportedly saying, \\"You are brave, Yvonne.\\" During the events of May_68, Yvonne accompanied her husband during his displacement to Baden-Baden. She opposed the \\"Communist\\" uprising and protests. Retirement and Death Upon Charles' resignation from the presidency in 1969, Yvonne accompanied him on a retirement trip to Ireland, famous for the photos of the couple and the aide-de-camp, General François Flohic, taken on the beach. Madame de Gaulle was widowed in 1970 and entering the retirement home of the sisters of the Immaculate Conception in Paris in 1978. She died at the Paris military hospital Val-de-Grâce hospital in Paris at the age of 79 the following year, on November 8th, 1979. She was the same age as her husband had been, on the eve of the ninth anniversary of his death. She rests at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises alongside her husband and their daughter Anne.

Hooped armour became extremely popular in the Saka, Parthian, and Kushan kingdoms and was used on both arms and legs. They can be seen at Khalchayan and on many pieces of Parthian artwork. In addition, two pieces were excavated at Taxila, dating to the 1st Century. Roman troops fought crupellarii in the revolt of Florus and Sacrovir of AD 21 .The Manica.

These extra pieces of armour may have been used as a protection against the Dacian falcēs, which were two-handed weapons which could hit with great force. Trajan's column in Rome seems to suggest that the lorica segmentata and the manica were only issued to Roman-born legionaries and not to auxiliaries. However, the Tropaeum Traiani, which is considered a better guide to the reality of field equipment, portrays Roman legionaries and heavy infantry auxiliaries equipped in the same fashion—both wearing scale body armour with manica arm guards.

These suggest that the manica was in use by the Roman military during the 1st century AD, independent from the Dacian wars. The sculpture at Alba Julia provides evidence of the manica in use in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD by the military. Ammianus describes Roman cavalry (probably cataphracts) on parade in AD 350 as \\"Laminarum circuli tenues apti corporis flexibus ambiebant per omnia membra diducti.\\" (Thin circles of iron plates, fitted to the curves of their bodies, completely covered their limbs).Ammianus Marcellinus.

Around 400 AD, manicae are represented on the Column of Arcadius and in the Notitia Dignitatum. Construction and use M. C. Bishop lists likely components as one shoulder plate, about 35 metal (ferrous or copper alloy) strips, 90-120 leathering rivets, 3 or 4 internal leathers, and one padded lining. The lining may have been a separate component, in order to avoid it being torn by the articulated metal plates. The metal strips were about 25 to 30 mm wide and 0.35 to 0.5 mm in thickness; they were longer at the top of the arm. Each strip had holes at its lower edge, through which flat-headed copper alloy rivets passed from the inside to hold the leather straps in place. It also had a hole punched at each end, which did not have a rivet and presumably served as an attachment point for an organic fastening. The lower few plates were in some cases riveted together, rather than articulated on leather. One depiction appears to show a manica terminating in a hand shape.Lorica Segmentata - (Vol. I.) - A Handbook of Articulated Roman Plate Armour.

The plates were probably not long enough to cover the whole circumference of the arm, but would have extended from the upper arm down to the thumb, leaving an unprotected area at the back. The plates overlapped upwards, directing any blow to the inside of the elbow which had a particularly dense coverage of multiple plates.

Ernest married Mollie Kile (or Kyle), a native Osage. Through various permutations, William King Hale had Mollie's sister Anna Brown killed in 1921. Anna's head rights were inherited by her mother Lizzie Q and Mollie. The death of Lizzie Q and several cousins left Mollie Burkhart and therefore Ernest as heirs to the headrights worth several hundreds of thousands of dollars in 1920s. Mollie fell ill and was later discovered to have been poisoned. When she moved away from Fairfax she recovered. She divorced Ernest afterward, and their children inherited Mollie's estate. Investigations The Osage Tribal Council suspected Hale early on, but couldn't elicit any testimony from the townspeople, many of whom Hale had bribed or threatened into silence. The council turned to the FBI, who sent four undercover agents to the Reservation who, over the next few years, gained the townspeople's trust enough that they began speaking out against Hale. Hale's nephew, whom he had coerced into helping with the scheme, confessed and charges were finally brought against Hale, as well as the contract killer Hale had hired to perform the murders and Hale's corrupt attorney. In 1929, Hale was convicted of ordering the murders, and imprisoned. Conviction and later life After four trials Hale was convicted before a Federal District Court in 1929 for only one killing - that of the shooting death of Anna Brown's cousin, Henry Roan, and sent to the Leavenworth prison in Kansas.

It formed a part of the Ancient Parish of Stepney. Together with the rest of Bow, it separated from Stepney to become a (late formed) Ancient Parish of Bow in 1719.T F T Baker (editor) (1998). \\"Stepney: Early Stepney\\".

It expanded rapidly in the Victorian era and was designated an independent Anglican parish in the mid-Victorian period, although civil administration has always been associated with Bow. =Location of the ford= Victorian OS maps show an illustrative location of the, by then, former ford, which was just to the south of the Northern Outfall Sewer and immediately south of the confluence of the Lea and the Hackney Brook. The confluence is likely to have caused the Lea to eddy and slow, causing much alluvial material from both watercourses to be dropped at this point, which may have been the reason that fording the river was possible here. This may have been reinforced by the factor that the Lea's tidal head was in the vicinity.http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/oldford.html Excavations have shown that in the Roman period, the ford lay a very short distance to the north of this point, immediately north of the Northern Outfall Sewer. The Romans dumped materials to improve the ford and at one time appear to have had a bridge over the Lea.http://www.lamas.org.uk/images/documents/Transactions59/039-060%20Crown%20Wharf.pdf Evidence has been found of a late Roman settlement at Old Ford dating from the 4th and 5th centuries. Excavations in 2002-3 discovered a substantial 'ribbon' development along the line of the road, surrounded by fields. Near the river there was evidence for a cluster of wooden buildings dominated by a large open-ended barn. Large amounts of cattle bone were also discovered, suggesting butchery to supply the London market. The Lea was thought to be used to supply Roman London with agricultural products and pottery from Hertsfordhire and the north. Old Ford was where the goods were transferred to continue their journey into London by wagon.Mapping the sub-surface drift geology of Greater London gravel extraction areas (MOLAS report for English Heritage 2002/3) accessed 28 March 2008 =Routes using the ford= Old Ford, as the name suggests, was the ancient most downstream crossing point of the then unchannelised River Lea. At this time the Lea was a wide fast-flowing river and the tidal estuary stretched as far as Hackney Wick. Two routes may have used the ford, both continuing through Essex and including Colchester amongst their destinations. ColchesterCeltic : Camulodunon, Roman : Camulodunum derived from Camulus, a Celtic God of War was where the Romans set up their initial capital for their occupation, and the road was upgraded to run from the area of London Bridge as one of the first paved Roman roads in Britain. The routes using the ford were: * A pre-Roman route that followed the modern Oxford Street and Old Street, through Bethnal Green to Old Ford and thence across a causeway through the marshes known as Wanstead Slip (now transferred to Leyton). * The Roman Road that emerged from London's Wall at Aldgate and went via Stratford and Chelmsford to Colchester and beyond. Beyond the M25, much of this route is now known as the A12. =The bridge= In 1110, Matilda, wife of Henry I, reputedly took a tumble at the ford on her way to Barking Abbey and ordered a distinctively bow-shaped three-arched bridge to be built over the River Lea. The building of the bridge at Bow didn't leave Old Ford as a backwater and the ford continued to be well used, but it was in an isolated and rural area and the local population centre moved to Bow in the middle ages. Old Ford was the site of one of the many watermills in the area that supplied flour to the bakers of Stratforde-atte-Bow, and hence bread to the City. Due to their isolation, residents were given dispensation to worship in the chapel of ease at Stratforde-atte-Bow, later Bow Church, to save the often difficult journey to the parish church of St Dunstan's at Stepney. A lock and weir now exist on the Lee Navigation near where the ford used to be. This lies at the end of 'Hackney Cut', an 18th-century artificial channel, and the natural channel (known as the Waterworks River) rejoins the channel below the lock. Old Ford Lock, Lee Navigation =Settlement to district= Farming and market gardening prevailed in the settlement until the 19th century when Old Ford became a part of the seamless London conurbation as a district, with large estates of relatively poor houses and much poverty. These were built to serve the new factories on the Lea and Lee Navigation and to serve the new railways. In 1865, a 30-acre plot was purchased to be used as a gasworks, but the Gas Light and Coke Company established what would become known as Fish Island, giving it its distinctive road names, and building a mixed residential and industrial development instead. The North London Railway had a line through the area with a station at Old Ford railway station. The line was badly damaged during World War II and never reopened. The station buildings were demolished in the early 1960s. =Reconstruction= As part of the post-war rebuilding, the Lakeview Estate was built and designed by Berthold Lubetkin, on a site damaged by bombing in World War II, on Grove Road between Old Ford Road and the Hertford Union Canal. The estate opened in 1958.'Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions after 1945 Social and Cultural Activities', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 135-147. Retrieved on 2008-12-25. Fish Island also saw significant bombing during the war, with damaged housing demolished post-war to make way for factories and warehouses. St Barnabas's, Bethnal Green was also badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War; the steeple was removed and the church rebuilt, retaining the tower and north and south walls. The remodelling was carried out by J Anthony Lewis of architects Michael Tapper & Lewis, who commissioned the sculptor Don Potter to create The Four Evangelists on the outside of the building. Victoria Park became known for its open air music festivals, often linked with a political cause in the 1970/80s. In 1978, Rock Against Racism organised a protest event against growth of far-right organisations such as the National Front. The concert was played by The Clash, Steel Pulse, X-Ray Spex, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X, and the Tom Robinson Band. In 1975, the Baroness Burdett Coutts Drinking Fountain was given Grade II* listed status by Historic England. =Contemporary= Last day of the Routemaster, 4 June 2004.

The Parochial Church Council and local people were determined to see that the church remained open and, in fact, was improved. The \\"A New Heart for Bow\\" project was born. More than £3,000,000 was raised from more than a dozen sources and philanthropies.

Old Ford is connected to the National Road Network via Parnell Road and Tredegar Road to the A12 (East Cross Route) running north/north east-south. Access to the Hertford Union Canal is via the tow-path (which the National Cycle Route 1 also passes along) from Wick Road at St Marks Gate (Victoria Park). East leads to the Lee Navigation where proceeding north leads to Hackney Marshes. Turning south along the Lea leads through Bow Locks, into Bow Creek and thence to the River Thames, but the tow-path can often be blocked.

It was established and is still practised by the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. In addition to attending lectures and other classes, Oxbridge students are taught by faculty fellows in groups of one to three on a weekly basis. These sessions are called \\"tutorials\\" at Oxford and \\"supervisions\\" at Cambridge. One benefit of the tutorial system is that students receive direct feedback on their weekly essays or work in a small discussion setting. The University of Buckingham also practices the weekly tutorial system since it was set up as England's first private university in the 1970s, though in larger groups of around 10. Student tutorials are generally more academically challenging and rigorous than standard lecture and test format courses, because during each session students are expected to orally communicate, defend, analyse, and critique the ideas of others as well as their own in conversations with the tutor and fellow students. As a pedagogic model, the tutorial system has great value because it creates learning and assessment opportunities which are highly authentic and difficult to fake.Palfreyman, D. (2008). 'The Oxford Tutorial' (OxCHEPS) . Outside the United Kingdom, a small number of universities have a tutorial system influenced by the Oxbridge system: Omega Graduate School in Tennessee, Williams College in Massachusetts, Honors Tutorial College of Ohio University, Sarah Lawrence College in New York, New College of Florida, and the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Liberal Studies at Capilano University in North Vancouver, Canada. These tutorials are often limited, either restricting them to those on an \\"honors program\\", or offering them as a single class rather than being the central feature of the university's teaching. In France, the system of Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles has a similar system of weekly oral examinations, called khôlles, by groups of two or three. References Further reading * Adamson, J.

They were conjoined at the top of the head (vertical craniopagus). In 2003 they were brought to the United States by their mother Arlene in the hope of having them surgically separated. A revolutionary new process was used in separating the twin boys. Because \\"marathon\\" surgical operations have historically led to a high rate of mortality and morbidity, Clarence and Carl's doctors chose to separate them in several smaller operations, allowing the twins to recuperate after each surgery. In October 2003, tissue expanders (pouches filled with saline) were implanted under the boys' scalps. This is common practice in separating conjoined twins, as it creates more skin that can be used to cover the twins' wounds after separation. Over the next ten months, the brothers underwent several more operations to tease apart their joined skulls and brains. On August 4, 2004, the final surgery was completed. All of these operations were performed at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, New York by a team led by James T. Goodrich, a pediatric neurosurgeon, David A. Staffenberg, a plastic surgeon. They received most of their post-operative rehabilitation at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, New York. By December 2005, Clarence could walk short distances unassisted, and Carl could walk with a walker. As of August 2014, both boys and their mother live in a donated house in Scarsdale, New York. The twins continue to attend physical therapy at Blythedale. Goodrich says there was some degeneration of Carl's right parietal lobe. He takes medication to control seizures, can utter just a word or two at a time, and has limited use of his left arm and leg. Both must still wear helmets to protect their brains; when they are fully grown, their skulls will be patched.

Its traditional purpose was to hold the ship's magnetic compass, mounted in gimbals to keep it level while the ship pitched and rolled. A binnacle may be subdivided into sections and its contents typically include one or more compasses and an oil lamp or other light source. Other devices such as a sand timer for estimating speed may have been stored in the binnacle as well. History Statue of Lord Kelvin in Belfast, with a corrected binnacle behind him The construction of many early (mid-18th century) binnacles used iron nails, which were later discovered to cause magnetic deviations in compass readings. As the development of the compass and understanding of magnetism progressed, greater attention was given to binnacle construction to avoid compass disturbances caused by iron. With the introduction of iron-clad ships the magnetic deviation observed in compasses became more severe. Methods of compensation by arranging iron or magnetic objects near the binnacle were developed. In 1854, a new type of binnacle was patented by John Gray of Liverpool which directly incorporated adjustable correcting magnets on screws or rack and pinions. This was improved again when Lord Kelvin patented in the 1880s another system of compass and which incorporated two compensating spheres. These are colloquially known as \\"Kelvin's balls\\" in the UK, and \\"navigator's balls\\" in the United States. Unlike most display binnacles today, which have the balls painted red and green to represent port and starboard side of the vessel, the balls were painted black or some other uniform color. The Royal Maritime museum at Greenwich, London, has an extensive collection of binnacles in correct colours. http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/7238.html The ship's \\"binnacle list\\" is the medical department's report of personnel at sick bay, excused from that day's duty. Etymology A compass binnacle in front of the ship's wheel. The small stove-pipe chimney vents the lamp used to illuminate the compass face at night. Before 18th century bittacle, through French bitacle, from Latin habitaculum, a little dwelling.

It maintains a full schedule of concerts, recitals, and plays. While large and built in the European Baroque style, it is far simpler than the Parisian influenced Teatro Nacional one block east. The land was bought by Jose Raventós, who dreamed of building a theatre in which to produce zarzuelas, usually comic) Spanish operettas. The building was designed by Jose Fabio Garnier Ugalde, dramatist and architect. Construction began 8 February 1927, and was completed 7 October 1928. The inauguration featured operettas of Esperanza Iris, the famous Mexican singer known as the Empress of Operetta. In 1960 a new gallery was added that included a screen for cinemascope. Seven years later, in 1967, during the dawn of 23 April, a fire destroyed the room. In the early 1970s, the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports decided that Costa Rica must buy the theater and renew it. In December 1981, a pre-inauguration occurred. Shortly afterwards, the building was closed to finish the restoration. There was a re-inauguration 6 March 1985, and 7 April the following year. \\"The Gaceta\\", the official newspaper of the government, announced law 7023 that gave the Melico Salazar the position of \\"cultural institution especializada\\" of the Costa Rican State. In 2014 it was announced that a new combined gallery and waiting area at the theatre would be named in honour of Dinora Bolandi who was a Costa Rican teacher and artist. The whole facility was once named the Raventós Theater, it was renamed in 1986 to honor the famous Costa Rican tenor Manuel \\"Melico\\" Salazar.

Although it was predominantly studied for its demonstration of asymmetrical brain development and function, in recent years many scientists have begun to examine the habenular nuclei's role in motivation and behavior as it relates to an understanding of the physiology of addiction.  Anatomy and connectivity  The habenular nuclei comprise a small group of nuclei that are part of the epithalamus of the diencephalon, and is located just above the thalamus and is divided into two asymmetric halves: the medial habenula (MHb) and the lateral habenula (LHb). These nuclei are hypothesized to be involved in regulation of monamines, such as dopamine and serotonin. The medial habenula receives connections from posterior septum pellucidum and diagonal band of Broca; the lateral habenula receives afferents from the lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, internal globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, and diagonal band of Broca. As a whole, this complexly interconnected region is part of the dorsal diencephalic conduction (DDC) system, responsible for relaying information from the limbic system to the midbrain, hindbrain, and medial forebrain. The right and left habenular nuclei are connected to each other by the habenular commissure. Habenula nuclear divisions: * lateral habenular nucleus (, ) * medial habenular nucleus (, ) The pineal gland is attached to the brain in this region. Nerve impulses from the habenular nuclei are transmitted to the septal nuclei via the stria medullaris, which is found on the medial surface of the thalamus. Axons from habenular nucleus pass to interpeduncular fossa, the tectum of midbrain, the thalamus and the reticular formation of the midbrain.  Motivation and addiction  Recent exploration of the habenular nuclei has begun to associate the structure with an organism's current mood, feeling of motivation, and reward recognition. Previously, the LHb has been identified as an \\"anti- reward\\" signal, but recent research suggests that the LHb helps identify preference, helping the brain to discriminate between potential actions and subsequent motivation decisions. In a study using a Pavlovian conditioning model, results showed an increase in the habenula response. This increase coincided with conditioned stimuli associated with more aversive punishments (ie. electric shock). Therefore, researchers speculate that inhibition or damage to the LHb resulting in a failure to process such information may lead to random motivation behavior. LHb is especially important in understanding the reward and motivation relationship as it relates to addictive behaviors. The LHb inhibits dopaminergic neurons, decreasing the release of dopamine. It was determined by several animal studies that receiving a reward coincided with elevated dopamine levels, but once the learned association was learned by the animal, dopamine levels remain elevated, only decreasing when the reward is removed. Therefore, dopamine levels only increase with unpredicted rewards and with a \\"negative prediction error\\". Moreover, it was determined that removal of an anticipated award activated LHb, inhibited dopamine levels. This finding helps explain why addictive drugs are associated with elevated dopamine levels. = Nicotine and nAChRs = According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1 in 5 preventable deaths, in the United States, is caused by tobacco use. Nicotine is the addictive drug found in most tobacco products and is easily absorbed by the bloodstream of the body. Despite common misconceptions regarding the relaxing effects of tobacco and nicotine use, behavioral testing in animals has demonstrated nicotine to have an anxiogenic effect. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been identified as the primary site for nicotine activity and regulate consequent cellular polarization. nAChRs are made up a number of α and β subunits and are found in both the LHb and MHb, where research suggests they may play a key role in addiction and withdrawal behaviors.

Opened in 1997 and built by Custom Coasters International, it is as of today the 2nd longest wooden coaster in Europe, after Colossos, with a track length of 1230m (4044 feet). This coaster is also the second wooden roller coaster built in France after Walygator Parc's Anaconda, and the second massive roller coaster of the park after Goudurix, which was built since the park's opening in 1989. These two roller coasters were followed by la Trace du Hourra in 2001, and OzIris in 2012. No other wooden roller coaster was built in the hexagon until Walibi Rhône-Alpes' Timber in 2016. Located in the park's rear Antique Greece section, not far from Goudurix, The 1232-metre-long coaster has a 30m (98-foot) tall lift hill, a first drop diving straight into a mouth- shaped-tunnel, and two helices, the first one at 572° and the second at 256°. Its recorded top-speed is 83,7 km/h, and two blue (one of them was red between 2004 and 2014) trains of 7 cars each, hold 56 people at a time enjoying several air-times due to the use of lap-bars as only protection. A safety belt holds each lap-bar down to prevent them from opening at hilltops. A third train, located in the garage located straight between the station and the turn leading to the lift hill, is stored for extra capacity should the need arise. On-ride photos can be purchased. \\"Tonnerre de Zeus\\" is French for \\"Thunder of Zeus.\\" In Greek mythology, Zeus was regarded as the king of gods. He also is often associated as being a weather god, hurling a thunderbolt at those who displeased him. A large statue of Zeus, complete with floral underwear, is featured at the ride's queue entrance, which means that patrons can look directly up at Zeus' underwear. The queue extends through the neighbouring arbored areas, then follows the ride's final helix before the brakes line before heading towards the station itself : a massive Greek temple allowing for a quick passenger load/unload.

The golden age of this cloister was in the 17th century. It boasts one of the few preserved three-tented belfries and medieval clock towers in Russia. The abbey was founded in 1487, when a monk of the Valaam Monastery, named Alexander, settled between Roshchinsky and Holy lakes, 20 km to the east from Lake Ladoga and 6 km from the Svir River. During his life in the woods, he had a vision of the Holy Trinity who ordered him to build two oaken chapels dedicated to the Trinity and the Saviour's Transfiguration. These churches gave birth to the twin Trinity and the Transfiguration cloisters, collectively known as the Alexander Svirsky Monastery. The monastery's founder died on August 30, 1533, and was buried at the Transfiguration cloister, which still serves as a burial place for the local monks. 12 years later, his disciples recounted his life in a biography. The church synod of 1547 canonized Alexander of the Svir, and the new saint became venerated throughout Russian lands. One of the chapels of the famous Saint Basil's Cathedral on Red Square, for instance, was consecrated to him. The frescoed cupola of one of the two katholikons. The Russian tsars bestowed many important privileges on Alexander's cloister, including the right to appropriate taxes from the Svir Fair, which was held annually under the cloister walls. During the Time of Troubles, the Swedes sacked and burnt both hermitages on three occasions, and yet the monastery continued to prosper. After the Russian-Swedish border was delineated west of the Svir River, much of the trade between two nations had to pass through the Svir Fair, further augmenting the monastery's importance. This renewed prosperity was reflected in the monastic structures erected in the 1640s. In 1644, when the five-domed Transfiguration Cathedral was finished, Tsar Mikhail Feodorovich presented to the monks a golden ark for keeping St Alexander's relics there. A belfry of the Trinity cloister was built in three tiers and crowned with three tents in 1649. Most of the monastic cells date back to the 1670s. The roomy Trinity Cathedral was completed by 1695. The last structure to be erected within monastery walls was the hospital chapel of St John of Damascus (1718). Prokudin-Gorski in 1909 The vast lands of the Alexander Svirsky Monastery were secularized during Catherine the Great's ecclesiastical reform in 1764. The Transfiguration cloister continued as a seat of the local seminary and a residence of the Olonets archbishops, who rebuilt much of the monastery structures for their own needs. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the monks were imprisoned and then executed by the Cheka after trying to resist Bolshevik forces.Figes, Orlando: A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891–1924. The Bodley Head, London (2014). p. 528 The relics of St Alexander were desecrated and put on a public display in Leningrad. The medieval monastery buildings housed an infamous gulag known as Svirlag. They were further damaged during World War II. Restoration did not commence until the 1970s. As of 2005, the Transfiguration Cloister is the home to the local monastic community, while the Trinity Cloister still houses a mental asylum instituted in 1953. The monastery has a subsidiary chapel in St Petersburg, situated some 260 km to the west.

In just a year, he was the number 1 of the Sporting team, where he played until 1957/58, and was a four-time national champion (1951/52, 1952/53, 1953/54 and 1957/58) also winning the Cup of Portugal in (1958). During the golden years of his career, he played 18 times for the National Team. His first game, on November 22, 1953, was a friendly match against South Africa, which Portugal won 3–1. His last game, on May 7, 1958, was a 1–2 defeat by England; another friendly match. After his demands were refused by Sporting, he moved to Spain, where he represented Granada and Real Oviedo. He returned to Portugal, to play for Atlético, in 1960/61. He was a known opponent of the fascist regime and it is believed, like he claimed, that the allegations of rape against him were a set-up, created by the political police of the regime to force him to leave football. After a simulated injury in an Atlético game with Vitória Guimarães, he escaped to Spain. Later, he escaped to Morocco and played with Tangier FC, USP Tangier and CODM Meknès. In 1969, he went to Algeria, played with JS Djijel and became a manager. In 1971, he managed MC Oran and won the championship. He went to Tunisia before returning to Portugal in the 1980s. He moved again to Spain and Austria, returning finally to Portugal in July 2005, suffering from Parkinson's disease. He died soon after, at age 73.

It was produced by Warner Bros. Television for the Fox network, originally airing from 2001 to 2002. Musician Henry Rollins was the uncredited host of the show. Production Filming for the show began during July 2000 in Vancouver, Canada.http://playbackonline.ca/2000/07/24/29664-20000724/ Veteran punk and metal singer Henry Rollins got hired as host after discussions with Fox executives, who initially wanted him to play a recurring role on their popular sci-fi series The X-Files. In a 2001 interview, Rollins remarked \\"It's kind of a Twilight Zone-thing and I'm the Rod Serling. It's awesome. I got the job last year, and I'm working on it now and again up in Vancouver. Really nice people, really good material. That's the best part of it, really. If it's bad material it doesn't matter how much money they're throwing at you, it's not worth it.\\"http://www.comeinandburn.com/archive/playboy.htm Originally, Night Visions was not going to feature a host. Co-creator Billy Brown (a former writer of the 1990s Goosebumps TV series) stated, \\"I never wanted a host. There should have been an introductory voice-over, a la Outer Limits. But the network said 'No host, no show'. So we started looking, and actually got a commitment from Gary Oldman. Having played Dracula, and being a fantastic actor, he would have been a real presence. The network said no. They wanted Henry Rollins. I didn't get it, nor did anyone else on the show's staff. It seemed like someone's desperate idea to make the show hip\\". Regarding Fox's involvement in the creative process, Brown said \\"They [Fox] said many conflicting things. We had a chance to option an incredible Dean Koontz short story that was just terrifying, and they nixed that because it was too scary. And yet they complained that other stories weren't scary enough.\\" The show's directors included some best known for feature films, including Tobe Hooper and Joe Dante, and others, such as Brian Dennehy, JoBeth Williams, and Bill Pullman, known primarily as actors. Broadcast history The show was scheduled to debut during October 2000 at 8:00 p.m. on Fridays, but this never eventuated, with reality show Police Chase and Freakylinks airing in its place. It eventually aired on Fox from July 12 to September 6, 2001 as a summer filler. Billy Brown reflected \\"There was a changing of the guard at Fox between the time we filmed the pilot and the time the network was ready to order the series. The new regime wasn't convinced an anthology would work, yet everyone agreed that the pilot was good. I had the feeling the network didn't think the show was hip enough.\\" It was later picked up by the Sci Fi Channel, which reran the series beginning June 14, 2002. During September 2002, Sci Fi broadcast the final three remaining episodes that never aired on Fox, which was due to scheduling conflicts arising from the 2001 September 11 terrorist attacks. One of these, \\"Cargo/Switch\\", ran as part of the Night Visions series, while the two other episodes' segments (\\"Patterns\\", \\"The Maze\\", \\"Harmony\\" and \\"Voices\\") were edited into the Sci Fi Channel film Shadow Realm, minus the Rollins introductions and the Night Visions name. Reruns of the series also aired on the Nine Network in Australia and on cable channel Chiller. The show has never been released on DVD. Reception Night Visions has been favorably compared to other horror/sci-fi anthology shows, particularly The Twilight Zone, although The Washington Post claimed the show is \\"far more graphic and scary.\\" Episodes 13 color episodes in 43-minute format (not counting commercials): { class=wikitable style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" - style=\\"color:#FFFFFF\\" ! style=\\"background:#000050; width:30px\\" ! style=\\"background:#000050\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#000050; width:130px\\" Directed by: ! style=\\"background:#000050; width:170px\\" Original air date } References = Notes = :1.

He received the Children's Literature Legacy Award for his lifetime contribution to American children's literature in 2011. Early life and education DePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, to a family of Irish and Italian heritage, the son of Joseph and Florence May (Downey) DePaola.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/books/tomie-de-paola- dead.htmlhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11820469/florence-may-depaola He had one brother, Joseph (nicknamed Buddy), and two sisters, Judie and Maureen. His paternal grandparents originated from Calabria, where he set his well- known book Strega Nona. His book The Baby Sister is about Maureen being born. DePaola was attracted to art at the age of four, and credited his family with encouraging his development as an artist and influencing the themes of his works. After high school, dePaola studied art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  Career  = Teaching = DePaola taught art at Newton College of the Sacred Heart outside Boston from 1962 to 1966, then moved to California, where he taught at San Francisco College for Women from 1967 to 1970. He received a Master of Fine Arts degree from California College of Arts and Crafts in 1969 and a doctoral equivalency from Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. DePaola relocated to New England in the 1970s, teaching art at Chamberlayne Junior College in Boston from 1972 to 1973. From 1973 to 1976 he worked at Colby- Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, as an associate professor, designer, and technical director in the speech and theater department and as writer and set and costume designer for the Children's Theatre Project. He taught art at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, from 1976 to 1978. DePaola retired from full-time teaching in 1978 to devote his time to writing and illustrating books. He provided illustrations for Maggie and the Monster Baby (Holiday House, 1987) by Elizabeth Winthrop. = Writing = The first published book that dePaola illustrated was a 1965 volume in the Coward- McCann series \\"Science is what and why\\": Sound, written by Lisa Miller.Science is what and why (Coward-McCann series from 1965). WorldCat. Retrieved 2013-06-11. The first that he wrote and illustrated was The Wonderful Dragon of Timlin, published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1966. His writing career spanned over 50 years during which he worked on more than 270 books. Close to 25 million copies of his books were sold worldwide, and were translated into over 20 languages. Perhaps his most well-known work, Strega Nona, was first published in 1975 and was a finalist for the coveted Caldecott Medal for best illustrated work. = Television = DePaola appeared in several episodes of Barney & Friends as himself. In 2017 he also appeared as himself in the Jim Henson Company series Telling Stories with Tomie dePaola.  Exhibitions  DePaola had two exhibitions in 2013-2014 at the Colby-Sawyer College. The first, called \\"Then\\" showed his early work during his formative years at the Pratt Institute and the influence Fra Angelico, George Roualt and others had on him. The second exhibition was of his later work, called \\"Now,\\" came out close to dePaola's 80th birthday.  Personal life and death  DePaola was gay. He came out later in his life, telling The New York Times Magazine in 2019 that, for much of his career, \\"If it became known you were gay, you’d have a big red ‘G’ on your chest... and schools wouldn’t buy your books anymore.” DePaola had resided in New London, New Hampshire, where he taught from 1973 to 1976. DePaola died at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center on March 30, 2020, in Lebanon, New Hampshire, according to his literary agent, Doug Whiteman. He was badly injured in a fall in his barn studio the previous week and died of complications following surgery. He was survived by his two sisters Judith and Maureen (the latter being his best friend) and many nieces and nephews. Awards and honors In 2011 dePaola received the biennial Children's Literature Legacy Award from the U.S. children's librarians, which recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made \\"a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children\\". The committee noted the wide range of his stories and his \\"innate understanding of childhood, a distinctive visual style, and a remarkable ability to adapt his voice to perfectly suit the story.\\" It called Strega Nona, the wise Grandma Witch, \\"an enduring character who has charmed generations of children.\\" The Pratt Institute honored him with an honorary doctorate on May 18, 2009. The New Hampshire Institute of Art honored him with an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts on May 20, 2018.

A political figure of May 1968 in France, he was the disciple and last personal secretary of Jean-Paul Sartre from 1974 to 1980. Along with him, he helped founding the French newspaper Libération in 1972. After having encountered the Jewish philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas in 1978, he operated a return to tradition. He then founded the Institut d'études lévinassiennes in Jerusalem with Alain Finkielkraut and Bernard-Henri Lévy. Benny Lévy is known for his unusual itinerary from Maoism to Judaism, or \\"from Mao to Moses\\", which was also followed by a few other philosophers of his generation.  May 68 and the Gauche prolétarienne  Born in Egypt, Benny Lévy grew up without experiencing Judaism as a faith. He left Egypt after the Suez Crisis of 1956 and immigrated to Belgium then France with his family. His elder half-brother, Eddy Lévy, stayed in Egypt, converted to Islam in 1956 and changed his name to Adil Rifaat.Mahmoud Hussein, jumeaux de l'islam. Le Monde, 1 March 05 The historian of mathematics Tony Lévy is his brother. Benny Lévy soon proved to be a brilliant student and completed his studies at the École Normale Supérieure, learning under such key intellectual figures as Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida, founder of deconstruction. He entered the Union des étudiants communistes (UEC), a student communist group, and then at his foundation in 1966 the Maoist Union des jeunesses communistes marxistes-léninistes (UJC - ml). He became one of the main leader of this latter organization after Robert Linhart. Benny Lévy was an important figure during the May 68 Student Revolt. After these events, the direction of the UJC-ml was put in minority, and founded the Maoist Gauche prolétarienne (GP, Proletarian Left). Taking the pseudonym of Pierre Victor, Benny Lévy was one of its main leaders, along with Alain Geismar. As editor of the Maoist newspaper La Cause du Peuple (The Cause of the People), he was arrested repeatedly by the French police, who were determined to suppress the unrest. By 1970, with arrests occurring more frequently, Lévy and the other editors decided to turn to Jean-Paul Sartre, whom they knew benefited from protection to police harassment. Sartre responded by adding his name to the list of editors, and the arrests indeed stopped. It was then discovered by the government that the proletarian leftwing leader Pierre Victor was, in fact, a stateless refugee. The passport given to him by the United Nations was confiscated, and he was ordered to appear at the local police station once every two weeks with his relatives and a lawyer. The organisation was outlawed in 1970. As stateless and leader of an outlawed organisation, Benni Lévy was forced to clandestinity until 1973, date of the auto-dissolving of the GP. By this point, however, Lévy had developed a very amicable relationship with Sartre, who decided to make him his protégé and asked him to serve as his personal secretary, which he remained from September 1974 till Sartre's death in 1980. Sartre interceded to President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and Lévy was naturalized.  The thought of the Return  During these six years, Lévy worked with Sartre, and the two men produced four books until Sartre's death. While working with Sartre, Lévy began to discover Judaism, initially through his research into the Kabbalah, which he conducted with his mentor. Their work together created a stir among the circle that surrounded Sartre, because Sartre had begun introducing new ideas and terms that evoked religious and, more specifically, Jewish concepts, such as Redemption and Messianism. Some, including Simone de Beauvoir began accusing Lévy of brainwashing Sartre and faking his writings. After this Ms de Beauvoir and Mr Levy were no longer on speaking terms. Two months before his death, Sartre responded to these critics, claiming that he had indeed abandoned some of his earlier ideas. In 1978, Lévy encountered Levinas, and started learning Hebrew and beginning Talmudic studies. Starting in 1975, he taught at the University of Paris-VII, founded in the wake of May 68, before obtaining a doctorate in philosophy at the Sorbonne in 1985, and a habilitation to direct researches (HDR) in philosophy in 1998, under the direction of Dominique Lecourt at Paris-VII. Benny Lévy embraced Jewish Orthodoxy, and began to study in a yeshiva in Strasbourg. He finally immigrated to Israel in 1997, where he established the Institut d'études lévinassiennes in Jerusalem along with Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut, and learned with Rabbi Moshe Shapira. He died suddenly during the holiday of Sukkot in 2003. In Etre Juif, he wrote: > To be Jewish. To be, in an absolutely singular manner... a thought of the > Return. The Return to the Sinaï...

It is the sequel to The Neverhood, and rather than being a graphic adventure, it is a platformer. Terry Scott Taylor composed the soundtrack.  Plot  The evil Klogg was banished from The Neverhood at the end of the first game, but has now ended up on the Planet Idznak, which is inhabited by creatures known as Skullmonkeys and an insect race known as YNT. Klogg becomes the leader of the Skullmonkeys and sets off to make \\"Evil engine number 9\\" to destroy the Neverhood, while Klaymen is brought onto the scene to stop him.  Gameplay  In the single- player platform game, the player controls Klaymen, a resident of the Neverhood who is kidnapped in order to prevent the destruction of the Neverhood. He can jump, duck, look up, and grab a wide range of items such as a halo (allowing him to withstand more than one hit) and a wide range of quirky and crude projectile weapons. Aside from the assortment of weapons, enemies and bosses can be destroyed by jumping on them, and there are several secret levels (set to 1970s easy-listening music) where bonus points and extra lives can be earned. The levels are in a sidescrolling format, unlike the point and click format of The Neverhood. Throughout each of the levels, clay balls can be collected to earn points, with extra lives being awarded upon collecting 100. Several bosses are stationed throughout the game to be defeated. The game was noted for being hard to complete,Dulin, Ron. \\"What is most frustrating about Skullmonkeys is that it just wears you down after a while.\\" GameSpot, Jan. 31, 1998. Accessed February 22, 2008. but the game's password feature keeps things from being unreasonably difficult. The bonus stage is accompanied by a slow acoustic ballad, with lyrics about \\"guiding\\" the player like a \\"dad\\" or a \\"mom\\".  Development  Skullmonkeys was a strictly two-dimensional game developed at a time when this format was seen as increasingly outmoded. Project lead Doug TenNapel, however, preferred the 2D format and believed that 3D platform gaming could never work, being always plagued by depth-perception problems. Besides TenNapel, star creators who worked on the game included Mike Dietz (inventor of the animation process used in Disney's Aladdin and Earthworm Jim) and Mark Lorenzen. Klaymen's motions were penciled first, then used in tandem with a model to record the animation. One method used by the designers to create the creatures in the game, was to take children's toys and cover them with clay to see what shapes were formed. A boss in the game, Joe- Head-Joe, is actually the face of Joseph Sanabria, one of the game's designers. The cutscene clips were created by applying stop motion animation to the modeled clay figures. TenNapel commented, \\"When I sculpt [clay], I feel very relaxed and comfortable, compared to doing art on the computer where you'll find me scowling and squinting a lot.\\" During development TenNapel said that composer Terry Scott Taylor \\"[is] coming up with this Hawaiian shit, like Don Ho. And we're like 'Go! Go!' because it's so stupid and so nongaming that we have to embrace it.\\"  Release  The game was released in Japan on August 13, 1998.

However, many video game websites panned it for its high difficulty, replacing the saves with passwords and technical problems which affected its playability.

It is a subordinate command of the Army Test and Evaluation Command. Located in southwestern La Paz County and western Yuma County in southwestern Arizona, U.S., about north-east of the city of Yuma, it encompasses 1,307.8 square miles (3,387.2 km²) in the northwestern Sonoran Desert.Yuma Proving Ground census blocks, Census Tract 206, La Paz County and Census Tract 105, Yuma County, Arizona United States Census Bureau Overview The proving ground conducts tests on nearly every weapon in the ground combat arsenal. Nearly all the long-range artillery testing for U.S. ground forces takes place here in an area almost completely removed from urban encroachment and noise concerns. Restricted airspace controlled by the test center amounts to over . Yuma Proving Ground has the longest overland artillery range () in the nation, the most highly instrumented helicopter armament test range in the Department of Defense, over of improved road courses for testing tracked and wheeled military vehicles, over of fiber-optic cable linking test locations, and the most modern mine and demolitions test facility in the western hemisphere. Realistic villages and road networks representing urban areas in Southwest Asia have been constructed and are used for testing counter-measures to the threat of roadside bombs. The General Motors Desert Proving Ground – Yuma opened at the proving ground in late July 2009. General Motors built the facility at a cost of more than $100 million after closing its desert automotive test facility in Mesa, Arizona, that had been in operation since 1953. The new facility allows Army automotive testers to test their wheeled vehicles all year-round. It is estimated that the track can be used to test about 80 percent of the Army's wheeled vehicle fleet. More than 3,000 people, mostly civilians, work at the proving ground, which is the largest employer in Yuma County. In a typical year, over 500,000 artillery, mortar and missile rounds are fired, 36,000 parachute drops take place, are driven on military vehicles, and over 4,000 air sorties are flown from the proving ground's Laguna Army Airfield. About 10 percent of the proving ground's workload is training. In a typical year, dozens of units come to the facility for realistic desert training, especially before deploying overseas. Yuma Proving Ground's clean air, low humidity, skimpy rainfall – only about per year – and annual average of 350 sunny days, add up to almost perfect testing and training conditions. Urban encroachment and noise concerns are nonexistent problems, unlike at many other military installations. Of the four extreme natural environments recognized as critical in the testing of military equipment, three fall under the management authority of Yuma Proving Ground. Realistic natural environment testing ensures that American military equipment performs as advertised, wherever deployed around the world. The proving ground manages military equipment and munitions testing at three locations: The Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) at Fort Greely, Alaska;CRTC U.S. Army Cold Regions Test Center, atec.army.mil, last accessed 27 July 2019 the Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) operating in Panama, Honduras, Suriname, and Hawaii;Tropic Regions Test Center; International Test and Evaluation Association; by Lance VanderZyl Director, Tropic Regions Test Center, U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Yuma, Arizona; dated 2008, last accessed 27 July 2019 and at the Yuma Test Center (YTC) located at Yuma Proving Ground. The common link between these test centers is \\"environmental testing,\\" which makes the proving ground the Army's environmental test expert. Yuma Proving Ground tests improvised explosive devices, commonly known as IEDs, the number-one killer of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles fly at the proving ground each year from the six airfields located at the proving ground, as do helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft conducting personnel and cargo parachute drops. Many friendly foreign nations also visit the proving ground to conduct test programs.Piranhas swim at U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, army.mil, by Mr. Mark Schauer (ATEC), dated 5 September 2017, last accessed 22 November 2018 History The presence of the U.S. Army in Yuma goes back to 1850, when Fort Yuma was constructed on a hill overlooking the important Yuma crossing of the Colorado River. Soldiers at Fort Yuma maintained peace and protected the important Yuma crossing, which was used by thousands of travelers each year.Yuma Proving Ground Continues Area's Army History, yuma.army.mil, last accessed 22 November 2018 The Army constructed a second facility in 1865, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, to act as a supply base for Army posts throughout Arizona and parts of New Mexico. Supplies were delivered by riverboats and transported from the depot to military outposts by wagon. After Fort Yuma and the Yuma Quartermaster Depot closed in the 1880s, the Army did not return to Yuma on a permanent basis until World War II. Yuma Proving Ground traces its history to Camp Laguna and the Army Corps of Engineers Yuma Test Branch, both activated in 1943. Located on the Colorado River, the Yuma Test Branch conducted testing on combat bridges, amphibious vehicles, and boats. Tens of thousands of mechanized and infantry soldiers were trained at Camp Laguna for duty at combat fronts throughout the world, from North Africa to the South Pacific. Abandoned campsites and tank trails can still be found on the proving ground. Camp Laguna lasted only until the end of World War II. The Yuma Test Branch was closed in 1949 and reactivated two years later as the Yuma Test Station, under the operational control of the Sixth U.S. Army. In 1962, the station was named Yuma Proving Ground and reassigned to the U. S. Army Materiel Command as an important component of the Test and Evaluation Command. On July 26, 1973, it officially received its full name – U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground. The following year it was designated as a Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Base. Since its early days, Yuma Proving Ground has been a desert environmental test center for all types of military equipment and materiel. However, developmental and a variety of other types of testing of artillery systems and ammunition, aircraft armament and targeting systems, mobility equipment, and air delivery systems, not necessarily desert environmental-related, now comprise the bulk of the workload. A heavy investment in technology and a highly skilled soldier-civilian workforce makes the proving ground a significant social and economic component of the local community. 35px Yuma Test Center YPG's YTC primary ranges * Ground weapons systems from small arms to long range artillery * Helicopter armament and target acquisition systems * Artillery and tank munitions * Cargo and personnel parachutes, including guided systems technologies * Land mines and mine-removal systems * Tracked and wheeled vehicles in a desert environment * Vibration and interference-free tests of smart weapon systems * Laguna Army Airfield complex, featuring two runways – and . * 12 drop zones and multiple airstrips for Unmanned Aerial Systems * A overland artillery range, the longest in the nation * Over of improved road courses for tracked and wheeled vehicles * State-of-the-art fiber optics systems to acquire, reduce and transmit data in real time * Specialized facilities for testing countermeasures for the defeat of roadside bombs, such as the National Counterterrorism/Counterinsurgency Integrated Test and Evaluation site 35px Tropic Regions Test Centers 35px Cold Regions Test Center References External links * {align=left  } Buildings and structures in La Paz County, Arizona Buildings and structures in Yuma County, Arizona United States Army posts Military installations in Arizona Proving grounds 1943 establishments in Arizona Historic American Engineering Record in Arizona ","title":"Yuma Proving Ground"},{"id":"2982611","text":"John Tartaglione (January 14, 1921 – November 12, 2003),Comics Buyer's Guide #1650; February 2009; Page 107\\"United States Social Security Death Index,\\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JR7Q-8JW : accessed 5 Mar 2013), John Tartaglione, 12 November 2003. a.k.a. John Tartag and other pseudonyms, was an American comic book artist best known as a 1950s romance- comics artist; a Marvel Comics inker during the Silver Age of comic books; and the illustrator of the Marvel biographies The Life of Pope John Paul II, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the first of which at least sold millions of copies worldwide in several languages.  Biography  =Early life and career= Raised in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, Tartaglione studied at that borough's Pratt Institute, and at the Traphagen School of Fashion in Manhattan. Comics-creator credits were not routinely given in the early days of comic books, up through the 1960s, making a comprehensive listing of Tartaglione's credits difficult to compile. His first confirmed work as a comic-book inker is the six-page story \\"The Mad Monk!\\" in Amazing Detective Cases #6 (May 1951), from Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics. His first confirmed penciling art is the six-page story \\"The Man Who Walked The Plank\\", for the same publisher's Young Men #11 (Oct. 1951). Tartaglione thus began a long association with Marvel that found him penciling suspense, adventure, sports and crime stories — signing his work a variety of ways including \\"Tartag\\", \\"Tar\\", \\"Leone\\" and \\"JT\\" — though he was most prolific in romance titles, illustrating more than 120.John Tartaglione at the Grand Comics Database. WebCitation archive. =Silver Age of comic books= Tartaglione also freelanced for DC Comics, Charlton Comics and for Gilberton Publications, where he illustrated the Classics Illustrated adaptations Won by the Sword and Tom Brown's Schooldays. From 1963 to 1966, he penciled several Movie Classic adaptations for Dell Comics — from Jason and the Argonauts to Beach Blanket Bingo — as well as TV series tie-in comics (Ben Casey, Burke's Law, The Defenders, Dr. Kildare) and other work, including the presidential biographies John F. Kennedy (inked by Dick Giordano; year n.a.), and Lyndon B. Johnson (1964). Back at Marvel — where he sometimes went by \\"John Tartag\\", with and without a period — the wide-ranging Tartaglione had a long run inking Dick Ayers on Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos #27-42 (Feb. 1966 - May 1967) and other issues, plus two annuals. Following this, interspersed with other titles and characters across the Marvel line, Tartaglione spent a year as the regular inker for one of Gene Colan's signature series, Daredevil, embellishing issues #29-35, 37, and 40-41 (June 1967 - June 1968), plus Daredevil Annual #1 (Sept. 1967). His work as a Marvel inker includes three stories with the highly influential penciler Jim Steranko: Writer-artist Steranko's final Nick Fury story, \\"What Ever Happened to Scorpio?\\", in the much-reprinted Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #5 (Nov. 1968),Reprints include Nick Fury Special Edition #2, Jan. 1984, and the 2001 trade paperback Nick Fury: Scorpio, and the Arnold Drake-written X-Men #50-51 (Nov.-Dec. 1968).Reprinted in the 2002 trade paperback Marvel Visionaries: Jim Steranko, =Other comics and commercial art= With the exception of an occasional item such as the cover of Dazzler #12, Tartaglione returned to penciling for the first time in years with the 64-page Marvel Comics biography The Life of Pope John Paul II (1982), written by Steven Grant and Mieczyslaw Malinski, and inked by Joe Sinnott. A 1984 follow-up profiled Mother Teresa, with the same artists and writer David Michelinie. Comics historian Mark Evanier wrote that Tartaglione at Marvel \\"became the 'go-to' guy when a project came along that required historical research and/or spiritual themes. He was therefore the perfect artist when, in 1982, Marvel issued a comic-book biography of Pope John Paul II that through various religious channels sold well into the millions, leading to a follow-up book on Mother Teresa\\".Evanier, Mark. \\"John Tartaglione, R.I.P.\\" / \\"More on John Tartaglione\\", POV Online (column) November 14, 2003.

The side which wins the rook is said to have won the exchange, while the other player has lost the exchange, since the rook is usually more valuable. Alternatively, the side that has won the rook is up the exchange, and the other player is down the exchange. The opposing captures often happen on consecutive moves, although this is not strictly necessary. It is generally detrimental to lose the exchange, although occasionally one may find reason to purposely do so; the result is an exchange sacrifice (see below). The minor exchange is an uncommon term for the exchange of a bishop and knight. \\"The exchange\\" differs from the more general \\"exchange\\" or \\"an exchange\\", which refers to the loss and subsequent gain of arbitrary pieces, for example to \\"exchange queens\\" would mean that each side's queen is . Value of the exchange The value of the exchange (i.e. the difference between a rook and a minor piece) has been considered for decades. Siegbert Tarrasch put its value as 1½ pawns in the endgame, but not for the opening or the first part of the middlegame. That is widely accepted today, but Jacob Sarratt, Howard Staunton, and José Capablanca felt that the exchange was worth two pawns. Tigran Petrosian thought that one pawn was the right value. Wilhelm Steinitz said that a rook is slightly better than a knight and two pawns but slightly worse than a bishop and two pawns . Cecil Purdy said that the value depends on the total number of pawns on the board. The reason is that when there are many pawns, the rooks will have limited mobility because there will not be open . The exchange is barely worth 1½ points when there are 14 or more pawns on the board. Only when there are ten or fewer pawns may the exchange be worth 2 points . Purdy gave the value as 1½ points in the opening and increasing to 2 points in the endgame. In the middlegame the value would be closer to 1½ than to 2 . Edmar Mednis gave the value as 1½ in the endgame , . Max Euwe put the value at 1½ in the middlegame and said that two pawns are more than sufficient compensation for the exchange . Larry Kaufman's computer research puts the value as 1¾ pawns, but only 1¼ pawns if the player with the minor piece has the . Hans Berliner puts the difference between a rook and knight as 1.9 pawns and the difference between a rook and a bishop as 1.77 pawns . In practice, one pawn may be sufficient compensation for the loss of the exchange, whereas two pawns almost always is . In the endgame In the middlegame, the advantage of an exchange is usually enough to win the game if the side with the rook has one or more pawns. In an endgame without pawns, the advantage of the exchange is normally not enough to win (see pawnless chess endgame). The most common exceptions when there are no pawns are (1) a rook versus a bishop in which the defending king is trapped in a corner of the same color as his bishop, (2) a knight separated from its king that may be cornered and lost, and (3) the king and knight are poorly placed . In the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a knight and a pawn, if the pawns are passed the rook is much stronger and should win. If the pawns are not passed, the side with knight has good drawing chances if its pieces are well- placed . In the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a bishop and pawn, If the pawns are on the same file, the bishop has good chances to draw if the pawns are blocked and the opposing pawn is on a square the bishop can attack; otherwise the rook usually wins. If the pawns are passed the rook normally wins. If the pawns are not passed and are on adjacent files, it is difficult to assess but the bishop may be able to draw . In an endgame with more pawns on the board (i.e. a rook and pawns versus a minor piece with the same number of pawns) the rook usually wins . This position is typical. The superior side should remember these things: # the main idea is to get the king through to capture opposing pawns # force as many opposing pawns as possible onto the same color square as the bishop # some pawn exchanges may be necessary to open , but keep pawns on both sides of the board # try to keep the position unbalanced. A passed pawn almost immediately becomes a winning advantage . If the minor piece has an extra pawn (i.e. one pawn for the exchange), the rook should win, but with difficulty. If the minor piece has two extra pawns, the endgame should be a draw . The exchange sacrifice  An exchange sacrifice occurs when one player gives up a rook for a minor piece. It is often used to destroy the enemy pawn structure (as in several variations of the Sicilian Defence where Black a knight on c3 with a rook), to establish a minor piece on a strong square (often threatening the enemy king), to improve one's own pawn structure (creating, for example, connected passed pawns such as in A Yurgis vs. Botvinnik, 1931), or to gain time for development. The exchange sacrifice contrasts with other sacrifices in that during the early-middle to middle game the board is sufficiently crowded to where the rook is not as effective as an active knight or a good bishop, this is why such exchange sacrifices happen usually from moves 20 to 30, and rarely occur in the later moves. When they do occur in the endgame, it is usually to create and promote a passed pawn . Subsequently, the relative importance of the pieces might be different than the standardized Chess piece relative value system and takes advantage of the fluctuating values of the pieces during the progression of the game. The sacrifice might also be used to increase the influence of one's own minor pieces by eliminating opposition from their counterparts (such as in the Petrosian versus Spassky game below, where even a double exchange sacrifice was successful). A common example of this idea is the elimination an opponent's bishop, with the expectation that in doing so one's own bishop will increase in power from being unopposed on the color squares in which it resides. There is often more dynamic play and positional considerations such as pawn structure or piece placement compared to sacrifices due to a mating attack or a pawn sacrifice to gain the initiative. Sometimes the exchange can be sacrificed purely on long term positional objectives, as frequently demonstrated by former world champion Tigran Petrosian. =Sokolov vs. Kramnik= In this 2004 gameSokolov vs. Kramnik between Ivan Sokolov and World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, White gave up the exchange for a pawn in order to create two strong connected passed pawns. The game continued: :33. Rxc7 Qxc7 :34. Rxf6 Rxf6 :35. Qxf6 Rf8 and White won on move 41 . =Reshevsky vs. Petrosian= Tigran Petrosian, the World Champion from 1963–1969, was well known for his especially creative use of this device. He once responded (only half jokingly), when asked what was his favourite piece, as saying \\"The rook, because I can sacrifice it for minor pieces!\\" In the game Reshevsky versus Petrosian at the 1953 Candidates Tournament in Zurich,Reshevsky vs. Petrosian, 1953 he sacrificed the exchange on move 25, only for his opponent to sacrifice it in return on move 30. This game is perhaps the most famous and most frequently taught example of the exchange sacrifice. There are no open in this position for the rooks to exploit. Black sacrificed the exchange with : 25... Re6 With the rook not on e7, the black knight will be able to get to a strong outpost on d5. From there the knight will be attacking the pawn on c3, and if the white bishop on b2 does not move to d2, it will be of little use. In addition, it will be practically impossible to break Black's defense on the white squares. The next few moves were: : 26. a4 Ne7! : 27. Bxe6 fxe6 : 28. Qf1! Nd5 : 29. Rf3 Bd3 : 30. Rxd3 cxd3 The game was drawn on move 41 . =Petrosian vs. Spassky= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Petrosian vs. Spassky, 1966   } In the tenth game from the 1966 World Chess Championship between defending champion Tigran Petrosian and challenger Boris Spassky contained two exchange sacrifices by White.Petrosian vs. Spassky Black had just moved :20... Bh3?! (first diagram) White responded with an exchange sacrifice: :21. Ne3! White had no choice: 21.Rf2 Rxf4 22.Rxf4 Qg5+, etc. The game continued: :21... Bxf1 22. Rxf1 Ng6 23. Bg4! Nxf4?! (second diagram) And now a second exchange sacrifice: :24. Rxf4! Rxf4 Black is helpless, despite being two exchanges ahead. White won back an exchange on move 29. On move 30 White forced the win of the other rook and the exchange of queens. Black resigned because the position was a winning endgame for White (two knights and five pawns versus one knight and four pawns) . Petrosian won the match by one game to retain his title. =Kasparov vs. Shirov= In a 1994 game between World Champion Garry Kasparov and Alexei Shirov,Kasparov vs. Shirov, 1994 White sacrificed a pure exchange (rook for a bishop) with the move 17. Rxb7!!. As compensation for the sacrifice, Black became weak on the white squares, which were dominated by White's bishop. The exchange sacrifice also deprived Black of the and his remaining bishop was a . During the game, many spectating grandmasters were sceptical whether White's compensation was enough. Black returned the exchange on move 28, making the equal, but White had a strong initiative. Black missed a better 28th move after which White could have forced a draw, but would have had no clear advantage. White won the game on move 38 . Minor exchange The minor exchange refers to the capture of the opponent's bishop for the player's knight (or, more recently, the stronger for the weaker) . Bobby Fischer used the term , but it is rarely used. In most chess positions, a bishop is worth slightly more than a knight because of its longer range of movement. As a chess game progresses, pawns tend to get traded, removing support points from the knight and opening up lines for the bishop. This generally leads to the bishop's advantage increasing over time. Traditional chess theory espoused by masters such as Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch puts more value on the bishop than the knight. In contrast, the hypermodern school favored the knight over the bishop. Modern theory is that it depends on the position, but that there are more positions where the bishop is better than where the knight is better . There are some occasions when a knight can be worth more than a bishop, so this exchange is not necessarily made at every opportunity to do so. Many of the Classicists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century claimed that two bishops versus rook and knight were equivalent. While today the view is that a pair of bishops shouldn't be underestimated, but the rook and knight are still superior. A pair of active bishops is frequently adequate compensation for a pawn - or even the exchange in a middlegame position. Adding the better cooperation of the rook with the bishops, many Soviet theoreticians believed that, in active positions, rook and two bishops outperform two rooks and a knight. The modern consensus is that the side with the two bishops need at least a pawn when facing rook and knight, even then the side with the two bishops is underdog. William Steinitz reckoned that often two bishops and two pawns is superior against rook and knight. A rook and bishop usually work better together than a rook and knight in the endgame , . José Raúl Capablanca stated that a queen and knight work better together than a queen and bishop in the endgame . More recently, John Watson has stated that from his study of this endgame that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages (for example, having a knight against a bad bishop in a position, or having a bishop in a position with pawns on both sides of the board, particularly if the knight has no natural outpost). Watson states that positions in this endgame in general \\"are very volatile, and often the winning side is simply the one who starts out being able to win material or launch an attack on the opposing king\\" . Glenn Flear agrees with that assessment for endgames. He could not find an endgame by Capablanca that supported his statement. The statistics for queen and bishop versus queen and knight endgames are about even. Most decisive games were won because of a significant advantage from the middlegame and only a limited number of positions show an inherent superiority for one over the other .

He, along with Chen Fan, attempted to curb the eunuchs' power and install Confucian scholars in imperial government, but after a plot by him and Chen to exterminate the most powerful eunuchs was discovered, he was defeated in battle and committed suicide. Career under Emperor Huan Dou Wu's father Dou Feng () was a great-grandson of Dou Rong (), who contributed much to Emperor Guangwu's campaign to reestablish Han Dynasty. Dou Feng was a commandery governor. When Dou Wu was young, he became known for his scholarship in Confucian classics and was famous for it in all of western empire, but was not involved in politics. That changed in 165 when his daughter Dou Miao was selected to be an imperial consort, as an eligible woman from an honored clan. Because of this, Emperor Huan made Dou Wu a low level official. Later that year, after Empress Deng Mengnü was deposed, the imperial officials all favored Consort Dou to be the new empress due to Dou Wu's reputation, and Emperor Huan gave in to their wishes although he personally did not favor Consort Dou. She was created empress later that year. Dou Wu was promoted to be the commander of the capital (Luoyang) defense forces and created a marquess. In 167, during the height of the first Disaster of Partisan Prohibition (in which Confucian officials and their university student supporters were accused to be \\"partisans\\" scheming against the emperor), Dou Wu interceded on the partisans' behalf, requesting leniency and at the same time tendering his resignation (which Emperor Huan did not accept). It was with his intercession and that of Huo Xu () that Emperor Huan did not execute any of the partisans, although he did strip their civil liberties. Dou Wu, in the meantime, also recommended several scholars who were not accused to be partisans for important posts. Career during his daughter's regency and death Early in 168, Emperor Huan died without an heir. Empress Dou became empress dowager and regent. She consulted her father and Chen Fan with regard to who would be the new emperor. They eventually decided on the 12-year-old Liu Hong (), the Marquess of Jieduting. Later that year, he became emperor (as Emperor Ling). Empress Dowager Dou continued to serve as regent. With Empress Dowager Dou as regent, Dou Wu and Chen became the most important officials in the imperial government. Dou Wu was given a larger march, while his son and two nephews were also created marquesses. Dou and Chen recalled the partisans and made many of them important officials. Meanwhile, though, they became concerned that the emperor and the empress dowager were being surrounded by eunuchs, the ladies in waiting, and Emperor Ling's wet nurse Zhao Rao (), who flattered them and were trusted by them. Chen and Dou therefore started a plot to exterminate all of the powerful eunuchs. When Dou Wu presented the plan to his daughter, however, she refused—reasoning that not all of the powerful eunuchs deserved death. Dou Wu therefore sought to execute four—Guan Ba (), Su Kang (), Cao Jie (), and Wang Fu (). As Empress Dowager Dou was still pondering this proposal, another eunuch, Zhu Yu (), while Dou Wu was on vacation, opened up Dou Wu's proposal and found out that Dou Wu proposed a mass extermination plan and became enraged. He gathered 17 other eunuchs and took Emperor Ling into custody (managing to persuade him that they did it for his own protection) and kidnapping Empress Dowager Dou. They then sent forces to arrest Dou Wu and Chen. Chen was quickly captured and killed, but Dou gathered his forces and resisted. The eunuchs tricked the general Zhang Huan (), who was battle tested as the former commander of the northern border defense forces, into believing that Dou was committing treason, and Zhang led his forces to defeat Dou Wu. After defeat, Dou Wu committed suicide, and his entire clan was slaughtered. Empress Dowager Dou lost power and was put under house arrest ever since. However, Dou Wu's young grandson Dou Fu was saved.

He exposed such scandals as thalidomide and the Dalkon Shield. Since 2004 he has been a Senior Adviser to niemanwatchdog.org. Career In 1955, at the Globe-Democrat, Mintz did the nation's first newspaper series on the plight of the mentally retarded. At the Post, he broadened conventional definitions of \\"news\\" with people-oriented reporting on issues mainly involving the pharmaceutical, medical-device, tobacco, oil, auto and insurance industries. At the Post, in 1962, Mintz broke the story of thalidomide, the sedative/tranquilizer that caused several thousand children worldwide to be born without arms, legs, or without any limbs at all. Although the press greeted the advent of the original oral contraceptive uncritically, he revealed that in approving The Pill, in 1960, the FDA had launched the greatest uncontrolled medical experiment in human history. Tens of millions of healthy human beings would take The Pill 20 or 21 days a month, often throughout their child-bearing lifespan, on the basis of inadequate scientific evidence of safety. Mintz also reported on numerous unsafe and/or ineffective medicines and medical devices, including cholesterol-lowering MER/29, which afflicted thousands with cataracts; Oraflex, a killer anti-arthritis drug withdrawn by the manufacturer only a few months after sales began, and the Dalkon Shield and Cu-7 IUDs. Starting in 1965, and continuing into 1999, he reported on the tobacco industry, including the 1988 smoker-death trial in which cigarette makers were compelled to disclose for the first time what they knew of the dangers of smoking and when they knew it. In 1993, Mintz wrote Allies: The ACLU and the Tobacco Industry, which exposed the American Civil Liberties Union's conflict of interest in advocating a key industry cause in Congress and soliciting and accepting money from that industry, both while disclosing nothing to ACLU members of either activity. In 1966, Mintz broke the story of the tailing of Ralph Nader by a private detective retained by General Motors and for years covered automotive-safety issues. He was often alone in reporting grave corporate crime and misconduct. Mintz covered the Supreme Court's 1965 and 1978-1980 terms. In 1983, he reported on the refusal of the United States during World War II to bomb the rail lines to the gas ovens at Birkenau and the Auschwitz death camp itself. He based the story on an exclusive interview with John J. McCloy, who as an assistant Secretary of War had played a key role in the episode. Personal Mintz lives in Washington, D.C.

Untrimmed, the tri-tip weighs around 5 pounds. In the U.S., the tri- tip is taken from NAMP cut 185C.  Etymology  Roasted tri-tip The precise origin of the name \\"tri-tip\\" for this cut of beef is unclear, with several sources claiming original usage of the term. This cut of beef has been referred to by a variety of names including \\"Newport steak,\\" \\"Santa Maria steak,\\" \\"Triangle tip,\\" and \\"Triangle steak.\\" The cut was known in the United States as early as 1915, called \\"the triangle part\\" of the loin butt. Triangle tip, cooked in wine, was served at Jack's Corsican Room in Long Beach in 1955. The cut was marketed under the name \\"tri-tip\\" as early as 1964, at Desert Provisions in Palm Springs. Otto Schaefer Sr. claimed to have originally named and marketed tri-tip in Oakland, California, in the 1950s. My Father, a butcher in Oakland (Part 4) Butcher and restaurateur Jack Ubaldi claimed to have originally named and marketed tri-tip under the name \\"Newport steak\\" in the 1950s. Larry Viegas, a butcher at a Santa Maria Safeway store in the late 1950s, claimed that the idea to cook this as a distinct cut of beef first occurred to his store manager, Bob Schutz, when an excess of hamburger existed in the store (into which this part of the animal were usually ground). Viegas says that Schultz took a piece of the unwanted meat, seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic salt, and placed it on a rotisserie for 45 minutes or an hour; the result was well-received, and Schultz began marketing the cut as \\"tri-tip.\\" It became a local specialty in Santa Maria in the late 1950s. Today, it is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and other seasonings, grilled directly over red oak wood to medium-rare doneness. Alternative preparations include roasting whole on a rotisserie, smoking (cooking) in a pit, baking in an oven, grilling, or braising in a Dutch oven after searing on a grill. After cooking, the meat is normally sliced across the grain before serving. Sometimes labeled \\"Santa Maria steak,\\" the roast is popular in the Central Valley regions and the Central Coast of California. Along with top sirloin, tri-tip is considered central to Santa Maria-style barbecue. In central California, the fat is left on the outside of the cut to enhance flavor when grilling, while butchers elsewhere trim the fat side for aesthetic purposes.  Europe  Tri-tip is called aiguillette baronne in France and is left whole as a roast.\\"L'aiguillette baronne\\" , CIV (Centre d'Information des Viandes) In northern Germany, it is called Bürgermeisterstück or Pastorenstück, in Austria Hüferschwanz, and in southern Germany it is called the same name as the traditional and popular Bavarian and Austrian dish Tafelspitz, which serves it boiled with horseradish. In Spain, it is often grilled whole and called the rabillo de cadera.  South America  In Argentine asado, it is known as colita de cuadril. In Brazilian churrasco, it is known as maminha.  Cooking  This cut of beef can be sliced into steaks, grilled in its entirety, or used in chili con carne. To grill or roast the tri-tip, heat the pan on high until it is very hot. For best results, the tri- tip should be seared and roasted, putting the fat side down in the pan. The roast can then be put in the oven and cooked for about 10 minutes per pound until the internal temperature is 127°F for medium-rare.

Located between Rockford and the southern border of Wisconsin, the school serves students from the towns of Rockton, Roscoe, Shirland, and parts of South Beloit. Specifically, the school districts Kinnikinnick School District 131, Prairie Hill School District 133, Rockton School District 140, and Shirland School District 134 all feed into the high school. Hononegah Community High School opened in 1923. The school is named after the Native American Hononegah, wife of Stephen Mack Jr.. Stephen Mack Jr. is credited to the founding of Rockton, Illinois. The school's namesake is honored with a large mural of Hononegah in the school's main lobby. One of the unique aspects of Hononegah was its inflatable \\"bubble\\" field house, the first of its kind for any Illinois public school, until its collapse in December 2015 due to a hailstorm. It was replaced by a field house in March 2019. History Hononegah (c.1814–1847) was the wife of Stephen Mack, Jr. an employee for The American Fur Company, a pioneer to the Rock River Valley in northern Illinois and founder of the community of Rockton, Illinois. Hononegah had a strong influence on the Roscoe-Rockton area; the high school of the four towns and the main thoroughfare connecting the towns are both named after her. Hononegah High School was built in 1922, and dedicated in February 1923. Additions to the building have taken place in the 1950s, 1971 (metal gym complex), 1981 classroom addition, 1996 (Performing Arts Center and classrooms), 2003 (new entrance, locker rooms, guidance and social studies as well as the information system's academy), and 2019 (field house). The cafeteria was originally the theater and gym. The concession area in the metal gym was the location of the Hononegah Theater in the 1970s through 1996. District 207 purchased land near Interstate I-90 to accommodate a second campus if enrollment continues to rise. Notable additions to the base campus include a Performing Arts Center capable of seating 1,100 and an athletic practice dome (which deflated in a hail storm during the winter of 2015 and replaced by a field house). As of the 2019 - 2020 school year, the school's demographics is 84.6% White, 7.4% Hispanic, 3.3% 2+ Races, 2.5% Asian, 1.9% African American, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 0.1% American Indian. 175px Academics In 2008, the Chicago Sun-Times listed Hononegah as the 50th best public high school in the state of Illinois based on average scores on the PSAE, and one of the ten best outside of the Chicago area. In 2010, Newsweek announced that Hononegah qualified for the magazine's 2011 list of the nation's top high schools. Over the past three years Hononegah has increased the amount of advanced placement tests its students are taking. In 2012, Hononegah had an average composite ACT score of 22.9, and graduated 89.39% of its senior class. Though from 2006 to 2014, Hononegah students have achieved 9 perfect scores. As of 2014, 72.6% of students met or exceeded standards in reading, 75.9% met or exceeded in mathematics, and 69.% met or exceeded in science on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, a test used to estimate the school's Adequate Yearly Progress for the No Child Left Behind Act. Athletics Hononegah competes in the Northern Illinois Conference (NIC-10) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most high school athletics and competitive activities in the state. Teams are stylized as the Indians. The following teams have finished in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournaments or meets: * Football: semifinals (1996–97); 2nd place (1985–86) * Volleyball (girls): 2nd place (2006–07) * Wrestling: 4th place (2004–05, 2006–07) Hononegah is also one of five drafting schools of the Rockford Icemen hockey program. Along with Boylan High School, Guilford High School, Harlem High School, and Christian Life, Hononegah contributes nearly ten student athletes to the Rockford Icemen who recently won their fifteenth consecutive Illinois state championship. = Dome Collapse = After an ice storm in December 2015, the 13-year-old dome collapsed. It housed several events for indoor track athletes, including practices and meets, practice room for all winter sports teams, physical education classes, and various community events. The dome was designed by Air Structures American Technologies Inc. and cost $3 million at the time of its construction in 2002. It was meant to last 15–20 years. = Field House Construction & Opening = In 2017, following the collapse of the dome, Hononegah School District officials proposed a $17.8 million referendum in order to construct a brand new 90,000 square-foot field house. During the November 2016 general election, voters initially rejected a $44 million referendum that would increase taxes to supply funds to replace the dome and implement various other renovations throughout the school. After this rejection, a new $17.8 million referendum was added to the April ballot, which very narrowly passed with only 51% of voters approving the measure by a difference of 127 votes. On November 7, 2017, a groundbreaking ceremony was held, signifying the beginning of construction. School officials say they fully intend for this space to be open to the public rather than only Hononegah students. 175px On April 5, 2019, an opening ceremony was held to officially open the field house. It started with a ribbon cutting ceremory following by activities throughout the day. Controversies In mid 2018, Madison Oster opened a lawsuit against the high school. They claimed that the school breached her civil rights to be for gun rights during the mass walkout of school on February 14, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. On January 8, 2020, a group of Hononegah students in a group called \\"Hononegah SDS\\" started a petition to remove the mascot of their school and change it to something else. The controversy created a spinoff petition meant to keep the mascot. As of February 1, 2020 18:30 UST, the first petition has nearly 2,500 signatures and the spinoff petition to keep the mascot has nearly 15 thousand signatures.

Lucedio Abbey (Italian: Abbazia di Santa Maria di Lucedio) is a 12th-century former Cistercian foundation near Trino, which is now in the province of Vercelli, north-west Italy. It played an important role in the development of rice production in the region. History The abbey was founded in 1124, when Renier I of Montferrat provided an extensive tract of marsh, heath and woodland known as Locez, on whose agricultural development the future prosperity of Lucedio would depend. As the second daughter-house of La Ferté Abbey (after Tiglieto Abbey, in the Ligurian Apennines), this was one of the earliest Cistercian monasteries in Italy. Lucedio contributed in its turn to the expansion of the Cistercian Order by giving birth to three daughter-houses over the next eighty years: Santa Maria di Castagnola Abbey in Chiaravalle (1147) in the Marche, Rivalta Scrivia (1180) near Tortona and Acqualunga (1204) near Pavia. The refectory. The Abbey’s political ties to the Aleramici of Montferrat were shown in 1202 when its abbot, Peter II, accompanied the Marquess Boniface, grandson of Renier, on the notorious Fourth Crusade. After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 Boniface, as leader of the crusade, had expectations of being appointed the first emperor of the new Latin Empire. Abbot Peter was among the electors and is presumed to have been among the two or three who voted for Boniface. The crown, however, went to Baldwin, Count of Flanders who had the support of the Venetians. Thwarted in this ambition, Boniface and his crusaders conquered Thessalonica and was installed by Baldwin as king of the Crusader state the Kingdom of Thessalonica, albeit under authority of Constantinople. Peter became Bishop of Ivrea (and later Patriarch of Antioch) and his long-time associate Ogliero (who was later beatified by the Church) took his place as Abbot of Lucedio in 1205. The abbey then housed fifty monks. In 1214 two further daughter-houses of Lucedio were founded in the Crusader states: Saint George de Jubino in the Principality of Antioch and Chortaïton in Thessalonica. The abbey managed its agricultural assets employing the grange system and was effective in developing the productivity of the land, notably introducing the cultivation of rice to this damp riverside area in the fifteenth century. Today the Vercelli region is one of the most important areas of rice production in Italy. From 1457, by an act of Pope Callixtus III, Lucedio was placed under commendatorial control, losing prestige and autonomy. The abbey was secularized in 1784, the remaining monks being transferred to a Jesuit college in Castelnuovo Scrivia. The buildings and their lands have passed through various hands in subsequent years, including those of Napoleon Bonaparte, who gave it to Camillo Borghese in exchange for a large quantity of artworks which are now housed in the Louvre. Today the abbey buildings are incorporated into a rice farm. Architecture The original church dated to the founding of the monastery, and had become in danger of collapse. It was rebuilt between 1767 to 1770 in a baroque style, designed by the monk architect Valente de Giovanni. Its striking medieval bell-tower however remains intact: a rectangular base from 1150–1175 supporting an octagonal structure from perhaps a hundred years later. After the closure of the abbey, this became the town's parish church. It underwent extensive restoration work in the first decade of the 21st century.

They are qin (the guqin, a stringed instrument, 琴), qi (the strategy game of Go, 棋), shu (Chinese calligraphy, 書) and hua (Chinese painting, 畫), and are also referred to by listing all four: . Origin of the concept Although the individual elements of the concept have very long histories as activities befitting a learned person, the earliest written source putting the four together is Zhang Yanyuan's 9th century Fashu Yaolu (Compendium of Calligraphy) from the Tang Dynasty. File:The Eighteen Scholars by an anonymous Ming artist 1.jpgQin File:The Eighteen Scholars by an anonymous Ming artist 2.jpgWeiqi (Go) File:The Eighteen Scholars by an anonymous Ming artist 3.jpgCalligraphy File:The Eighteen Scholars by an anonymous Ming artist 4.jpgPainting Qin The guqin Qin 琴 is the musical instrument of the literati, the guqin. Although it exclusively meant this instrument in ancient times, it has now come to mean all musical instruments, but essentially it refers to guqin only considering the context. The guqin is a seven-stringed zither that owes its invention to the Chinese society of some 3,000 years ago. During the reign of the imperial China, a scholar was expected to play the guqin. Guqin was explored as an art-form as well as a science, and scholars strove to both play it well and to create texts on its manipulation. Gǔqín notation was invented some 1,500 years ago, and to this day it has not been drastically changed. Some books contain musical pieces written and mastered more than 500 years ago. Guqin is so influential that it even made its way into space: the spacecraft Voyager launched by the U.S. in 1977 contained the Voyager Golden Record, a vinyl style record of a guqin piece named \\"Flowing Water\\". The fact that the guqin's name breaks down to gu (old) and qin (musical instrument) reveals the instrument's great antiquity. Qi A Ming dynasty print of wéiqí players Qi 棋 is a board game and art form which is now called weiqi (圍棋) in Chinese (Go in Japan and the West), literally meaning \\"surrounding game.\\" Current definitions of qi cover a wide range of board games, and given that in classical Chinese qí could also refer to other games, some argue that the qí in the four arts could refer to xiangqi. However, xiangqi is often considered a popular \\"game of the people,\\" whereas weiqi was a game with aristocratic connotations. Many theories exist regarding the origin of weiqi in Chinese history. One of these holds that it was an ancient fortune-telling device used by Chinese cosmologists to simulate the universe's relationship to an individual. Another suggests that the legendary Emperor Yao invented it to enlighten his son. Certainly weiqi had begun to take hold around the 6th century BCE when Confucius mentioned wéiqí in his Analects 17:22. Weiqi is a game in which two players take turns placing black and white stones on a board consisting of a grid of 19x19 lines. Stones are placed on the intersections of the grid. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed if a stone or group of stones is surrounded on four sides by stones of the opposing color occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points. The two players place stones alternately until they reach a point at which neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. At the conclusion of the game, it is scored by counting the territory encircled by each side (empty space along with captured stones) and the number of stones remaining on the board to determine the winner. Games may also be won by resignation. Ancient weiqi texts are prized among modern Chinese weiqi professionals, as seen below in the translation of an ancient strategy book: Shu A Chinese calligrapher Shu 書 refers to Chinese calligraphy, which dates to the origins of recorded Chinese history, in essence ever since written characters have existed. Chinese calligraphy is said to be an expression of a practitioner's poetic nature, as well as a significant test of manual dexterity. Chinese calligraphy has evolved for thousands of years, and its state of flux stopped only when Chinese characters were unified across the empire. Chinese calligraphy differs from western calligraphic script in the sense that it was done with a brush instead of metal implements or a quill. Calligraphy was the art by which a scholar could compose his thoughts to be immortalized. It was the scholar's means of creating expressive poetry and sharing his or her own learnedness. Calligraphic process is also structured in the same way as weiqi. A minimalist set of rules conveys a system of incredible complexity and grandeur. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Only three basic forms are used in the creation of the character, those being square, triangle and circle. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes, none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect or individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the more precious treasures that can be found from ancient China. Hua Eight horsemen in Spring, by Zhao Yan, 10th century, Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Hua 畫 refers to Chinese painting. Brush painting is the final of the arts that a scholar is expected to learn, and is arguably the greatest measure of individual creativity. Through painting a Chinese noble would demonstrate his mastery over the art of line. Often Chinese paintings would be produced on a sheet of plain white rice-paper or silk using nothing but black ink and a single brush. These paintings were made to demonstrate the power of a single line, and in them was reflected a skill that valued intentional and calculated strokes over instinctual erratic creation. In a Chinese painting was reflected the artist's ability to evaluate his own imagination and record it clearly and concisely. Chinese painting can be traced back even further than calligraphy. Some examples date back to the decorative paintings that were emblazoned on Neolithic pottery. To add tonal quality to paintings the artists would often paint portions of the subject then wash the cloth before continuing. This made for beautiful landscapes and depictions of ritual. Painting was the art by which a scholar could separate him or herself from the others and take a name.

The most common imprest system is the petty cash system. The base characteristic of an imprest system is that a fixed amount is reserved, which after a certain period of time or when circumstances require, because money was spent, it will be replenished. This replenishment will come from another account source, e.g., petty cash will be replenished by cashing a cheque drawn on a bank account. Petty cash imprest system Petty cash imprest system allows only the replenishment of the spend made. So, if one starts the month with $100 in one's petty cash float and spend $90 of that cash in that month, an amount of $90 will be then placed in one's petty cash float to bring the balance of the petty cash float back to $100. The replenishment is credited to the primary cash account, usually a bank account (Dr - Petty Cash a/c, Cr - Bank a/c) and the debits will go to the respective expenses account, based on the petty cash receipt dockets (Dr - Expense a/c, Cr - Petty Cash a/c). Advantages In this example the maximum amount of petty cash that can be issued (spent) is $100. The claimant may only spend what they have and is only replenished with what they spend, in this case $90. In a non imprest system where a fixed amount is issued every month, e.g., $100 every time cash is required, there is no incentive to ensure all money issued has been documented because when money is all spent a check for a fixed amount is issued. It is much more difficult to reconcile a non imprest system as one never knows how much exactly should be in the float. In an imprest system the amount requested is documented, the documentation being the petty cash dockets and their associated receipts or invoices. Therefore, at all times one can check how much should be left in the petty cash float by deducting the amount spent from the opening petty cash float. How petty cash imprest system works The imprest system ensures that one must document how the petty cash is spent. In a petty cash system, petty cash receipts are written for each amount issued. So, when all of these receipts are totalled at the end of the month and deducted from the opening petty cash float, the calculated value must agree with what is left in the petty cash float. Under the imprest system, only that which is recorded as spent is replenished. Any shortfalls might need to be replenished by the guardian, usually a bookkeeper, of the petty cash float from their own personal resources.The base characteristic of imprest system is that a fixed amount is reserved which after a certain period of time when circumstances require, because money was spent, it will be replenished.

They were a traveling team which played in the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball, an independent league not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The team started play in the 2005 season due to an uneven number of teams in the Can-Am League after the disbanding of the Bangor Lumberjacks, and were disbanded after the season. The Grays rejoined the league along with the Atlantic City Surf for 2007 to maintain an even number of teams, but were disbanded again following the year. A third incarnation, called the Garden State Grays, played during the 2015 season, to maintain schedule balance after a touring team of players from Japan's Shikoku Island League Plus finished their early season tour of the league. The team played both home and away games but, since they were a traveling team with no home base, their \\"home\\" games were played in the opposing team's stadium with the Grays batting last. History The Grays came into existence in April 2005, when the Can-Am League terminated the membership of the Bangor Lumberjacks, who had said they did not have the resources to operate for the season. The team's roster at the time became the roster for the Grays (unlike the year before when the Aces, who replaced the Allentown Ambassadors, were not able to keep their team intact), and Chris Carminucci was hired as their manager. Playing in a 96-game split season, the Grays were competitive in the first half, finishing with an even 23–23 record and placing 7 games behind the front running Quebec Capitales. However, the bottom fell out in the second half, and the Grays finished with a 10–36 second-half record, 19 games out of first place. The Grays were disbanded in the 2005–2006 offseason, with part of its roster being absorbed by the expansion Sussex Skyhawks. The Grays were one of two teams to fold that offseason (the Elmira Pioneers was the other; Sussex and the Atlantic League's Nashua Pride joined the league in their places). Along with the Atlantic City Surf, the Grays were part of the Can-Am League's expansion in 2007. The team failed once again to make the playoffs, and after the season the team joined the New Haven County Cutters and North Shore Spirit in suspending operations and made their players available in a dispersal draft. The Grays did not return in 2009 despite further contraction of the Can-Am League which left an uneven number of teams in the league.
