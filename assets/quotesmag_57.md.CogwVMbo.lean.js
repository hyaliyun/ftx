History With the onset of World War II, the Eglin Field military reservation was greatly expanded when the Choctawhatchee National Forest was turned over to the War Department by the U.S. Forestry Service on 18 October 1940, and a series of auxiliary airfields were constructed from January 1941 onward. The history of Pierce Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of construction of Pierce Field is undetermined. It was constructed in a similar manner to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. It was possibly used by then-Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle in 1942 as one of several practice sites on the greater Eglin Field complex for the short takeoff runs needed for his B-25 bomber crews to conduct their carrier-launched raid on Japan. At some point after 1945, a new 8,000-foot jet runway was laid down west of the north/south runway 18/36, with 18/36 also being extended to 8,000 feet. The use of these jet runways, however is undetermined. Between November 1966 and 1970, Pierce Field was the site of the 560th Civil Engineering Squadron, also known as the Civil Engineering Field Activities Center, for the training of RED HORSE personnel. In 1975, after the Fall of Saigon, the installation served as one of four South Vietnamese resettlement camps established in the United States as part of Operation New Arrivals, the largest humanitarian airlift in history. Air Force personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees in a \\"Tent City.\\" It again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000 Cubans who fled to the U.S. between April and May 1980. =Current status= The active use of the field initially ended in the late 1970s, was reactivated in the late 1980s and closed again in 2000. The airfield remains under the ownership of the United States Air Force and is under the jurisdiction of the 96th Test Wing, formerly the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) at Eglin AFB. It is likely used as part of the testing of new weapon systems, defensive systems and support systems. It was used as part of the former Air Armament Center (AAC) until that organization was disestablished in October 2012 and merged with the 96th Air Base Wing into the current 96th Test Wing. The last active-duty USAF F-4D Phantom II, AF Ser. No. 68-8800, has been sitting on ramp at Pierce Field since 1992.

He played professionally as a fullback and halfback for three seasons with the Cleveland Rams and Cleveland Browns in the National Football League (NFL) and All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Greenwood played college football at the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois, where he starred as a halfback, punter and quarterback. His first year in professional football was with the NFL's Rams in 1945, when the team won the NFL championship. The Rams moved to Los Angeles after that year, however, and Greenwood elected to stay in Cleveland, where a new team called the Cleveland Browns was under formation in the AAFC. He played two seasons for the Browns, during both of which the team won the league championship. Greenwood was plagued by injuries in 1946, and in 1947 he suffered a debilitating cheekbone fracture that ended his professional career. After retiring, he worked as a high school coach in Ohio and briefly as an assistant at Yale University. In 1951, became the head football coach at Toledo University in Toledo, Ohio, but resigned from that position before completing his first season, saying the school had not done enough to counteract unnecessary violence in the game. Early life and high school Greenwood grew up in Kansas City, Missouri and attended Southwest High School. He played on the school's football team but was more accomplished as a track athlete. He won the Missouri state championship in 1938 by running the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds. In 1939, he was a member of an 880-yard relay team that won state and national championships. College career After graduating from high school, Greenwood enrolled at the University of Missouri in 1940 and played on the school's football team as a halfback who doubled as a punter. He also continued to run track, and set a school record of 6.2 seconds in the 60-yard dash. In football, Greenwood became a star on strong Missouri teams in 1941 and 1942. The Missouri Tigers football team ended the 1941 season with an 8‚Äì2 record under head coach Don Faurot, winning the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (Big Six) title and advancing to the Sugar Bowl against Fordham. Missouri lost the game after a punt by Greenwood in the first period was blocked, leading to a safety. The final score of the game, played on a muddy field, was 2‚Äì0. Greenwood entered the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 to serve in World War II, but he got a medical discharge in 1943 after he was injured in a plane crash. After leaving the air corps, Greenwood enrolled at the University of Illinois and played in 1943 and 1944 for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. He played quarterback at Illinois, and threw five touchdowns in 1943. He played in an October 1944 game against a military team at Great Lakes Naval Training Station coached by Paul Brown that ended in a 26‚Äì26 tie. Greenwood also played baseball in college, mostly as a pitcher starting as a sophomore at Missouri in 1941. In his final year at Illinois he batted .415 against Big Ten Conference teams. He ultimately decided that he had better chances as a football player. Professional career Greenwood went undrafted in 1944 but signed late that year with the National Football League's Cleveland Rams. He came to Cleveland before the 1945 season and began an off-season job at Thompson Products Company in its engineering department. His college degree was in psychology, and he hoped to switch to personnel work. He also worked as an assistant to Edward McKeever at Cornell University before the season started. With the Rams, Greenwood was part of a potent offense led by quarterback Bob Waterfield. The team won the 1945 NFL Championship Game by a score of 15‚Äì14 in frigid conditions at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Owner Dan Reeves moved the Rams to Los Angeles after the 1945 season, and Greenwood decided to stay in Cleveland and play for the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and coached by Paul Brown. He was still under contract with the Rams, but he signed with the Browns after successfully arguing along with several other Rams players that he was not legally bound to play for a team not based in Cleveland. Before the 1946 season started, Greenwood was working in the personnel department of A.W. Hecker Company. He left the company, however, to take a job as the track coach at Western Reserve University in Cleveland. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1946, and Greenwood tied as the league's touchdown leader with six. Greenwood, who played halfback both on offense and defense, was plagued by injuries late in 1946 and into 1947. He had a broken cheekbone in 1947 that put him in the hospital for two weeks and kept him on the sidelines as the Browns won another AAFC championship. Coaching career After the 1947 season, Greenwood announced his retirement from football due to his cheekbone injury and accepted a job as head football coach at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Greenwood was hired as an assistant coach at Yale University in 1949. By 1951, he was the football coach at Toledo University in Toledo, Ohio. But he left that post the same year in protest of \\"rough play\\" during a game between Toledo and Bowling Green. He said football should be discontinued at the school until players could be protected and their safety ensured. He said he would give up coaching until the \\"accent on win at any cost is abolished\\". The cheekbone injury he sustained in an \\"uncalled for collision\\" in a 1947 game against the San Francisco 49ers helped prompt his decision, he said. He had three operations on the injury, and it had not completely healed.

A music video accompanied the track and was published in 2008.  Background and composition  The title track, \\"Kill Kill\\", was originally titled \\"The Ocean\\"; however, the title changed after a record producer dismissed the name as \\"boring\\". In frustration, Lana crossed out \\"The Ocean\\" above the lyrics, and wrote \\"Kill Kill\\" in place of a title. > \\"Yes, when I recorded with Davey (David Kahne), we recorded 13 songs. So I > was never expecting to release an EP, but when iTunes came to us, and became > fervent supporters and said, \\"put out anything and we'll give you the > artist's spotlight\\". We decided, okay, we'll just put out an EP, which was > released on October 21\\". In an interview, Del Rey called the EP's genre \\"Hawaiian glam metal\\". Artists that influenced the EP's sound include Elvis Presley, Poison, and Van Halen. Songwriter and producer David Nichtern revealed to MTV that Kill Kill was a way for Del Rey and her team to generate some buzz before releasing a fully produced studio album. Writing for The Huffington Post, Felicia C. Sullivan said that the EP was \\"decidedly anti-genre\\", containing elements of jazz, pop, electronica, rock, and blues.  Critical reception  Index Magazine called Kill Kill \\"lush and cinematic, with strings, Wurlitzers, and electric guitars\\". On the three tracks, Del Rey's voice was called \\"gravelly\\" and inspired by Marilyn Monroe. Felicia C. Sullivan, a journalist for The Huffington Post, wrote that Del Rey's vocals were haunting and soulful on Kill Kill. Lyrically, Kill Kill was called dark, poetic, and elegant. Of the videos shot for Kill Kill, Sullivan said they were \\"quirky, odd, [and] magical\\", stating that Del Rey must be \\"infatuated with Americana\\". Sullivan said it was safe to say that the tracks of Kill Kill tell the story of a \\"precocious, but strong-willed woman on display\\". Del Rey endorsed the critique, adding that she: > \\"... didn't feel trapped in a trailer park. I felt trapped before I got to > the trailer park because I had nowhere to live. When I got my trailer, > everyone there had the same taste as I did. We all liked giant, lush, fake > flower gardens and liked to decorate the walls with streamers even if it > wasn't our birthday.

Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the EP differs from the tone and sound of Del Rey's debut major label single, \\"Video Games\\", which gained Del Rey significant mainstream attention. More specifically, Halperin described a contrast in \\"Video Games\\", and Del Rey's works before \\"Video Games\\", including Kill Kill, with the former having contained a \\"breathy, melancholy musings\\", and the latter having contained a \\"jazz-meets-electronica lounge\\" sound.

The court considered her tale to be a Satanic illusion or a symptom of insanity, and sentenced her to eight days on water and bread and Uppenbar kyrkoplikt for having worked on a Sunday and for having used the name of the Trinity in her chants. She was banned from her work as a cunning woman and the vicar's assistants kept her cottage under watch. The verdict, however, only served to make her more widely known as a cunning woman, and the vicar complained that many people travelled to her for her help and trusted her as if she was a deity. In 1737, the vicar's assistants caught her with a client, Beata Grupe, and they were both arrested and taken to the vicarage. She was put on trial for the second time in 1738. This time, she claimed to have been taught by her cousin Gertrud Zakrisdotter (1647‚Äì1718), and she read five of her medical chants in court. The court did not consider her guilty of witchcraft, but repeated their judgement from the last trial. On 21 October 1738 she was sentenced to 12 days on bread and water. She served her sentence at the Kajsatornet (Kajsa Tower) at the Visby city wall. Brita Bi√∂rn is confirmed alive as late as 1745, but her exact year of death is unknown. In 1760, an old woman only mentioned as \\"Old Brita\\" is noted as dead in the parish register, and in 1765, \\"The widow of Bi√∂rn\\" was registered as dead, but it is not known if Brita Bi√∂rn was one of these two.  Successors  She had a son, boatswain Olof J√∂nsson Lunda (1692‚Äì1773), who married Pernilla Larsesdotter (1715‚Äì1779). Her son's daughter Greta Enderberg (1746‚Äì1831) and great granddaughter Gertrud Ahlgren (1782‚Äì1874), succeeded her as famous cunning women on Gotland: they were both known as Hejnumsk√§ringen during their time as cunning woman.

Lund grew up in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and went to the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio. He was a star on his college football, basketball and track teams. He was a triple threat man in football, playing halfback and fullback. In track, he set and still holds school records in the 100-yard dash and long jump. His 110-yard dash time of 9.7 was set in 1945, and will never be broken as 110-yard dash is no longer run. He won the U.S. amateur championship in 1944 in the long jump. After a short stint in the U.S. Navy, Lund was drafted in 1945 by the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League. He signed instead to play for the Browns, a team under formation in the new AAFC. After two years with the Browns, in both of which the team won the AAFC championship, he was traded to the Chicago Rockets. Lund, however, elected to leave professional football to work as an engineer. He was later an assistant coach at Case, his alma mater. College and professional career Lund grew up in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and played football briefly in high school. He graduated and attended the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio starting in 1942, playing on the school's football, basketball and track teams. As a sophomore in 1943 he became a primary halfback on Case's football team and was touted as an emerging triple threat man. Lund joined the U.S. Navy during World War II, but was allowed to stay at Case and study engineering as part of the Navy's V-12 training program. In the summer of 1944, he won the U.S. long jump title at the Amateur Athletic Union track and field championships in New York City. Lund set school records in the long jump, with 23 feet and 7 inches, and the 100-yard dash, with a time of 9.7 seconds. In the 1944 football season, Lund was moved from halfback to fullback. Later in the season, he became the team's primary passer while continuing to run the ball and kick. Lund was selected by the National Football League's Cleveland Rams with the 147th pick in the 1945 NFL Draft. Lund was still in the military in 1945, however, stationed at a base in San Diego, California and playing for the Fleet City Blue Jackets, a service team in San Diego. Upon his discharge in the summer of 1946, Lund signed with the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). After injuries sidelined two of the team's starting halfbacks in 1946, head coach Paul Brown said Lund would be used more frequently. He got off to a strong start playing alongside fullback Marion Motley, the team's primary running threat. He suffered an ankle injury later in the season, however, as the Browns went on to win the 1946 AAFC championship. Lund got married in May 1947 to Nancy Ann Faris of Lorain, Ohio. He was introduced to his wife, a nurse, by teammate Robert Kolesar, who practiced medicine in the offseason. He also worked as an engineer in the offseason at Thompson Products, an aerospace and automotive conglomerate based in Euclid, Ohio. Near the beginning of the 1947 season, Lund broke his left thumb crashing into the stands after returning an interception for a touchdown against the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers. He missed three games and returned in October 1947. The Browns again won the AAFC championship that year. Before the beginning of the 1948 season, the Browns traded Lund and guard Joe Signaigo to the Chicago Rockets for guard Alex Agase and tackle Chubby Grigg. Lund did not play for the Rockets, however, quitting professional football to take a job as an engineer. Later career Lou Saban, Lund's teammate on the Browns, became Case's head football coach in 1950 and hired Lund to coach the freshman team. Lund later worked at Howmet Corporation in New Jersey and Cleveland's Sherwood Refractory. In 1979, he co-founded Concorde Castings, an aerospace components manufacturer, and was its chief executive officer until his retirement in 1995. Lund was a cousin of Pug Lund, a star at the University of Minnesota who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He died in 2008.

The system was based on small, completely automated tram-like vehicles of about 25 passengers that could be connected together into three-car trains to increase capacity. Proposed designs were submitted by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics (HSD) and EASAMS (part of GEC). HSD's system used rubber wheels and EASAMS' steerable steel ones, but the projects were otherwise similar and notably shared a linear motor for propulsion and most braking. A series of failed sales efforts in the UK and to the GO-Urban system in Toronto, combined with decreased government spending in the 1970s, led to the concept being abandoned. Background During the 1960s a number of influential studies were published on the nature and future of mass transit systems. Primary among these were a series of reports from the US known collectively as the HUD reports. The HUD reports concluded that existing forms of transit could not compete with the convenience of car driving. If such systems were to be successful, they would need to offer tighter schedules to reduce waiting, smaller cars with fewer passengers, and more direct routing to eliminate intermediate stops. The result was the personal rapid transit concept, or PRT.J. Edward Anderson, \\"Some Lessons from the History of Personal Rapid Transit\\", 4 August 1996 The reports suggested the only way to offer all of these features would be to use extensive automation. Systems were imagined with driverless vehicles with sizes anywhere from three to 20 passengers, normally travelling at fixed speeds to reduce timing complexity, with stations built \\"offline\\" on sidings to allow traffic to bypass intermediate stops. Even with relatively slow cruise speeds, end-to-end trip times would be better than existing mass transit systems, and especially cars.J. Edward Anderson, \\"An Intelligent Transportation Network System\\", April 2011 The publication of the HUD reports, along with considerable development funding by the US Congress, led to major development efforts in most of the industrialized countries around the world. Four major developments were underway in the US, two in France, two in Germany, and two in Japan. The UK initially entered the fray with early studies on the Cabtrack system, but a political firestorm followed the publication of proposed station designs and the concept was abandoned. =Minitram= Out of the ashes of the Cabtrack debacle came Minitram, designed to be technically simpler than Cabtrack, using on-line stations and scheduling and routing much more similar to conventional metro systems. The concept was no longer along the lines of the PRT systems, and was essentially a small metro system, with small 20 to 25-passenger cars that could automatically link together to reduce headway and thereby increase route capacity. This \\"automatic platooning\\" concept also allowed multiple routes in low-volume areas on the outskirts of the network to all feed into a small number of high-volume routes in the downtown cores. This was a topic of some research at the time, notably the French Aramis project. Initial studies by the TRRL demonstrated route capacities greater than Cabtrack, less construction for the same capacity, and better fare box returns. The studies examined vehicles with 14 to 20 passengers running on elevated tracks with 30 second minimum headways, maximum speeds of 55 km/h and average speeds including stops of 40 km/h. Several potential development sites were considered, including London's Docklands area and between Croydon and New Addington. The most serious study was for a line in Sheffield which connected the city's spread-out shopping areas. A complete report on the route was published in 1974 by Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall, calling for a total of 2.5 km of double-track forming roughly a U shape with nine stations. Peak capacity with three-car trains was 5,400 passengers per hour, reducing to as little as 180 per hour when running single cars at off-peak times with 5 minute headways. The government also provided some money to British Rail to study a maglev solution along the same routes. On 22 May 1975 the Minister for Transport cancelled the system. He argued that the system was not ready for deployment, and the cancellation was final. His argument for final cancellation was to allow the city to consider other transportation options. This eventually took the form of the existing Sheffield Supertram system, whose downtown route from City Hall to Park Grange follows the original Minitram route.David Banister, \\"Transport and Urban Development\\", Taylor & Francis, 1995, p. 179 The only other interest expressed in the Minitram system was by the GO-Urban development for Toronto. Hawker Siddeley Canada was already a major provider of equipment for Ontario, including both the H-series cars for the Toronto Transit Commission's subway system and the newly developed BiLevel Coach for GO Transit's regional rail networks.Daniel Garcia and James Bow, \\"The Bi-Level Coaches\\", Transit Toronto, 10 November 2006 After the initial downselect from 18 different proposals, the project selected the Ford ACT, Hawker's version of Minitram, and the Krauss-Maffei Transurban. Ford withdrew their system from the contest, leaving the two platooning systems (Transurban could operate in three-car trains) in the running. Given the high- tech goals of the project, it was considered a foregone conclusion that the Transurban would win the contest, as announced on 1 May 1973.Mike Filey, \\"Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were\\", Dundurn Press, 1997, p. 39 References =Citations= =Bibliography=  * Jack Irving, Harry Bernstein, C.

After a stint in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he joined the Browns in 1946. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year. Rokisky was sent to the Rockets in 1947 and to the Yankees the following year before leaving football. Early life and college career Rokisky grew up in Clarksburg, West Virginia and played as an end and a placekicker at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania beginning in 1939, when he was a sophomore. He scored nine points that year in an upset of the University of Pittsburgh. In a December game against the University of Detroit Mercy Titans, he kicked an extra point to tie the game at 10‚Äì10 and preserve Duquesne's unbeaten record. The Duquesne Dukes finished the season undefeated and were ranked eighth in the nation in the AP Poll of the best college teams. After the 1941 season, he was named an All-American by Collier's. At the end of 1941, he played on an eastern all-star college football team, one of three all-star squads he made during college. After he graduated from Duquesne, Rokisky joined the U.S. Navy's Seabees, a construction battalion. He played football for a military team at Camp Peary in Virginia and was selected to play on the Navy's all-star team. Professional career Rokisky was drafted in 1942 by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, but did not sign with the team as he continued his military service. In 1946, following his discharge from the Navy, he signed with the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was the 21st player signed by the team. Paul Brown, the coach of the Browns, placed Rokisky on the team's inactive list in October to make room for the addition of Bud Schwenk to the team's roster. The Browns went on to win the AAFC championship. Rokisky played in 1947 for the Chicago Rockets as a kicker, and moved in 1948 to the AAFC's New York Yankees before leaving professional football.

Hedda Albertina Andersson (24 April 1861, Malm√∂ - 7 September 1950, Lund), was a Swedish physician. She was the second female student at Lund University and the second university-educated woman physician in Sweden. Life Hedda Andersson was the daughter of a male laborer named Andersson and the cunning woman Johanna Andersson. When her father died in 1866, she moved with her mother and three siblings to her grandmother. On her mother's side, she descended from a line of medicine women, known to have practiced traditional folk medicine since at least seven generations, dating back to the 17th-century. Her great grandmother Marna Nilsdotter, as well as her grandmother Elna Hansson, was active in this field. Her mother and grandmother worked together as medical practitioners in Malm√∂. Her grandmother was famous in all Scandinavia as the Lundakvinnan (\\"Woman of Lund\\"), and had educated herself to a barber surgeon to avoid being accused of quackery, as did her daughter, the mother of Hedda, for the same reason. When the universities of Sweden were opened to women in 1870, her mother and grandmother decided that she should study medicine at a university and obtain a formal license, to avoid being persecuted and accused of quackery, which had been the case with many women in the history of their family, such as her grandmother and mother. Hedda Andersson was educated at the school of Maria Stenkula, and was admitted to Lund University in 1880. She has been referred to as the first female student there, though actually this was Hildegard Bj√∂rck only shortly before. She was the only female there until 1882, but she was reportedly treated with respect by her male fellow students. She took her bachelor's degree in 1887 and her medical license in 1892. She thereby became the second female physician to have graduated from a Swedish university after Karolina Widerstr√∂m. She also studied in Copenhagen in 1892 and 1895, and under Max S√§nger in Leipzig in 1893. She was active as a doctor in Ronneby 1892‚Äì95, in Malm√∂ in 1893‚Äì95 and in Stockholm 1895-1925, after which she settled in Lund.

The film is a sequel to the 1999 film Gen-X Cops. Plot The film opens in Washington D.C., where a new government robot called RS-1 is scheduled to make its debut at a convention in Hong Kong. Doctor Cameron gives the investors a demonstration of RS-1 while agents Ross Tucker, Ian Curtis, and Jane Quigley watch. However, soon a malfunction with the robot occurs during one of its tests, resulting in the robot beginning to shoot at everyone. However, Ross and Ian shoot at the control panel which stops the robot. Cameron is now reconsidering bringing RS-1 to Hong Kong, but the investors tell Cameron to fix the issue and send it to save their own butts. The malfunction comes from a hack by Kurt, the designer of RS-1, who was unceremoniously fired for being young and a bit reckless. Kurt has plans to steal the robot and intends to get the help of rogue FBI agent Quincy. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, two of the original Gen-X Cops, Match and Alien, must go undercover as weapons dealers to bust a missing undercover cop named Edison. When they successfully make a deal, the duo beat up the dealer and find a room with beaten up victims. Alien mistakes one victim for Edison but soon find Edison still in cahoots with the leader of the gang. Edison shoots Alien and Match but shoots their guns as a cover up. When Alien and match learn that the gang running the operation has stolen the Hong Kong police entry for the robot convention, Alien mistakes a phone for a bomb he has just purchased. Alien throws the bomb phone to the Ferrari he and Match drove in. The explosion blows their cover and Match, Alien, and Edison are forced to fight not only cage fighters, but using a flash bomb, defeat the gang and have them all arrested. The next day at headquarters, the trio of cops join others in seeing Dr. Tang demonstrating the recovered Hong Kong robot but things don't go as planned. On the day of the convention, the FBI arrives and Edison looks at Jane, who looks back only to get distracted. It is soon apparent that the Hong Kong Police and the FBI are not going to be able to get along. When Jane attempts to show a demonstration of the security system, the system does not work. Ian gets miffed and when Hong Kong lieutenant Chung asks if they can get the FBI anything, all the agents request coffee. Match is not happy, but Alien happily takes the task as he intends to put his dandruff in all of the coffee for the FBI agents. When Match tries out a cup, Alien looks at him with a surprising look. Edison receives a call from an old friend and meets the friend that night at Jumbo Restaurant. The old friend is Kurt, who is still somewhat shocked that Edison is a cop. When Edison tells Kurt he will help him, the two hug it out only for Kurt to drug Edison with a hypnosis drug. Under the hypnosis, Edison breaks into headquarters and steals the robot. Kurt once again hacks into RS-1 and has the robot kill Doctor Cameron. Edison breaks out of the spell and is surprised to learn that he had killed Quincy, who was actually trying to kill him admitting Kurt's treachery beforehand. When Ian sees the dead Quincy, he fights Edison but Edison escapes and resorts to taking Jane as a hostage. After a standoff involving Match and Alien as well as the FBI, the two end up in Kurt's van where Edison finally learns what had happened. He and Jane make their escape, destroying the friendship between Edison and Kurt. Match and Alien soon become the scapegoats for Edison when they learn that if Edison and the robot cannot be recovered, they will have to take the fall. The next day, Edison remembers a man in a lobster suit during his hypnosis. He and Jane, who is starting to believe that Edison may be innocent after all, find the lobster man. However, they were both tracked by Match and Alien as well as the FBI. Jane returns with the FBI while Edison, Match, and Alien are being shot at by the FBI. Edison finds an unexpected ally in the lobster man, who helps him escape. As for Match and Alien, the two end up in the hospital along with the injured FBI agents. A confrontation between Match and Ian almost gets physical until Ross and Chung arrive to break it up. Ian assures Match and Alien that they will take the fall if Edison and the robot are not found. Jane attempts to convince Ian that Edison may have been drugged and may be innocent, but Ian won't hear of it. Ross tells everyone to cool off and they leave the hospital. Edison finds Kurt in an abandoned warehouse, where the two start to fight. Match and Alien have been tracking Edison and find the robot. They soon find themselves in the mix when they face Kurt's men. Kurt, however, escapes again but Match and Alien trap Edison and tell him they have to take them in to save themselves. When Match and Alien bring Edison back to headquarters, they are hailed as heroes for the arrest of Edison. However, they soon become convinced that Edison may be innocent as well. With help from Oli, Match's techie girlfriend, and Peggy, a techie who has a serious crush on Alien, they are able to tap into Edison's memory and have learned where the robot may be found. When they decide to find RS-1, Jane confronts them only to agree to help them out. They learn Kurt plans to sell RS-1 to an Arab terrorist but as they bust the dealers and Kurt, Ross arrives. When Jane asks Ross where backup is, Ross is revealed to be involved in the entire scheme with the dead agent Quincy. When the deal is finalized, Ian arrives in time and had learned of Ross betraying everyone only to put a tracking device himself on Ross. This leads to a confrontation while Kurt escapes with the robot. The terrorist is killed and a fight ensues between Ross and Ian. As Ross begins to get the upper hand, Match comes to the rescue and he and Ian team up to fight Ross. When Ross gets Ian to the edge of a shipping container, he points his gun towards Ian. Match comes up from behind and drop kicks Ross off the container to his death. Match and Ian realize they have to get the robot. Kurt has unleashed the robot all over the city, destroying anything in its path. Edison and Alien catch up to Kurt and RS-1 at the convention center. An attempt from the robot from Mainland China results in that robot being destroyed. However, Dr. Tang installs a virus to be transferred from his robot to RS-1. When the virus is uploaded, RS-1 destroys Tang's robot. Kurt is convinced that RS-1 is the ultimate robot and when he stands in victory, the now virus-filled RS-1 guns down Kurt to his death. An attempt to take out RS-1 by Match, Alien, and Edison fails. However, with the virus came a self-destruct button, and with the clock ticking, Ian arrives by car and the trio of Hong Kong police wrap a chain around RS-1. The four cops drive to the harbor and send RS-1 into the water, where it explodes. Match, Alien, and Edison are in the back of an ambulance when they see Ian, who tells them they have to settle one more thing. The trio are at first angry until they learn the thing that has to be settled is to find the best bar in Hong Kong to celebrate solving the case. As Ian tells them to hurry, Edison, Match, and Alien head off to meet with Jane and Ian.

Little is known of his life, although he is mentioned briefly in the various Anglo-Saxon chronicles, and he has been purported, since ancient times, to be the father of St Frideswide, patron saint of Oxford. Biography The date of Dida's birth is not known. He appears to have acted as a sub-king of the Chilterns around 670-675. Anglo-Saxon chronicles describe him as controlling areas of Mercian territory around Oxford and the Chilterns. He appears to have been in constant dispute with the West Saxons over land boundaries. It is speculated that he was a Mercian nobleman who was raised to the status of sub-king by Wulfhere of Mercia; although it is not known for certain how long he held that position, or even if he lost his authority only upon his death. Because of his connection to St. Frideswide, it is also assumed that he was related to the sub-king of Surrey, Frithuwold of Chertsey. The chronicles do not record the date of Dida's death. Legends In a Vita (or Life) of St Frideswide, William of Malmsbury mentioned Dida, and describes him as \\"a catholic and upright man\\", who was married to a \\"worthy wife\\" named Safrida. Their only child was Frideswide, whom he ordered to be baptised. When Safrida died, Dida built a church at the behest of his daughter, dedicating it to the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Mary and all the saints. There he allowed Frideswide to become its first abbess. After the death of Dida, a certain Algar of Leicestershire (apparently √Üthelbald of Mercia) succeeded him and wooed Frideswide; but she, rejecting his advances, escaped from him until the providence of God caused him to fall from his horse and break his neck. Frideswide continued as the abbess of the monastery at Oxford until her death. She was later to become patron saint of Oxford and of the university there.

Oswald Grey was convicted of the crime, and became the last person hanged at the city's Winson Green Prison. Grey maintained his innocence and doubt remains as to whether or not there was sufficient evidence against him.  Robbery and murder  Thomas Arthur Bates, aged 46, ran a newsagent's shop at 196 Lee Bank Road (now Lee Bank Middleway) in Birmingham's Edgbaston district. At 6:30 pm on Saturday, 2 June 1962, a 19-year-old Jamaican baker called Oswald Augustus Grey, of Cannon Hill Road in that city, carried out a robbery at the shop, during which event he shot Bates in the upper chest. Grey then made his escape by a number 8 (Inner Circle) bus. Bates' mother, who had been in the living area at the back of the shop, heard a large bang and found him collapsed on the floor. Finding him alone in the shop, she initially believed he had suffered a heart attack or stroke. He was reportedly dead before he reached the city's General Hospital, but it was not until he reached there that it was realised that he had been shot. The bullet had passed through his heart, lungs and liver.  Conviction and appeal  The Birmingham City Police investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent Gerald Baumber. Police immediately suspected a robbery, as they found an empty cash tin on the floor, a bullet hole in the wall behind the counter, and a spent cartridge. The Birmingham CID distributed a description of a black man who had been seen outside the shop at the time of the Bates' murder. During a dawn police sweep four days after the murder, the Birmingham police raided several homes in Ladywood and Edgbaston. Several men were arrested, including Grey. Grey was questioned within four days, and was brought before magistrates on 7 June, charged with stealing a pistol and ammunition from a 60-year-old Handsworth man, Hamilton Bacchus. Grey admitted stealing the gun but insisted he did not shoot anyone. The next day, Grey was charged with murder, following an identification parade at which he was positively identified by a woman, Cecilia Gibbs, who said that, once the men in the parade tilted their hats as had the suspect, \\"He was standing in front of me again as on that Saturday.\\" At his trial at Birmingham Assizes, Grey maintained his innocence, claiming to have sold the gun at a party, for ¬£16. Four women testified that he was not the person they had seen at the murder scene. It was also claimed that the police had coerced him into making a confession by force; a claim they denied. Grey was convicted on 13 October 1962, after the jury deliberated for just 50 minutes, and was immediately sentenced to death. Grey filed for appeal within days. His solicitor, Mr. F. G. Owen, claimed the weight of the evidence against Grey was insufficient for a guilty verdict and death sentence. The English Court of Criminal Appeals, consisting of the Lord Chief Justice Lord Parker of Waddington, Mr. Justice Gorman and Mr. Justice Salmon, dismissed the appeal on 29 October. Execution Grey was executed by hanging on the gallows at Winson Green Prison on Tuesday, 20 November 1962 by Harry Allen and his assistant. He was the last person executed there, and in the city. In attendance were prison governor John Richards and prison doctor Dr. P.M. Costa, plus eight uniformed officers and plain-clothed detectives.

Phase micro- objects are invisible because they do not change intensity of light, they insert only invisible phase shifts. The holographic interference microscopy distinguishes itself from other microscopy methods by using a hologram and the interference for converting invisible phase shifts into intensity changes. Other related microscopy method to holographic interference microscopy are phase contrast microscopy, holographic interferometry.  Holographic interference microscopy methods  Holography was born as \\"new microscopy principle\\". D. Gabor invented holography for electron microscopy.For some reasons his idea is not applied in this branch of microscopy. But invention of holography opened up new possibilities in imaging of phase micro-objects due to the application of the holographic interference methods in microscopy that allow not only qualitative, but quantitative study. Combining the holographic interference microscopy with methods of numerical processing has solved the problem of 3D imaging of untreated, native biological phase micro- object.Tishko,T. V., Titar, V. P., Tishko, D. N.(2005). \\"Holographic methods of three-dimensional visualization of microscopic phase objects\\" .J. Opt. Technol., 72(2): 203‚Äì209.Holographic microscopy of phase microscopic objects. Theory and practice. by Tatyana Tishko, Tishko Dmitry, Titar Vladimir, World Scientific (2010).Tishko,T. V., Tishko, D. N., Titar, V. P., \\"3D imaging of phase microscopic objects by digital holographic method In: Duke EH, Aquirre SR. \\"3D Imaging: Theory, Technology and Application\\", New York, NY: Nova Publishers (2010):51‚Äì92.. In the holographic interference method the images appear as the result of the interference of two object waves passed the same path through the microscope optical system but in different points of time: the reconstructed from the hologram \\"empty\\" object wave, and the object wave disturbed by the phase micro-objects under study. The hologram of the \\"empty\\" object wave is recorded using a reference beam, and it is used as an optical element of the holographic interference microscope. In the dependence on conditions of the interference two methods of the holographic interference microscopy can be realized: the holographic phase-contrast method and the holographic interference-contrast method. In the first case, the phase shifts inserted by the phase micro-object into the light wave passing through it are converted into intensity changes in its image; and in the second case ‚Äì into deviations of interference fringes.  Holographic phase-contrast method  Holographic phase-contrast method is the holographic interference microscopy technique for phase micro-object visualization that converts the phase shifts inserted by the micro-object to the wave of light passed through it into intensity changes in the image. The method is based on the holographic addition (constructive interference) or holographic subtraction (destructive interference) of the \\"empty\\" wave reconstructed from the hologram, and the object wave disturbed by the phase micro-objects under study. The image can be considered as interferogram in interference fringes of infinite width. Phase- contrast image of human blood erythrocytes obtained by the wave addition in a bright interference fringe The method solves the same problem as does F. Zernike phase contrast method. But in comparison with F. Zernike phase contrast method, the method has some advantages. Due to equal intensities of the interfering waves, the holographic phase-contrast method allows obtaining maximal contrast of images. The sizes of the micro-object do not restrict the application of the method, though F. Zernike phase contrast method works the more successfully, the smaller the micro-object in thick and sizes. The image in the holographic phase-contrast method is the result of interaction of two identical waves, and it is free of aberrations. The method can be realized as the method of holographic addition and subtraction in an interference fringe. A small angle is introduced between the interfering waves so that the period of resulting system of interference fringes significantly exceeds the size of the images. The conditions for the waves to be antiphased or in-phased (holographic subtraction or addition) are automatically created within a dark and bright interference fringes, correspondingly. The intensities in the image of the micro-object I_{im+} and the intensity of the background I_{b+} in the case of wave addition in a bright interference fringe are determined by the expressions: I_{im+} (x',y')=2I_0[1+cos f (x, y) ]; I_{b+}=4I_0 and the intensities in the image of the micro-object I_{im-} and the intensity of the background I_{b-} in the case of wave subtraction in the dark interference fringe (waves are antiphased): I_{im-}(x', y')=2I_0[1-cos f (x, y) ]; I_{b-}=0 where f (x, y) is the phase shift inserted by the micro-object into the wave transmitted through it; I_0 is the intensity of each of the two waves. So, dark images of phase micro-objects can be observed against the bright background in the case of wave addition, and bright images against the dark background ‚Äì in the case of wave subtraction. The contrast of images is maximal. The intensity distribution in the images depends on the phase shifts inserted by the micro-objects under study. So, the method allows measuring the phase shifts, and 3D images of the phase micro-objects can be reconstructed under computer processing of their phase-contrast images. The high sensitivity to vibrations is the main backgrounds of the method. It requires developing the hologram in its place. So, the method remains \\"exotic\\", and it is not widely applied.  Holographic interference-contrast method  An Interferogram of blood Erythrocyte Holographic interference-contrast method is the holographic interference microscopy technique for phase micro-object visualization that converts the phase shifts inserted by the micro-object to the passed light wave light into deviations of interference fringes in its image. A certain angle is introduced between the \\"empty\\" wave and the wave disturbed by the phase micro-objects so the system of straight interference fringes is obtained, which are deviated in the image of the micro-object. The image can be considered as an interferogram in the fringes of finite width. The deviation h(x',y') of the interference fringe in a point of the image is linearly dependent on the phase shift f (x, y) inserted in the corresponding point of the micro-object : h(x',y')=f(x, y) T/2 \\\\pi, where T is the set period of the system of interference fringes. So, the interference-contrast image (interferogram) visualizes phase silhouette of the micro-object in the form of the deviated lines; and the phase shifts can be measured just by a \\"ruler\\". This makes it possible to calculate optical thickness of the micro- object in every point. The method allows measuring thickness of the micro- object if its refractive index is known or to measure its refractive index if the thickness is known. If the micro-object has a homogeneous refractive index distribution, it is possible to reconstruct its physical 3D shape under digital processing the images. The method can be used for thick and thin, small and large micro-objects. Due to equal intensities of the interfering waves, contrast of images is maximal. The \\"empty\\" wave reconstructed from the hologram ia a replica of the object wave. So, due to interference of identical waves optical aberrations of the optical system are compensated, and images are free of optical aberrations. Both methods of holographic interference microscopy can be realized in a single device of the holographic interference microscope uses an optical microscope in an off-axis conventional holographic set-up, with the reference wave, which is usual for the holography, a laser as a coherent source of light, and the hologram. The \\"empty\\" object wave produced by the objective in the absence of the micro-objects under study is recorded on the hologram using the reference wave. The developed hologram is returned in its original position, and it works as a fixed optical element of the holographic interference microscope. The images appear under simultaneous observation of the real object wave disturbed by micro-object and the \\"empty\\" object wave reconstructed from the hologram. The period of the observed interference picture is adjusted just by cross shift of the hologram from its initial position. The main background of the HIM methods are coherent noise and speckle structure of the images appearing as the result of using coherent source of light. The methods of holographic interference microscopy were worked out and applied for phase micro-object study in the 1980s.Safronov, G.S., Tishko, T.V.

In the late 1990s, a computer began to be used for 3D imaging of phase micro-objects by their interferograms. 3D images were obtained for the first time when investigating blood erythrocytes.Tishko, T.

Univ.,Ser Biol. Vestnik., 2 (1):107‚Äì111(in Russian). And from the beginning of the 21st century, holographic interference microscopy has become digital holographic interference microscopy.  Digital holographic interference microscopy  Digital holographic interference microscopy (DHIM) is a combination of the holographic interference microscopy with digital methods of image processing for 3D imaging of phase micro-objects. The holographic phase-contrast or interference-contrast images (interferograms) are recorded by a digital camera from which a computer reconstructs 3D images by using numerical algorithms. The closest method to the digital holographic interference microscopy is the digital holographic microscopy. The both method solve the same problem of micro-object 3D imaging. Both method use the reference wave to obtain phase information. The digital holographic interference microscopy is more \\"optical\\" method. This makes this method more obvious and precise, it uses clear and simple numerical algorithms.The digital holographic microscopy is more \\"digital\\" method. It is not so obvious; application of complicated approximate numerical algorithms does not allow reaching the optical accuracy. 3D Image of a native Human blood smear Digital holographic interference microscopy allows 3D imaging and non-invasive quantitative study of biomedical micro-objects, such as cells of an organism.

It is located on the Theotokopoulou Street in the Upper Old Town of Thessaloniki. The baths date to the late 12th/early 13th century, and functioned continuously until 1940, when they shut down probably due to World War II and the German occupation of Greece. The Byzantine sources do not mention it, hence it is likely that it originally belonged to a monastery complex. In Ottoman times, it was known as Kule Hammam, i.e. \\"bath of the citadel\\". The bath's long use led to numerous alterations of the original structure over time. The original architecture follows the typical conventions of Roman baths. The original entrance in the south leads to the rectangular frigidarium rooms, which were used as dressing rooms. Then came two vaulted tepidarium rooms and finally two caldarium rooms. The latter were square in shape and featured hypocausts below the floor. One was covered by a dome supported by an octagonal base with eight windows, the other had a domed ceiling. To the north of the baths was the cistern that provided it with water, with a hearth beneath to warm it. In Byzantine times the building was alternately used by men and women, but in the Ottoman period the bath was divided into exclusively male and female sections, by blocking off each pair of rooms from each other. The bath was one of several in the city‚Äîthe 14th-century writer Nikephoros Choumnos claims that Thessaloniki had more baths than inhabitants‚Äîbut is the only surviving in Thessaloniki and the largest and most complete of the handful of Byzantine baths surviving elsewhere in Greece: five ruined public baths‚Äîtwo in Corinth, one in Sparta, one in Paramythia, one in Ioannina Castle‚Äîand one each in the monasteries of Kaisariani and Zoodochos Pigi. Although closed since 1940, the bath was subject to neglect and damage during the 1978 earthquakes, and only survived standing through heavy propping up by the 9th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities and the protection offered by an external metal sheet covering. In 1988, it was included among the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki on the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Following four years of restoration work, the bath was re-opened to the public as a museum and cultural space in June 2015.

Although manuscripts and hand-drawn maps were widely available throughout the Muslim world, the massive printing of books started only in 1729 by Ibrahim Muteferrika and the Cedid Atlas could only be published in 1803 by M√ºderris Abdurrahman Efendi in a style based on European sources. The Cedid Atlas includes a monochrome celestial chart and 24 hand-coloured copper engraved maps Beydilli(1995) of various parts of the world; the celestial chart and maps measure at least (53 cm by 72 cm) and all the maps are actually adaptations of William Faden's William Faden's Biography General Atlas. The maps are preceded by a (1+79) page-long treatise of geography, \\"Ucalet-√ºl Coƒürafiye\\" by Mahmud Raif Efendi Mahmud Raif Efendi As The Chief Secretary of Yusuf Agah Efendi, The First Permanent Ottoman-Turkish Ambassador to London (1793-1797)Mahmud Raif Efendi's Ucalet-√ºl Coƒürafiye and a title page. The \\"Ucalet-√ºl Coƒürafiye\\" of Mahmud Raif Efendi was printed one year later, in 1804, and bound together with the atlas.Ottoman Statesmen: Mahmud Raif Efendi From a point of view of art, the atlas is notable for the color of the maps as well as the beauty of the script on the maps. The Cedid Atlas was published in parallel with the developments of the Ottoman Empire's Nizam-ƒ± Cedid, the \\"New-Order\\" or the \\"New System\\" (\\"Cedid\\" means \\"new\\" and \\"Nizam\\" means \\"system\\", \\"regime\\", or \\"order\\") and its title-name reflects this clearly. The atlas was new in terms of cartographical knowledge and well suited to the new system which tried to introduce new institutions into the Ottoman Empire while trying to replace existing ones with contemporary counterparts from the West. Introduced by the ruling padishah (the sultan) of the Ottoman Empire, Selim III, the \\"New-Order\\" included a series of reforms which mainly modernized and changed the structure of the then existing Ottoman army and changed the administrative structure of the Empire. It was an effort to catch up with technical, military, economic, and administrative achievements of the West against which the Ottoman Empire was losing grounds since the 17th century. New military and engineering schools were established and governmental units related with the foreign relations and affairs were re-organized to align with the new system. For these schools, governmental units, and the wholly re- organized army reformed according to the European practice, a new understanding and applications of geography of the standards of the West were necessary and the Cedid Atlas was translated and printed for this purpose. Only 50 copies of this atlas (measuring 36 cm x 53 cm) were printed at the press. A copy was presented to Selim III; several copies were also presented to the high-ranking officials of the Empire, some were reserved for the library of Muhendishane (military engineering school of the time), and the remaining were reserved for sale. However, during the \\"Alemdar Vakasƒ±\\", an uprising of the janissaries in Constantinople during November 15‚Äì18, 1808,Kinross(1977), pp 431-434. a fire at the warehouse of the press destroyed an unknown (unaccounted) number of the copies reserved for sale.Municipality of Usk√ºdar-Istanbul Based on several estimates and accounting for the single maps (torn-out from bound volumes of the atlas) sold or being sold worldwide, it is believed that a maximum of 20 complete examples could be present in libraries or in private collections whereas some sources suggest that there exist only 10 complete and intact copies in the world.Newly acquired: Cedid Atlas Terc√ºmesi (Istanbul, 1803) As such, it's one of the rarest printed atlases of historical value. Other names A few sources outside Turkey and the Muslim world also refer to this atlas as the New Great Atlas.

The fort is south of Hadrian's Wall, and may have been situated to control local lead mining. The multiple banks and ditches on the uphill side, and the fort's exceptional lozenge shape, can be seen in the photograph. Whitley Castle (Epiacum) is a large, unusually shaped Roman fort () north-west of the town of Alston, Cumbria, England. The castrum, which was first built by the Roman Army early in the 2nd century AD, was partly demolished and rebuilt around 200 AD. It appears to have been sited to protect lead mining in the area as well as to support the border defences of Hadrian's Wall. Unlike most Roman forts that have a \\"playing-card shape\\" (rectangular with rounded corners), Whitley Castle is lozenge-shaped to fit the site. Numerous banks and ditches ring the stone ramparts, making it among the most complex defensive earthworks of any fort known in the Roman Empire. The site was surveyed by the geologist Thomas Sopwith in the 19th century and the historian R.G. Collingwood in the 20th century. In 2012, a geophysics survey was conducted by a team from Durham University but it has not been fully excavated. Among finds at the fort are altars with inscriptions to Hercules by Legio VI Victrix (normally stationed at Eboracum [York]) and to Apollo by the 2nd Cohort of Nervians, the garrison of auxiliaries. Other finds include a midden containing shoes; coins, fragments of Samian pottery, beads, nails, and a bronze handle shaped like a dolphin. Whitley Castle (Epiacum) is referenced as the site of a fictional battle between fictional characters Uhtred of Bebbanburh and Sk√∂ll in the 2018 novel War of the Wolf written by Bernard Cornwell, the eleventh book in his Saxon Stories series. Toponym Although its English name is Whitley Castle, the Romans knew the fort as Epiacum. It is named in Ptolemy's Geography as the first town in the lands of Brigantes tribe in northeastern England. Its Latin name probably comes from a local British name *Epiakon \\"the property, or estate of Epios\\", Latinised as Eppius; hence Eppius may have been a local leader or chieftain of the Brigantes tribe.Robertson, 2007. p9 The name may be a derivative of the P-Celtic epos \\"horse\\". Location Whitley Castle is about above sea level in the Pennine hills on the southern edge of Northumberland near its border with Cumbria. It lies to the west of the modern A689 road beside the Pennine Way long-distance footpath. During the Roman era, Epiacum was situated about south of Hadrian's Wall and north of the main road which ran between Luguvalium (Carlisle) in the northwest and Eboracum (York) in the southeast. The Maiden Way road connected Whitley Castle to the fort of Magnae (Carvoran) on Hadrian's Wall to the north, and the fort of Bravoniacum (Kirkby Thore) on the Carlisle-York road to the south. Whitley Castle is one of the most isolated Roman sites in Britain, which may help to explain both why it remains largely unexcavated as of 2018 and why so much of it has survived.Went and Ainsworth, 2009 The site is a lozenge-shaped spur of high ground on Castle Nook hill farm, under permanent pasture for sheep. The fort remains lie under the grass, and are most clearly seen in aerial photographs. The Roman fort itself covers about ; outside it is a system of concentric defensive ditches. The fort may have been sited to exert control over the area near Alston and its lead mines, as well as to provide support for Hadrian's Wall. History Multiple defensive ramparts on the north side of Epiacum Epiacum was built early in the 2nd century AD. It was at least partly demolished and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196.Robertson, 2007. p10 The fort was modified or wholly rebuilt about the year 300. It appears to have been preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed. Epiacum was in some ways a typical Roman fort: inside the wall were straight roads which crossed, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there was a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There was an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules. rushes) on the western, uphill side of the Roman fort Epiacum, however, has two unique features. First, the fort's military engineers modified the usual rectangular plan to suit the available site: it is distorted into a lozenge or parallelogram; the internal features of the fort are similarly distorted. Six barracks were however fitted in behind the headquarters building (principia), and four in front of it, in a limited area of . Second, the wall is surrounded by four steep defensive ditches and banks around the hill spur, and seven such ramparts across the uphill side of the spur. These constitute the most complex defensive earthworks of any known Roman fort, with multiple banks and ditches outside the usual stone ramparts. Illustration of an altar to Hercules found at Whitley Castle, from Thomas Sopwith, 1833. The altar is now in Bedford Museum.Story No 6: The lost altar of Epiacum, alstonmoorhistoricalsociety.org.uk Inscriptions on some of the altars found at Epiacum provide evidence of the Roman army units garrisoning the fort. One of these is inscribed \\"DEO HERCVLI C VITELLIVS ATTICIANVS > LEG VI V P F\\" (\\"To the god Hercules, Gaius Vitellius Atticianus, Centurion of the Legio VI Victrix, Loyal and Faithful, [erected this].\\")Robertson, 2007. p22 This was a regular army legion based at York. Another altar is inscribed \\"DEO APOLLINI G...IVS ... ...COH II NER ...\\" (\\"To the god Apollo, Gaius Julius Marcius, [commander] of the 2nd Cohort of Nervians, [fulfilled his vow].\\"). This and two other inscriptions also naming the 2nd Nervians, auxiliaries from the lower Rhine, date to 213‚Äì221 AD. The altar was in a socket of a big stone slab supported by four columns, each topped by a coin; one of these was dated to 141‚Äì161 AD.Robertson, 2007. pp23-24 Archaeology Plan of Whitley Castle by Thomas Sopwith, 1853. The Victorian Enclosure walls shown within the Roman fort were largely removed in 2018.http://www.epiacumheritage.org Little archaeological research has taken place at Whitley Castle. In 1810, the Revd. John Hodgson excavated the bath house, in the north-east corner of Epiacum.Robertson, 2007. pp16-17 In 1825 several leather shoes were recovered from a Roman rubbish tip when a Mr Henderson was cutting a drainage ditch.North Pennines AONB/English Heritage leaflet 'Whitley Castle' ref NMR 20677/026, 2013Robertson, 2007. p19 The geologist Thomas Sopwith surveyed the fort, describing it, its baths and the midden (waste heap) in 1833 as follows: Plan, made by R.G. Collingwood in 1930, shows the unique skewing of the playing-card shape of Roman forts, and the similarly extraordinary set of ramparts outside the fort's wall. The fort was surveyed by R.G. Collingwood and described by him in his Archaeology of Roman Britain, 1930, where he noted the fort's uniquely skewed shape and extraordinary set of defensive ramparts on the western, uphill side. Pottery excavated in the 1950s suggested that the fort was constructed in 122 AD, at the same time as Hadrian's Wall. A survey in 2007‚Äì8 by English Heritage showed a large Roman civilian settlement or vicus to the north and west of the fort. Artefacts found include coins, pottery, glass, objects made of jet, and inscribed stones. In 2012, the University of Durham carried out a geophysics survey as part of an English Heritage project. In the absence of a full excavation, archaeologists have exploited the diggings of moles to uncover Roman artefacts by sifting earth thrown up by the animals in their molehills. Finds include fragments of terra sigillata (Samian ware, Roman table pottery); rim fragments of serving bowls and earthenware pots; a bead made of jet; some iron nails; and a bronze dolphin from the bath house, most likely the handle of an instrument like a strigil or razor. Preservation The site is on the privately owned Castle Nook Farm, and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. In 2012 the not-for-profit company Epiacum Heritage Ltd. secured a ¬£49,200 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to develop a programme of events for the fort to include a website, guided tours for the public, archaeology survey days for volunteers and educational events for schools.

Before entering professional football, Smith starred as a halfback at Rhodes College and led the country in scoring in 1938. He was selected by the Rams in the second round of the following season's NFL draft and played for the Cleveland team until deciding to retire from the sport in 1943. After taking a job as a personnel director and playing on a regional basketball and baseball teams based in the Cleveland area, Smith joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 during World War II. He was discharged two years later and signed with the Browns, then a new team in the AAFC. Smith was a second-string player with the Browns, but substituted for an injured Marion Motley late in the season as the team won the AAFC championship game. Smith retired after the 1946 season, but stayed in Ohio to raise his family and work as a manufacturer's representative. He died in 1958 at the age of 41. College career Smith grew up in Beebe, Arkansas and attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee starting in 1935. He played baseball, basketball and track in college, but he was best known as a star halfback on the school's football team. While Rhodes was a small college, Smith led the country in scoring for two weeks in 1938 and finished the season in third place. He was named to All-Dixie teams in 1937 and 1938, and was named a Little All-American in 1938. The Cleveland Rams selected him in the second round of the NFL draft that December. Professional career Smith played for the Rams beginning in 1939. He started out as a halfback, but was shifted to quarterback and then tailback in the 1940 season before moving back to quarterback. He then served primarily as a fullback in 1941 and 1942, and like many players of his era was assigned to both the offensive and defensive units. Smith retired from football after the 1942 season and took a job as personnel director of Thompson Products, Inc., an aerospace, automotive and financial conglomerate based in Ohio. Smith played amateur baseball as a catcher and regional professional basketball in 1943. He also boxed in an amateur tournament organized by the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The following year, Smith joined the U.S. Navy during World War II. He reported in May for training at the Great Lakes Naval Station outside of Chicago. At Great Lakes, he played for a military football team coached by Paul Brown. Following his discharge from the service in early 1946, Smith was signed by Brown to play for the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference. The Rams had moved to Los Angeles after the 1945 season, and Smith was one of five former Rams players to stay in Cleveland with the Browns, alongside Tommy Colella, Mike Scarry, Don Greenwood and Chet Adams. He joined the Browns despite a lawsuit filed by the Rams against Adams in which the Rams contended he was still under contract with the team. Smith said he had signed with the \\"Cleveland Rams\\" and that the contract said nothing about a move to Los Angeles. \\"After the Rams moved to the coast, they sent me another agreement specifying a raise in pay, but I didn't sign it,\\" he said. \\"I decided that if I couldn't play football in Cleveland, I wouldn't play at all.\\" A federal judge eventually ruled in favor of Adams, clearing the way for former Rams players to join the Browns. Smith was not a regular starter for the Browns when the team started play in 1946, but he got additional playing time toward the end of the season after fullback Marion Motley suffered injuries to his feet. Smith ran for 240 yards and scored five touchdowns as the Browns won the first AAFC championship that year. He retired from professional football for good after the season. Later life Smith was associated in the mid-1950s with a company started by Browns quarterback Otto Graham and Cleveland Indians catcher Jim Hegan that sold gift items including trophies, watches and jewelry to companies for presentation to clients. He also worked for Thompson Products and the National Screw Company as a manufacturer's representative. Smith died in 1958 in Ohio, where he had remained with his family after retiring from football. He had four children with his wife Carol. Two years after his death, Rhodes College dedicated the Gaylon Smith Memorial Gateway in his honor. He is considered one of the best football players Rhodes has produced. He was inducted into the Rhodes College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1996.

Its name is derived from St. Peter's Church, which is on the hill. Until the 14th century the Petersberg was known as the Lauterberg.  Geography  The Petersberg is located about 10 kilometres north of the German city of Halle on the River Saale not quite halfway between Halle and K√∂then. The municipality of Petersberg with its hamlets of Drehlitz and Fr√∂√ünitz lie on the hill. At the foot of the hill are the villages of Ostrau and Wallwitz as well as three small nature reserves. On the southern slopes of the hill is a small lake. A stretch of the A 14 motorway runs past the Petersberg to the west and south, and the B 6 federal highway runs by to the southwest. They form a junction at Halle-Trotha, from where the Petersberg may easily be reached.  Geology  The Petersberg is the highest point of the Halle Porphyry complex. It was formed, like the other porphyritic domes in the surrounding area, during the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian by the solidification of numerous molten lava flows under the earth. In the slowly cooling lava, easily visible feldspar and quartz crystals were formed. The Petersberg consists of small-grained Halle porphyry ‚Äì this hard rock is used mainly as a raw material for the manufacture of ballast and gravel. The present shape of the hill is a result of the last ice age. The surrounding loose rock was cleared away by the ice sheet leaving the hard porphyritic core behind. The top of the hill stood clear of the glacier as a nunatak.  Petersberg Abbey  Petersberg Abbey with its collegiate church of St. Peter is a former Augustinian monastery. Since 1999 it has been used by an Evangelical monastic community of the Community of the Christ-Brotherhood Selbitz.  Bismarck tower  One of the 15 surviving Bismarck towers in Saxony-Anhalt stands on the Petersberg. Its 15-metre-high tower was built to a design by Wilhelm Kreis and inaugurated on 24 September 1902. The observation tower that was badly damaged in the Second World War was thoroughly renovated in 1999/2000, so that it is once again climbable for the first time since the war.  Communication towers  There is a communication tower on the Petersberg at which was built in 1963 and became operational on 1 May 1965. Made of reinforced concrete, the Petersberg communication tower is 119 metres high and is now operated by Deutsche Telekom. It broadcasts several radio programmes for the Halle region, including MDR 1 Radio Sachsen-Anhalt, MDR Sputnik and Radio SAW. There is also a seven-storey A Tower on the Petersberg which also belongs to Deutsche Telekom and has directional antennas on the roof.  Tourism  The Petersberg is a popular tourist destination. On the hill is a wildlife park with Eurasian animals. There is also a sommerrodelbahn with toboggans and similar vehicles, that is open all year round. There are regular flea markets on a festival ground on the hill as well as other events. The E11 European long distance path from the Netherlands to Masuria runs close by the Petersberg.

Early career Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza was born in 1631. He was a member of the wealthiest family in New Mexico. He had, at least, two siblings (between them, the governor of New Mexico Tom√© Dominguez de Mendoza). At the age of twelve he went to New Mexico, and he was to accompany several expeditions into what is now Texas. He was a member of the Diego de Guadalajara expedition of 1654 from Santa Fe to what is now San Angelo, Texas, where the three main tributaries of the Concho River converge. Dom√≠nguez rose in rank to lieutenant general and was appointed Maestro de Campo in New Mexico - second in command to the Governor. He was an able administrator, and by the time of the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 was one of the most experienced and capable of the New Mexico militia leaders. When the Pueblo Revolt broke out, Dom√≠nguez advanced north from Isleta Pueblo to Cochiti, to the southwest of Santa Fe. However, he was then forced to retreat to El Paso del Norte (now Cuidad Juarez). Later he was criticized for not being sufficiently aggressive in his action against the Pueblos. Second Texas expedition In 1680, a major uprising of Native American tribes later termed as the Pueblo Revolt, completely uprooted the vast majority of the Spanish colonies in the New Mexico region. The Europeans were forced to retreat to the site of present day El Paso, Texas where they were reinforced by a large supply of munitions and manpower. Rather than risking a full scale counter attack against the Natives, New Mexican governor, Antonio de Otermin, decided to establish a fort and refuge camp at the Paso del Norte with the intent to organize a stronger military campaign at a later time. Between 1681 and 1683, Governor Otermin had launched several unsuccessful attacks against the Native American forces that still occupied New Mexico. But by the end of the summer of 1683, Otermin‚Äôs ill health and military failures had led the Spanish government to appoint a successor. On August 28, 1683, Jironza Petriz de Cruzate took command of the New Mexican governorship. Stepping into a quagmire mess, Cruzate faced the difficult challenge of having to re-conquer New Mexico and to prevent a social upheaval in the newer settlements along the Rio Grande. The Spanish colonists either wanted their old homes back, or for new ones to be found. With winter rapidly approaching, Cruzate was understandably overwhelmed during the early autumn months of 1683. But on October 20, a potential lifeline came riding into El Paso. A delegation of the Jumano tribe, a culture of Native Americans that had been close allies with the Spaniards since the 1520s, arrived in El Paso. The head leader of the delegation was a man named Juan Sabeata who was an ardent supporter of the Catholic faith and well versed in several languages which included: Spanish, Castilian (a form of Spanish that was frequently spoken in high society), and numerous Native languages from all across present day Texas. Juan Sabeata requested an audience with Governor Cruzate to present aid to the current situation that the Spanish colonists were currently facing. In exchange for a permanent mission to be established with the Jumanoes near the La Junta de los Rios region (present day Presidio, Texas), Sabeata agreed to personally guide a Spanish expedition into the eastern interior of the Jumano homelands where he stated the Spaniards could find immeasurable amounts of aid from the smaller tribes of Natives in establishing a new settlement. To add further incentives, Sabeata related a number of divine experiences that he stated he had personally witnessed from God while waging war against the encroaching Apache tribe. In one such instance, Sabeata stated that the Jumanoes were on the verge of losing a fiercely contested battle against the Apaches when a cross appeared in the skies above the battlefield, took a physical form, and dropped from the clouds directly into his hands. With the cross held high, Sabeata claimed, that he led the Jumanoes to a glorious victory that day. Later, he claimed that a multi-colored cross had appeared above La Junta de los R√≠os, at the junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande near modern-day Presidio, Texas. (See La Junta Indians) He also talked of wooden houses floating on the sea, which the Spanish took to refer to French ships. Three friars left at once for La Junta, where they started missionary work. Inspired by Sabeata‚Äôs stories, and with a sudden sense of possibly adding an entirely new kingdom to Spain‚Äôs domain, Governor Domingo Jironza Petriz de Cruzate agreed to establish the mission the Jumanoes desired and to organize a major exploration of the eastern Jumano homelands. On November 29, 1683, Governor Cruzate appointed Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza as the head commander of what would become known as the Mendoza-L√≥pez Expedition of 1683-84. Mendoza was given a long list of expectations and duties that he was to make certain were abided by and accomplished at all times. These requirements included: 1) Making sure that the priests who were to accompany him were treated with respect, politeness, and good courtesy by all the members (Natives and Spaniards) of the expedition. 2) To accurately record, in writing, the amount of leagues traveled from camp to camp, the route taken, the natural resources of the wilderness encountered, and any trails he was guided upon. 3) To make certain that, at every camp or village, the Spaniards were to be completely separated from the main abodes of the Native people and to publicly punish any Spaniard who was caught fraternizing with local Native women or bartering with Native craftsmen. 4) He was to reconnoiter the Rio de los Nueces (present day Concho River in San Angelo, Texas) and to both document and bring back examples of the natural amenities that could be found there. The expedition, often called the Mendoza Expedition, set off from El Paso on 15 December 1683, going down the Rio Grande to La Junta. Fray Antonio de Acevedo was left there in charge of new missions. The rest of the expedition, joined by many Indians, followed Indian trails north to the Pecos River, then followed the Concho River downstream to its junction with the Colorado River. They spent six weeks on what Dom√≠nguez called the \\"glorious San Clemente\\" river, building a fort, probably near the location of present- day Ballinger, Texas as defense against Apaches and hunting buffalo for hides and food. They fed and baptized many of the friendly local people who visited their camp. Dominguez de Mendoza and the Jumano leader, Juan Sabeata, clashed early in the expedition. Sabeata, Dominguez said, was untruthful and spread false rumors of hostile Apaches to bring the expedition to a halt. Sabeata apparently believed that the Spaniards were more interested in hunting buffalo than fighting Apache. Sabeata abandoned the expedition as did most of the Indians. A grand council of Indians envisioned by the Spanish never took place and the Spaniards returned to El Paso having collected 5,000 valuable buffalo hides. Later career On returning to La Junta de los R√≠os, Dom√≠nguez took possession of the north bank of the Rio Grande in the name of Spain. Dom√≠nguez and L√≥pez returned to El Paso, and then went on to Mexico City in 1685, where they made a strong case for sending soldiers and missionaries to the Jumano country. Dom√≠nguez and L√≥pez were initially optimistic about the potential for setting up missions among the Jumanos. However, Governor Jironza was unable to help since his forces were tied up combating local insurrections by the Suma and the Manso Indians. The incursion into eastern Texas by Frenchman Ren√©- Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1685 caused another distraction, so there was no immediate follow-up to Dominguez de Mendoza's expedition.

Interoperability is advantageous because programming languages are optimized for specific tasks, and allowing them to communicate can create better systems. There are many ways programming languages are interoperable with one another. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are a form of language interoperability as they work together to render webpages. Some object oriented languages can do this thanks to the hosting virtual machine (e.g. .NET CLI compliant languages in the Common Language Runtime and JVM compliant languages in the Java Virtual Machine). High-level programming languages are usually interoperable with some lower level languages, an example of which is Apple's Swift (programming language) and Objective-C.  Methods for interoperability  = Object models = To facilitate interoperability between languages, one method is to use object models. CORBA and COM are the most popular object models. These standards provide a base set of rules for how object oriented languages would implement their data models to allow for a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in which they were created. = Virtual machines (VMs) = Different Languages compile into a shared CLI A Virtual machine is software that emulates operating systems, and acts a buffer between the language and the hardware. This allows a program to run on any hardware or OS. An advantage to VMs can use these type systems to ensure the correctness of participating languages and gives languages a common ground for their type information. Another advantage is that languages designed for VMs compile into a low level intermediate language. The intermediate language then goes through its own compiler or interpreter which can do more types of optimization.  Challenges  = Object model differences = With object oriented languages attempt to pair containers of data with code, but how each language chooses how to do that may be slightly different. Those design decision do not always map to another language easily. An example of this would be how different languages handle inheritance. A single class may have zero (Go), one (Java), or many (C++) superclasses. A common approach to this issue is defining a subset of a language that maps directly to the other, but can also fully understand the other language. This approach does mean in order for the superset to communicate down it will need to wrap some of its interfaces into classes that can be understood by the subset. = Memory models = Differences in how programming languages handle deallocation of memory is another issue when trying create interoperability. Manual and automatic deallocation is not the only issue but if it has deterministic and nondeterministic destruction. Based on the constraints of the language there are many different strategies for bridging the different behaviors. C++ which uses manual deallocation could use a Java styled garbage collector by changing deallocation behavior to delete the object, but not reclaim the memory. This requires that each object will have to manually be deallocated, in order for the garbage collector to release the memory safely. = Mutability = Mutability becomes an issue when trying to create interoperability between functional and object oriented languages. Languages like Haskell have no mutable types, where in C++ there are some constructs to flag classes as immutable but lack support of determining if something is mutable or not. Many functional types when bridged to object oriented languages can not guarantee that the underlying objects won't be modified.

Territory The Rumsen historically shared a common language, Rumsen, which was spoken from the Pajaro River to Point Sur, and on the lower courses of the Pajaro, as well as on the Salinas and Carmel Rivers, and the region of the present-day cities of Salinas, Monterey and Carmel. The Rumsen tribe held the lower Carmel River Valley and neighboring Monterey Peninsula at the time of Spanish colonization. Their population of approximately 400-500 people was distributed among at least five villages within their territory.Breschini and Haversat 1994 An early twentieth-century mapping of a specific village called Rumsen on the Carmel River, several miles inland from the Mission in Carmel, may or may not be accurate.Kroeber, 1925, Map p. 465 Mission registers indicate that \\"Tucutnut\\", about three miles upstream from the mouth of the Carmel River, was the largest village of the Rumsen local tribe.Milliken 1987 History Rumsen individuals lined up at Mission San Carlos Borrom√©o de Carmelo The Rumsen were the first Costanoan people to be seen and documented by the Spanish explorers of Northern California, as noted by Sebastian Vizca√≠no when he reached Monterey in 1602. Since this first Spanish contact, Manila galleons may have occasionally ventured up the California coastline and stopped in Monterey Bay between 1602 and 1796.Levy 1978:486; Teixeira 1997:15. Graves of the Rumsen that died at Mission San Carlos Borrom√©o de Carmelo During the era of Spanish missions in California, the Rumsen people's lives changed when the Spaniards came from the south to build the Mission San Carlos Borrom√©o de Carmelo and the Monterey Presidio in their territory. Many were baptized between 1771 and 1808. Once baptized, the Rumsen people were required to live in the mission village and its surrounding ranches, They were taught as Catholic neophytes, also known as Mission Indians, until the missions were secularized (discontinued) by the Mexican Government in 1834. Some Mission San Carlos Indian people were formally deeded plots at secularization, only to lose those plots during the Rancho Period.Hackel 2005 At least since the mission era, the people of the Esselen Nation claim close association with the Rumsen Ohlone, through Mission integration and intermarriage. Rumsen-speaking tribes and Heritage Dialects of the Rumsen language were spoken by four independent local tribes, including the Rumsen themselves, the Ensen of the Salinas vicinity, the Calendaruc of the central shoreline of Monterey Bay, and the Sargentaruc of the Big Sur Coast. The territory of the language group was bordered by Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Awaswas Ohlone to the north, the Mutsun Ohlone to the east, the Chalon Ohlone on the south east, and the Esselen to the south. Linda Yamane is an Ohlone scholar and basket weaver who traces her heritage to the Rumsen Ohlone. She has spent over thirty years researching and reviving Rumsen language, stories, songs, basketry and other Ohlone cultural traditions.

Ulinski grew up in Pennsylvania and attended Marshall University in West Virginia, where he starred as a blocker and end. He then served for four years in the U.S. Air Force during World War II, playing for military football teams in 1944 and 1945. He signed with the Browns in 1946 and played as a guard as the team won four straight AAFC championships. He retired after the 1949 season to begin a coaching career, working first at Santa Clara University for three years before taking an assistant coaching job at Purdue University. Paul Brown, the head coach of the Browns, hired Ulinski in 1954 to work with the team's linemen. Ulinski changed to the Browns' linebackers coach in 1963 after Brown was fired and Blanton Collier replaced him. He later served as an administrative coaching aide and the Browns' film coordinator before retiring in 1984. The Browns won three National Football League championships during Ulinski's coaching career, in 1954, 1955 and 1964. He was inducted into Marshall's athletics hall of fame in 1986. Ulinski died in 2006 after a bout with Alzheimer's disease. Early life and college career Ulinski was born in Pittsburgh and attended Ambridge Area High School in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. After graduating, he went to Marshall University in West Virginia, where he played as a blocking back and an end on the school's football team opposite Frank Gatski, later a teammate on the Cleveland Browns. Ulinski was named to an all-West Virginia team in 1940, and was selected as a little All-American in 1941. He joined the U.S. Air Force in 1942 during World War II and played for the Second Air Force Super-Bombers football team as a blocking back in 1944. He was shifted to guard in the middle of that season, where he played for the remainder of his career. Ulinski played for a Fourth Air Force football team in 1945. Professional career John Brickels, an assistant coach for the Cleveland Browns in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), noticed Ulinski when he was playing at Marshall. Brickels had been a high school coach in Huntington, West Virginia, where Marshall is located, and saw him in action again when he played for the Super-Bombers. At Brickels' urging, Ulinski signed with the Browns in 1946. The Browns finished that season with a 12‚Äì2 record and went on to win the first AAFC championship. Ulinski was named a second-team All-Pro. Cleveland won the AAFC championship again in 1947, when Ulinski began playing middle linebacker on defense in addition to his role on the offensive line. Paul Brown, the coach of the Browns, called him the best offensive guard in the AAFC, and said the team \\"discovered he is about as good a middle line backer as we have on the team\\". Cleveland had a perfect season in 1948, winning all of its games, and Ulinski again was named a second-team All-Pro. The Browns repeated as the league's champions for a fourth year in a row in 1949, Ulinski's last season in professional football. Coaching career =College= Ulinski retired after the 1949 season and began a coaching career, accepting a job working under former Browns teammate Mike Scarry at Santa Clara University in California. Scarry had left a job at Cleveland's Western Reserve University to take the head coaching job at Santa Clara. In 1953, he was hired as an assistant line coach by Purdue University in Indiana. =Professional= The following year, Brown hired Ulinski to replace Weeb Ewbank as the team's tackles coach after Ewbank resigned to become head coach of the Baltimore Colts. \\"We've looked forward to the day when Ulinski would return to our organization as a coach\\", Brown said after the signing, calling him a \\"fine student of football\\" and a player who could teach the game well. The Browns, who by the time Ulinski joined as a coach had moved to the National Football League (NFL), won championships in both of Ulinski's first two years as an assistant under Brown. Paul Brown was fired 1963, two years after Art Modell took ownership of the team, but Ulinski stayed on the staff. Under his successor, former assistant Blanton Collier, worked primarily as a linebackers coach. The Browns won another championship while Ulinski was with the team in 1964. Ulinski continued as the linebackers coach and worked as an administrative coaching aide until 1971, when he was named the team's film coordinator. He held that position until he retired in 1984, having spent more than 30 years with the Browns as a player and coach.

Biography Editor Eduardo L√≥pez Rivas, L√≥pez Bustamante's father Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, on December 9, 1881. He was the eldest son of Eduardo L√≥pez Rivas and Carmen Bustamante. His father was a journalist, publisher and editor of the newspaper Diario El Fon√≥grafo (The Phonograph Daily) and the magazine El Zulia ilustrado (The illustrated Zulia). He was also the owner of a Venezuelan publishing house, Imprenta Americana (American Press).Tarre Murzi, Alfredo, Biograf√≠a de Maracaibo (Maracaibo Biography), Ed.

He grew up into the intellectual environment created by his father and during his childhood he learned several languages. This knowledge enabled him to become, at eighteen, the translator of international news in El Fon√≥grafo, which, by that time, reached newspapers in the original language of each country. General Rafael Urdaneta, ancestor of Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante He gradually became involved in journalism and in the family business. He and his brothers, Carlos and Enrique, as well as his sister Teresa L√≥pez Bustamante, were educated as journalists under their father's principles. According to historian Alfredo Tarre Murzi, they became a true dynasty of writers. He married Aurora P√©rez Luzardo in 1910, daughter of General Eduardo P√©rez Fabelo, a military linked to the history of Zulia state. The couple had six children. Aurora was also sister to Venezuelan lawyer N√©stor Luis P√©rez Luzardo, a minister in the Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras cabinet. He died in Maracaibo on June 30, 1939.Doctor Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante, comuniqu√© from the Bar Association of Zulia State on the occasion of the death of Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante. Published in the Panorama newspaper, Maracaibo, Venezuela, July 1, 1939. Director of El Fon√≥grafo Front page of Diario El Fon√≥grafo during World War I In 1908 Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante was appointed director of the newspaper El Fon√≥grafo and of the publishing house, Imprenta Americana. That same year general Juan Vicente G√≥mez became president of Venezuela and imposed strong censorship. According to author Jos√© Rafael Pocaterra, due to its independent editorials, El Fon√≥grafo was constantly threatened by the government. In his book Memorias de un venezolano de la decandencia (Memoirs of a Venezuelan in decline), he refers to the G√≥mez regime as a \\"Tyranny far more brutal than all previous ones\\". \\"The previous despotic regimes\\", writes Pocaterra, \\"had respected that newspaper, whose material progress was a result of its enormous moral responsibility\\".Pocaterra, Jos√© Rafael, Memorias de un venezolano de la decadencia (Memories of a Venezuelan in decline), Monte √Åvila Latin-American editors, C.A., Caracas, Venezuela, 1997. =World War I= Dungeons at San Carlos Fort, where L√≥pez Bustamante was held as political prisoner during five years When World War I began in 1914, G√≥mez favored the German Empire in the conflict while maintaining a veneer of neutrality against the allied community. In 1917, Eduardo started a simultaneous edition of \\"El Fon√≥grafo\\" in Caracas, under the direction of his younger brother, Carlos L√≥pez Bustamante. According to the writer and columnist of \\"El Fon√≥grafo\\", Jos√© Rafael Pocaterra, the Capital's edition \\"enjoyed a great popularity from the beginning\\" because, unlike other Venezuelan newspapers of the time, El Fon√≥grafo sympathized with the Allies. This position annoyed G√≥mez who, thereafter, decided to put an end to the newspaper. In the words of writer Pocaterra, \\"anonymous and insulting threats rained down\\" during those days. The newspapers's policy in favor of the Allies resulted in economic imbalance for \\"El Fon√≥grafo\\" because most of its advertisements, that came from Maracaibo German import and trading firms, began to be withdrawn. Government pressure on the newspaper became more and more intense but Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante did not change El Fon√≥grafo's editorial line. On August 23, 1917, the newspaper was raided by government troops. The headquarters of \\"El Fon√≥grafo\\" in Caracas and Maracaibo were closed permanently, ending with it, writes Jos√© R. Pocaterra, \\"the efforts of two generations ... and 38 years of the great Zulia newspaper.\\" L√≥pez Bustamante escaped to Cura√ßao where he lived as an expatriate for two years. San Carlos fort Prison Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante returned to Venezuela in 1919, under a false promise of armistice, and was imprisoned for five years in a colonial fortress located at the entrance to the Gulf of Venezuela: the San Carlos de la Barra Castle.

L√≥pez Bustamante spent five years in the castle on the island of San Carlos del Zulia, shackled and bolted by the feet and living in subhuman conditions. During his captivity he devoted himself to studying law, with a view to taking steps to rejoin the Venezuelan society still governed by G√≥mez. The permanent closure of the family publishing house and newspaper made it clear to the journalist that he needed to have another profession.

Author Gast√≥n Montiel Villasmil writes that, \\"from then on he developed a true passion for the essential foundation of law.\\" L√≥pez Bustamante was a popular lawyer within Zulia state, particularly among workers of the oil sector. Venezuelan writer Ciro Nava explains in his book Centuria cultural del Zulia: \\"When the oil industry started in Venezuela, as a result of oil exploitation, Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante sided with them and became a leading advocate of the workers' rights\\". \\"In this respect\\", writes Nava, \\"the performance of Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante is always deeply remembered and appreciated by the people of Zulia.\\" Venezuelan writer Gast√≥n Montiel Villasmil adds that L√≥pez Bustamante \\"wrote several works of interesting legal content related to the subject, being best known the one entitled Responsibility for accidents occurring at work.Nava, Ciro, Centuria Cultural del Zulia, √âlite editorial, Caracas, Venezuela, 1940.

Nest, 4 August 1915 ‚Äì 2 October 1990), known professionally by her maiden name of Loni Nest, was a German actress. Born in Berlin, she was a child star of German silent films in the 1920s. She was filmed for the first time at the age of four weeks.  Life and film career After more than 40 movies, she ended her movie career in 1928 at the age of 13. In 1933 she played in one last movie in France. Her whereabouts after 1933 remained unknown for several decades, but it was eventually discovered that she died at the age of 75 on 2 October 1990 in the French town Nice. In 2014, the website Forever Missed published an obituary that ostensibly revealed that Nest had died in Hawaii in 2014 at the age of 98. It also described details of Nest's life after she left Germany and moved to America. Various websites including the Internet Movie Database quickly adopted this information. It was soon discovered, however, that both the time and location of her death as well as the details about her later life were a hoax. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, German film historian Toni Schieck had discovered years before that Nest's sister Ursula had moved to the United States and died in Florida in 2007. Through her family, Schieck discovered that Nest had married and taken the last name Arnault. She moved to France where she died at the age of 75 in Nice.

Origins Juchereau was baptised in Tourouvre, Perche, France on 30 August 1593 to Jean Juchereau (1567-1628) of Tourouvre and his first wife Jeanne Creste (d.1608). His father's family was from Mortagne, Perche, France and prominent in government. His mother's family were wealthy land owners from Tourouvre and L'H√¥me. Juchereau had one brother, Jean Juchereau de Maur (1592-1672), who had two sons Nicolas Juchereau, sieur de St-Denis and Jean Juchereau, sieur de la Fert√©. The Juchereau brothers No√´l Juchereau and his brother Jean, with origins in Perche's Tourouvre hamlet, played a key role in the Percheron Immigration Mouvement toward Qu√©bec, Canada Nouvelle-France in the XVIIth century working closely with Robert Giffard, who spearheaded the movement, to recruit future settlers to the region. The Juchereau brothers were responsible for forty-one engagement contract destined for Canada largely executed by Tourouvre-based Choiseau notaries between 1646 and 1651. No√´l and Jean Juchereau were half-brothers to Pierre Juchereau, sieur des Moulineaux, who helped in the recruitment of engag√©s on behalf of Jean et No√´l Juchereau. Pierre Juchereau never crossed the ocean to Canada. New France No√´l Juchereau completed studies in the humanities and law, and was granted a Bachelor of Law degree. Juchereau first traveled to Qu√©bec in 1634, followed by his brother Jean with his family, in 1643. Juchereau was an active figure in New France. The governor of Qu√©bec frequently sought his help with delicate legal matters. Juchereau and Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny, originally created the Communaut√© des Habitants. He was appointed their head clerk in 1645. As a church warden from 1645-1646 he prominently participated in religious ceremonies central to Qu√©bec's social life. Historian Benjamin Sulte believed that he was acting as an agent for Ros√©e and Cheffault who wanted a grant of part of the trade in New France from the Company of One Hundred Associates. The de Maur seigneurie, west of Qu√©bec city was granted to Jean Juchereau and No√´l Juchereau in 1647. This concession of land was inherited by brother Jean when No√´l died. Death No√´l Juchereau travelled to France in 1647 as a delegate of the Communaut√© des Habitants to obtain related organization changes. He drowned shortly before July 31, 1648, in Orl√©ans, France.

He collected valuable intelligence on German military capabilities while serving in Berlin before World War II. During the war, he was a personal advisor to General George C. Marshall. He influenced the establishment of the new Bundeswehr to play a role in the Cold War.  Early life and career  He was brought up and attended schools in Stamford, Connecticut. His father was killed in action at Cebu, Philippine Islands (February 1900). He attended Yale (1912‚Äì15) and earned a B.A., 100 years after his namesake grandfather. He was a graduate student at Columbia (1915‚Äì1916). He married Katherine Alling Hollister in 1917.  U.S. Army  He served on the Mexican border as a lieutenant in the New York National Guard (1916), and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Regular Army November 30, 1916. In World War I he was a company commander and battalion commander in the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment in France during the Marne and Meuse-Argonne Campaigns. He received the Silver Star (recommended for Distinguished Service Cross) and promotion to major for leading his battalion in capture of the Bois de Foret. He was in Coblenz during the occupation of Germany as political advisor to the officer in charge of civil affairs (January 1919 ‚Äì June 1920), followed by nearly four years as assistant military attach√© in Berlin (June 1920 ‚Äì April 1924). In November 1922, Smith was sent to Munich to research a local political organizer, Adolf Hitler. In his report filed to Washington, he prophetically identified the young Hitler as a \\"marvelous demagogue,\\" who was the dominating force in his Bavarian fascist movement and that his forceful, logical, and fanatical speaking could sway a neutral listener. Smith returned to Berlin as military attach√© from 1935 to 1939. During the eleven years between postings in Berlin, he completed the U.S. Infantry School, Ft. Benning, Georgia (1927), attended the Command and General Staff School, Ft. Leavenworth (1928), returned to the Infantry School as an instructor (1928‚Äì32), attended the Army War College (1933), and served with the 27th infantry regiment, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii (June 1933 ‚Äì April 1935). He returned to Washington, D.C., as a specialist on Germany in the U.S. Army military intelligence division, and as a personal adviser to General George C. Marshall (1939‚Äì1945). From Berlin in the late 1930s, he reported on German rearmament, Luftwaffe capabilities, and the increasing extent of the Germans' organization for war. He was friendly with important officers such as Werner von Blomberg (Minister of War). He arranged (May 1936) the first of Colonel Charles Lindbergh's five inspection trips to the German aircraft industry and the Luftwaffe. Senior Luftwaffe officers discussed air tactics and operations with Lindbergh; he flew a Messerschmitt Bf 109. The trips produced valuable intelligence. Lindbergh's public opposition to Roosevelt's war policies, among other things, made him unpopular. Accepting a medal from Hermann G√∂ring fueled suspicion that he was a Nazi sympathizer and disloyal to his country. Smith represented that Lindbergh's visits in fact provided valuable intelligence. Smith was himself vulnerable to vilification as a defeatist or a German sympathizer, but Marshall, who had commanded him at Fort Benning, protected him. Smith, by all accounts, served the army well during World War II, but he and his wife remained staunchly anti-Roosevelt in their outlook. Upon hearing of Roosevelt's death in April 1945, Smith and his wife burst into roars of laughter and embraced each other and a friend.Lynne Olson, Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941, pg 406  Retirement  He sought the Republican nomination for Connecticut's 4th congressional district in 1946, but lost to Hon. John Davis Lodge in 1946. He advised the Eberstadt (Armed Forces) Committee, part of the first Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch (1945‚Äì1946, or 1948). He was military aide to the governor of Connecticut. He translated, edited, and wrote the preface for Invasion, 1944: Rommel and the Normandy Campaign, by Lieutenant General Hans Speidel, Rommel's chief of staff. In 1958, General Albert Wedemeyer published an autobiographic book about WW II.Wedemeyer Reports!, New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1958 In this book, he praised Smith for his achievements during his time in Berlin and the quality of the reports he delivered, i.e. about the German re-armament. Wedemeyer pointed out that Smith (and Charles Lindbergh) earned gratefulness of the United States but were criticized by a clique of politicians that wanted to ignore the war preparations of the Nazi regime.

The foundation is dedicated to international education, training, and exchange. El Compromiso partners with foundations, governments, corporations, NGOs, and other institutions to develop and implement programs that impact the local and international community. El Compromiso provides global services that benefit children, men, and women in 22 countries. The foundation's primary objective is to help find solutions to some of the greatest challenges faced by the most marginalized and unprotected members of society, especially those in developing countries. They strive to achieve these goals through: *Support of public opinion campaigns that raise and promote awareness about the issues that the address and directly impact the groups mentioned in the above. *Finding and developing funding for the design and execution of development projects that can be used to solve the challenges by these groups. The Foundation encourages the development of cooperation efforts. While at the same time assisting and carrying out philanthropic and formative acts directed at toward serving those who are in greatest need of assistance. El Compromiso strives for the creation of a better world, one in which every person has free access to regular and sufficient alimentation, education, health, and housing, in an atmosphere of respect for Human Rights and the environment.

It is, also, one of his most successful early compositions. The three movements of this cycle were composed between 1952 and 1954.  Composition  After winning the first prize in the Bucharest Music Festival in 1953 for La colombe de la paix, one of his unpublished works, Xenakis decided to complete the first and the second movement of his Anastenaria trilogy, strongly influenced by his Greek roots. He was then studying with Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and, most especially, with Olivier Messiaen, who even made several changes to the original conception of this work.  Conception  Xenakis claimed that the work is based on a Greek Ritual which, after Constantine the Great, it has been reinterpreted to be a Christian ritual. In this ritual, Xenakis distinguishes up to three different phases: * Phase A: the procession of the priests, the \\"Anastenarides\\", and the crowds from several villages, thus performing a ritual in which the ceremony is centered on instrumental and choral music. The priest say prayers while the Anastenarides ladle out holy water for the people to drink or to wash themselves with. * Phase B: On the evening before the 21st of May, a holy steer is brought from the fields to the church. A huge fire is lit out on the church square and the Anastenarides dance effusively on hot coals with their bare feet, as part of the ritual. Xenakis decided not to compose the third phase, in which the steer blessed by Orthodox priest is sacrificed on the 21st of May.  Analysis  This work consists of three movements, which are often performed individually. The movement list is as follows: #Procession aux eaux claires, for large orchestra, SATB chorus of 30 voices and male chorus of 15 voices (1952/1953) #Le sacrifice, for large orchestra (1953) #Metastaseis, for 61 solo instruments (1953/54) The first movement is largely tonal, unlike the rest of the work. According to Hans Rudolf Zeller, the divisi in the choral parts create musical phenomena of mass resulting from the individualization of the leading voice. It is also based on the principle of overlapping, which makes each voice to proceed from its own melodic, harmonic or rhythmic personality. The second movement, which treats the evening before the sacrifice, is conceived purely instrumentally; this movement is clearly closer to the style of his contemporaries. However, from this movement on, Xenakis would no longer be constrained by serial techniques, and would explore his musical viewpoints and perspectives by using glissandos and discontinuous pitches. The third movement was the result of this change, even though it would still not be considered stochastic music, which Xenakis would explore further in Pithoprakta. However, Xenakis removed completely any trace of serial music and started working to bring his vocal compositions to the same level as that of his instrumental and electroacoustic compositions. According to the composer himself, the third movement was separated from the rest because it was \\"such a step forward\\".

It is a festival of the Hindu community in the Saloor Dungra village of the Painkhanda Valley in the Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, India. The festival and the eponymous art form are conducted as an offering to the village deity, Bhumiyal Devta, in the courtyard of the village temple. The Ramman is unique to the village and is neither replicated nor performed anywhere else in the Himalayan region.http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091029/dplus.htm#1  The Deity  The guardian deity of Saloor Dungra is Bhumichetrapal, also known as Bhumiyal Devta. The festival is held in her honour every year after Baisakhi, a harvest festival that also marks the beginning of the Hindu Solar New Year. On the day of Baisakhi, the village priest announces the date for the Ramman festival which falls on the ninth or the eleventh day after Baisakhi.http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg;=00011&RL;=00281#identification The Bhumiyal Devta comes out in a procession to the temple on the day of Baisakhi. The second day, people offer hariyali (sprouted barley plants), to the deity who, in turn, promises prosperity to all, including agricultural yield and forest produce. Every day of the festival, the Devta takes a round of the village. The festival lasts for ten days during which time the local epic of Rama is sung and masked dances depicting different aspects of life take place in the courtyard of the Bhumiyal Devta's temple  Festivities and Dances  The Ramman begins with an invocation to Ganesha, the remover of obstacles followed by the dance of Ganesha and Parvati. This is followed by the dance of the Sun God, an enactment of the creation-myth of the birth of Brahma and Ganesha. The other dances include the dance of the Bur Deva along with Gopi Chand (Krishna) and Radhika, the Mwar-Mwarin dance that showcases the travails of the buffalo herders and the Baniya-Baniyain Nritya (dance of the trader-couple) that shows the hardships faced by the common people.Nomination No. 00281 for inscription on the Representative List in 2009. UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage , Abu Dhabi 2009. After these initial performances, the focus now shifts to the enactment of the local Ramkatha. Episodes from Rama‚Äôs life, beginning with his visit to Janakpur and culminating with his coronation following his return from exile, are sung to a total of 324 beats and steps. Another important aspect of these performances is the singing of Jagar, a musical rendition of local legends. There are also other dances and episodes like the Maal Nritya, Koorjogi and Narsingh Pattar Nritya that follow the Ramkatha. In the Maal Nritya, a historical battle between the Gurkhas of Nepal and the local Garhwalis is comically enacted by a troupe of four dancers dressed in red and white. It is mandatory to have a red Maal from the Kunwar caste of Saloor village, as it is believed that this hamlet supported the Gorkhas while the other three are selected by the panches of the Gram Panchayat. In the Koorjogi ceremony, weeds (koor) from the village fields are pulled out by a Koorjogi, a character who carries a sack full of these weeds. There is much merriment as people throw these weeds at each other in a spirit of a communal sport.  Community Participation  The villagers of Saloor-Dungra are the inheritors, organizers and financers of the Ramman festival. All households, irrespective of caste and community, offer prayers and perform rituals to the main deities of the Ramman. The roles of the various castes in the festival are however well established. Talented youth and elders selected by village heads are the performers at Ramman. The Brahmin priests conduct the rituals and prepare and serve prasada to the deity. Baaris are charged with the organization and collection of funds while the Dhaaris are a group that assists the baaris in organizing the event. The baaris and dhaaris are assigned their duties by the Gram panchas. It is also these panchas who select the residence of the Bhumiyal Devta till the next Ramman festival. The family where Bhumiyal Devta resides for the year has to maintain a strict daily routine and a place in the house is demarcated and consecrated for the deity. The Jagar is sung by the Jagaris or Bhallas of the Rajput caste who are professional bards. The playing of drums is central to the festivities and this is done by drummers of the Das community, the lowest caste, whose status is elevated during the performance. The festival ends with a feast where the prasada of the deity is distributed as a sacrament.  A Threatened and Unique Tradition  Ramman combines the sacred and the social, the ritualistic with revelry and expresses the history, faith, lifestyle, fears and hopes of the Saloor Dungra villagers through a mesh of oral, literary, visual, kinetic and traditional craft forms. It is an annual affair that children learn by watching. The various skills it involves in terms of dance, singing and drumming are passed down across hereditary communities orally. The onslaught of globalization and technology and lack of financial or artistic compensation have adversely impacted the ritual and traditional performances of the Ramman. Being peripheral to mainstream art forms, the awareness of the Ramman beyond its immediate borders is small and it stands the risk of becoming extinct in time.http://www.paramparaproject.org/traditions_ramman.html In 2009, UNESCO inscribed Ramman on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article27604.ece  References  Hindu festivals Festivals in Uttarakhand ","title":"Ramman (festival)"},{"id":"36510682","title":"83rd New York State Legislature"},{"id":"36510691","text":"Melissa Caballero (born 5 January 1985) is a Spanish former swimmer who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Glavar was born in Ljubljana and was an illegitimate and abandoned child of the Maltese noble Pietro Giacomo de Testaferrata and of a local servant. He was raised in Vopovlje in northern Carniola. As he was a quick learner, he went to study for a priest to Ljubljana and about 1738 to Graz, where he became a master of liberal arts (). There he also got acquainted with economic theories of French physiocrats. His education was wide and he was fluent in several European languages. Glavar's house in Komenda Glavar returned to Carniola around 1743. He settled in Komenda in northern Carniola, where he established a school in 1751, and erected a benefice building with a library in 1752. The library still stands and comprises around 2,000 books from a multitude of fields of science and arts. A mighty lime tree in Komenda was presumably planted by Glavar in 1748 and has been named after him. Glavar collaborated with artists and ordered Franc Jelov≈°ek to paint the beneficiary house and the local church. From 1754 until 1760, he edited the first Slovene-language parish family book, writing the data about the inhabitants of Komenda. In 1761‚Äì66, he erected the High-Baroque St. Anne's Church in Tunjice. In 1766, Glavar bought Lan≈°pre≈æ Castle () in Gomila near Mirna in the central Carniola, where he kept an apiary with about 200 quite profitable hives. He also established a beekeeping school there and wrote several texts on beekeeping, including Pogovor o ƒçebelnih rojih (Discussion About Bee Swarms) from 1776‚Äì78, which was the first Slovene-language scholarly text, but was lost and was published only in 1976. He was a supporter of poor students. He died at Lan≈°pre≈æ Castle aged 62 years. His assets were distributed among the poor and used for the establishment of Glavar Hospital in Komenda in 1804. In 2006, a TV-documentary was produced about Peter Pavel Glavar.

It is located in the village of Kabelv√•g on the island of Austv√•g√∏ya. It is the church for the V√•gan parish which is part of the Lofoten prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of S√∏r-H√•logaland. The yellow, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1898 by the architect Carl J. Bergstr√∏m. The church seats about 1,200 people, making it the largest wooden building in Northern Norway. History This has been a church site since the 12th century. Lofoten's first church was built here during the time of King √òystein Magnusson (c. 1088‚Äì 1123). Five or six different churches have been built on this very location throughout the last 900 years. One former church was moved to V√¶r√∏ya in 1799 (see Old V√¶r√∏y Church). The present church was built in 1898 to be large enough to accommodate all the fishermen who came to Kabelv√•g each season. It was nicknamed the \\"Lofoten Cathedral\\" () by Eivind Berggrav, the Bishop of the Diocese of Oslo in 1929. The church was designed in Gothic revival style by the architect Carl Julius Bergstr√∏m (1828-1898). When the Lofoten Cathedral was completed, the \\"old church\\" was still located just across the road, until it was demolished in the summer of 1900.

This species occurs globally, and is a serious pest to such crops as citrus, tea, papaya, guava and coffee, and can heavily damage numerous other crops. They are unique in having haploid females,Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) - Core a condition caused by a bacterium that change haploid males into females.Single mite female  Nature Description =Adults= Adult specimens can grow to long (including the rostrum) and wide. They are flat, oval, and have a dark green to red-orange colour. The adult males are more wedge-shaped than females. This species has two pairs of legs that extend forward and two extending back. It has two sensory rods on tarsus II that distinguish it from another mite species that is known to occur on the same plants, the privet mite, (Brevipalpus obovatus Donn.). A black, \\"H\\"-shaped mark occurs on females when raised in temperatures of 68 ¬∞F to 77 ¬∞F, although this marking is not present at 86 ¬∞F. Image:Brevipalpus phoenicis - tarsus1 01-over.jpg Image:Brevipalpus phoenicis - tarsus2 01-over (1).jpg Legend: Empodium (EM) Claw (C) Leg setae-prorals (p) Tectals (tc) Festigials (ft) Unguinals (u) Solenidion (w) =Larvae= Larvae are about long, have six legs, and are bright orange-red when newly emerged, later becoming opaque-orange. The protonymphs and deutonymphs are somewhat transparent, with some of their inner organs appearing a diffuse green colour, with black or yellow patches. Like the adults, they are eight-legged. =Eggs= Eggs can be seen with the unaided eye, as clusters of reddish- orange. Distribution Brevipalpus phoenicis occurs globally, mostly in the tropics. It is known to occur in: *Argentina *Australia *Brazil *Guyana *Cuba *Egypt *Netherlands *India *Jamaica *Kenya *Malaya *Mauritius *Mexico *Spain *Taiwan =United States= This species has become established in numerous southern states, throughout the mainland from Florida to California, and also in Hawaii. Life cycle Larva Protonymph Deutonymph Brevipalpus phoenicis lays approximately 50 to 60 eggs during adulthood. These eggs have a fragile stipe that projects from them, and may break if handled. The eggs hatch 8 to 16 days after being laid. Females deposit eggs singly, commonly sharing a single location with other females. Usually 4 to 8 clusters of eggs are present, normally deposited in cracks or the hollow cavities in leaves created when the internal mesophyll has been destroyed. One day before the eggs hatch, they turn opaque white and the red eyes of the larvae within become visible. In warm to temperate regions, 4 to 6 generations of this mite can occur each year. In tropical regions, at least 10 generations can occur. Ideal conditions for this species are a temperature range of 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C (77‚Äì86 ¬∞F) with high relative humidity. Adult females live for a maximum of 5 to 6 weeks. The maximum life expectancy for this species is 47 days at 68 ¬∞F, with a minimum of 7.5 days at 86 ¬∞F in regions of relative humidity of 85% to 90%. Populations of Brevipalpus phoenicis are almost entirely female. This is because the species is parthenogenetic, with most reproduction occurring from unfertilized eggs that produce only females. Development takes place in three stages‚Äîlarva, protonymph, and deutonymph. The maturation from egg to adult occurs during 12 to 24 days. =Moulting= This mite experiences a quiescent period prior to each moulting, during which it does not eat. During this time it remains attached to the host plant by its stylet alone, with its legs held straight. Hosts This species is known to have at least 65 hosts, and the USDA reports that there may be up to 1,000. In the state of Florida, this mite is known to infest Aphelandra, gardenia, grapefruit, hibiscus, holly, ligustrum, lemon, lime, orange, pecan and viburnum. Damage This species damages fruit by injecting the cells with toxic saliva. They do this to be able to digest the contents. They puncture numerous cells in close proximity to one another, causing visible chlorotic spots around the area. Later, these spots merge to become brown patches. This can stop the plant's growth and result in deformations. This may cause the skin of the fruit to rupture, and shoots to lose leaves and occasionally die back. On papaya, the mites begin by feeding on the trunk of the tree. As the population becomes more dense, they migrate to the leaves and fruit. Characteristic evidence of feeding sites is drying of the surrounding areas, with brown colour appearing and the area becoming callous and suberized. Damage to citrus is more severe. When cholorotic spots are great in number, production of the host plants may be severely reduced. Characteristic galls at the nodes may be observed, and the buds may be unable to sprout. Shoots may be grossly misshapen, and very few leaves may develop. This can result in the death of the entire tree. Apart from the physical damage this species can cause, it is also a vector of both citrus leprosis and the coffee ringspot virus. Control Early in the 20th century, Florida farmers used sulfur as a way to control this pest. However, this is toxic to other, beneficial arthropods. There are at least four natural predators of this species, but are generally not useful economically, as they attack Brevipalpus phoenicis only after the population has increased to very high numbers and severe crop damage has already been done. Currently, as there is no alternative available, pesticides are used.

She is widely known for her movement towards nudism and feminism. Jones is a feminist who is adamant about female self-acceptance, obliterating fat shaming and general ideals in keeping with the feminist way of thinking. She encourages acceptance of sexuality and social nudism in daily life. Felicity has been a contributor for magazines such as Failure Magazine and Internaturally. She continues to be a notable figure in the naturist movement. Jones is one of the co-founders of Young Naturists America. Her blog, created in November 2010, is part of the Young Naturists America site. It contains a variety of topics such as nudism, social nude activities, feminism, and art projects. Since the creation of her blog, she has been interviewed by a number of news publications seeking information about nudism and specifically the Young Nudist Movement. Over the time that she has been publishing, she has been steadily shifting focus. When she first started, Jones' blog posts were mostly about the nudist movement and her own personal experiences growing up as a third-generation nudist in America. In early 2011, Jones began writing about a broader range of topics. She believes the United States has many core social issues that could be greatly diminished by incorporating more social nudity into people's lives. Some of the broader social issues she now talks about on her blog include feminism, sexuality, body image, fat shaming, cyber bullying and topfreedom. Jones takes part in social activism. With the aim of promoting body acceptance, she has participated in public art projects by artists such as Zefrey Throwell and body painter Andy Golub. While the art projects themselves are varied, they have all had a single common connecting factor, which is the incorporation of public nudity. As of May 2017, Felicity Jones is married to her Young Naturists America co-founder, whose pen-name is Jordan Blum.  In 2011  In August 2011 Jones participated in a nude art project called Ocularpation: Wall Street by Zefrey Throwell. During this art performance she was arrested by the NYPD for disrupting the peace and for blocking traffic; the charges were dropped a few months later. She has also been working to promote top-free rights for women and had her first Top Free Day In Central Park in the summer of 2011. During this event, she forced men to wear bras while the women were topless. Later in 2011, Jones also participated in an additional performance, this time a week-long game of strip poker in the window of an art gallery titled \\"I'll Raise You One\\"NY Post Video - I'll Raise You One by the same artist which was covered by the NY Post and The Village Voice.  In 2012  An art performance involving body painting took place in July 2012 and was the brainchild of artist Andy Golub. Jones and a few other members of Young Naturists America got completely naked in Times Square and had their bodies painted by Golub. The performance attracted hundreds of spectators who clamored to get pictures of the naked models. This event was covered by Vice Magazine, which published an article titled: \\"Waiting for the panties to drop in Times Square.\\" This prompted her response blog post, \\"Naked Body Painting in the Heart of New York City.\\" She was interviewed on October 19, 2012 by Hollywood Today for a piece about censorship titled \\"Censorship and Social Networks ‚Äì violence is in. Nipples are out!\\"  In 2013  On January 18, 2013, Jones was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal about an off Broadway naked comedy show that she co-produced. On January 22, 2013, Jones was interviewed by the Chicago Tribune about the impending San Francisco anti nudity legislation as well as her thoughts about the current lack of younger people who are involved with naturism. In February 2013, the Fire Island National Seashore authorities decided to close Fire Island's nude beach. Jones was interviewed with regards to this issue by both the New York Times as well as News Day. She was also cited in the Huffington Post and the Long Island News website. On May 2, 2013 Jones was interviewed by Nancy Redd for Huffington Post Live. The segment was called \\"Let's Get Naked\\". (not available) On August 3, 2013, Jones was interviewed by journalist Bill Briggs for a featured article on NBC News about the lack of young nudists in America. Jones was then quoted in a Digital Journal follow-up news article. On August 4, 2013 as featured in the local news site The Citizen / AuburnPub.com, Jones attended the annual Northeast Naturist Festival in upstate New York. This festival is where naturists congregate and talk about issues facing the movement. On November 7, 2013, reporter Hilary Cadigan wrote an article for Chiang Mai News titled \\"Naked Brunch.\\" While the article mostly dealt with Thailand‚Äôs first clothing-optional resort, The Oriental Village, the reporter cited Felicity's article, \\"Why Women Should See Other Women‚Äôs Naked Bodies,\\" as it dealt with body acceptance through social nudity.  In 2015  On June 26, 2015, Felicity explained why naturism is a positive impact on body image \\\\- a central topic in her writings. In July 2015 Felicity was in a New York Observer article about nudism in New York. She was also featured in New York Magazine in an article about meeting people on nude beaches.  In 2016  In May 2016 Felicity was interviewed in Self article \\"This Is What It's Like To Live Most Of Your Life Naked\\". And in VICE article \\"We Asked a Young Nudist Why Young People Aren't Nudists Anymore\\".  Articles written  She has written for publications such as Failure Magazine, Internaturally, and the Bulletin. Felicity contributed a recommendation to the New York Magazine article \\"How to Swim All By Yourself.\\"  Felicity's Blog  In her blog, Felicity addresses issues of public nudity, home nudity, nudist events, challenges getting nudist clubs to adapt changing expectations, sex positivity and body acceptance. For example, she has written \\"How To Be A Sex Positive Person\\", \\"Home Nudist Etiquette With Visitors\\", and \\"It‚Äôs Time for Nudist Clubs to Change Their Policies on Genital Jewelry\\".

The novel follows 15-year-old Dell Parsons, who must learn to fend for himself after his parents are arrested for robbing a bank. The book also re-visits Great Falls, Montana, a setting that Ford frequently uses in his work. It was Ford's first \\"stand alone\\" novel since Wildlife (1990). Plot After his parents are arrested for robbing a bank, fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons is left to fend for himself. His twin sister Berner has run off, leaving him to a family friend who secrets him away to Saskatchewan, Canada. There Dell is to live with the American Arthur Remlinger, a man with a cool demeanor and a hidden inner violence that threatens Dell's well-being. Development The work on Canada took Ford twenty years, with the author stating that he took inspiration from several different sources. Ford stated that some of the elements in the book, such as the feeling of \\"not [being] connected with the larger forces of a culture I was by accident born into\\", were drawn from his personal experiences. He also expressed an interest in the aftermath and consequences of crimes such as murder and robberies, and the effect they have on the young family members of the perpetrators, as well as the \\"closeness to which normal life bears upon felonious life\\". Reception Critical reception for Canada has been overwhelmingly positive, with The New Yorker comparing the book to William Maxwell's So Long, See You Tomorrow and Ford's previous novel Wildlife. The latter book also used Montana as a setting and, like Canada was a \\"stand alone\\" novel (i.e., not featuring Frank Bascombe as a protagonist). Praise for the novel centered on the book's narration, which is told from the viewpoint of an older Dell, and the book's clarity and simplicity. The Daily Telegraph cited Ford's \\"genius at capturing human frailty and its pitiful disguises\\" as a highlight while The Washington Post praised the book's \\"plainspoken lines\\".

Her parents divorced, and responsibility for her two sisters fell on her shoulders. Eventually, the children were placed in separate foster homes. Paneok became an emotionally troubled adolescent who at one point was in a juvenile detention center. Aviation career Inspired by a magazine article, and enabled by income from the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Paneok pursued her dream of becoming a pilot beginning in 1976. Counselors in her detention center required her to attend therapy sessions because of her admitted total obsession with flying. She often skipped school to attend flying lessons at Merrill Field. In order to continue the lessons, she began creating and selling scrimshaw to visiting tourists in the area. She received her pilot's license in 1979, becoming the first female licensed pilot of indigenous Alaskan ancestry. A year later, she survived the crash of her Piper Tri-Pacer with three cracks in one vertebra. When her blood pressure disqualified her from a career in aerobatics, she became a bush pilot, carrying cargo and passengers to areas other pilots did not go to. She was an operations inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration, and a statewide safety coordinator for the Alaska Aviation Foundation. Paneoka had her article titled \\"With Trusting Eyes Behind Me\\" published in 1996 in Alaska Magazine. In 1997, she was an honored guest at the \\"Women in Flight\\" exhibit of the National Air and Space Museum. One of the stories she told at the event was about an airstrip having to be cleared of polar bears before her plane could land. Death and legacy Ellen Evak Paneok died on March 2, 2008. On March 7, 2008, Senator Lisa Murkowski paid tribute to Paneok on the floor of the United States Senate. The tribute was read into the Congressional Record. Paneok was a volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters, working with at-risk children. She was a member of the International Organization of Women Pilots, the Alaska Ninety-Nines and the Alaska Airmen's Association. Her ivory scrimshaw and original paintings are now in museums in Alaska. In 2012, Paneok was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.

Early years As children in Cleveland, the Jones sisters began singing gospel music in front of their church in the early 1950s, encouraged by their parents Howard and Wanda Jones. They quickly began singing on local television programs and at other churches; during this time they officially names themselves \\"The Jones Sisters Trio.

It was launched aboard a Black Brant sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The images taken were the highest resolution photos ever of the Sun's corona. Telescope description The telescope weighs , and is long. The mirrors are approximately across. Its optics were designed at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama with assistance from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and L-3Com/Tinsley Laboratories of Richmond, California. Dr. Jonathan Cirtain, from MSFC said: \\"These mirrors were to be the finest pieces of glass ever fabricated for solar astrophysics.\\" =Imaging system= The imaging system was designed by Apogee Imaging Systems with a resolution of 0.1 arcsec/pixel (14 times higher resolution than the Solar Dynamics Observatory).

The total cost of the mission was $5 million. On the second flight, in 2018, five and a half minutes (329 seconds) of pictures were taken of an area on the sun 4.4 arcminutes square (the sun's disk being about 30 arcminutes in diameter). Seventy eight images were taken at intervals of 4.4 seconds, with a two-second exposure time, at the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of 17.2 nanometres which is dominated by Fe IX emission (emission from iron in the +8 ionization state) indicating temperatures around 800 000 Kelvin. The instrument was able to resolve strands of plasma as narrow as about 200 kilometres wide. Findings The first mission revealed never- before-seen \\"magnetic braids\\" of plasma roiling in the Sun's outer layers. It was the first time scientists were able to directly observe magnetic reconnection in braids, which may be the primary sources of heating in the active solar corona.

He was a close associate of his cousin, King Richard II of England, and was one of his most valuable advisors. He was also an esquire of John of Gaunt, and an extremely close friend to Queen Anne of Bohemia. He was an MP for Somerset and Devon.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/luttrell- sir-hugh-1364-1428 Biography Sir Hugh Luttrell was born in Dunster, a son of Elizabeth Courtenay (d. 7 August 1395), great-granddaughter of Edward I of England, and her second husband Sir Andrew Lutrell of Chilton. Sir Andrew was a direct descendant of an Irish noble family: the Luttrells, who were the original Earls of Carhampton. The family had strong ties with the Plantagenets, to which they were related. Given her loyal servitude to the royal family, Elizabeth received 200 pounds from her close cousin, Richard II of England. Courtenay used this loan to buy large properties of land, which increased the family's wealth by leaps and bounds. This act would make Sir Hugh famous throughout England. In 1378, Hugh's father died abruptly, and in 1379, he began his own career. When he was about 16, he became an esquire to John of Gaunt. He served Gaunt for about 12 years, and switched his services to the English Queen, Anne of Bohemia. They became very close, and Anne granted him numerous plots of land for his servitude and good nature, which boosted his social standing among the English nobility. Hugh again switched his services, this time to his cousin, Richard II. Hugh soon became the bearer of numerous titles, like Constable of Leed's Castle (1393‚Äì1399), and Keeper of her Forest of Gillingham in 1399. Sir Hugh's loyalty to Richard II was unbreakable, right up to his imprisonment. After all, he was one of the King's closest retainers and advisors. After the monarch's murder, Hugh felt sorrow for his cousin. However, his switching sides to the new king, Henry IV of England (also known as Henry of Bolingbroke), doubled his fortunes drastically. He flourished during Henry's reign, mostly because of his family's prominence, and usefulness to the king. In 1400, he sailed to Calais, in the company of his uncle, Sir Peter, who had become the commander of the English garrison there. Luttrell spent three years being the deputy Lieutenant of Calais (1400‚Äì1403), and devoted his time in that job to politics. He discussed numerous peace talks with French officials, and numerous other governmental matters. In 1403, he was assigned with Sir Thomas Swineburn and John Urban to renew a peace treaty with Flanders. The talks were harsh, as surviving documents say, and the three Englishmen left Flanders, with an impression that the Flemings were not to be trusted. When he arrived back in England in 1404, he was elected to the English Parliament for the first time, and faced a serious dilemma. On 6 October 1404, Lady Mohun, a noblewoman that had sold vast plots of land to Hugh's late mother, Elizabeth, had died at Canterbury. This was a serious blow to Luttrell, who had inherited Mohun's estates from his mother. After Lady Mohun's death, her heirs and Luttrell began a fierce legal battle over who would own the estates. The battle went in Hugh's favor for a period of time, when copies of Mohun's will were handed over to him. The crown gave him full seisin over the properties, and the legal battle quieted down for a while. However, the legal battle had to be resolved, and in May 1405 Parliament intervened. A year passed with no clear victor, and the House of Commons of England stepped in, this time on Luttrell's side. The debating went on for two more years, and in 1408 Luttrell prevailed, paying 100 marks for his succession to the barony. Through 1406‚Äì1414, little was known of Hugh's activities. It is known that he was present at Glastonbury Abbey in 1408, with scores of other influential noblemen. It was then and there that Archbishop Thomas Arundel made a visit to them, and discussed important political and religious matters with the noblemen. In 1410, the Queen of England, Joan of Navarre, made Luttrell her steward, a task which he enjoyed. When Henry V of England ascended to the throne in 1415, Sir Hugh's popularity increased. He traveled to France with the English army, to re- incite the 100 Years' War. He proved to be a daring leader, and was one of the key commanders at the Siege of Harfleur, and at the Siege of Rouen. After the siege, he returned home to England, and in 1417, he entered the service of Henry V, becoming one of his most loyal retainers. Throughout the rest of his life, he would have a splendid relationship with the king. In February 1417, he was appointed Lieutenant of Harfleur and embarked to France, where the war was still being fought, in the retinue of Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury. Luttrell had his own private battalion, consisting of 20 men-at- arms and 60 archers. After assuming command over the city of Harfleur in 1418, he was given orders by his superiors to manage the English garrison there, and hang any deserters. During that same year, Sir Hugh negotiated the surrender of the French Captains of Montivilliers and F√©camp. In 1419, he also negotiated the surrender of the town of Montreuil, and many others. In July 1419, Luttrell was appointed the Royal Seneschal of Normandy by Henry V, a position he held for two years (1419‚Äì1421). Sir Hugh thus became the ruler of one of the most important places in medieval France. Luttrell was thrilled with governing his new domain, describing himself as the \\"gret Seneschal of Normandie.\\" Sir Hugh kept Normandy under the mighty fist of the English, which Henry V of England benefited from greatly. In 1420, Luttrell corresponded with the king many times, praising Henry's marriage to Catherine of Valois, saying in a letter that it caused him: \\"the gretest gladnesse and consolation that ever came unto my herte.\\" He also reported to King Henry about the state of the country, saying: \\"ther ys no steryng of none evyl doers (there is no stirring of none evil-doers)\\", and also informed the king of the poverty of the country. In 1421, he was relieved of his duties as Seneschal of Normandy and Lieutenant of Harfleur, and was ordered to return to England. Upon arriving in England, Hugh met with many members of English nobility, and royal officials. He was also occupied with many royal assignments, which continued up to his death. On 24 March 1428, Sir Hugh Luttrell fell gravely ill and died on a visit to one of his daughters, a nun at Shaftesbury. A large funeral procession followed his coffin on the way to Dunster. After he was buried, a monument was built in his memory at the Dunster church. At that moment, one of the most influential figures in medieval England, a man who had lived through three reigns, was put to rest.

It is prepared by the electrochemical fluorination of sulfolane. NfF serves as an entry point to nonafluorobutanesulfonates (nonaflates), which are valuable as electrophiles in palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions. As a perfluoroalkylsulfonylating agent, NfF offers the advantages of lower cost and greater stability over the more frequently used triflic anhydride. The fluoride leaving group is readily substituted by nucleophiles such as amines, phenoxides, and enolates, giving sulfonamides, aryl nonaflates, and alkenyl nonaflates, respectively. However, it is not attacked by water (in which it is stable at pH<12). Hydrolysis by barium hydroxide gives Ba(ONf)2, which upon treatment with sulfuric acid gives perfluorobutanesulfonic acid and insoluble barium sulfate. Purification center Commercially available NfF is contaminated with 6-10 mol % perfluorosulfolane derived from its production. This is readily removed by vigorously stirring the commercial material with a concentrated aqueous solution of K3PO4 and K2HPO4 in a 1:1 molar ratio for 96 hours. This treatment, followed by removal of the aqueous layer and distillation from P2O5, gives a product that contains >99 mol % NfF with near quantitative recovery. Synthesis of aryl and alkenyl nonaflates As mentioned above, aryl and alkenyl nonaflates are useful as electrophiles in palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Their reactivity generally mirrors that of the more commonly encountered triflate electrophiles, but nonaflates tend to be less prone to hydrolysis to ketones (in the case of alkenyl sulfonates) and phenols (in the case of aryl sulfonates). Their resistance to hydrolysis makes nonaflates superior electrophiles in Buchwald-Hartwig couplings, where this side reaction can be deleterious to yields of the desired product. The sodium enolates of Œ≤-ketoesters react with 1.15 equivalents of NfF to give the corresponding alkenyl nonaflates in high yield. Ethyl 2-methylacetoacetate (R=R'=Me) gives the geometrically pure E isomer by this method. center Simple aldehydes and ketones react with NfF in the presence of bases such as DBU or phosphazenes to give alkenyl nonaflates in high yields without formation of a discrete enolate. Use of the P2 phosphazene base at -30 to -20 ¬∞C gives the less substituted alkenyl nonaflate with unsymmetrically substituted ketones. Similar reactions with triflic anhydride generally require the use of the expensive 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine to achieve high yields. The reaction of enolates with NfF depends strongly both on the structure of the enolate and its metal counterion. The lithium enolates of methyl ketones give mixtures of products derived from electrophilic attack on the O (expected) or C (unexpected) atoms of the enolate. This effect is particularly evident with the lithium enolate of pinacolone, which gives a 2:1 mixture favoring C-attack. More substituted lithium enolates give only products of O sulfonylation in variable yields. center Trimethylsilyl enol ethers react with NfF in the presence of a substoichiometric fluoride source at 0 ¬∞C to ambient temperature to give alkenyl nonaflates in moderate to good yields. Dried Bu4F was the preferred fluoride source in one study, but CsF has been used in difficult cases with excellent results. center Aryl nonaflates can be prepared straightforwardly from phenols and NfF in the presence of bases such as potassium carbonate and Et3N in near quantitative yields. Stronger bases such as NaH and BuLi can also be used, but they tend to give somewhat lower yields. Reaction with alcohols The reaction of NfF with alcohols highlights the lability of alkyl nonaflates ‚Äì in most cases, the final product of the reaction is either an alkyl fluoride (from F‚àí attack on the intermediate alkyl nonaflate) or an olefin (from elimination of NfOH from the intermediate nonaflate). Synthesis of bis-nonafluorobutanesulfonimide (Nf2NH) NfF reacts with ammonium chloride in the presence of triethylamine in acetonitrile to give the triethylammonium salt of the superacidic bis- nonafluorobutanesulfonimide in 97% yield. The corresponding potassium salt is obtained by treatment of a methanolic solution of the triethylammonium salt with KOH. The acid is obtained by ion exchange chromatography of the triethylammonium salt with Amberlite IR-100 as the stationary phase and methanol as the eluent. The actual species produced in the latter procedure is likely MeOH2+ Nf2N‚àí.

Having studied with Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e and Jean-Baptiste Greuze, she adopted a style of soft brush strokes and made paintings of sentimental scenes like that of her instructors. Greuze, for instance, his daughters said that \\"he painted virtue, friendship and innocence, and his soul breathes through his pictures\\" although more objective opinions were that he painted wounded and vulnerable subjects.Germaine Greer. The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work. Tauris Parke Paperbacks; 2 June 2001. . p. 36. Following the French Revolution's Reign of Terror, society settled into a calmer lifestyle in which miniature and portrait paintings became popular. Mayer painted portraits of women and children, family scenes, self-portraits and miniatures of her father. She attained a degree of success, exhibited Self-Portrait of Citizenness Mayer Pointing to a Sketch for a Portrait of Her Mother, and exhibited at every salon thereafter. At the 1801 salon she exhibited Self-Portrait with Artist's Father: He Points to a Bust of Raphael, Inviting Her to Take This Celebrated Painter as a Model. Sensitive to the viewpoint of women artists, Mayer had her work presented as the student of Greuze and Suvee so that they would be more acceptable to the public. She worked in Jacques-Louis David's studio in 1801 and adopted a direct and simple style under his tutelage, but still depicted sentimental scenes. She studied with Pierre-Paul Prud'hon beginning in 1802,Stranahan, C.H., \\"A History of French Painting: An account of the French Academy of Painting, its salons, schools of instructions and regulations\\", Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, New York, 1896 but they did not have the typical pupil-master relationship. In many ways there were more like peers. They had both exhibited at the salon and unlike Prud'hon, she had received a better education in art, and he was known for his talent in drawing, particularly complex historic compositions.

Controversy As was often the case with women artists who were associated with better known male artists, there were claims made that she did not produce all the work attributed to her and because of her long relationship with Prud'hon, it is still not well understood exactly what he did and what she did. This confusion is in large part due to the fact that the two artists collaborated on several works: he sketched the design and she made the paintings. Many were exhibited under her name, but when the works became part of public collections they were attributed to Prud'hon.

It may also be referred to as hobby beekeeping or backyard beekeeping. Bees from city apiaries are said to be \\"healthier and more productive than their country cousins\\". Their presence also provides cities with environmental and economic benefits. History Most cities in North America at one time prohibited the keeping of bees, but in recent years beekeepers have had success in overturning bee bans. Many urban areas now regulate beekeeping, and while registering beehives is often mandatory, a high proportion of urban beekeepers fail to inform the city. The popularity of urban beekeeping was growing rapidly c. 2012 perhaps due to its inclusion in the local food movement. Between 1999 and 2012, London saw a 220% increase in beekeepers.This statement is supported by multiple sources: *For 1,000 London beekeepers in 1999, see *For 3,200 London beekeepers in 2012, see Challenges and Concerns One problem created by a surfeit of bees is swarming. * As cities have limited greenspaces, the increasing popularity of the hobby may lead to lower honey yields as has been reported in London and New York City. According to a 2015 research study, urban environments favor viability and transmission of some disease agents that affect honey bees and may be a contributing factor to their diseases. Urban beekeeping cities Some cities have active beekeeping communities, while others offer plentiful green space but harbor few apiaries. = North America = Bees producing honey in a hive.  Detroit  Detroit is not only home to a burgeoning population of native bees, but also hosts several \\"urban farms\\" (not all of which maintain hives), including the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative. the Hantz Farm, D-Town Farm, Recovery Park Farms, and Earthworks Urban Farms. A 2017 newcomer is Detroit Hives, a non-profit dedicated to acquiring vacant lots and setting them up with bee hives, along with community education and outreach. https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/detroits-newest-industrial- workers-bees#.XSqGVMSB1BM.facebook  Chicago  In 2003, Richard M. Daley, then Mayor of Chicago, had two beehives placed atop City Hall. Michael S. Thompson was put in charge of their care. Subsequently, the bee population in the city has grown. In 2013, a ban on beekeeping was defeated in the Chicago suburb of Skokie. The village may regulate backyard beekeeping in the future.  Milwaukee  A Beepod Vented-Top-Bar Hive on the roof of a non- profit, CORE/El Centro, overlooks downtown Milwaukee and serves as an education location to teach new beekeepers. In 2010, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, passed a beekeeping ordinance allowing individuals to practice beekeeping in the urban center of the city. Urban beekeepers take part in Milwaukee's Community Pollinator Initiative. Montreal Montreal's beehives are regulated by the governmental agency MAPQ. This agency enforces a set of regulations surrounding the installation of a beehive in order to protect the health of colonies, but these rules are rarely restrictive enough to deter committed hobbyists. The Westmount Library has a public honeybee hive on its roof featuring live inspections every two weeks during the summer months for kids, parents, and the elderly. As part of their 135th anniversary, Birks Group installed three honeybee hives on the roof of their downtown headquarters in Montreal. In the summer of 2014, the Accueil Bonneau homeless facility launched a pilot project introducing their itinerant community to the art of beekeeping as a means of re-engaging them in a fulfilling and meaningful hobby. Most of the public beekeeping initiatives stem from companies offering beekeeping services that make it more accessible to urban dwellers, such as Alveole, Apiguru, or Miel Montreal. The movement towards generating local produce is part of why beekeeping is becoming increasingly popular in this metropolitan city. New York Until 2010, beekeeping was illegal in New York City, but this had little effect on the many New Yorkers who built and maintained hives. Prior to being recognized by the city, urban beekeeping had become an established hobby, and a support network of organizations, blogs, and supply stores was already in place. When the ban was lifted, only the non-aggressive Apis Mellifera species was allowed to be kept. While registering beehives is required, as of 2012 only half of the 400 bee colonies thought to be situated on New York rooftops had been reported to the city. Western honey bee In New York, there are beehives at InterContinental The Barclay Hotel, the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the York Prep School, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the Bank of America Tower (New York City). Toronto While urban beekeeping is touted as a new trend, hives have been kept discreetly in Toronto for many years. Several beekeepers kept around fifty hives each along the Don River in the beginning of the 20th century, and there was a beekeeping co-op near the Don Valley Brick Works into the late 1950s. Mayor William Dennison kept nineteen colonies in his Jarvis Street backyard during the 1970s. During this time, beekeeping equipment could be bought in the downtown‚Äôs Little Italy / Little Portugal area. As of 2015, Toronto does not have any bylaws governing beekeeping, so the Ontario Bees Act applies. The Act does not address urban beekeeping but contains a 30-meter set back requirement for property lines, and a 10-meter set back requirement for highways; however the rule has gone largely unenforced as few urban lots are spacious enough to meet requirements concerning proximity to property lines, dwellings, and highways. In 2011, there were 107 registered hives in Toronto. Some of the many Toronto landmarks host to honeybee hives include: the Fort York historic site, the rooftop of the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, the University of Toronto, the roof of Amsterdam Brewing Company, and the Fairmont Royal York hotel. Vancouver Often regarded as a green and sustainable city, the City of Vancouver has recognized hobby beekeeping in residential areas by issuing guidelines and requiring hives to be registered. Bees are kept at Vancouver Convention Centre and Vancouver City Hall.  Los Angeles  Los Angeles has a long history of beekeeping. The first two honeybee colonies arrived, by way of the Isthmus, in California in 1853. Imported by Christopher H. Shelton, they were the only survivors of the long trip from New York to San Francisco. Bees were purchased on the docks of San Francisco for $150 then brought south to Los Angeles. The bees arrived in Los Angeles on September 4th, 1854. In April of 1855, the colonies cast out 2 swarms which were sold for another $150. At this time, the honey generated by the bees was sold for $1.50/lbs. Italian bees, considered superior to the German variety, were introduced in January of 1855. By the 1860s, beekeeping was common in Los Angeles with some owning 25 hives. Wild honey was collected in significant quantities throughout the foothills. The honey was sent to San Francisco for sale. A large colony was found in the San Fernando Valley, some estimate it contained 8 to 10 tons of honey: \\"The hive is located in a rift which penetrates the rock to a depth of probably one hundred and sixty feet. The orifice is thirty feet long and seventeen feet wide with four passages. This rift was discovered to be the abiding place of a swarm of bees that is seen to come out in a nearly solid column, one foot in diameter. Certain parties have endeavored to descend to the immense store of honey collected by the bees, but were invariably driven back, and one man lost his life in the effort.\\" (ibid.) In 1873, the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association was founded. In 1879, Los Angeles lawmakers banned beekeeping within city limits based on the false belief that honeybees damaged the citrus crop (one of the largest industries in the Los Angeles area). By 1917, there were calls to repeal the \\"ancient ordinance,\\" many were illegally keeping hives anyway, however lawmakers did not act. It wasn't until 2015 that the 136 year old ordinance was repealed by the city council. = Europe = London Beekeeping in London has become increasingly popular. The number of beekeepers rose 220% between 1999 and 2012 with other figures showing a 200% increase between 2008 and 2013. As of 2012, an estimated 3,200 apiaries exist in London, and while registration is mandatory, 75% are thought to operate without license. The density of hives in London is much greater than in other areas of the UK, and this has led to concerns that city greenspace may not provide sufficient forage to sustain burgeoning bee populations. The UK government has aided the rise of keeping bees in cities by releasing a plastic beehive purpose-built for urban beekeeping. Called Beehaus, it is supported by quango Natural England. Organizations supporting best practices for urban beekeeping in London include The London Beekeeper's Association, which holds monthly meetings, provides mentoring to new beekeepers, and lends out beekeeping supplies. In London, bees are kept at department store Fortnum & Mason, Lambeth Palace, Buckingham Palace,https://www.gardenista.com/posts/the- bees-of-buckingham-palace/ the London Stock Exchange, the Natural History Museum, the Tate Modern, and at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, etc. Hives once stood atop the Bank of England as well.  Istanbul  Urban beekeeping is a growing hobby and industry in Istanbul and beehives can be found from city parks to high rise buildings' terraces. Beekeeping in the city, especially at its outer districts, is supported by the municipal government, ƒ∞BB. Hotels like The Ritz-Carlton in Istanbul also reportedly have urban beehives for their restaurant's honey needs. Urban beekeeping has been described as difficult hobby in ƒ∞stanbul, which has fewer green spaces compared to other cities in Turkey. Unregistered beehives can be spotted in some parks in downtown districts of ƒ∞stanbul. Hasan Efe from the Apiculture Research Institute stated that beekeeping in ƒ∞stanbul's city center could harm the insects‚Äô physiology, adding that gas from vehicles and environmental conditions can contaminate urban honey with heavy metals. Yet these claims were challenged as some research centers did not find significantly elevated levels of heavy metals in urban honey samples. Local and international conferences and seminars about urban beekeeping are being held in the city. ƒ∞stanbul has also hosted the 45th edition of Apimondia from October 29 through November 4, 2017. = Africa =  Johannesburg  Johannesburg has over 6 million trees. This environment is highly beneficial for urban beekeepers, who often have higher honey yields per hive than other Highveld beekeepers. In South Africa, anyone who handles bees must be registered as a beekeeper with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. =Other cities= Urban beekeeping exists in many major cities and has been reported in: Berlin, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Sydney, and Tokyo, amongst others.

A gamergate ( ) is a mated worker ant that can reproduce sexually, i.e., lay fertilized eggs that will develop as females. Gamergates are restricted to taxa where the workers have a functional sperm reservoir ('spermatheca'). In various species, gamergates reproduce in addition to winged queens (usually upon the death of the original foundress), while in other species the queen caste has been completely replaced by gamergates. In gamergate species, all workers in a colony have similar reproductive potentials, but as a result of physical interactions, a dominance hierarchy is formed and only one or a few top-ranking workers can mate (usually with foreign males) and produce eggs. Subsequently however, aggression is no longer needed as gamergates secrete chemical signals that inform the other workers of their reproductive status in the colony. Depending on the species, there can be one gamergate per colony (monogyny) or several gamergates (polygyny). Most gamergate species have colonies with a few hundred or fewer workers. Etymology \\"Gamergate\\" derives from the Greek words (g√°mos) and (erg√°tƒìs) and means \\"married worker\\". It was coined in 1983 by geneticist William Louis Brown and was first used in scientific literature by entomologists Christian Peeters and Robin Crewe in a 1984 paper published in Naturwissenschaften. The definition typically found in entomological dictionaries is \\"mated, egg-laying worker\\", and is drawn from the glossary of Bert H√∂lldobler and E. O. Wilson's 1990 book, The Ants. Description There are 100‚Äì200 different species in which gamergates reproduce (roughly 1% of all ants), most of which fall within the poneromorph subfamilies. Whereas workers (which are all females) in most ant species are morphologically incapable of storing sperm, in gamergate species one or several workers mate and have active ovaries. Gamergate lifespan is short compared to queens in queenright colonies, but gamergates can be replaced by other dominant workers in the colony without risking colony survival. Reproductive investment in gamergate females is thus optimized because non-differentiated gamergates (i.e. reproductively inactive workers) function as laborers. =Caste structure= Dorsal view of a nonreproductive female Diacamma australe worker, lacking anterior thoracic gemmae (buds). Within gamergate colonies, all workers are born reproductively viable and are thus potential gamergates. Prior to differentiation as a gamergate, a dominant worker must physically inhibit its sisters. For example, in the case of Diacamma australe, the first female to become reproductively active will clip off the thoracic gemmae of her sisters, thus greatly reducing their sexual attractiveness. In other genera, persistent domination of worker females by gamergates via physical aggression all but ensure that they will not produce male offspring. In Diacamma nilgiri, gamergates use dominance interactions to monopolize reproduction without mutilation of sister workers. The same is true for Streblognathus peetersi, which engage in non-injurious aggression to determine dominance. For most gamergate species, the start of ovarian activity eliminates the need to physically dominate nestmate workers. Instead newly produced pheromones or signaling chemicals ensure that workers remain nonreproductive. Although it is unknown to what degree these chemicals act as pheromones or as signals, support for the signaling hypothesis can be found in the loss of reproductive inhibition of workers as the gamergate grows older and her fecundity diminishes. Mechanisms of gamergate replacement vary among monogynous and polygynous species. When a gamergate dies, it is usually replaced by a formerly submissive worker who proceeds to mate and begins ovarian activity. A new gamergate often originates from a younger cohort. For example, when the original founding queen dies in a Harpegnathos saltator colony, younger workers begin to fight for dominance and some become the next reproductives. Because reproductively inactive workers are able to activate their ovaries after the death of the gamergate, some gamergate species can be considered cooperative breeders rather than truly eusocial insects. In colonies with both queens and gamergates, the latter function as secondary reproductives. Research on Amblyoponinae species has shown that there is a fecundity-based hierarchy among gamergates. In Stigmatomma reclinatum, it was found that higher-ranked gamergates had more fully developed oocytes than low-ranked gamergates. In Streblognathus peetersi, only the alpha worker mates and becomes the gamergate; younger workers await a chance to reproduce when the current gamergate exhibits decreased fecundity or dies. Challenges to gamergates from subordinate workers are risky because the gamergate in species like Dinoponera quadriceps may mark the challenger by rubbing special chemicals produced only by the gamergate. These chemicals signal to other workers to immobilize the challenger by biting her appendages and immobilizing her for a few days until her hormonal levels return to normal. Subordinate workers play an important policing role in the selection of future gamergates and are thus able to increase their indirect fitness. =Social structure variation and ecology= There is much variation in the social structure of ant colonies with gamergates. Some species such as Harpegnathos saltator, Pseudoneoponera tridentata, Gnamptogenys menadensis, and Rhytidoponera confusa have a winged alate queen caste as well as gamergates. Queenless species with only gamergates and workers may have a monogynous structure with a single gamergate or they may have a polygynous structure with multiple gamergates. Examples of monogynous queenless species include Pachycondyla krugeri, P. sublaevis, Diacamma australe, D. rugosum, Dinoponera quadriceps, Platythyrea lamellosa, and Streblognathus aethiopicus. Examples of polygynous queenless species include Ophthalmopone berthoudi, O. hottentota, and all known queenless species of Rhytidoponera. In the queenless Ophthalmopone berthoudi, foreign males visit underground nests to mate with young workers. Ecologically, gamergate species from different tribes and genera often tend to share certain characteristics. Many gamergate species are solitary generalist foragers living in arid environments. Similar to species with ergatoid queens, the evolution of gamergate reproduction is hypothesized to be associated with a shift to colonial fission. Myrmecologists Christian Peeters and Fuminori Ito have also suggested that \\"the evolution of gamergate reproduction appears strongly associated with the adaptive benefits of secondary polygyny (e.g. increased colony lifespan and resource inheritance), and it is the preferred option in species having workers able to store sperm.\\" Classification dispute The utility of \\"gamergate\\" as a morphological designation is not without critics. Within the field of myrmecology it is a matter of dispute whether caste should be defined primarily by reproductive role or by physical morphology. Notably, Alfred Buschinger has argued that the term \\"worker\\" should be applied only to those ants who make up the non-reproductive caste and \\"queen\\" should be applied only to reproductively viable female ants regardless of their physical appearance. H√∂lldobler and Wilson suggest that the two positions can be semantically resolved and that the most fruitful approach would be to keep classification \\"somewhat loose, incorporating either anatomy or roles in a manner that maximizes convenience, precision, and clarity of expression.\\" Genera with gamergates This list may be incomplete and may require expansion: *Poneromorph subfamilies **Amblyoponinae ***StigmatommaThroughout Ito's 1993 paper for the Journal of Natural History, he refers not to Stigmatomma but to Amblyopone.

The building most recently served as a public library and administration building. , the Altes Stadthaus is being renovated and extended as a \\"House of Learning\\" (), which will accommodate the community college and the library. Location and architecture German Bestelmeyer designed the building to make an impressive entry point to the city on the north side. It was erected on a bastion that remained from the former city walls, opposite the University of Bonn, which occupies the former residential palace of the prince-elector of Cologne on the site of the south bastion.Klein, Heijo, Leserbrief (letter to the editor) , 22 November 2006, at Bottlerplatz-Bonn; \\"Ein ideales 'Haus der B√ºrger'. General-Anzeiger Bonn, 5 December 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2012. A curved section adjoins Windeckstra√üe on the south side and defines the remaining bastion as a garden space. Along with the \\"Old Toll-House\\", this bastion is one of the few parts of the old fortifications accessible to the public. In the 1980s, a new access route was created from the Florentiusgraben, and the courtyard was landscaped and trees planted. In the late 1990s part of this small park was turned into a playground. The Altes Stadthaus is arranged around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces M√ºhlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance is at the southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstra√üe, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of M√ºlheimer Platz and M√ºnsterstra√üe, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus‚Äîthe new city administration building‚Äîwas built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing M√ºhlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In the course of this restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns. The east wing of the building was demolished to make way for a C&A; department store. History After World War II, the Bundesministerium f√ºr gesamtdeutsche Fragen was housed in the Altes Stadthaus between 1949 and 1957, primarily in the now demolished section of the building. In the summer of 2006, the mayor and the speaker of the Social Democratic Party of Germany group in the city council announced plans to sell the Altes Stadthaus, relocating the library, the community college, and the city museum to a new building in Quantiusstra√üe, near the station. The Stadthaus was to be used as retail space. =House of Learning= The announcement to sell the building sparked a fierce public debate. The Green Party, at the time in a coalition with the SPD, strongly disagreed with the plan. The Christian Democratic Union party held a meeting in October 2006. The director of the Bonn Women's Museum, Marianne Pitzen, accused the initiators of the plan of selling off public property and underestimating the value of cultural heritage.Pitzen, Marianne, \\"Rote Karte f√ºr Banausen\\", General-Anzeiger, 30 November 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2012. At the end of October 2006, a citizens' group was formed to promote the creation of a \\"House of Learning\\" () at Bottlerplatz.

Retrieved 18 September 2012. At its session of 23 November 2006, the planning committee of the city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600 m¬≤. This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.betr.

On 31 January 2007, the city council voted to accept this plan, with Greens, Citizens' Coalition, CDU and SPD members voting for it. The cost of the necessary remodelling and renovations is expected to exceed ‚Ç¨19 million. An architectural contest concluded in October 2008; the entry of the Alexander Koblitz architecture firm of Berlin was chosen.

It is a re-creation of the traditional Cape Horse or old-type Boer Horse, which is now extinct.  History  The origins of the Cape Horse go back to horses imported to southern Africa from Java in 1653. Between 1770 and 1790 there was some cross- breeding with Thoroughbreds. Many Cape Horses were exported to India in the nineteenth century. The first horses to be imported into Australia were of this breed, which thus contributed to the evolution of the Australian Waler. The Basuto pony and Namaqua Pony also derive from it. During the Boer Wars between 1880 and 1902, many old-type Boer horses were killed: some died in the fighting, while others were shot on Boer farms. By the end of the wars, numbers were greatly reduced and conservation efforts began. From 1905 until about 1920 the horses could be registered with the horse-breeders' association of Transvaal. A breeders' association, the Kaapse Boerperd Breeders' Society of South Africa, was formed in 1948. A separate association, the Boerperd Society of South Africa, formed in 1973. It became the Historiese Boerperd Breeders Society in 1977, and SA Boerperd in 1998. The Historiese Boerperd was officially recognised by the Department of Agriculture in 1996.

Monomoy Regional High School serves approximately 625 students in grades 8-12 from the towns of Chatham and Harwich. Construction of the high school was completed in early 2014 and officially opened in September 2014. The school's mascot is the Sharks and the school colors are Navy Blue & Silver. Athletics All the athletic teams from Harwich High School and Chatham High School began competing cooperatively as the Monomoy Sharks in Fall 2012 for all sports offered by both schools. Monomoy offers 20 interscholastic athletic teams along with multiple club and intramural teams. As of 2016, Monomoy is a member of the Cape & Islands League, which competes in the Division 4 level of athletic competition in Massachusetts, and is affiliated with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. In May 2015, Monomoy Regional High School gained approval from the South Shore League at the annual league meeting to leave the league and join the Cape & Islands League, citing travel expenses and competition as the main factors regarding their departure. Monomoy was a member of the South Shore League since the mid-1990s. The change will take effect during the beginning of the 2016‚Äì17 academic year. The football team's league affiliation is in question due to the change, as the Cape & Islands League does not sponsor football. Ultimately, the Sharks will either continue to compete in the South Shore League as a football only member, or pursue an independent schedule with no league affiliation. With the departure of Monomoy, Mashpee is left as the South Shore League's lone representative from Cape Cod. Recent Success in Sports: The Monomoy High School's Basketball team went from 1-19 in 2015-2016 while competing in the South Shore League to 15-6 after switching into the Cape and Islands League. The team went under a controversial time after the school's administration decided to fire beloved Coach and Harwich High School Alumni Adam Rose. Rose was then hired as a head coach at CCA. Monomoy then hired Coach Keith Arnold a former DY and Nauset boys basketball coach to take over. Part of the team's core of Junior-Meehan and Senior-Mazulis were Nauset Transfers who founded the foundation for Monomoy Basketball success. The team won the Cape and Islands Large League Title and also made it to the Division 4 South Sectional Finals as the #9 seed after beating Sturgis East, Southeastern, and Old Colony in the MIAA tournament. Later on the team would lose to D4 powerhouse Cathedral Catholic. Players Nick Meehan, Chris Mazulis, Sam Reed and Eli Nickerson were vital to this team's cinderella run in the MIAA tournament.

As prior of Galway, in 1626-27 he was signatory with his fellow Dominicans, Peter Martin (STP), Stephen Lynch (Franciscan), Dominic Lynch, and Richard Bermingham, of an agreement ratifying the establishment and status of Dominican schools in the town. He succeeded Ross MacGeoghegan as Irish provincial in June 1627. Later that year he applied to Propaganda Fide for special faculties for administration in the province. In February 1629 he presided over a provincial chapter held at Athenry, after which he left for Rome to represent the Irish province at the general chapter held in June. During the chapter, he and Michael O'Connor (Michael of the Holy Spirit) were named Masters of Theology, with Richard Caron honoured with the degree sacrae theologiae praesentatus. Lynch departed Rome for Louvain, arriving there in September, en route for Ireland. He was in Brussels on 8 March 1630 where he received 100 crowns from Philip IV of Spain, as he and his two companions were straited after their journey from Rome. That same year he had his term of office extended to 1632 by Pope Urban VIII. Hugh O'Donnell, 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell nominated him for the see of Achonry, However Lynch never returned to Ireland, due to a new era of persecution. As a result of this he travelled to Lisbon - arriving in January 1632 - en route to Seville, where a never-held chapter was to be held. A further extension of his office was made while he resided in Portugal and Spain, during which he petitioned Philip IV for help to restore the Dominican province in Ireland, and presided over a chapter of the Portuguese province. He left Portugal for Rome, where on 1 March 1634 he was named prior of San Sisto Vecchio. He was nominated that year for Killala or Achonry by Nicholas Ridolfi. Lynch died in July 1634, and was buried in what was then the principal church of the Dominicans, Santa Maria sopra Minerva. √ì Floinn summed up Lynch as follows: > \\"Nicholas Lynch was representative of a new breed of confident, energetic, > and highly confident, energetic, and highly competent Irish Dominicans in > the seventeenth century, springing from the renaissance of reformed > Dominican life in continental Europe. He was an internationalist, thanks, in > part, to the cosmopolitan world of his family and his order, and was as much > at home in Lisbon, Salamanca, Rome, and Louvain as in Galway and Sligo.\\" References Sources * The Irish Dominicans, 1536-1641, Thomas S.

More recently he has become interested in issues in the philosophy of time, and in the understanding of human freedom. In the history of philosophy, he has worked mostly on Wittgenstein and Leibniz. He lives in Hamden, CT, and works as a private tutor in philosophy (jonathanwestphal.wordpress.com)What I do Westphal received his B.A. from Harvard College in 1973, an M.A. from the University of Sussex in 1975, and the Ph.D. from the University of London 1981, where he studied with David Wiggins. He has taught at the University of Hawaii, the University of London, Idaho State University, Amherst College, Hampshire College and at other colleges and universities in the U.K. and the U.S. He has been an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, at the University of Munich; he is a Fellow of Berkeley College (Yale University), and a Permanent Member of the Senior Common Room at University College, Oxford.Jonathan Westphal at Hampshire College Published works Among Westphal's one hundred or so publications are: * 1987 Colour: Some Philosophical Problems from Wittgenstein. * 1991 Colour: a Philosophical Introduction, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991, 2nd ed) . In this work as in its 1987 predecessor Westphal subjects some of the statements in Wittgenstein's Remarks on Colour (\\"the puzzle propositions\\") to a detailed examination drawing on philosophy, phenomenology, psychology and physics. Rejecting Wittgenstein's grammatical explanation of colours, as well as the physicalists' reduction of colours to light emissions of specific wavelengths, Westphal argues that the puzzle propositions are analytic and that the relevant definitions are to be given in terms of phenomenalistically interpreted absorption spectra. According to WorldCat, the book is in 224 libraries * 1998 Philosophical Propositions: An Introduction to Philosophy (London: Routledge, 1998). 169 pp. . According to WorldCat, the book is held in 1206 libraries WorldCat author listing In this work Westphal presents an introduction to key philosophical problems in chapters titled: The Nature of a Philosophical Problem; Basic Concepts of Logic and Philosophy; the Problem of Evil; the Existence of God; Reality; Certainty; Time; Personal Identity; the Mind-Body Problem; Freewill and Determinism; the Meaning of Life?http://philpapers.org/rec/WESPPA * 2005 \\"Conflicting Appearances, Necessity and the Irreducibility of Propositions About Colours\\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 105 (2):219-235. Reviewing the argument from 'conflicting appearances' for the view that nothing has any one colour, Westphal takes further a well-known criticism of the argument made by Austin and Burnyeat. He aIso undertakes the task of positive construction, offering a theory of what it is that all things coloured a particular colour have in common, and he argues that the resulting \\"color phenomenalism\\", rather than physicalism, is required to give a satisfactory account of the necessity of Wittgenstein's 'puzzle propositions' about colour.http://philpapers.org/s/Jonathan%20Westphal * (15 pages). Propositional variables p, q, etc., are the unit vectors in a vector space, and various logical relations are represented, e.g. duality is the sliding of a vector through the origin, which produces De Morgan's Theorems. * 2006 \\"The Future and the Truth-Value Links: A Common Sense View\\", Analysis 66 (289):1‚Äì9. This article is about the ancient problem of the truth of propositions about the future, or future contingents. Westphal argues that propositions about the future are true not because anything is now the case but because something will be the case. The problem is a confusion about tenses. * 2008 \\"\\"My Body\\", \\"my X\\" and \\"I\\"\\" American Philosophical Quarterly, 45 (3):187-197. Sometimes 'My body is F follows from 'I am F, for example when F is \\"hot\\", but sometimes not, for example when F is \\"rich\\". Westphal offers a theory of the logical relations between \\"mind\\", \\"body\\", and \\"I\\" which gives a complete symmetry between mind and body. * 2011 \\"Silhouettes Are Shadows\\", Acta Analytica 26 2:187-197. Here a solution is proposed to Sorensen‚Äôs problem about the eclipse of Near and Far. Since a silhouette is a shadow, what is seen is the silhouette or shadow of Far, into which Near has disappeared, as a smaller object might. Shadows are seen because the surface in shadow fails to reflect light. *The Mind-Body Problem, (Cambridge MA: MIT Press, 2016) argues for a neutral monist solution to the mind-body problem, and claims that in the past neutral monists have paid almost no attention to the causal relations between mind and body.

Ploughing (above), fertilizer, pesticide application and harvesting routinely involve children with their families.Child labour in Africa is generally defined based on two factors: type of work and minimum appropriate age of the work. If a child is involved in an activity that is harmful to his/her physical and mental development, he/she is generally considered as a child labourer. That is, Any work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children, and interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work. Appropriate minimum age for each work depends on the effects of the work on the physical health and mental development of children. ILO Convention No. 138 suggests the following minimum age for admission to employment under which, if a child works, he/she is considered as a child laborer: 18 years old for hazardous works (Any work that jeopardizes children‚Äôs physical, mental or moral health), and 13‚Äì15 years old for light works (any work that does not threaten children's health and safety, or prevent them from schooling or vocational orientation and training), although 12‚Äì14 years old may be permitted for light works under strict conditions in very poor countries. Another definition proposed by ILO‚Äôs Statistical Information and Monitoring Program on Child Labor (SIMPOC) defines a child as a child labourer if he/she is involved in an economic activity, and is under 12 years old and works one or more hours per week, or is 14 years old or under and works at least 14 hours per week, or is 14 years old or under and works at least one hour per week in activities that are hazardous, or is 17 or under and works in an ‚Äúunconditional worst form of child labor‚Äù (prostitution, children in bondage or forced labor, armed conflict, trafficked children, pornography, and other illicit activities). Africa has the world's highest incidence rates of child labour. A report by the United Nations' International Labour Organization reveals that in 2016 nearly 1 out of every 5 children partakes in child labor. The problem is severe in sub-saharan Africa where more than 40% of all children aged 5‚Äì14 labour for survival, or about 48 million children. Although poverty is generally considered as the primary cause of child labour in Africa, recent studies show that the relationship between child labour and poverty is not as simple as a downward linear relationship. A study published in 2016 \\"Understanding child labour beyond the standard economic assumption of monetary poverty\\" illustrates that a broad range of factors ‚Äì on the demand- and supply-side and at the micro and macro levels ‚Äì can affect child labour; it argues that structural, geographic, demographic, cultural, seasonal and school-supply factors can also simultaneously influence whether children work or not, questioning thereby the common assumption that monetary poverty is always the most important cause. In another study, Oryoie, Alwang, and Tideman (2017) show that child labour generally decreases as per capita land holding (as an indicator of a household's wealth in rural areas) increases, but there can be an upward bump in the relationship between child labour and landholding near the middle of the range of land per capita. In addition to poverty, Lack of resources, together with other factors such as credit constraints, income shocks, school quality, and parental attitudes toward education are all associated with child labour. The International Labour Organization estimates that agriculture is the largest employer of child labour in Africa. Vast majority are unpaid family workers. Cultural history Africa has a long history of child labour. Above, colonial Cameroon children weaving in 1919. Children in Africa have worked in farms and at home over a long history. This is not unique to Africa; large number of children have worked in agriculture and domestic situations in America, Europe and every other human society, throughout history, prior to 1950s. Scholars suggest that this work, specially in rural areas, was a form of schooling and vocational education, where children learned the arts and skills from their parents, and as adults continued to work in the same hereditary occupation. Bass claims this is particularly true in the African context. Africa is a highly diverse and culturally continent. In parts of this continent, farming societies adhere to a system of patrilineal lineages and clans. The young train with the adults. The family and kinsfolk provide a cultural routine that help children learn useful practical skills and enables these societies to provide for itself in the next generation. Historically, there were no formal schools, instead, children were informally schooled by working informally with their family and kin from a very early age. Child labor in Africa, as in other parts of the world, was also viewed as a way to instill a sense of responsibility and a way of life in children particularly in rural, subsistence agricultural communities. In rural Pare people of northern Tanzania, for example, five-year-olds would assist adults in tending crops, nine-year-olds help carry fodder for animals and responsibilities scaled with age. Berber shepherd girl in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. In northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Islam is a major influence. Begging and child labour was considered as a service in exchange for quranic education, and in some cases continues to this day. These children aged 7‚Äì13, for example, were called almudos in Gambia, or talib√©s in Senegal. The parents placed their children with marabout or serin, a cleric or quranic teacher. Here, they would split their time between begging and studying the Quran. This practice fit with one of the five pillars of Islam, the responsibility to engage in zakat, or almsgiving. The growth of colonial rule in Africa, from 1650 to 1950, by powers such as Britain, France, Belgium, Germany and Netherlands encouraged and continued the practice of child labour. Colonial administrators preferred Africa's traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Children in these colonies between the ages of 5-14 were hired as apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. Colonial British laws, for example, offered the native people ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labor of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins. A boy shoeshiner in Gondar, Ethiopia. Child labour was also encouraged by new tax laws. British and French colonial empires introduced new taxes to help pay for the local colonial government expenses. One of these, called the Head Tax, imposed a tax payable by every person, in some cases as young as 8 year old. Regional populations rebelled against such taxes, hid their children, and in most part had to ensure their children were involved in economic activity to pay such taxes and pay their living expenses. Christian mission schools in Africa stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not secular education. In late colonial period, colonial governments attempted to run schools and educate children in parts of Africa. These effort were generally unsuccessful both in terms of enrollment and impact. Few children enrolled. Even when children enrolled, it did not necessarily mean regular attendance. Chronic absenteeism, or children dropped out of the schools to instead ‚Äúgo to sea with the fishermen.‚Äù Jack Lord claims in his reviews of scholarly papers of African colonial history, that late colonial era experience suggests children and families made decisions based on complex combination of economic factors such as household income, state of the family, and cultural factors that considered working with families as a form of education and a form of developing social and human capital. Contemporary child labour Child labour is common in informal mining industry of Africa. Above, children engaged in diamond mining in Sierra Leone. Agriculture alone employs more than 30% of all African children aged 10‚Äì14. Informal economy such as small scale artisanal mines is another significant employer of child labour. =Burkina Faso= According to Burkina Faso‚Äôs United States Department of Labor in 2012, 37.8% of children in Burkina Faso, between the ages of 5‚Äì14 years, were working in granite quarries and gold mines. These children have worked 6 to 7 days a week for up to 14 hours per day. Payment is in the form of food to eat and a place to sleep. Since that time, the Government has adopted a National Action Plan, and in collaboration with Interpol, have since have rescued many children from child trafficking. Christian Children's Fund of Canada (CCFC) has partnered with EDUCO, a fellow member of the ChildFund Alliance, to implement a European Union-funded project in north Burkina to prevent children from working in mines. =Congo= In 2008, Bloomberg claimed child labour in copper and cobalt mines of Congo that supplied Chinese companies. The children dig the ore by hand, carry sacks of ores on their backs, and these are then purchased by these companies. Over 60 of Katanga's 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region's minerals go to China. An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15, or about 40% of all miners, were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region. BBC, in 2012, accused Glencore of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of Africa. Glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour. Glencore claimed being aware of child miners who it claimed were part of a group of artisanal miners. They had without authorisation raided Glencore's concession since 2010, and the company claimed it has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from its concession. About 4.7 million children aged 5‚Äì14 work in Congo. In addition to copper mines, children with their families participate in artisanal mining of cobalt, wolframite, cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, diamonds. Many of these use hammers to break free the ore, pour harsh chemicals with no protective equipment, and manually transport rocks from deep pit or open pit mines. Children also work in agriculture and continue to be recruited as child soldiers for Congolese National Army and various rebel groups. Child labour is commonly visible on the streets of Kinshasa region. =Ghana= The 2010 United States Department of Labor estimated over 2.7 million child laborers in Ghana, or about 43% of all children aged 5‚Äì14. 78.7% of these children work in agriculture, 17.6% in fishing and transportation services, and 3.7% in industry, which includes manufacturing work and mining. In Ghana 64% of children seek work for financial reasons, making it the leading driver for child labor in the region. Most children working in rural areas are working on family farms and often combine schooling with their work. In Urban areas, such as Accra and Ashanti children are often not enrolled in school and are often engaged in artisanal fishing and domestic services. Child porters, locally called kayaye, work in urban areas and some of them are as young as 6 years. A young 'kayaye' girl engaged in selling palmwineGhana. Agriculture, fishing and artisan mining were the largest employers. In southern Volta region, children work in religious servitude for a period ranging between few months to three years. They are known as trokosi (literally: wife of a god), fiashidi , or vudusi. This practice requires young girls to work and serve the religious order, in order to atone for family members‚Äô alleged sins or as an offering for the family's good fortune. This practice is claimed to be also present in neighboring countries, even though it has been outlawed and imposes prison term under the laws of Ghana and neighboring countries. In 2013, statistics on children's work have not changed much and according to the DOL's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Ghana, the majority of working children engage in hazardous activities like pesticide spraying in the production of cocoa, fishing and gold mining. The Department's 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor includes fish and tilapia in particular, cocoa and gold as goods produced in such working conditions in Ghana. =Kenya= Maasai herder in Kenya. Suda, in 2001, estimated that Kenya had 3 million children working in intolerable conditions and who were visible. The number of invisible child workers, claims Suda, were much larger. The visible child labour in Kenya were engaged in agriculture, tourism industry, quarries and mines, pastoral labour, mining, garbage collection, fishing industry, and the transport sector where they move from place to place as \\"Matatu\\" touts. The government of Kenya estimates there are 8.9 million children aged 5‚Äì13 who work, most of whom miss schooling. Agriculture is a major employer; of all labourers employed in coffee plantations, for example, 30% are children younger than age 27. United Nations, in its country profile report for Kenya in 2009, estimated about one third of all children aged 5‚Äì14 were working. Agriculture and fishing were the largest employers, with former accounting for roughly 79% of child labour. The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 32% of all Kenyan children aged 5‚Äì14 work, or over 2.9 million. Agriculture and fishing are the predominant employers. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include sugarcane plantations, pastoral ranches, tea, coffee, miraa (a stimulant plant), rice, sisal, tobacco, tilapia and sardines fishing. Other economic activities of children in Kenya include scavenging dumpsites, collecting and selling scrap materials, glass and metal, street vending, herding and begging. Forced exploitation of children in sex tourism, the report claims, is prevalent in major cities such as Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret and coastal cities of Kenya. Poverty and lack of schooling opportunities are major causes of child labour in Kenya. The country faces shortages of teachers and schools, overcrowding in schools, and procedural complications from children‚Äôs unregistered status. Kenyan law prevents access to schools to a child if he or she is unregistered as a citizen with Kenyan authorities. Currently, 44% of Kenyan children in rural areas remain unregistered. Thus, even when schools may be available, rural children are unable to prove citizenship, and these unregistered children risk losing the opportunity for schooling. =Madagascar= Child labour in Brickaville, a city in Atsinanana region of Madagascar. Children are common in small scale mines of Madagascar. Some children are involved in salt mining, quarry work, gem and gold ore collection. About 58% of children in these mines are younger than age 12. According to IPEC, Child labourers in these mines usually come from families who are in precarious economic situation. According to a United States-based 2010 report, about 22% of Madagascar children aged 5‚Äì14, or over 1.2 million work. Another French based group suggests Madagascar child labour exceeds 2.4 million, with over 540,000 children aged 5‚Äì9 working. About 87% of the child labour is in agriculture, mainly in the production of vanilla, tea, cotton, cocoa, copra (dried meat of coconut), sisal, shrimp harvest and fishing. Malagasy children engaged in domestic service work an average of 12 hours per day. Several internationally funded efforts were involved in Madagascar to help reduce and prevent child labour. However these stopped, after the government change following 2009 coup, because much of the funding from international donors, including the African Union, European Union, World Bank and the United States, was suspended. =Morocco= A 2010 report estimates about 150,000 children aged between 5 and 14 were working in Morocco. Agriculture and domestic services are the predominant employers. Young girls, locally called as petites bonnes (little maids), are sent to work as live in domestic servants, many aged 10 or less. These petites bonnes come from very poor families, face conditions of involuntary servitude, including long hours without breaks, absence of holidays, physical, verbal and sexual abuse, withheld wages and even restrictions on their movement. They are denied education. More visible forms of child labour includes street children in Casablanca, Marrakech, F√®s and M√®knes. These children survive by selling cigarettes, begging, shining shoes, washing cars and working as porters and packers in ports. The Ministry of Planning in Morocco estimates that there are between 60,000 and 100,000 petites bonnes in the country. Studies commissioned by the Morocco government finds poverty and lack of school, often in combination, are primary causes of the little maids phenomenon in Morocco. Additionally, rural parents do not believe that an education or a diploma of any sort can help their girls find a job. =Nigeria= In 2006, there were about 15 million child labourers younger than age 14 in Nigeria. Many of these worked in hazardous conditions and for long hours. Poverty was the main driver of child labour, and the income of these children was a major part of their impoverished families income. Vast majority of child labour in Nigeria worked in agriculture and semi-formal or informal economy. Domestic servants were the least visible form of child labour, and often sexually harassed. Amongst informal economy and public places, street vending employed 64%. Midst informal enterprises in semipublic places, children were often observed as mechanics and bus conductors. About 6 million of Nigeria's children do not go to school at all. In the current conditions, these children do not have the time, energy or resources to go to school. =Rwanda= ILO estimates Rwanda has 400,000 child workers. Of these, 120,000 are thought to be involved in the worst forms of child labour and 60,000 are child domestic workers. = Swaziland = =Tanzania= =Zambia= The government of Zambia estimates there are some 595,000 child workers in the country. Of these, 58% are aged 14 or less. Many are employed in informal mining operations. The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 33% of Zambian children aged 5‚Äì14 work. Agriculture is the dominant employer, and with mining employs 98% of all child labour in Zambia. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include cotton plantations, tobacco, fishing, tea, coffee and charcoal. Child labour is common in mining. However, this is witnessed in small artisanal and traditional mines, where the children extract emeralds, amethyst, aquamarines, tourmalines and garnets. Child labour is also present in mines of lead, zinc and copper ores. They do not wear any protective equipment to protect their eyes or face or body; injuries are common. Child trafficking for purposes of hazardous labour is prevalent in Zambia. Children in agriculture and domestic service are exchanged for money, goods and gifts to family members. Zambia has strict laws against trafficking and child labour. However, implementation and enforcement of its laws has proven to be difficult. According to ILO, child labour in Zambia is a coping strategy for the children and families when adult breadwinners die, fall ill, or when families are simply unable to make ends meet. Dynamics Home-based carpet weaving enterprise in Egypt deploying child labour. International Labor Organization (ILO) stated that first of all, poverty is the greatest single force driving children into the workplace. Another major factor driving children to harmful labor is the lack of schools and poor quality of schooling. =Child labour laws in Africa= Most African nations have ratified worldwide child labour-related conventions. African countries colored in green had national laws, as of 2006, equivalent to ILO Conventions 138 and 182. Additional countries, except South Sudan and Somalia, too have ratified ILO Conventions since then. Most African governments have formally adopted the three International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions. In addition, many have signed a memorandum of understanding with ILO to launch a programme under the International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). Nigeria, for example, is now an active member of IPEC. It is also implementing the West Africa Cocoa Agriculture Project. Nigeria's Child Rights Act is now part of its Labour Act, and it prohibits exploitative labour from children. Some states, like Anambra, have also banned children from working during school hours. South Africa has made it a criminal offence to employ a child under the age of 15, except with a permit from the Department of Labour to employ children in the performing arts. Sections 43 through 47 of its Employment Act also makes it illegal to employ children aged 15 to 18 if the work is inappropriate for their age or something that places them at risk. Kenya passed a Children's Act in 2001. Section 10 of this Act protects children and youth below age 18 from economic exploitation and any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child‚Äôs education, or to be harmful to the childspiritual, moral or social development. The law also forbids hiring anyone less than age of 18 for military or in any armed conflict. Ghana, as another example, forbids child labour. Section 87 of its Children's Act 1998 forbids any person from employing a chiId in exploitative labour, or in any engagement that deprives the child of its health, education or development. Section 88 prohibits anyone from employing any child at night, that is between the hours of eight o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning. The Act's section 89 to 90 allow children above the age of 13 to engage in light work, and those aged over 15 non-hazardous work. In 2018 only three individuals were fined in Ghana for employing children under the legal age and depriving them of their right to education and no employer has served a prison sentence so far, thereby illustrating that law enforcement is limited in Ghana. While substantial legislation is now in place in almost all of Africa, legal enforcement remains a challenge. Due to a lack of government intervention, these child labor rates continue to increase. 14.2% of children additionally work under know hazardous conditions since over three years. A lack of consequences for employers, has resulted in children choosing to remain employed out of fear of violence and/or need to provide for their families forces them to remain employed. =Non-governmental organizations= ILO has a number of projects in Africa that seek to reduce, and ultimately eliminate child labour in Africa. One such project, launched in 2006 is focussed on west African nations of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. This project, started in 2009, aims at worst forms of child labour in west Africa. It has two main components: the first will support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, while the second aims at mobilizing sub-regional policy makers and improving sub-regional cooperation for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour among all fifteen member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). KURET project, which is an acronym for Combating Exploitive Child Labor Through Education in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia Together, is a regional effort to prevent exploitive child labor through education. Funded by the United States Department of Labor and implemented by World Vision, the Academy for Educational Development, and the International Rescue Committee, KURET began in September 2004. The regional office is located in Kampala, Uganda. A report in 2009 claims it made a difference in the lives of thousands of children in this region of Africa. Patriots Ghana is another non-governmental organization which is located in Ghana. The organization's vision is a nation full of empowered patriots contributing to Ghana's development. The organization focuses on achieving development through a variety of local actions. Their mission is to empower Ghanaian citizens to undertake meaningful projects regarding eliminating child trafficking and labor, health, education, human rights, and economic development, to improve the lives of the less privileged Ghanaian citizens. Patriots Ghana therefore aims to achieve their mission through a rights-based approach which is reflected in their activities. The organization emphasizes a need for a rights-based approach due to the consequences of rapid population growth in Ghana, which results from a lack of health care for the poor. Having to supply for a large family has led to long-term financial instability, especially in rural regions. Because of the need to provide for their families, children are often deprived of their right to education and have to work. In order to eliminate a long-term poverty spiral, the organization focuses on actions which empower communities to reestablishing human rights by reducing child labor in Ghana.

In the newborn period (less than 2 months of age), almost all circumcisions are done by generalist physicians using one of three surgical instruments. In the USA, the Gomco clamp is the most utilized instrument, followed by the Mogen clamp and the Plastibell. They are also used worldwide. Complications may also include bleeding, infection, reduction in sensation of the glans penis,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/circumcision-in-men/ and too little or too much tissue removal. Deaths are rare. After the newborn period, circumcision has a higher risk of complications, especially bleeding and anesthetic complications. Currently, most circumcisions in boys and men are performed using one of three open surgical methods. The forceps-guided method, the dorsal slit method, and the sleeve resection method are well described by the World Health Organization in their Manual for Male Circumcision under Local Anaesthesia. The Gomco clamp and Mogen clamp are sometimes used after the newborn period, in conjunction with either sutures or cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive to prevent post-operative bleeding. Circumcision surgical instruments should be distinguished from circumcision devices. Circumcision instruments are used at the time of surgery, and the circumcision is complete at the end of the procedure. The Gomco clamp, the Mogen clamp, and Unicirc are surgical instruments. Circumcision devices remain on the penis for 4 to 7 days and either spontaneously detach or are removed surgically at a subsequent visit. Plastibell, Shang Ring and other plastic rings are all circumcision devices, also known as \\"in situ\\" devices. Circumcision via instrument results in healing by primary intention and healing via devices is by secondary intention, so healing is delayed. All circumcision procedures should involve adequate injectable or topical anesthesia. Circumcision surgical instruments =Gomco clamp= An adult man being circumcised with a Gomco clamp. The Gomco clamp is a surgical instrument used to perform circumcision in all age groups, but is mainly used in newborn circumcision. It is the leading instrument for newborn circumcision in the US. The World Health Organization describes it as having \\"an impeccable safety record.\\" After retracting the foreskin, the Gomco bell is placed over the glans at the level of the corona and the foreskin is replaced into the anatomic (natural) position. The yoke is then placed over the bell, trapping the foreskin between the bell and the yoke. The clamp is tightened, crushing the foreskin between the bell and the base plate, and left in place for 5 minutes. The crushed blood vessels provide hemostasis. The flared bottom of the bell fits tightly against the hole of the base plate, so the foreskin may be cut away with a scalpel from above the base plate with no risk of injuring the glans. Advantages Circumcision is rapid and completed in a single session. The total procedure takes less than ten minutes, five minutes of which is spent in waiting for the crushing action to take place. In newborns (<2 months of age), no sutures are needed and bleeding is uncommon. After the newborn period, either sutures or cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive can be used to seal the fused mucosal-skin edge to prevent post-operative bleeding. Because the glans is protected by the bell of the Gomco clamp, injuries to the glans are rare. No parts are left on the penis, so late complications are rare compared to devices like the Plastibell which remain on the penis. Complications Care must be taken to ensure that the device is properly sterilized between procedures, or transmission of infection may occur. The American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed one study of 1,000 newborn Gomco circumcisions in a hospital setting in Saudi Arabia and rated it \\"fair evidence.\\" The study found an overall complication rate of 1.9%. Bleeding occurred in 0.6% of cases, infection in 0.4%, and insufficient foreskin removed in 0.3%. Because the Gomco clamp is made of three major parts, there is a chance that pieces could be incorrectly assembled from differently-sized units or those produced by different manufacturers. Using mismatched parts results in a device that might not sufficiently crush the foreskin, potentially resulting in bleeding. History The Gomco clamp was invented by Dr. Hiram S. Yellen and Aaron A. Goldstein in 1935. Yellen, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Buffalo, New York sought an improved method of newborn circumcision. Goldstein was a prolific local inventor and manufacturer. Gomco stands for the GOldstein Medical COmpany, the original manufacturer of the instrument. The patent was in the name of Aaron Goldstein (U.S. Patent 119180, issued February 27, 1940). The instrument was a rapid success and was widely marketed and sold in the US and Canada. It is currently manufactured and marketed worldwide. Prevalence Multiple surveys in the USA estimate that the rate of male circumcision ranges from 42% to 80% among various populations. The Gomco clamp is the leading instrument used to perform non-ritual male circumcision in the United States. There is little information concerning prevalence of Gomco use outside of the USA. A 1998 survey found that the Gomco clamp was the preferred technique by 67% of American physicians, whereas Plastibell was used by 19% and the Mogen clamp by 10%. =Mogen clamp= The Mogen clamp is a surgical instrument which permits rapid circumcision. It is most often used in the newborn period, particularly for Jewish ceremonial circumcision (Bris), but is also used in older boys. The newborn version has two flat blades that open 2.5 mm. The Mogen clamp is widely used around the world. The foreskin is first extended using several straight hemostats. The Mogen clamp is then slid over the foreskin. After confirming that the tip of the glans is free of the blades, the clamp is locked, and a scalpel is used to cut the skin from the flat (upper) side of the clamp. In newborns, no sutures are required. Outside of the newborn period, cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive can be used instead of sutures. Advantages The Mogen clamp has no parts to assemble, is easy to use, and results in a bloodless circumcision with minimal scarring. A single size can be used for infants, obviating any sizing errors. It is rapid, but requires five minutes of clamping to prevent post-operative bleeding. Any complications are immediate, because the instrument is not left on the penis, so they can be dealt with on site. The clamp can be safely used by non- physician healthcare workers in resource-limited settingsKankaka EN, Murungi T, Kigozi G, et al. Randomised trial of early infant circumcision performed by clinical officers and registered nurse midwives using the Mogen clamp in Rakai, Uganda. BJU Int. September 2016. doi:10.1111/bju.13589. Complications Care must be taken to ensure that the device is properly sterilized between procedures, or transmission of infection may occur. The instrument does not directly protect the glans during the procedure, so there is a risk that the glans can be pulled into the slit and crushed or partially severed. In July 2010, one company manufacturing Mogen clamps (Mogen Circumcision Instruments of New York) went out of business following a lawsuit in which the doctor entirely removed the head of the penis from the child. The court awarded the plaintiff $10 million in damages. This came following similar lawsuits in 2007 and 2009, which awarded $7.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there are no good studies of complications of the Mogen clamp because complications are rare; thus, one can only rely on available case reports of glans injuries. History The word mogen is derived from the Hebrew word for ‚Äúshield.‚Äù The Mogen clamp was introduced by Dr. Harry Bronstein in 1955. Before the advent of the Mogen clamp, the Jewish shield was used, which has a narrow gap that protected the glans while the foreskin was pulled through and excised. Others modified this shield and began using instruments that produced a crushing action. Still used in many parts of the world, bone cutters are used to shield the glans, crush the foreskin tissue and guide the scalpel for a clean incision. The Mogen clamp is a refinement of these ancient techniques. =Unicirc= Unicirc is a single-use-only, disposable surgical instrument, which permits rapid minimally-invasive circumcision of males from infancy to adulthood. After the foreskin is retracted, Unicirc's transparent bell is placed over the glans at the level of the corona and the foreskin is then replaced into the anatomic (natural) position. The yoke is placed over the bell and the screws are tightened, compressing the foreskin for 5 minutes, which fuses the mucosal and skin surfaces. This allows for bloodless excision of the foreskin. Other than a scalpel, no surgical instruments are needed. The fused skin edges are sealed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. The procedure is completed in 9 minutes with no subsequent visits needed. Advantages Unicirc is a single-use-only instrument with a locking device that prevents reuse, eliminating the possibility of transmission of infection from one person to another. It has a transparent polycarbonate bell, so the glans is protected and can be visualized at all times. Topical anesthetic cream is used instead of injectable anesthetic and the use of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive obviates the need for sutures. It is quick to perform and is completed in a single visit, healing by primary intention is rapid, and cosmetic results are excellent. Unicirc can also be used in males when the foreskin is tight or adherent to the glans (phimosis), after a dorsal slit (similar to that performed in newborns). Frenulectomies can be performed under topical anesthetic immediately prior to Unicirc circumcision. An international group of researchers estimated that compressive instruments (like Unicirc and Gomco) could displace up to 85% of surgical circumcisions. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that compressive instruments were associated with less blood loss, more rapid healing, and less pain compared to other techniques. Complications As a result of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding episodes using Unicirc version 1, the developers made changes to the tightening mechanism. The current version 2 has the same bleeding risk as surgical circumcision. A small proportion of patients experience partial wound separation in the following week, which does not require treatment.  History Unicirc was developed by a team led by Cyril Parker, family physician, and Elisabeth Pillgrab-Parker, project development specialist, in Cape Town, S. Africa. = AccuCirc = Accucirc is a single use plastic infant male circumcision instrument, consisting of two parts, a shielding ring probe and a clamp. The probe is inserted beneath the foreskin, shielding the glands without the need for an incision. The attached clamp is then placed over the probe. The device is designed so the clamp can only be activated if the shield is in position in order to protect the tip of the penis. When the lever is depressed, it crushes the foreskin, which prevents bleeding by sealing blood vessels, while a circular steel blade excises the foreskin.  Advantages  Accucirc is a sterile, disposable instrument. The kit contains all the necessary tools, a shielding ring which protects the tip of the penis from laceration and a clamp that can only be activated when the shield is in position, eliminating the possibility of mismatching parts.  Complications  In a study conducted in Zimbabwe in 2013, moderate or severe adverse events occurred in 7 of 500 (1.4%) circumcisions. This included two cases of excessive removal of skin, two cases of inadequate skin removal, and 2 cases of severe bleeding. In the Botswana study, there were 5 complications in 150 (3.3%) circumcisions: one case of bleeding, one case of infection, and 3 cases of incomplete foreskin removal. These complication rates are similar to the rates using other methods of infant circumcision.  History  The AccuCirc device was invented by Dr. David Tomlinson in 2010. Dr. Tomlinson developed the device with the aid of a team of collaborators at Brown University and Clinical Innovations. = Clinical Trials = *Zimbabwe, 2015 * Gaborone, Botswana 2014 =Other instruments= The Winkelmann clamp is a sterilizable Gomco-like instrument which consists of a single unit, so mismatching of parts cannot occur. Circumcision \\"in situ\\" devices All \\"in situ\\" devices are based upon steel circumcision rings originally patented by Cecil Ross in 1939. Plastibell represents the first commercialization of the Ross device and is the progenitor of all subsequent \\"in situ\\" devices. Such devices consist of a plastic ring which is inserted beneath the foreskin at the level of the corona and has a ligature (or ligature device) which acts as a tourniquet. This necroses the remaining part of the foreskin and the device either detaches spontaneously after 4 to 7 days, or is removed surgically at one week. Initial implementation of \\"in situ\\" devices for HIV prevention has failed to demonstrate potential advantages with regard to efficiency or cost, compared to conventional surgical circumcision. =Plastibell= A baby midway through a Plastibell circumcision A 6 day old Plastibell Circumcision Device on a one- month-old infant. Plastibell' is a single-use disposable plastic device mainly used to circumcise infants which may be used for boys up to 12 years of age. The Plastibell plastic ring is placed under the foreskin and secured with a circumferential ligature, which prevents bleeding when the distal foreskin is excised. The entire procedure takes five to ten minutes. The ring falls off after 4 to 7 days, leaving a circumferential wound that heals by secondary intention in one to two weeks. Advantages Plastibell is a single-use- only disposable device, which prevents reuse and potential transmission of infection. The glans is protected during the procedure by the ring, so there is a reduced risk of injury to the glans, compared to the Mogen clamp. It is a rapid procedure which can be done under clean (rather than sterile) conditions. No bandage is required, allowing for easy monitoring for bleeding or infection. Complications The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that overall complications occur in from 2.4% to 5% of Plastibell procedures. The risk of bleeding is 1%, similar to the risk with the Gomco clamp and Mogen clamp. A significant complication can occur if the glans swells and herniates (protrudes) through the ring. This worsens the swelling and can reduce blood and urine flow, resulting in serious long-term sequelae. Unlike complications occurring with surgical instruments that are dealt with immediately, this complication occurs hours to days after the patient leaves the clinic and must be dealt with promptly to prevent serious complications. Therefore, Plastibell should only be used when follow-up is rapidly available. History The idea of using a tourniquet approach to infant circumcision is attributed to Dr Cecil J. Ross who patented steel circumcision rings in 1939. Subsequently, Dr Kariher patented a plastic ring with a removable handle in 1955. Plastibell comes in a sterile package with a single ligature. =Shang ring= The Shang Ring is a disposable plastic \\"in situ\\" device for male circumcision. It has been studied in China and Africa, and has been approved by WHO for circumcision in males > 13 years of age to prevent HIV. The Shang Ring consists of two concentric medical grade plastic rings: an inner ring with a silicone band and an outer, hinged ring that acts as a ligature. The appropriate size is determined through use of a measuring strip. The inner ring is placed underneath the foreskin. The outer (hinged) ring is placed on the outside of the foreskin and locks against the inner ring when snapped together. The distal foreskin is then excised. The Shang Ring is removed after one week when the outer ring locking mechanism is opened using a special tool. A pair of scissors, specifically designed for this purpose, is then used to remove the inner ring. Advantages Shang Ring is marketed as being simple, disposable, easy to use, and provides sutureless circumcision that may be an acceptable alternative to current surgical techniques. Complications Like other \\"in situ\\" devices, complications may occur up to several days following the placement procedure and must be dealt with promptly to prevent serious sequelae. Shang Ring should only be used where surgical care is rapidly available. In a review by WHO personnel, 0.4% men required rapid intervention with surgical circumcision as the excision had occurred but the foreskin slipped from the device and required suturing. No serious adverse events occurred; 1% experienced moderate adverse events from a total of 1983 successful device placements. All adverse events were managed with minor interventions and resolved without long-term sequelae. Rates were similar to those observed with conventional surgical circumcision. In settings where skilled surgeons are mostly located in urban centers, referral of clients who require surgical management of device-related complications within the recommended time frame of 6‚Äì12 hours may not be possible. Healing is by secondary intention and is therefore delayed compared to techniques which allow for healing by primary intention. There is a risk of HIV transmission if men engage in unprotected sex before the wound is healed. Thus, Shang Ring circumcision requires a longer period of post-circumcision sexual abstinence than surgical or instrumental methods. History The Shang Ring was developed by Jianzhong Shang in 2003. The Shang Ring has been approved by WHO, and is cleared by the U.S. FDA under the 510(k) mechanism with Plastibell as the predicate device. Shang ring is being used in HIV prevention programs in the 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most common. =Other plastic ring devices= \\"Prepex\\" was withdrawn from the market in 2019. Many other plastic ring devices exist, none of which has thus far gained significant market share. \\"Circumplast\\" is a Plastibell-like device which uses a cylinder instead of a ring, which aids in more easily placing the ligature and prevents damage to the glans. \\"Tara Klamp\\", \\"SmartKlamp\\", and \\"Ali's Klamp\\" are all in situ ring devices for boys and men.

He was a specialist steeplechaser who ran twelve times and won seven races under National Hunt rules. After mixed success in Point- to-point, Mr Mulligan rose to prominence by winning five successive races of increasing importance in the 1995/1996 National Hunt season. He became known for his front-running style and occasionally erratic jumping. In the following year he appeared to have lost his form before recording an upset win over a strong field in the 1997 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was retired after being injured in training in 1998. Eighteen months later he died after being injured in a paddock accident. Background Mr Mulligan was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze bred by James Rowley of Clifton Lodge. He was sired by Torus out of the mare Miss Manhattan. When Rowley died in 1991 his bloodstock was sold and the four-year-old gelding was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sales in February 1992 where was sold for 1,700 guineas. Mr Mulligan was later bought privately for ¬£18,000 by Michael Worcester. Mr Mulligan was a huge, awkward-looking horse. Richard Edmondson in The Independent wrote that he was \\"no oil painting, rather something a child might produce on the kitchen table with crayon\\", while the horse's owner described him as \\"a great orange thing\\". Mr Mulligan appeared almost useless in training: according to Noel Chance, who trained him to his greatest success, he was an exceptionally lazy animal who only showed his best in a competitive race. Racing career =Point-to- point racing= Before running under official National Hunt rules, Mr Mulligan competed in Ireland on the amateur Point-to-point circuit. In early 1994, the six-year-old failed to complete the course in his first three attempts. He fell at Punchestown, \\"slipped up\\" at Cashel and unseated his rider in a race at Summerhill. On 8 May he finally showed some promise, winning a three-mile event for maidens at Nenagh in Tipperary by a distance (more than thirty lengths). Mr Mulligan was then sent to England to be trained professionally by Kim Bailey. In November 1994 Mr Mulligan had his first race under rules when he ran in a Novice chase at Newbury Racecourse. He went into a clear lead despite several jumping mistakes, but stumbled and fell at the eleventh fence. Mr Mulligan sustained a serious neck injury in the fall and did not race again for ten months. =1995/1996 season: novice chasing= Mr Mulligan's absence following his failure at Newbury meant that he began the 1995/1996 season as a novice, never having won a race under National Hunt rules. He was now trained by Noel Chance, who had become Worcester's private trainer at the Folly House stable in Lambourn. Mr Mulligan was ridden in five of his six races that season by Richard Johnson. He began in a Novices' hurdle race at Uttoxeter Racecourse in September. He led from the start and pulled away from the field to win by fifteen lengths, despite being eased by Johnson in the closing stages. A month later he won a similar event at Wetherby, leading from the start and coming home thirteen lengths clear of Rye Crossing. In November, Mr Mulligan returned to larger obstacles for a Novice steeplechase at Bangor-on- Dee Racecourse. He was so far clear of the opposition at the finish, that his rider, Mark Dwyer, was able to walk the horse over the line and still win by more than thirty lengths. In January, Mr Mulligan was promoted to Grade II class for the Towton Novices' Chase at Wetherby, in which he was matched against the David Nicholson-trained Call It A Day, who started favourite. Mr Mulligan took an early lead, turned back the challenge of Call It A Day, and drew away to win by fifteen lengths. In the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase a month later, Mr Mulligan faced St Mellion Fairway, another Nicholson runner who had won his last three races, and the Jenny Pitman-trained Nahthen Lad. The field appeared to be the strongest assembled for a novice chase up to that point in the season. Johnson sent Mr Mulligan into the lead from the start and the gelding was never seriously challenged, winning by fifteen lengths from Nahthen Lad. The future Grand National winner Lord Gyllene was beaten more than forty lengths in fifth. Mr Mulligan's run of five victories made him an obvious choice for the Sun Alliance Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March, and he was made 11/8 favourite. He made a bad mistake at the first fence and another at the eleventh. He reached the lead on the second circuit of the course but when challenged by Nahthen Lad at the last fence he weakened quickly and was beaten eight lengths. =1996/1997 season: steeplechasing= Competing against experienced chasers in the 1996/1997 season, Mr Mulligan's first two runs were disappointing. He was made 2/1 favourite for the Rehearsal Handicap Chase at Chepstow despite carrying top weight of 166 pounds. A new jockey, David Bridgwater, was unable to improve his jumping as Mr Mulligan made two serious errors and finished fourth of the seven runners behind Belmont King. Tony McCoy took over the ride in the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, but after running well for much of the way, the gelding fell when in second place at the last fence. Mr Mulligan returned from the race with a grapefruit-sized hematoma on his back which was slow to heal and put the rest of his season in doubt. The horse spent three weeks in the care of Mary Bromiley, an equine physiotherapist, before returning to Chance to be prepared for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Twelve days before the race, the horse was sent to Newbury racecourse for an exercise gallop, where, according to Chance, he \\"worked appallingly, badly even for him.\\" A better piece of work a week later convinced the trainer to send him to Cheltenham. Mr Mulligan's erratic performances and disrupted preparation saw him sent off a 20/1 outsider in the Gold Cup on 13 March. The field appeared to be a strong one, with the 1996 winner Imperial Call starting favourite ahead of One Man, Dorans Pride, Danoli, Nahthen Lad and Barton Bank. McCoy had Mr Mulligan among the leaders from the start before sending him to the front just after half way in the three and a quarter mile race. Mr Mulligan made a mistake at the fourth- last fence, but went clear of the field at the next and ran on strongly to win by nine lengths from Barton Bank and Dorans Pride. =1997/1998 season: steeplechasing= Mr Mulligan made his first appearance since his Gold Cup win when he ran in the Desert Orchid Chase at Wincanton Racecourse in October. He finished second to Gales Cavalier, who was carrying thirteen pounds less than the champion. In November, Mr Mulligan was sent to Scotland for the Sean Graham Handicap Chase at Ayr Racecourse. The opposition was not strong and Mr Mulligan started at odds of 1/6 despite conceding at least twenty-one pounds to his opponents. He made two bad mistakes but still won comfortably by three lengths. Retirement In early 1998 Mr Mulligan injured a tendon in training. Rather than have the horse fired and prepared for a comeback, Worcester decided to end the horse's career on a winning note and Mr Mulligan was retired from racing. Mr Mulligan was sent to spend his retirement at Worcester's Home Farm at Thornbury, near Bristol. On 28 June 1999 Mr Mulligan was kicked by another horse and sustained a serious fracture to his left foreleg. The injury proved untreatable and the horse was quickly euthanized. On hearing the news a tearful Chance said \\"I owe everything to that horse\\" and described Mr Mulligan as \\"a wonderfully brave chaser\\".Michael Worcester said the Mr Mulligan had been thriving in retirement and that the horse's death was \\"desperately sad\\".

The mixtape was originally supposed to be released on August 15, 2012, but got delayed several times and was released on September 3, 2012. It is the fourth installment of Lil Wayne's Dedication series, following its predecessors The Dedication, Dedication 2 and Dedication 3. It's also the fourth installment of Lil Wayne's \\"Gangsta Grillz\\" series. Background On July 15, 2012, Wayne announced that the mixtape will be released some time in August, 2012 stating \\"Dedikation 4 coming next month.\\" DJ Drama revealed to MTV that Cortez Bryant told him that Wayne \\"had been mentioning it and was gearing up\\", and during a stop of Drake's Club Paradise Tour Bryant told him \\"it was a 100% go\\". On August 1, 2012, Lil Wayne confirmed the release date of the mixtape when he called into DJ Drama‚Äòs Hot 107.9 radio show. Wayne then also named three instrumentals (\\"Cashin Out\\", \\"I Don't Like\\" and \\"Burn\\") that he had already rapped over. On August 15, 2012, Mack Maine wrote that the release date of the mixtape got pushed back to a then unknown date. Maine also said that Lil Wayne would announce the new release date, and \\"something special\\" (which later turned out to be the track \\"No Lie\\") by stating \\"Announcement and something special will be delivered by @LilTunechi today....#stayTUNEd\\". Lil Wayne later explained he didn't release Dedication 4 on August 15, because his friend and fellow rapper 2 Chainz released his debut album Based on a T.R.U. Story on August 14, and he wanted all the attention on 2 Chainz. The official artwork was released through Wayne's Facebook page on August 16, 2012. On August 17, 2012, Nicki Minaj confirmed that she features on the mixtape. On August 24, 2012, Lil Wayne announced the mixtape would be released on August 30, 2012 by stating \\"D4 aug-30\\", however on August 30 it was confirmed by DJ Drama that the mixtape would be pushed back to September 3, 2012. The mixtape got pushed back again because Cortez Bryant wanted DJ Drama to properly set it up. On September 3, 2012, the mixtape was released for free download on multiple mixtape websites at 12:00PM EST which then got pushed back to 4:00PM EST and was finally release at 4:30PM EST. Critical reception Upon its release, Dedication 4 was met with mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\" based on 7 reviews. Kevin Jones of Exclaim! said, \\"Wayne's current stylistic tack of relying entirely on rap metaphors, along with a thematic scope limited almost exclusively to sex and periodic sprinkles of king-of-the-hill braggadocio, leaves listeners awash in an endless streams of exhausting wordplay, with relatively few moments of genuine, smirk-inducing entertainment.\\" William Ketchum III of HipHopDX said, \\"Dedication 4 won‚Äôt have the iconic, game-changing longevity that the series‚Äô first two did, but it‚Äôs still a snack-sized offering that offers glimpses of the New Orleans youngster who proclaimed himself as the \\"Best Rapper Alive\\" Regardless, seeing Dedication in the title will likely inspire listeners to turn up previous classics like \\"Cannon,\\" \\"Georgia‚Ä¶Bush\\" and \\"Motivation.\\" Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone said, \\"This summer, Lil Wayne told a radio station that rap had become \\"boring,\\" and that he prefers to spend time on his skateboard. Yet on much of this mixtape, he sounds less bored than he has in years, drawling filthy, funny rhymes over beats borrowed from Rick Ross, 2 Chainz and more.\\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork Media said, \\"The worst I can say about Dedication 4 is that there isn't one moment where I wouldn't rather be listening to the often mediocre originals. There are a dozen or so good punch lines scattered on D4, enough to make it fun enough for one listen \\" Track listing All tracks were arranged by DJ Drama.

In 1882 the name of the faith community was changed to St. John's as construction of the building began. This wood frame church still stands on its original \\"single course, dry-laid, uncut fieldstone foundation,\\" and is located east of the Wild Rice River in the Red River Valley near Galchutt, North Dakota.  History  The South Wild Rice Congregation was made up of Norwegian immigrants who arrived in the area in the early 1870s. In October 1873 the first annual meeting of the congregation was held, at which it was decided to reserve a 2 acre-parcel of land, found on Section 32, Range 48, Township 134, for religious purposes. One acre was to be set aside as church property, while the remaining acre was to be used as the church's cemetery. The oldest date on any grave marker is 1877. In its early years, this congregation met in members' homes. In 1874 a log schoolhouse was built and served as a church until the congregation could afford a separate building. This first schoolhouse was not very large, only 18 by 22 by 10 feet. Later it was moved to land just north of the church. The community was one of several congregations served by pastor J. A. Hellestvedt. Hellestvedt was the first Norwegian Lutheran pastor to reside in North Dakota, having settled in the state in 1873. and St. John's was built in 1883, with the bell tower having been added in 1897, it was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The church's listing on the National Register was based on its connection with the first wave of Norwegian Lutheran settlers in the region, the early settlement of southeastern North Dakota, and its retention of \\"greater integrity than any other church building in the region.\\" The church building has not been used for regular services since 1956, except for occasional events such as periodic worship services, baptisms and weddings. However, burial activity in the cemetery has continued.  Tenure  St. John's stands today as a monument of the early pioneers. Although regular services are no longer held, the church build and grounds are maintained by the descendants of these pioneers. Since 1956 this responsibility has been held in trust by the people of Galchutt Lutheran Church of Galchutt, North Dakota.

The colour black represents gunpowder and the red blood. Armorial achievement of Spain during the Francoist State, consisting of the traditional escutcheon (arms of Castile, Le√≥n, Aragon, Navarre and Granada) and the Pillars of Hercules with the motto Plus Ultra, together with Francoist symbols: the motto ¬´Una Grande Libre¬ª, the Eagle of St. John, and the yoke and arrows of the Catholic Monarchs which were also adopted by the Falangists. In use 1945‚Äì1977. State Coat of arms version in use 1938‚Äì1945. The symbols of Francoism were iconic references to identify the Francoist State in Spain between 1936 and 1975. They serve as visual illustrations for the ideology of Francoist Spain. Uniforms were designed for men and women that combined elements of the earlier Falangist and Carlist uniforms. The state developed new flags and escutcheons based on the traditional heraldry of the monarchy, but now associated with the state. The emblem of five arrows joined by a yoke was also adopted from earlier Spanish symbology, but after 1945 the arrows always pointed upward. This emblem appeared on buildings, plaques and uniforms. Many statues of Francisco Franco were installed in public places, in part to lend legitimacy to his state. Some towns, streets and plazas were given new names derived from Franco and his entourage. Franco caused many monuments to be erected, some of them substantial buildings. The most imposing is the Valle de los Ca√≠dos, the Valley of the Fallen, incorporating a huge basilica built into the side of a mountain. War memorials and plaques commemorating those who had died in the Spanish Civil War were installed in many towns and villages. After Franco's death in 1975, followed by the return to democracy, many symbols of Francoism were destroyed or removed and places renamed. An October 2007 law mandated removal of all remaining symbols from public buildings, with some exceptions for works of particular religious or artistic significance. Recently, Francoist symbols are added to Anti- Defamation League lists.  Background  Convento de San Rafael in Belchite, destroyed in the Civil War, now a monument Francisco Franco and Dwight D. Eisenhower in Madrid in 1959 The Second Spanish Republic was established in April 1931 after King Alfonso XIII had forced the dictator General Miguel Primo de Rivera to resign, followed by nationwide municipal elections. The king and the former dictator fled the country when the republic was declared, and the new government inherited a bankrupt state. In an atmosphere of political unrest, opinions were polarized between the extreme right and extreme left, often degenerating into violence. On the right, the traditionalist Carlist movement was revived. In 1933, the aristocrat Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of the former dictator, founded the far-right Falange movement, similar to the Italian Fascists. In February 1934 the Falange merged with the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (J.O.N.S), another right-wing group. Parallel to this, left-wing trade unions staged industry-wide or citywide strikes, and in Catalonia Marxist and Anarchist groups competed for power. Landless labourers seized land, occupied estates, and burned churches. On 17 July 1936, at a time of political crisis, General Francisco Franco led the Spanish colonial army from Morocco to attack the mainland, sparking the Spanish Civil War. A bitter war of attrition in which over 500,000 people died, the Spanish Civil War dragged out until 1 April 1939, when the Nationalists led by Franco acquired full control of the country. Franco was supported by the Falange and the Carlist Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, and united the two parties to forming the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS, or FET y de las JONS, whose official ideology was the Falangists' 27 puntos. The new party was a wide-ranging nationalist coalition, closely controlled by Franco. Franco had received material support in the civil war from both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the fascist rulers of Germany and Italy, but when World War II broke out in September 1939, he cited the exhausted state of his country in maintaining a position of neutrality. In June 1940, Spain changed to a position of non-belligerency, despite pressure from Axis diplomats. After the war ended in 1945, Franco remained dictator of Spain, at first isolated among the democracies of post- war Western Europe. This isolation was gradually eroded by the pressures of the Cold War, with Spain signing a security treaty with the United States in 1953. In the 1960s Spain experienced a boom from a growing tourism industry and from relaxation of trade barriers, modernizing economically and then culturally, which placed pressure on the state's highly conservative values. However, Franco held onto power until his death in November 1975. Soon after, a transition to liberal democracy began. A 1977 amnesty law was passed under which Franco's followers were given immunity for past abuses in return for supporting the transition.  Uniforms  Altered photograph of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera in the Falange blue shirt Uniforms were adopted gradually -- photographs taken at the founding ceremony of the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS in October 1933 do not show anyone wearing a uniform, but a picture of a meeting of the Junta Pol√≠tica a year later shows some (but not all) members in the official uniform. This consisted of a dark blue shirt with epaulettes and long black trousers. The left pocket of the shirt bore the yoke-and-arrows emblem of the Falange. Women wore the blue shirt and a knee-length black skirt, with a leather belt bearing the Falange emblem on its buckle. At a meeting in the Teatro Calder√≥n in Valladolid in March 1934, the hall was filled with banners and insignia and many attendees wore the blue shirts, visually displaying what Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera called the \\"spirit of service and of sacrifice, the ascetic and military concept of life.\\" Later, upper-class women tended to use Falangist insignia on their clothes as fashion accessories. When Carmen Primo de Rivera, sister of Jos√© Antonio, married in December 1938, she had the yoke and arrows embroidered on her wedding dress. After Jos√© Antonio died, a black tie was added in his memory. After the union with the Carlists, the original Falange uniform became important in identifying genuine Falangists. The red beret had become the symbol of Carlism by the 1860s. The new party, commonly known as the Movimiento Nacional, was given a uniform with the Falangist blue shirt, the red Carlist beret and military belts. The party symbol was the Falangist yoke and arrows. A portrait of Franco by Ignacio Zuloaga from 1940 shows him wearing the blue shirt, military boots and jodhpurs, and the red beret of the requet√©s.  Heraldic devices, symbols and icons  Copy of the model of the coat of arms called the \\"abridged\\" version for Franco's Spain. Approved in 1938, it was a simplified version of the coat of arms to promote bureaucratic aims. It was used on stamps, lottery tickets, identity documents, and buildings. A popular name for it was \\"coat of arms of the Eagle\\". = Flag = At the time of the Pronunciamiento of 17 and 18 July 1936, the insurgent military forces used the national flag with their coat of arms superimposed: this consisted of the then-current tricolor with the 1869 coat of arms, as had been approved by the Spanish Constitution of 1931. However, in military operations, especially in the air and naval divisions, the insurgents soon experienced confusion in distinguishing their units from those of the government. Also, within the insurgent heterogenic political families, the Carlists in Navarre insisted on going into combat with flags that were red and gold (alternatively, white embroidered with red), known as the burgundy of San Andr√©s, and these flags included a wide variety of emblems, including symbols of the monarchy and religion, with frequent inclusion of the \\"Sacred Heart\\". The government aimed to resolve this flag situation with the Decree of 29 August 1936, signed by General Miguel Cabanellas, which reinstated the red and yellow flag. There was no reference to the dimensions nor the particulars of the coat of arms, so the insurgent forces employed a host of distinctive coats of arms. To settle this situation, the Junta added an order to the Decree on 13 September 1936, signed by Colonel Federico Montaner. This defined the shapes and dimensions of the Army's flags to conform to the dimensions at the time before the proclamation of the Republic. The coat of arms was to be that of the Republic. Eventually, considering the aims of the Falange, a new design for the coat of arms was formally specified and regulated by Decree number 470, 2 February 1938, signed by General Franco. = Escutcheon = The escutcheon, popularly known the \\"Eagle escutcheon\\", then representative of the right-wing insurgent group and its ideology, was adopted after the conflict as the national escutcheon for Spain. It included some minor technical improvements which were approved in 1945, during the period of the Francoist State itself and also during the period of democratic transition until 1981. Certain minor changes to the design were approved in 1977, such as making the eagle's wings much more open. According to the directive of the Franco government, the design of the shield of the national emblem represented a departure from the traditional shield that had been used in its various forms since 1868. In the Franco era, the escutcheon of Spain was associated with the State rather than the Monarchy. Without affecting the basic design, the shield was divided into four with the coats of arms of Castille, Le√≥n, Aragon and Navarre, plus the ¬´ent√© en point¬ª of Granada. The inclusion of other historical heraldic elements gave a clear symbolic significance: \\"The set of arrows and the yoke of the Catholic Monarchs, whose adoption as a badge is one of the great successes of our Falange, must appear on the official arms to indicate what should be the tone of the New State.\\" The Eagle on Franco's escutcheon had previously been used in the arms of the Catholic Monarchs. The eagle was the Eagle of Saint John the Evangelist, which Queen Isabella I of Castile used on an evangelist escutcheon to which she added the words sub umbra alarum tuarum protege nos (protect us under the shadow of your wings). The heraldry used by Franco was similar to that of the Catholic Monarchs, with the arms of Navarre replacing those of Aragon-Sicily, and with the addition of the Pillars of Hercules and the motto One, Great and Free. = Origin of the Yoke, arrows, and Gordian knot = Emblems of the Catholic Monarchs on the facade of the Church of Santiago (Losar de la Vera, C√°ceres), c. 1500. In Spanish heraldic tradition, the yoke, the set of arrows, and the Gordian Knot were elements which were often joined by leaves and the pomegranate, as well as the motto Tanto monta, monta tanto (\\"equal opposites in balance\\"), the personal motto and prenuptial agreement of the Catholic Monarchs Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon as embodied in the song of Pedro Marcuello. This motto was used upon the weapons of both Monarchs from 1475. They made an agreement, now called Concordia de Segovia and the coat of arms is a graphic representation of this pact which united the two most important Monarchs on the peninsula. This iteration is the oldest known image of the escutcheon. The bundle of arrows may have its origins in the Roman fasces, a bundle of rods with the blade of an axe, that were carried before the magistrates to show their power. The arrows previously pointed downward to show that they were ready for use in executing criminals or for warfare. With the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, the bundle of arrows meant the union of Castile and Aragon to create Spain -- the yoke was Isabel's and the arrows Ferdinand's. The Gordian knot, cut, united the two. The number of arrows varied, but always pointed downwards. Over time, the badge of the Catholic Monarchs spread to other heraldic compositions, and was adopted in some of its variants as the emblems of not only towns and cities such Ronda, Marbella and M√°laga, but also to countries like Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. = Emblem of the Falange = Logo of the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS. Sign on public housing built during the Francoist State ( Madrid, 2007). The official single party used its association with the National Movement, and with it the FET-JONS, to try to carry out National Syndicalists measures, although these had little effect. The adoption of the arrows and yoke symbol was initially explained by a professor at the University of Granada, Fernando de los R√≠os. In a class on political law of the Fascist state and its symbols, he made a drawing on the blackboard of a set of arrows linked with a yoke, indicating that this would be the symbol of Fascism and to have been born or raised in Spain. He said that if ever there was a Spanish fascism, this would be the emblem.\\"'' Juan Aparicio L√≥pez, a student attending the class, suggested adoption of this symbol for JONS of On√©simo Redondo and Ramiro Ledesma Ramos (Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista). He also proposed the 'red and black' and the motto \\"Spain: one, great and free\\". The J.O.N.S adopted the yoke and arrows symbol, which immediately became popular due to its geometrical simplicity, warlike symbolism and invocation of a time when Spain was \\"glorious\\". The symbol was adopted by the Falange at the time of the merger on 13 February 1934. The yoke and arrows represented the union of the five kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Granada and Navarre. Both national unity and the glories of the Ferdinand and Isabella period were persistent themes of Franco's Spain. The poet and activist Rafael S√°nchez Mazas wrote in a 1933 edition of the magazine El Fascio that the reasons for the Spanish Falange's adoption of symbols used by the Catholic Monarchs was because of their origin in the works of the Roman poet Virgil (70 BC ‚Äì 19 BC). The symbolism of the arrows as an expression of war was used in Virgil's Aeneid, and the yoke, a symbol of agriculture, was based upon Virgil's poem, the Georgics: \\"We integrate the yoke and the set of arrows into the escutcheon. If the yoke without the arrows is heavy, the arrows without the yoke are in danger of becoming too scattered. We are changing, rather than to a policy, to a discipline, to a behaviour, to a style, to a way of being, to an education.\\" Founders of the Falange ideology, such as Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, Juan Aparicio, Ernesto Gim√©nez Caballero, Ramiro Ledesma, Orbegozo, wrote in the journal Fascio that the chosen emblem was also close to that of Italian Fascism. = V√≠ctor and crism√≥n = Detail of the \\"v√≠ctor\\". It contains each one of the letters in the word victor. The \\"victor\\" is a symbol from the Ancient Roman Empire. After the Edict of Milan in the year 313 AD, the crism√≥n appeared on coins, flags and eventually also became part of the shields of the Roman legionaries. According to popular legend, the night before the battle of the Ponte Milvio, the crism√≥n with the words in hoc signo vinces (In this sign, you conquer') appeared to Emperor Constantine the Great in his dreams. The next day the Emperor replaced the Imperial eagle with the crism√≥n on the labarum, and he miraculously won the battle. Over time, the symbol was gradually included in varying forms on the Roman crowns. It had become the symbol of the victor and the victorious. From the fourteenth century, it was adopted as the emblem for doctors by some Spanish universities, such as the University of Salamanca and later Alcal√° de Henares, and is included in mural inscriptions done in red or black paint that remain there today. Finally, it was chosen as suitable for use in the Victory Parade (July 18, 1939) and thereafter throughout the Franco dictatorship as an emblem of Franco. Mistakenly, it was thought it had been designed by Corintio Haza, who incorporated astrological symbols into the emblem to protect the Caudillo. = Guidon, head of State's standard and coat of arms of Franco = The personal coat of arms of Franco. The guidon, the personal military flag and standard of the Head of State were created in 1940 and used until Franco's death. The stripe between the two dragon heads separates the two Pillars of Hercules which have silver columns, gold Corinthian capitals and are headed with crowns. The crown nearest to the stripe, which is always on the column placed on the lower part of the flag, is an Imperial crown with a central upright bar. The crown on the other column is a Royal crown, which has a more open top and is always on the column placed on the top half of the flag. The Royal Band of Castile, which was the personal badge of the Castilian Monarchs and later used by the House of Habsburg, was used as the basis for the escutcheon. The standard, the flag which was flown at official residences, in barracks, and on ships of the Spanish Navy, was a square which included the previously- mentioned elements. La Banda de Castilla and the Columns of Hercules form part of the personal escutcheon used by Franco as Chief of State. The coat of arms also contained the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand as the supporter, as well as an open crown without arches, known as the crown of military leadership.  Statues of Franco  Equestrian statue in Valencia Santander, removed from the town centre on 18 December 2008. \\"Franco's Footprints\\", part of the monument to the Victoria Convoy, in Ceuta. The footprints were filled with concrete in February 2010. A number of statues of Franco were constructed during his rule. The statues are varied sculptural representations of Franco: busts, full- length standing statues, equestrian statues, etc., which the state placed in many Spanish cities. It has been suggested that up to 1959 (and especially in the 1940s) the purpose of the many statues was to legitimize the state and \\"perpetuate the memory of victory\\". It has been further suggested that, in the 1960s, these statues were constructed in tribute to show \\"appreciation of Franco and his achievements\\" (in a spirit of commemorating the 25 Years of Peace). In the last period (after the death of Franco and until 1978) the statues were to \\"secure the memory\\" of an \\"unchanging goal. The most important equestrian statues were placed in prominent places in Valencia, Santander and the Nuevos Ministerios in Madrid. The original was designed in 1959 by Jos√© Capuz Mamano. This statue is at the Complutense University in Madrid, with other copies in Barcelona, Zaragoza (1948), Melilla, Ferrol, and the Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu in Madrid (1942, a smaller one than the original and moved to the Infantry Academy in Toledo in the 1980s). Places where statues can currently be found: *A Coru√±a: in various parts of the city, there are sculptures and plaques with the image of Franco on horseback surrounded by the Moorish guard of the Palace of Maria Pita. *B√©tera: a bronze equestrian statue of Franco sculpted by Jos√© Capuz Mamano.

Monuments  =War memorials and Plaques to \\"Those Fallen for God and for Spain.\\" = War memorials and plaques for those \\"Fallen for God and Spain\\" were placed in many villages, mostly on the outside of churches. They contained a list of names of the dead people belonging to the Spanish Nationalist party followed by the phrase \\"Present!\\", similar to that of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera. The plaques, although varied, were usually made of marble and topped with bronze or other metals. The plaques were often placed on the walls of the church, or, if there was a wall nearby, at the burial place of the victims named on the plaque. If there was a cross-shaped monument or low obelisk that recorded the names, a plaque was attached to it. Many places have now chosen to move this type of monument to nearby cemeteries, and in some cases they have been turned into tributes to the \\"fallen\\" from both sides. Plaques were also used to commemorate the opening of institutions and infrastructure such as railway lines, stations, reservoirs, etc. The majority of these plaques still exist today. Many of the plaques and monuments are neither maintained nor removed.

File:Soller Civil War Monument R01.jpgS√≥ller (Majorca), monument a los Ca√≠dos on Pla√ßa d'Espanya; the 'coat of arms of the Eagle' has been vandalised. = The Victory Arch = Victory Arch (Madrid). The Victory Arch of Madrid (Arco de la Victoria de Madrid) is situated in the Moncloa-Aravaca district of Madrid. The monument was built between 1953 and 1956 by order of Franco to commemorate his victory in the Spanish Civil War. The 40 metre (130 ft.) high arch commemorates the nationalist victory in the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria, in which the University City was destroyed. Inscriptions in Latin describe the victory and the construction of the new University City. Behind it is the Monument to the Fallen from Madrid, designed in 1949 by the architect Manuel Herrero de Palacios, a monumental circular building roofed with a cupola. Today it is the home of the municipal council of the Moncloa - Aravaca district. = Monument to the Fallen in Pamplona = Monument to the Fallen in Pamplona (Spain). Popularly known as the Monument to the Fallen, the actual name of this monument is Navarra a sus Muertos en la Cruzada (Navarre to its Dead in the Crusade), as indicated on its facade. The building was erected in memory of the dead from Navarre, a Nationalist stronghold during the Civil War, and is located in the heart of the city of Pamplona, the capital of Navarre. The building was designed by the architects Victor Eusa and Jos√© Yamoz. The names of the 5,000 people of Navarre who died in combat in the civil war were inscribed on its walls, but today they are covered by a sheet. Today the building is known as the Sala de Exposiciones Conde Rodezno (Conde Rodezno Exhibition Hall) and is used for small municipal exhibitions. = Cuartel de la Monta√±a = Commemorative plaque. The Cuartel de la Monta√±a was a military building in Madrid that achieved notoriety as the place where the military uprising of July 1936 began in the city. On July 19, 1936 in Madrid, General Fanjul, charged with the uprising of the city, came in civilian clothes to Cuartel de la Monta√±a. Instead of going out with troops to take the vital points of the capital, he simply proclaimed a state of war and took power with 1,500 men (of whom there were about 140 officers) and approximately 180 Falangists from the Cuartel de la Monta√±a. That afternoon, the base was surrounded by poorly armed troops and civilians loyal to the government of the Republic. At dawn on 20 July, shelling of the barracks began. The rebels resisted for only a few hours. Differences of opinion led some rebels to fly the white flag while others were firing on the attackers. The garrison fell, being almost completely destroyed. The entry of the attacking forces resulted in the murder of most of the officers (ninety of one hundred forty) and the Falangists. There were between 150 and 300 dead. The building, which had been mostly destroyed during the siege, suffered the impact of numerous artillery attacks during the war because of its proximity to the frontlines, which were more or less unchanged since early 1937. Towards the end of the war the building was reduced to ruins, which could still be seen in the early Sixties. A park, the Parque del Cuartel de la Monta√±a, was inaugurated on 20 July 1972, when Franco was still in power and Carlos Arias Navarro, the future prime minister, was mayor of Madrid. It incorporates a monument by Joaqu√≠n Vaquero Turcios, also from 1972, in memory of those who died in its defence. This monument consists of a bronze figure representing the body of an injured man at the centre of a wall sculpted in the form of sandbags. = The ruins of Belchite = The Ruins of Belchite. The Battle of Belchite occurred during the Republican offensive in Aragon that started in August 1937, with Zaragoza as the target. For various reasons, including heat, lack of water, and the military superiority of the Nationalists, the offensive was unsuccessful. Starting on 1 September 1937, the Republicans concentrated on Belchite, with an intense artillery bombardment combined with aerial bombing. The town was totally ruined and 6,000 people had died when the defenders surrendered on 6 September 1937. Although the outcome was a Republican victory, the delay caused by the battle gave the Nationalists time to regroup and prevent the advance to Zaragoza. Franco decreed that the original town be left in its state of ruin as a monument. Republican prisoners were made to build a new town of Belchite, but the original town has not been rebuilt. The ruins remain as a monument that attracts small numbers of battlefield tourists each year. = Monuments for the Battle of Ebro = Ruin of Corbera de Ebro. The bloodiest battle of the Civil War was fought on the left bank of the river Ebro. *In memory of General Franco's victory, the town of Corbera de Ebro was left just as it had been after the battle. *At an elevation of 427 metres at Quatre Camins, a stone cross stands in memory of the Third Requetes of Our Lady of Montserrat, the Carlist Nationalist unit formed by Catalan volunteers, which suffered heavy casualties in this place. A red St. Andrew's Cross stands on the pedestal. *At an elevation of 481 metres in Punta Targa, a monument stands for the brotherhood of the Third Requetes of Our Lady of Montserrat. The base of the monument is an ossuary containing the remains of combatants from both sides. *At the crossroads for Faterella and Villalba de los Alcores there is a monolith erected in memory of the soldiers of the 4th Division of Navarre who died in on the banks of the Ebro. *At Coll del Moro, on the outskirts of Gandesa, a monolith from 1953 marks the position from which Franco personally led the final attack. The monument has been vandalized with graffiti both for and against Franco's Spain. *On one of the peaks of Puig de l'√Äliga near Gandesa, there is another monument, but the original inscription has been lost over time. *In Prat de Compte, in front of the local school, there is a cross in memory of the 'Fallen for God and for Spain'. = Monument for the Massacre of Paracuellos = Paracuellos Cemetery. In the background is the white cross drawn on the hill where the killings took place. Republican Militia guards killed over a thousand prisoners in the \\"Massacre of Paracuellos\\", during the Battle of Madrid, in the area around San Jose, in the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama and Soto Aldovea, within the boundary of Torrej√≥n de Ardoz. They are commemorated by a large white cross on the slopes of the Cerro de San Miguel, near the river Jarama and visible from the airport of Madrid-Barajas. = The Fortress at Toledo = El Alc√°zar, Toledo, a fortress built out of rock, is located in the upper part of the city of Toledo and it overlooks the city. In the third century, the Alc√°zar of Toledo was a Roman palace. It was restored during the reigns of Alfonso VI and Alfonso X and further modified in 1535. During the Civil War it was used by Colonel Jos√© Moscard√≥ Ituarte as a fortress. During a siege there, which lasted 70 days (from 22 July to 28 September 28, 1936), it was completely destroyed by troops loyal to the Second Spanish Republic. It was later rebuilt. Since 1998 it has housed the Library of Castile-La Mancha, and from 2010 onwards it has also held the Army Museum. The siege and liberation were used by Francisco Franco to establish his dominance with his followers. The newspaper Ultra named the building El Alc√°zar of Spain. = Monument to the Cruiser \\"Baleares\\"= The Monument to the Cruiser \\"Baleares\\" (El Monumento al Crucero ¬´Baleares¬ª) is located in the San Feixina Park, Palma, Majorca. It is controversial, with some groups calling for its removal. The monument was erected in memory of the crew of the Spanish cruiser Baleares, which was torpedoed and sunk by destroyers of the Spanish Republican Navy in the Battle of Cape Palos. The monument was designed by the architects Don Francisco and Don Jos√© Roca Sim√≥ (a father and son duo) and the sculptor Jos√© Ortells Cabanellas. It was inaugurated on 16 May 1947. The column is high, topped by a large cross. At one time it also included a sculpture of a sailor clinging to an anchor.  Religious monuments Franco was raised as a devout Catholic, and came to believe that Spanish nationalism and Catholic belief could not be separated. He felt that Spain had a special religious mission, and completely identified his cause with the cause of the church. Franco called his fight against the Republicans a \\"crusade\\" and presented his 1939 victory as a victory of Christian civilization. When attending churches, he entered solemnly under a religious canopy. On 15 April 1938, the Vinar√≤s beach was captured, splitting the Republican-held area into two. The head of the Navarre IV Division dipped his fingers in the water and made the sign of the cross, symbolically taking possession. St. Teresa was designated by traditionalists and the Catholic Church as the \\"saint of the Spanish race\\". The Nationalist forces found the remnants of a sculpture of Saint Teresa in M√°laga -- one of her hands -- which was sent to Franco. He made a personal cult of devotion to the saint, keeping the relic in his home until he died. = The Valley of the Fallen = The Valley of the Fallen. This monument to the fallen in the Civil War was built by Republican prisoners of war. It is a large-scale monument, with the basilica built into the side of a pine-covered mountain and with an enormous stone cross above the entrance. The stone cross is high and is visible from a distance of . The monument and basilica were built in accordance with the Decree of 1 April 1940 providing funds for construction of a basilica, monastery, and youth headquarters in a farm located on the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama (El Escorial), \\"to perpetuate the memory of the fallen of our glorious Crusade\\". Construction began in the 1940s and the structure was completed in 1959. Franco's grave was located beside the altar. The monument continued to be visited by the dwindling group of his die-hard supporters on the anniversary of Franco's death in the post-Franco era. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera and many other combatants from both sides in the Spanish Civil War are buried in the valley. Perhaps 50,000 of Franco's supporters are buried there, along with a handful of Republicans. Human rights groups have called for El Valle de los Caidos to be converted into a centre that would teach visitors about the Civil War and the Francoist State. Others have asked that the bodies of Jose Antonio and Franco be removed, and that plaques or other methods be used to give visitors some understanding of the historical background. In 2019, Franco's body was exhumed and his remains were re-buried in a family crypt near Madrid. = Sacred Heart of Jesus = Monument, the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Cerro de los √Ångeles, Getafe, Spain. The Cerro de los √Ångeles (Hill of the Angels) is the site of the Monumento al Sagrado Coraz√≥n (Monument of the Sacred Heart). The original monument was created by architect Carlos Maura Nadal and sculptor Aniceto Marinas y Garc√≠a, and was inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII on 30 May 1919. It was destroyed on 7 August 1936 during the civil war. Republicans dynamited the monument due to its religious and political symbolism. There was a proposal to replace it with a figure representing Liberty or the Republic, but this was not executed. The current monument is similar in design to the 1919 monument, but on a larger scale. Construction began in 1944 in accordance with designs by the architects Pedro Muguruza and Luis Quijada Mart√≠nez. The monument shows Christ with open arms, inviting all men to come to Him. The high statue on a pedestal is the work of Aniceto Marinas, and the group of sculptures around the base is by Fernando Cruz Sol√≠s. The monument was opened in 1965. The crypt, which did not exist in the original monument, was opened in 1975.  Place names  Alberche del Caudillo, now Calera y Chozas in the Province of Toledo = Towns and villages = Today, there are a number of towns that preserve the memory of Franco in their official names. The only one which has the status of a municipality is Llanos del Caudillo, with 726 inhabitants. Many other towns and cities that had similar names for decades, such as El Ferrol del Caudillo (until 1982, in the province of La Coru√±a), or Barbate de Franco (until 1998, in the province of Cadiz), withdrew references to Franco after the restoration of democracy. Franco wanted to honour generals from the Nationalist side by ascribing their names to various locations, and most still retain these names. Such is the case of San Leonardo de Yag√ºe, where General Juan Yag√ºe was born, or Alcocero de Mola, where General Emilio Mola died in a plane crash during the war. The case of Numancia de la Sagra (Toledo) is another example; since the Middle Ages, this town was known as Aza√±a, but during the Civil War this coincided with the first name of the then Spanish Prime Minister, Manuel Aza√±a, so it was replaced in 1936. The original name, Aza√±a, means wheel (Arab-Moorish word). The town is now called \\"Numancia\\", after the regiment which captured it, and \\"Sagra\\" for the region it belongs to. = Street names = Nameplate for la Avenida del General√≠simo. The memory of Franco is still present in the names of the streets, squares and avenues of various towns and cities. There are also streets, avenues and squares in many cities and towns in Spain named for generals of the Civil War and the Nationalist party, such as Mola, Sanjurjo, Moscard√≥, Yag√ºe and Mill√°n Astray. Other names from the Franco era were used, such as Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, Ramiro Ledesma, On√©simo Redondo, Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, etc.  Removal of symbols  See also: Historical Memory Law In January 1980, the Madrid city council decided to rename twenty downtown streets, returning them to the names they had before 14 April 1931, when the Second Republic was created. The Avenida del General√≠simo thus became the Paseo de la Castellana. In 1981 the Avenida de Jos√© Antonio in Madrid was renamed La Gran V√≠a. Despite the withdrawal of some of the symbols during the first years of the Transition, some symbols remained more than thirty years after his death. The Spanish Historical Memory Law, approved by the Congress of Deputies on 31 October 2007, mandated the removal of commemorative plaques, statues and other symbols from public buildings. It also opened the public archives covering the Franco period and facilitated the task of locating and exhuming the graves of victims. Under the 2007 law introduced by the socialist government of Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, Falangist symbols had to be removed from public view, and streets and plazas that honoured Franco and his entourage had to be renamed. The law was criticized by both left-wing and right-wing observers, both for being too lenient or too severe. A historian said that by focusing on the abuses committed by Franco, the government was presenting the left-wing Republican government in too favourable a light, ignoring the many problems of the feuding socialist, anarchist, communist and separatist groups. In 2010 the department of National Heritage stopped offering tours of Franco's private quarters in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, although tours of the older parts of the palace with \\"high artistic value\\" continued. In December 2010, the Valle de los Caidos was reopened, but with tight security systems to prevent vandalism or destruction by militant members of victims' associations. As of 2011, the government was considering exhuming Franco's body from the Valle de los Caidos and reburying it beside his wife in a municipal cemetery. There were some protests, but many supported the plan to transform the site into a place of reconciliation, with plaques to explain the past. Ram√≥n J√°uregui, the responsible minister, said, \\"We have dealt with the past little by little. Maybe we're tackling this site a little late, but prudence has been the key to our peaceful transition.\\" In October 2019, Franco was exhumed and moved to a family plot near Madrid. There was much debate regarding symbols that might affect the Church, so an exception was introduced for religious reasons, and an exception made for monuments with particular artistic value. There are some emblematic symbols such as the yoke and arrows on the Casa Sindical (a brick tower facing the Museo del Prado) and the Central Headquarters of the Movimiento, the Alcal√° de Madrid which was built in a rationalist style.

Lone Elk Park was originally part of the Tyson Valley Powder Plant during World War II. After the war the area became a county park and herds of elk and bison were established in 1948. The land was reacquired by the federal government during the Korean War, and the wildlife herds were destroyed for safety reasons in 1958, but one lone bull elk survived. In 1964 St. Louis County acquired for Tyson County Park, which became Lone Elk Park in 1966. The park officially opened on October 17, 1971 and six bison were acquired from the St. Louis Zoo in July 1973. There are driving routes that provide views of the elk and bison, often at close proximity. The park is also home to many deer, wild turkey and waterfowl. Domestic animals are not permitted whatsoever, even if confined to a vehicle. Research was conducted in 2016 to determine if a sinkhole was under the lake. The boat dock has been removed.

It originally aired on TNT in the United States on July 22, 2012. It was written by Bradley Thompson & David Weddle and directed by Holly Dale. The title is drawn from the defiant cry reportedly uttered by Sparta's King Leonidas I to Persians demanding that he surrenders his army's weapons, Molon labe (\\"Come and take it\\"). Plot Karen leads Ben into a trap so the Overlords can find out about the Skitter Resistance movement. Before Karen can place a harness on him, Tom and the Second Mass arrive and start a firefight. Karen manages to slip away but, in the confusion, Tom manages to point a gun at an Overlord, causing the enemy forces to stand down. Realizing the value of his target, Tom decides to take the Overlord prisoner and take the creature to Charleston. Weaver resumes command and sends Matt along with Lourdes and Anne to get more supplies from the basement before they leave the hospital, with Matt along as security. Soon after the prisoner has been brought to base, the humans are attacked. Weaver realizes the frontal assault is a diversion and sends Tom to stop a mech that has sneaked through the back. While successful, the resulting explosion traps Anne, Lourdes and Matt in the basement. Karen then appears offering terms: Surrender the Overlord and everyone will be spared, though Tom and Hal don't buy this for a second. Ben and Tom argue over Ben's ultimate fate with the teen deciding to leave after this for the Second Mass' protection. In the basement, Anne, Lourdes and Matt come across an injured Jamil who was sent to look for them. He has no signs of visible injuries but is hurt in a bad way and cautions them not to open the door opposite him. At the same time, Maggie and Hal are nearly attacked in the tunnels by a swarm of spider-like creatures seemingly sent by the aliens to force man's hand. In the meantime, Jamil is revealed to have been made into a \\"Trojan horse\\" as several creatures erupt from his body and chase Anne, Lourdes and Matt, trapping them in the blood lab. Matt is sent through the air vents by Anne to fetch help and narrowly avoids being eaten by the creatures thanks to being found by Tom and Pope and is pulled out in time. The basement is sealed off but since the creatures can eat through metal like rats this is only a temporary measure. Karen appears again to tell the resistance it has run out of time and callously executes a captured fighter (Boon) to prove a point. An enraged Tom goes to confront the Overlord (the same one whom he spoke with on the ship) to demand answers. Through Ben the creature reveals that they're after something on Earth though it won't specify what and that the culling of humans was a favor. Humans are a weak self-destructive species that fights over dwindling resources and is ruled by emotions. To prove a point it begins to kill Ben through the link. Tom retaliates by shooting the alien in the neck leaving Anne to try to keep their only bargaining chip alive. Weaver is furious at Tom's actions but admits if it was Jeannie in that situation he would have done the same. While still uncertain, both men realize Red Eye's claims about a skitter rebellion may be true. While the Overlords consider the resistance a minor irritant, the prospect of their own slaves starting an uprising has them rattled. This still doesn't change the fact that the resistance is trapped. Tom gets an idea and tells them to bring in Karen. A smug Karen is brought in and gloats to Hal about how predictable the resistance is and how they fell for her ruse. Her attitude changes when presented with the injured Overlord and she has to be restrained to hear Tom's proposition: Let the humans leave and she gets her master back to treat. Though the aliens could blow them up with an air strike, Tom reveals they have wired the building with C4. The explosives are connected to a detonator that is with a hidden Pope and if he sees or gets word of trouble he will blow the building up, killing Karen and her master. The aliens are forced to agree with the resistance's demands. Ben and Tom say tearful goodbyes on the road as the convoy stops for a rest/refuel. After Ben leaves on foot to join the skitter rebellion, the Second Mass begins the final leg of their journey to Charleston.

It was bred and selected for its aesthetic attributes as well as its cold hardiness to at least (USDA hardiness zone 4) by Jim, Bob, and Dave Fleming of Fleming's Flower Fields in Lincoln, Nebraska. 'Kopper King' is a compact perennial shrub, reaching tall with a spread. The leaves are coppery red to dark purple, with a lobed and toothed leaf shape that appears to be similar to some maples. New growth will emerge in late May or early June and the plant will bloom from midsummer to early fall at the first frost. Each flower, with its cream to light-pink petals and deep red eye in the center streaking outward toward the margin, is borne singly from the leaf axils and can be in diameter. Each flower only lasts one day but new blooms are typically produced in succession, allowing for almost continuous flowering. The flower display is flat with petals overlapping. Overall, the plant is resistant to pests and diseases, although it can be severely damaged by Japanese beetles.US patent PP10793, Fleming, David W. & Fleming, James R., \\"Hibiscus plant named 'Kopper King'\\", issued 1999-02-16.Lauderdale, Cyndi Crossan. 2004. Hibiscus 'Kopper King'. American Nurseryman, 199(4): 74. 'Kopper King' is a complex hybrid involving three species of Hibiscus and is the culmination of a forty-year breeding program established by the Fleming brothers at their nursery in Nebraska. This cultivar was produced by backcrossing two Hibiscus cultivars for three generations: the pollen parent was an inbred seedling of 'Dahliatown Orchid', a cultivar of H. moscheutos, and the seed parent was 'Jazzmen', itself a hybrid of H. moscheutos, H. laevis (formerly H. militaris), and H. coccineus. 'Kopper King' first bloomed in 1987 on the Fleming brothers' property in Nebraska. After testing to verify the characteristics of the plant were stable, they applied for a patent on this cultivar on November 3, 1997. United States plant patent number PP10,793 was granted on February 16, 1999. The patent in part claims that, \\"[t]his hardy hibiscus plant contributes to the market with its sheer beauty, its compact growth habit, it[s] great resistance to disease and insects, its stability through extremes in rain and drought, and its extreme hardiness.\\" References Ornamental plant cultivars Kopper King ","title":"Hibiscus 'Kopper King'"},{"id":"36513107","text":"Juan Enrique Escalas (born 25 March 1964, in Palma de Mallorca) is a former Spanish swimmer who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics.

The village may have derived its name from the Old English and Scots term 'Haugh', referring to a low-lying meadow in a river valley, though equally it may have originated from the Old Norse 'Haugr' meaning hill or mound. It was first recorded within a territorial designation, that of Henry of Essex, lord of Raleigh and Haughley during the reign of King Stephen of England and Henry II of England. As the name has the same sound as the more common surname of Hawley, and as the spelling of English surnames was very variable until at least the 19th century, the two are likely to be related in many cases.

Early life Irina Slutsky was born in Kazakhstan, which was, at the time, part of the Soviet Union. Speaking of her childhood in 2007, Slutsky said \\"When I lived in the Soviet Union... we were told what we could read, what we could write, what we couldn't read, what we couldn't watch.... Needless to say, the Soviet Union isn't around any more; that stuff doesn't work.\\" At a young age, Slutsky and her family emigrated to New York City, settling in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, where she learned to speak English. Career =Red Herring= After the demise of the Silicon Valley magazine Red Herring, founder Tony Perkins sold the name and trademarks to Alex Vieux in 2003, who then revived the brand as a technology-news website with a short-lived companion magazine. In 2004 Vieux paid recent graduates of Columbia School of Journalism $2000 each to move to San Francisco to work as reporters, among them Irina Slutsky. Although Slutsky represented Red Herring as a featured speaker at the 2005 South by Southwest conference,SXSW 2005 she did not enjoy her time with the magazine; in her words, \\"it totally sucked\\". Editors did not allow bylines, as Vieux was allegedly worried that crediting the authors would give the young journalists \\"egos\\". Female employees were also not treated the same as their male counterparts; for Christmas 2004, Vieux reportedly gave the male staff each a Charvet necktie, while female staff (including the current managing editor) received nothing.Well, Alex Vieux knows women don't wear ties Slutsky quickly moved on. =GETV and PodTech= Slutsky with Geek Entertainment co-founder Eddie Codel and occasional guest-host Violet Blue. In November 2005, Slutsky teamed with Eddie Codel to form Geek Entertainment TV (GETV), a \\"snarky\\"Video bloggers ready to incite 'media revolution' - CNET News web television video blog (or vlog) initially focusing on Web 2.0, \\"reporting from deep inside the bubble as it re-inflates.\\"Geek Entertainment TV Codel produced the series, and the majority of episodes featured Slutsky performing interviews.

Early interviews included Wetpaint, Wesabe, Dogster and Instructables, among others.LunchMeet Unlike the other series, Codel appeared in front of the camera with Slutsky in addition to producing the video.

In early 2007 they released GETV back to Slutsky and Codel. Codel was let go as a full-time employee, though he continued producing videos and hosting LunchMeet on a contracted basis. Slutsky and Zuckerberg On July 18, 2007, Slutsky appeared (as MC Slutsky) in and produced a GETV parody music video in the style of Don't Cha by The Pussycat Dolls, celebrating the newly released iPhone.

An advertisement for Motorola's Droid Pro later used a similar idea, though it was unrelated to Slutsky's video.Update your user profile - Profile - Advertising Age It was later learned that the same day that she had published the music video, Slutsky had been let go from PodTech. PodTech founder John Furrier explained that he had been unable to monetize GETV as he had hoped, and that most of the company's revenue was coming from contracted work for corporations, rather than their original IP. He had hoped to continue working with Slutsky through contracted work, as had happened with Codel. He admitted that he had spent over $500,000 on GETV alone. Slutsky said that she understood the move, that her projects had been increasingly de-emphasized by PodTech, and that the company was spending too much of its limited resources on her.

Residence  The principal residence, known as Villa Sayer:fr:Villa Sayer is unusual for this region and is the work of Bauhaus architect, Marcel Breuer seconded by his Parisian associate Mario Jossa. It is Breuer's only private residence in France. Constructed from 1972 to 1974 by its owners, it illustrates a harmony between architecture and environment. It is a transparent house. For the roof, the shape of a double hyperbolic parabolic, the architect employs prestressed concrete, Cables are linked to exterior pillars of bush hammered concrete. The exterior uses white concrete, either bush hammered, in the form of boards, or alternatively vertical and horizontal. Like the exterior, the interior details, chimney, stairs, drawings on doors, the coating of the floor and walls were selected by mutual agreement between the owners and Breuer. The smallest details were the object of multiple plans being sent nearly everyday from the office in New York. In 1992 it was registered at the supplementary inventory of historical monuments and has been classed as a historical monument since 2005.  Marcel Breuer  The 1953 commission for UNESCO headquarters in Paris was a turning point for Breuer: a return to Europe, a return to larger projects after years of only residential commissions, and the beginning of Breuer's adoption of concrete as his primary medium. He became known as one of the leading practitioners of Brutalism, with an increasingly curvy, sculptural, personal idiom. Windows were often set in soft, pillowy depressions rather than sharp, angular recesses. Many architects remarked at his ability to make concrete appear \\"soft\\".

Gnel was most probably born and raised during the reign of Tiran. Sometime during the reign of his paternal grandfather, the Sassanid King Shapur II launched a war on Rome and her allies, firstly by persecuting the Christians that lived in Persia and Mesopotamia.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 Shapur II's war by capturing these territories began to dealt a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 Eventually the Sassanid King with his army had invaded Armenia, taking the members of the royal family including Gnel as hostagesKurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103Encyclopaedia Iranica: Armenia and Iran II.

After Shapur II was defeated, he had signed a treaty and Gnel with members of his family were released from prison.

Pharantzem was extremely well known for her beauty and modesty.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Her reputation for her beauty had become renowned and widespread to the point as Gnel's paternal cousin Tirit had become passionately in love with her and desired her to be his wife.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Finding a way to plot against his cousin Gnel, Tirit approached their uncle Arsaces II and said to him: ‚ÄúGnel wants to rule, and to kill you. All the grandees, the Naxarars and the Azats like Gnel and all the Naxarars of the land prefer his lordship over them than yours. Now they say, ‚Äòlook and see what you do, king, so that you can save yourself‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Believing the words of Tirit, Arsaces II became agitated and did confirm the statements of Tirit.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II from then until Gnel's death had a grudge against Gnel which he had frequently tried to persecute and plot treachery against him for a long time.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 From that moment Gnel was on the run with his wife from his uncle. Arsaces II did eventually kill Gnel around the time of the festival of Nawasard as his falsely lured his nephew and his wife into Shahapivan a native camping place of the Arsacids which was below a walled hunting preserve based on a lie that Arsaces II wanted to reconcile with Gnel.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 When Gnel was captured by Arsaces II's soldiers he was taken to a nearby hill of the mountain called Lsin where he was executed.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 After the death and burial of Gnel, Arsaces II issued an order to mourn the death of his nephew which Arsaces II weep and mourn for Gnel greatly while Pharantzem mourned so much for Gnel she tore off her clothes, was screaming and cried so much.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Now Tirit had successfully got rid of his cousin, he was unable to control his lust for Pharantzem. Tirit had sent his messenger to Pharantzem a note reading: ‚ÄúDo not mourn so much, for I am a better man that he was. I loved you and therefore betrayed him to death, so that I could take you in marriage‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 In her mourning Pharantzem, raised a protest, pulling out her hair and screaming as she mourned that her husband died because of her. When the Armenians in particular Arsaces II heard the cries of Pharantzem, Arsaces II began to realise the plotting of Tirit and the senseless death of Gnel. Arsaces II was stunned in what happened and had regretted in killing Gnel. For a while Arsaces II, didn't do anything to Tirit. Tirit had sent a message to Arsaces II stating, ‚ÄúKing, I want you to order that I be allowed to marry Gnel‚Äôs wife‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 As Arsaces II heard this he said: ‚ÄúNow I know for sure that what I have heard is accurate. Gnel‚Äôs death occurred for his wife‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II planned to kill Tirit in return for Gnel's murder. When Tirit heard this, he was in so much fear for Arsaces II he fled at night. Arsaces II was informed that Tirit had left and ordered his soldiers to find Tirit and kill him. His soldiers found Tirit in the forests in the district of Basen and killed him there.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 References Sources * Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, 5th Century * Encyclopaedia Iranica: Armenia and Iran II.

As a flag representing a county it is given special legal status by the UK Flag Flying Regulations. History The flag was adopted by Greater Manchester County Council in 1974, and derives from the shield and crest design on the coat of arms of Greater Manchester; the design itself is used by a number of organisations that represent the Greater Manchester area, such as the former Greater Manchester County Council, the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, and the Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force, all of which use ten golden towers on a red background to represent the ten metropolitan boroughs. Description The flag is composed of ten golden castles (arranged in rows of 3‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì2) on a red background, fringed by a golden border in the style of a castle battlement. The blazon is: \\"Gules, ten Towers three two three two, all within a Bordure embattled Or\\". The ten golden castles represent both the urban landscape of Greater Manchester, and its division in to its ten metropolitan districts: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Tameside, Trafford, Salford, Stockport, and Wigan. The red ground represents manpower and the region's red-brick architectural heritage, both legacies of Greater Manchester's industrial past. The embattled border represents the unity and shared future of the region, and its bold, vigilant and forward- looking character.

Anna adjusted her fee according to what the clients could afford to pay, which meant that she occasionally gave free help. She is described as a stout matron with dark piercing eyes and a dark forceful voice, and she was also known for her many black cats. In her capacity as a natural healer, she used herbal medicine: her daughter Kristina participated as her assistant in this field. As a Clairvoyant, she was often consulted for her ability to localise stolen property. She had a good reputation for succeeding with her tasks and was popular. Anna was reputed to be a white witch who could master sorcery, and she was known to threaten men, who had impregnated women and then abandoned them with sorcery unless they took responsibility. In 1847, Anna was convicted to fines or seven days for superstition after having taught the maid Johanna Jonsdotter to put a spell on her fianc√© Johannes Jonsson. As was often the case in court cases against cunning folk, the conviction worked as advertise and gave her more assignments. Anna had eleven children in her first marriage and one in her second, of which two survived to adulthood. She had her godson Karl Hart as well as her maid Ingrid Johansson, called Lill-ingerten, to succeed her. The myths surrounding Kloka Anna is kept at Folklivsarkivet.

The movie aired in the United States of America on July 21, 2012 at 8pm. An Officer and a Murderer has received six award nominations, winning two of these awards. Plot Russell Williams (Gary Cole), known to friends and family as 'Russ', is a Colonel in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He is promoted to base commander at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, and celebrates the promotion with his wife, Mary Elizabeth Harriman (Nahanni Johnstone), at her charity fundraiser. Both Russ and Mary are well-respected members of their small community of Tweed, Ontario. The night after the charity event, a hooded man breaks into a young girls room while she is away with family, stealing underwear, bras, and a picture of the girl at the beach. This intruder is given a face in the next break-in. It is revealed that Russell is the perpetrator after he steals underwear and sex toys, and hides in a woman's closet while she returns to her house at night. Russ leaves her a message on her computer screen before he exits the house, using poor grammar in an attempt to throw any potential investigators off his trail. Throughout the movie, Russ becomes increasingly daring and his crimes escalate from breaking and entering, to sexual assault, to rape, and eventually murder. With the town having labelled the responsible party as the \\"Tweed Creeper\\", Russ takes every opportunity to express how disgusting he thinks this man's actions are. Nobody is suspicious of the Trenton base commander. Detective Jennifer Dobson, a local police officer, teams up with Toronto Detective Nick Gallagher - who is on exchange in Tweed - to investigate the series of breaking and entering cases. They follow Russ's trail through many assaults, as well as the murder of Corporal Marie-France Comeau, an officer under the Colonel's command. The detectives' big break comes when Dobson is driving around on patrol and spots a vehicle parked in a field next to a house. She does a quick investigation, and when she finds nobody home, she moves on. When the woman who lived in that house, Jessica Lloyd, is reported missing and the SUV is gone, the police launch an investigation into the vehicle. Through the use of traffic checkpoints, the police match the treads of the tires to the vehicle of Colonel Williams. The detectives devise a plan to call Russ in with the story of needing his help in the cold case. He willingly complies and agrees to answer some routine questions. Russell removes his boots in the hallway, and while he is in the interrogation room with Detective Gallagher, Detective Dobson runs his boot prints. When they match those found on the scenes of the crimes, two teams are deployed to search Russell's Tweed home and his office at the Trenton Base. The panties and bras are found, alongside a staggering amount of photo and video evidence, and a record of all the undergarments he had stolen. In the interrogation room, Gallagher switches from small talk and easy questions to a more serious and invasive line of questioning. Eventually, Dobson joins Gallagher and they inform Russell Williams of all the evidence they found against him. The detectives coax a confession out of the Colonel and he is stripped of his title and his medals. His wife, his friends, his remaining victims, and his community are left to deal with the repercussions, as well as the 3000 military personnel who were under his command.

The film's writer, Keith Ross Leckie, defended the movie against critics claiming it was insensitive and ignored the facts in favour of sensationalizing the story. Leckie told The Star that they were very careful in how they went about the making of An Officer and a Murderer, recognizing the sensitive material. The release of the movie was delayed for a year in an attempt to distance the recreation from the actual events. Police, victims, and families of victims were all contacted before writing began, and Leckie went to the houses where the attacks occurred so he could tell the story with as much accuracy and empathy as possible. The Huffington Post published an article boldly titled Why Canadians Should Reject The Russell Williams Crime Movie, in which they proclaim that it is a sensationalistic movie created solely for profit, and that it \\"stains the good honour of Canadian women and men in uniform.\\" While citing all the inaccuracies and dramatizations throughout the film, Huffington Post professes that the only parts recreated with precision accuracy are the assaults, rapes, and murders of his victims, forcing them to relive the horrors they are trying to leave behind.

Units from the Algerian Army were attacked by units from the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces on the night of 27 January. The Algerians withdrew after fighting for 36 hours. However, the retaliation came fairly soon, between 13th and 15th february 1976 Polisario units defeated Moroccan troops in the second Amgala battle. Spanish Sahara was one of the last colonial possessions in Africa. Morocco had been fighting Spain for the liberation of this territory since 1957 after the Ifni war while Polisario Front, an organization of the local Sahrawi people, had been fighting for independence since its foundation on 1973. The United Nations had long called for a plebiscite on the future status of the colony, but in November 1975 Spain signed an agreement under which it was split between Morocco and Mauritania with no prior referendum. By January 1976 Morocco controlled most towns in their assigned sector. Thousands of Sahrawi nomads were fleeing east to Algeria. Algeria claimed their troops were providing food and medical supplies to refugees at Amgala, while Morocco said the Algerian troops were heavily armed and were aiding Polisario. The Moroccan attack went in during the night of 27 January, and on 29 January the Algerians withdrew. The number of deaths on either side is disputed, but over 100 Algerians were taken prisoner. The two countries seemed close to war, but after intense diplomacy there were no further engagements between Algerian and Moroccan troops. Background Road map of Western Sahara. The sparsely populated region of Western Sahara was formerly the Spanish colonial possession of Spanish Sahara. It was mainly inhabited by the Zenaga Berbers and Sahrawi people, a nomadic people of mixed Arab and Berber origin who practice Sunni Islam. In 1966 the United Nations General Assembly called on Spain to hold a plebiscite on self-determination for the territory. The United Nations reaffirmed this demand several times in the following years, the last time on 10 December 1975. In May 1973 the Polisario Front was formed to fight for independence. Algeria provided a haven for Polisario and for Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf area. Over the following years, Polisario gained control over large parts of the interior. Polisario's numbers were increased by deserters from the Spanish-led Tropas N√≥madas and territorial police. Under the Madrid Accords of 14 November 1975, Spain agreed to divide the region between Morocco and Mauritania without holding a referendum. Details of the agreement were secret, but seem to have included economic concessions to Spain. The Moroccan army entered Dakhla (formerly Villa Cisneros) on 9 January 1976, and on 12 January was joined by Mauritanian troops. On that day the last Spanish Legion troops left the Western Sahara. Algeria, which had not been consulted in the Madrid Accords, had launched a campaign in support of Western Sahara self-determination. In December 1975 large numbers of Moroccans were expelled from Algeria, and Algeria began to infiltrate troops into Western Sahara. By the end of 1975 there were 20,000 Algerian soldiers in the Spanish Sahara or in the neighboring Tindouf zone. According to the Red Cross, about 40,000 refugees were fleeing eastward to escape the advancing Moroccan forces. Battle Soviet-manufactured 2K12 Kvadrat (SA-6B Gainful) missile batteries in Baghdad. Reporters were shown missiles with Algerian army markings at Amgala after the battle. In January 1976, the Amgala waterhole was being used as a staging point for refugees being evacuated to Algeria, assisted by Algerian troops. According to the Algerians, their troops were supplying refugees with food and medical supplies. The Moroccans said that the Algerians were heavily armed with field guns, mortars, anti-aircraft guns and missiles. Some sources say Polisario fighters were present at Amgala, and Algeria had supplied an SA-6 antiaircraft battery with trained Algerian operators so Polisario could fend off Moroccan aircraft that were using napalm bombs. The Moroccans showed reporters Soviet-made missiles with Algerian army markings at the site a few days after the battle. On the night of 27 January, Moroccan troops surprised the Algerian troops at Amgala. The subsequent engagement lasted for 36 hours. According to Moroccan sources, about 1,200 men were involved in the battle including Algerian soldiers and Sahrawi militia men. The Algerians withdrew on 29 January. A Polisario spokesman said 440 Moroccans were killed. A Moroccan spokesman said only two of the attackers died and fourteen were wounded, while about 200 Algerians were killed and 109 captured. The Moroccans said they also captured twelve Sahrawis from the Polisario Front. The Algerian newspaper El Moudjahid claimed 400 Moroccan deaths, and went on to say Algeria would have chosen more effective weapons and a more strategic location than the Western Sahara if the intent had been to attack Morocco. International Red Cross officials confirmed the number of Algerian prisoners when they visited them in their place of detention near Rabat. Aftermath The day after the attack, on 28 January Algerian President Houari Boumediene sent messages to heads of state around the world. To leaders of the non-aligned countries he said that Algeria was concerned only with the right to self-determination of their brothers and neighbors in Western Sahara, who were facing what amounted to genocide. To the socialists he talked of the Moroccan imperialist strategy in the region. To the western leaders he talked of the right to a free and fair referendum to determine the future of the country. Algeria also presented their position to the United Nations and its Security Council, and held a series of meetings with Arab leaders. Egypt took the most active role in the follow-up diplomacy, calling for an immediate cease-fire and a meeting between the heads of state of Morocco, Algeria and Egypt to resolve the issue, but this was not accepted. Algeria started to provide arms and training to Polisario forces. On 3 February 1976 Morocco declared that it was willing to submit its dispute with Algeria to arbitration by the Arab League, the Organization of Arab Unity or the United Nations. The U.N. Secretary General appointed Olof Rydbeck, the Swedish ambassador to the U.N. as a mediator. Rydbeck's appointment was welcomed by Algeria, but treated with reserve by Morocco. He visited Western Sahara between 7 and 11 February, visiting El Aai√∫n, Dakhla and Smara. Although he talked to some local people, he was not able to meet Polisario representatives. While this diplomacy was continuing, Morocco and Mauritania were completing their occupation of the territory. On 12 February 1976 the Moroccan army occupied Al Mahbes, a community from the Algerian border that commanded the route to Tindouf. Polisario could not hope to defeat the Moroccan army in open battle, so adopted a guerilla policy of raids and withdrawals to create a zone of insecurity. Renewed fighting flared up at Amgala in February 1976. In an engagement on the night of 14‚Äì15 February a force attacked the garrison that Morocco had left at Amgala, causing several dozen deaths (see Second Battle of Amgala). The Moroccan garrison was almost wiped out. Hassan II of Morocco immediately accused Algeria of involvement in the attack, saying the Algerians had used heavy weapons \\"in numbers conceived for annihilation.\\" Algeria denied that they had participated, and said only Polisario forces had been involved. These two engagements at Amgala are the only two cases where Algerian and Moroccan troops came into conflict during the Western Sahara War. There were many stories of later Algerian involvement, but there was no proof since no Algerian prisoners were taken after Amgala. In Addis Ababa later that month, Algeria worked for recognition of the Polisario Front by the Organisation of African Unity. Spain officially withdrew from the territory on 27 February 1976, and that day Polisario formally proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Algeria recognized SADR on 6 March 1976. The next day Morocco broke off diplomatic relations with Algeria. Later in the spring of 1976, Polisario regained Amgala. Morocco took the position once again in May 1977. Ten years later, with a thawing of relations between Algeria and Morocco, on 25 May 1987 one hundred and fifty Moroccan prisoners of war were exchanged for 102 Algerian soldiers captured during the Battle of Amgala in 1976. Further serious fighting occurred at the oasis in the second Battle of Amgala, when Polisario fighters attacked and temporarily defeated a relatively small number of Moroccan troops before retreating, only to lose the territory to Moroccans again. Civilian casualties and military abuses In April 2013, specialists from the University of the Basque Country and the Aranzadi Science Society were contacted by Saharawi families of victims to investigate the discovery of human remains in the Fadret area near Amgala. DNA tests and a forensic investigation are being carried out by this team, which is also investigating the circumstances of their deaths. The team concluded in September 2013 that 8 Sahrawi civilians, including 2 children, had been arrested in February 1976 by a Moroccan military patrol and executed by gunfire, before being buried on the spot. Dr. Carlos Martin Beristain then concluded: \\"The fact of finding their remains on the spot is symptomatic of extrajudicial executions\\". However, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER), launched by the Moroccan authorities in 2004 to investigate enforced disappearances and other violations, had given no information on the fate of the eight people. The Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), a national body for the protection and promotion of human rights, which had carried out an investigation into four of the eight persons who had been reported missing, had concluded that the four persons had been arrested by Moroccan soldiers near Amgala in February, June and July 1976. The CCDH claims that the four were taken to the military barracks in Smara where they later died. A former Moroccan soldier, M'barek Daoudi, who served more than 33 years in the Moroccan army and retired in 2008, said in an interview that he witnessed the execution of two Sahrawi women in the Amgala area on 12 February 1976.

Piccolo was the commanding officer of the 386th Single Engine Gunnery Training Squadron at Eglin. History With the onset of World War II, the Eglin Field military reservation was greatly expanded when the Choctawhatchee National Forest was turned over to the War Department by the U.S. Forestry Service on 18 October 1940, and a series of auxiliary airfields were constructed from January 1941. The history of Piccolo Field is largely unknown, however in March 1942, the airfield was utilized for training by the Doolittle Raiders in preparation for their raid on Japan. The airfield was apparently used during the late 1950s and early 1960s as part of the CIM-10 Bomarc program. Just north of the airfield are approximately 40 BOMARC Launch shelters, along with several support buildings, large lighting poles and the remains of a security fence (). It is unknown if any missiles were located at the facility. It was likely abandoned in the early 1960s when BOMARC funding was ended. =Current status= The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 9 October 1959 and was inactivated. However, the airfield remains under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) as part of the active Eglin base and is not accessible to the public. Today, it serves as a microwave station.

In 1895 Oliver Kellogg began his undergraduate study at Princeton University, where he earned his master's degree in 1900. With a John S. Kennedy stipend he first studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin and then in 1901/1902 at Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen. At G√∂ttingen in 1902 he earned his PhD with a thesis Zur Theorie der Integralgleichungen und des Dirichlet'schen Prinzips under the direction of David Hilbert. After completing his thesis, Kellogg became an instructor at Princeton and from 1905 at the University of Missouri, where he became a professor in 1910. In World War I he was a scientific advisor at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, where he worked on submarine detection. Kellogg became a lecturer at Harvard University in 1919, an associate professor in 1920, and a professor in 1927. He died of a heart attack while climbing Doubletop Mountain near Greenville, Maine.

As the senior member of the Hamdanid dynasty, he inherited the family power base around Mosul from his father, and was able to secure it against challenges by his uncles. Hasan became involved in the court intrigues of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, and, between 942 and 943, he, with the assistance of his brother Ali (known as Sayf al-Dawla), established himself as amir al-umara, or de facto regent for the Abbasid caliph. He was driven back to Mosul by Turkish troops, however, and subsequent attempts to challenge the Buyids who seized control of Baghdad and lower Iraq ended in repeated failure. Twice, his capital Mosul was captured by Buyid forces, which were, however, unable to defeat local opposition to their rule. As a result of his failures to retain power, Nasir al-Dawla declined in influence and prestige. He was eclipsed by the actions of his brother Ali, who established his rule more firmly over Aleppo and northern Syria. After 964, Nasir al-Dawla's eldest son Abu Taghlib exercised de facto rule over his domains, and in 967, Abu Taghlib and his brothers deposed and imprisoned their father, who died in captivity a year or two later.  Life  = Origin and family = Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty Nasir al-Dawla was born al-Hasan ibn Abdallah, the eldest son of Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah ibn Hamdan (died 929), son of Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al- Harith, who gave his name to the Hamdanid dynasty.Canard (1971), pp. 126, 127 The Hamdanids were a branch of the Banu Taghlib, an Arab tribe resident in the area of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) since pre-Islamic times.Kennedy (2004), pp. 265‚Äì266 The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled Mosul and its region until the late 9th century, when the Abbasid government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in his effort to fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance of the Kurds living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.Canard (1971), p. 126Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 269 Hamdan's possessions were captured in 895 by the Abbasid Caliph al- Mu'tadid, and Hamdan himself was forced to surrender near Mosul after a long chase. He was put in prison, but his son Husayn ibn Hamdan, who had surrendered the fortress of Ardumusht to the Caliph's forces, managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and the Arab and Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strained relationship with the central Abbasid government in Baghdad during the early 10th century.Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 268 Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the Kharijites and the Tulunids, but was disgraced after supporting the failed usurpation of Ibn al- Mu'tazz in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim was governor of Diyar Rabi'a (the province around Nasibin) in 919 and after his death in the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud.Kennedy (2004), pp. 266‚Äì267 Hasan's father Abdallah served as emir (governor) of Mosul in 905/6‚Äì913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated as the political situation changed in Baghad, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful commander of the caliphal army, Mu'nis al-Khadim, in 929 he played a leading role in the short-lived usurpation of Al-Qahir (who would later reign as caliph in 932‚Äì934) against Al-Muqtadir (r. 908‚Äì932), and was killed during its suppression.Canard (1971), pp. 126‚Äì127Kennedy (2004), pp. 267‚Äì268 According to the researcher Marius Canard, Abdallah established himself as the most prominent member of the first generation of the Hamdanid dynasty, and was essentially the founder of the Hamdanid Emirate of Mosul.Canard (1971), p. 127 = Consolidation of control over the Jazira = Map of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids During his absence in Baghdad in his final years from 920/921 on, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to Hasan.Bowen (1993), p. 994 After Abdallah's death, however, al-Muqtadir took the opportunity to avenge himself upon the Hamdanids, and appointed an unrelated governor over Mosul, while Abdallah's domains were divided among his surviving brothers. Faced with the claims of his uncles, Hasan was left in charge of a small portion, on the left bank of the Tigris. In 930, after the caliph's governor died, Hasan managed to regain control over Mosul, but his uncles Nasr and Sa'id soon removed him from power and confined him to the western parts of the Diyar Rabi'a. In 934, Hasan again recovered Mosul, but Sa'id, residing in Baghdad and supported by the caliphal government, evicted him again. Hasan fled to Armenia, from where he orchestrated Sa'id's murder. Only then did his troops occupy Mosul and establish him permanently as its ruler. Finally, after defeating caliphal forces under the wazir Ibn Muqla and the Banu Habib, his rivals among the Taghlib, in late 935 the Caliph al-Radi was forced to formally recognize him as governor of Mosul and the entire Jazira, in exchange for an annual tribute of 70,000 gold dinars and supplies of flour for the two caliphal capitals of Baghdad and Samarra.Kennedy (2004), p. 268 Resistance to Hasan's rule outside of his family's core region around Mosul remained, however‚Äîin Diyar Bakr, the governor of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar Mudar, the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira by the end of 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward.Bianquis (1997), p. 104 In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al- Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be explained by the fact that a significant portion of the tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed. = Struggle for control of the Caliphate = Map of the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th and 10th centuries, showing Nasir al-Dawla's Jaziran domains in red While he tried to consolidate his rule over Mosul, Hasan showed himself conspicuously loyal to the Abbasid regime, and refused to support the revolt of Mu'nis al-Khadim against the Caliph al- Muqtadir in 932. Mu'nis succeeded in overthrowing and killing al-Muqtadir, but over the next few years the Abbasid government all but collapsed, until in 936 the powerful governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra'iq, assumed the title of amir al-umara (\\"commander of commanders\\") and with it de facto control of the Abbasid government. The Caliph al-Radi was reduced to a figurehead role, while the extensive civil bureaucracy was cut down dramatically both in size and power.Kennedy (2004), pp. 192‚Äì195 Ibn Ra'iq's position was anything but secure, however, and soon a convoluted struggle for control of his office, and the Caliphate with it, broke out among the various local rulers and the Turkish and Daylamite military chiefs, which ended in 946 with the ultimate victory of the Buyids.Bonner (2010), pp. 355‚Äì356Kennedy (2004), pp. 195‚Äì196 Thus, in the late 930s, Hasan, encouraged by his control over a large and rich domain, entered the intrigues of the Abbasid court, and became one of the main contenders for the title of amir al-umara. At first, Hasan tried to exploit the weakness of the Abbasid government to withhold his payment of tribute, but the Turk Bajkam, who had ousted Ibn Ra'iq in 938, quickly forced him to back down. Hasan then supported Ibn Ra'iq in the latter's quest to regain his lost position. Bajkam tried to forcefully evict Hasan from his Jaziran domains, but in vain, and was eventually killed in a skirmish with Kurdish brigands in early 941.Bonner (2010), p. 355 Hasan's great chance came in early 942, when the Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940‚Äì944) and his closest aides fled Baghdad to escape the city's imminent fall to the Barids of Basra and sought refuge at Mosul. Hasan now made a direct bid for power: he had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated and succeeded him as amir al-umara, receiving the honorific laqab of Nasir al- Dawla (\\"Defender of the Dynasty\\"). He then escorted the Caliph back to Baghdad, which they entered on 4 June 942. To secure his position further, Nasir al-Dawla married his daughter to the Caliph's son.Bowen (1993), pp. 994‚Äì995 Along with their cousin, Husayn ibn Sa'id, Nasir al-Dawla's brother Ali was instrumental in the Hamdanid enterprise, taking the field against the Baridis, who still controlled the rich province of Basra and were determined to regain Baghdad. After scoring a victory over them at the Battle of al- Mada'in, Ali was awarded the laqab of Sayf al-Dawla (\\"Sword of the Dynasty\\"), by which he became famous.Kennedy (2004), p. 270 This double award marked the first time that a laqab incorporating the prestigious element al-Dawla was granted to anyone other than the wazir, the Caliphate's chief minister, and was a symbolic affirmation of the military's predominance over the civil bureaucracy. The Hamdanids' success and rule over the Abbasid capital lasted for little more than a year. They lacked funds and were politically isolated, finding little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the Samanids of Transoxiana and the Ikhshidids of Egypt. Consequently, when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, Daylamites, Carmathians and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turkish general Tuzun, they were forced to quit Baghdad and return to their base, Mosul.Bowen (1993), p. 995 Caliph al-Muttaqi now appointed Tuzun as amir al-umara, but the Turk's overbearing manner induced al-Muttaqi to once again seek refuge in the Hamdanid court. The Hamdanid forces under Sayf al-Dawla took the field against Tuzun's army, but were defeated. The Hamdanids now concluded an agreement with Tuzun which allowed them to keep the Jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern Syria (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for an annual tribute of 3.6 million dirhams. In the meantime, the Caliph was brought to Raqqa for greater safety, while Husayn ibn Sa'id tried to secure control over northern Syria and pre-empt Egypt's ruler Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid taking control of the region. The attempt failed, as al-Ikhshid himself advanced into Syria, took Aleppo and marched to Raqqa, where he met the Caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried to persuade al-Muttaqi to come to Egypt under his protection, but the Caliph refused, and al-Ikhsid returned to Egypt. Instead, al-Muttaqi, persuaded by Tuzun's assurances of loyalty and safety, returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, replacing him with al-Mustakfi (r. 944‚Äì946).Kennedy (2004), p. 196 At the news of this crime, Nasir al-Dawla again refused payment of tribute, but Tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance. Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad, but he would find it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over the city he once ruled, and the subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it.Kennedy (2004), pp. 270‚Äì271 = Wars with the Buyids = Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries In late 945, Tuzun died. His death weakened the Abbasid government's ability to maintain its independence against the rising power of the Buyids, who under Ahmad ibn Buya had already consolidated control over Fars and Kerman, and secured the cooperation of the Barids. Al-Mustakfi's secretary, Ibn Shirzad, tried to confront the Buyids by calling upon Nasir al- Dawla, but Ahmad advanced on Baghdad with his troops, and in January 946 he obtained his appointment as amir al-umara with the honorific Mu'izz al-Dawla (\\"Strengthener of the State\\").Bonner (2010), p. 356 To secure their position, the Buyids immediately marched against the Hamdanids. Nasir al-Dawla countered by marching down the eastern bank of the Tigris river and blockading Baghdad. In the end, however, the Buyids defeated the Hamdanids in battle and forced Nasir al-Dawla to retire to Ukbara. From there, Nasir al-Dawla began negotiations with the Buyids, aiming to secure recognition of Hamdanid control over the Jazira, Syria and even Egypt as tributaries of the Caliphate, with the boundary between Buyid and Hamdanid spheres placed at Tikrit. Negotiations were disrupted by a rebellion among the Hamdanids' Turkish troops, but Mu'izz al-Dawla, who for the moment preferred a stable Hamdanid state to anarchy on his northern border, helped Nasir al-Dawla suppress it. The peace was agreed on the terms outlined above, and was affirmed by one of Nasir al-Dawla's sons being taken as a hostage to Baghdad. Conflict between the two rivals was renewed in 948, when Mu'izz al-Dawla again marched against Mosul, but was forced to cut off his campaign to assist his brother Rukn al-Dawla, who was having trouble in Persia. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla agreed to recommence the payment of tribute for the Jazira and Syria, as well as to add the names of the three Buyid brothers after that of the Caliph in the Friday prayer. Another round of warfare erupted in 956‚Äì958. While the Buyids were preoccupied with the rebellion of their Daylamite troops under Rezbahan ibn Vindadh- Khurshid in southern Iraq, Nasir al-Dawla took the opportunity to advance south and capture Baghdad. After the suppression of the Daylamite revolt, however, the Hamdanids were not able to maintain their position in the face of the Buiyd counteroffensive, and abandoned the city.Kennedy (2004), pp. 221, 271 Peace was renewed in exchange for the recommencement of tribute and an additional indemnity, but when Nasir al-Dawla refused to send the second year's payment, the Buyid ruler advanced north. Unable to confront the Buyid army in the field, Nasir al-Dawla abandoned Mosul and fled to Mayyafariqin and then to his brother Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. The Buyids captured Mosul and Nasibin, but the Hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their home territory in the mountains of the north, taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers. As a result, the Buyid army was unable to support itself in the conquered territory, all the more since the predominantly Daylamite troops were resented by the local people, who launched guerrilla attacks on them.Kennedy (2004), p. 271 Sayf al-Dawla tried to mediate with Mu'izz al-Dawla, but his first approaches were rebuffed. Only when he agreed to assume the burden of paying his brother's tribute for the entire Diyar Rabi'a did the Buyid ruler agree to peace. This agreement marks the reversal of roles between the two Hamdanid brothers, and the establishment of the predominance of the family's Syrian branch. In 964, Nasir al-Dawla tried to renegotiate the terms of the arrangement, but also to secure Buyid recognition for his eldest son, Fadl Allah Abu Taghlib al-Ghadanfar, as his successor. Mu'izz al-Dawla refused Nasir al-Dawla's demands, and again invaded Hamdanid territory. Once again Mosul and Nasibin were captured, while the Hamdanids fled to the mountain fortresses. As in 958, the Buyids were unable to maintain themselves for long in the Jazira, and soon an agreement was reached which allowed the Hamdanids to return to Mosul. This time, however, Abu Taghlib emerged as the effective leader in his father's place: it was with him, rather than the aged Nasir al-Dawla, that Mui'zz al-Dawla concluded a treaty. The end of Nasir al-Dawla's rule came in 967, in the same year that saw the deaths of his brother Sayf al-Dawla and his great rival Mu'izz al- Dawla. Nasir al-Dawla was reportedly so much affected by his brother's death that he lost interest in life and became remote and avaricious. In the end, Abu Taghlib, already the de facto governor of the emirate, deposed him with the aid of his Kurdish mother, Fatima bint Ahmad. Nasir al-Dawla tried to counter them by turning to one of his other sons, Hamdan, but he was seized and imprisoned in the fortress of Ardumusht, where he died in 968 or 969. = Domestic policies = Nasir al-Dawla was heavily criticized by contemporaries for his oppressive fiscal policies and the suffering they caused among the population. The traveller Ibn Hawqal, who visited Nasir al-Dawla's domains, reports in length on his seizure of private land in the most fertile regions of the Jazira, on flimsy legal pretexts, until he became the greatest landowner in his province. This was linked with the practice of a monoculture of cereals, destined to feed the growing population of Baghdad, and coupled with heavy taxation, so that Sayf al-Dawla and Nasir al-Dawla are said to have become the wealthiest princes in the Muslim world.Kennedy (2004), p. 265 Nevertheless, the Hamdanid administrative machinery seems to have been fairly rudimentary, and the tribute paid to the Buyids‚Äîestimated at somewhere between two and four million dirhams, when it was paid at all‚Äîwas a heavy burden on the treasury.

Lingeer Ndoye Demba was the maternal granddaughter of Lingeer Fatim Beye. They both came from the Serer ethnic group. Although the pre-colonial Kingdoms of Sine and Waalo now form part of modern-day Senegal, in pre-colonial Senegambia, present-day Gambia had open-borders with Senegal and share the same historical and cultural heritage. The demarcation of the two countries is purely geographical due to their colonial past, with Britain colonizing the Gambia and France colonizing Senegal. For a background to these events see the History of Senegal, History of the Gambia, Senegambia and Timeline of Serer history. From c. 1367, this maternal dynasty provided many kings of Waalo who rule by the royal title \\"Brak\\".

Origins The origins of the Joos as a matriclan is uncertain. What is known is that, it is just one of the many Serer matriclans which were in existence at the time of the Lamanes.BIFAN (1955), pp 313‚Äì326 The Lamanes were the old Serer kings. The exact period within the Serer calendar that this matriclan first acquired notoriety in Serer country is a matter of conjecture. Other than being in existence at the time of the Lamanes little is known about which part of the Lamanic period it first gained prominence. According to some sources, it was prominent by the first half of the 14th century. This corresponds to the collapse of the Lamanic Era (see also Lamane Jegan Joof, the Joof family and Guelowar).Diouf, \\"Chronique du Royaume du Sine\\", p 705 (p 3)Sarr, Alioune, Histoire du Sine-Saloum (S√©n√©gal).

The princess Lingeer Ndoye Demba (founder of this dynasty in Waalo) descended from the maternal line of Lingeer Fatim Beye,Many variations: Fatimata Beye (see BIFAN, 1979, pp 225, 233), Fatim/Fatimata Beye (see BIFAN, 1979, p 234), Fatime Bey (BIFAN, 1979, p 234), etc. The Serer surname Beye or B√®ye, following its French spelling in Senegal is also a Serer matriclan. Fatim (proper: Fa tim) in Serer language means \\"the maternal clan of...\\" For more on Serer matrilineality, see Jean-Marc Gastellu ¬´ 'Petit trait√© de matrilinarit√©.

Lingeer Fatim Beye is the maternal grandmother of Ndoye Demba and ancestor of all the Joos that came after her. In some sources, she is cited as the founder of the Joos Dynasty.BIFAN (1979), p 234Dyao, Yoro (1912) Lingeer Fatim Beye who was a contemporary of Ndiadiane Ndiaye the possibly mythical founder of the Jolof Empire, is also reported to have been married to Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh (var: Manyeasa Wali Dione) at one point. Maysa Wali was the first member of the Guelowar Dynasty to rule in Sine or any of the Serer kingdoms after a severe defeat inflicted on his family (the Guelowars) by the √ëaancos. The √ëaancos were for several centuries until 1865 (the Battle of Kansala) the reigning and powerful maternal dynasty of Kaabu (in present-day Guinea-Bissau). They defeated the Guelowars at the Battle of Troubang, an alleged dynastic war between the royal houses of Guelowar and √ëaancos. In fact there was no \\"Battle of Troubang\\". In reporting this tradition, Henry Gravrand did not notice that this is actually a description of the 1867 (or 1865) Battle of Kansala although the departure of the Guelowar can probably be explained by a war or a conflict of succession.Sarr, Alioune, Histoire du Sine-Saloum (S√©n√©gal) Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker. 1986‚Äì87, p 19 Having escaped Kaabu, the country of their birth, they were granted asylum by the Serer nobility¬´ Babacar S√©dikh Diouf ¬ª in Ngom, Biram La question Gelwaar et l‚Äôhistoire du Siin, Dakar, Universit√© de Dakar (1987), p 69 to which Lingeer Fatim Beye's family were a member of. The marriages between the upper echelons of Serer and Guelowar society sealed the union between Serer-Guelowar. In 1350, Maysa Wali was nominated and elected Maad a Sinig (king of Sine) by the people of Sine, having served as legal advisor to the nobles that granted him and his family asylum. He ruled from 1350 to 1370. The penetration of the Joos matriclan of Sine in the Wolof Kingdom of Waalo came via Lingeer Ndoye Demba. The Kingdom of Waalo was ruled by the Mbooj paternal familyVariations: Mbodj, Mboj, etc. who went by the royal title Brak (title for the kings of Waalo). As well as this patrilineal mode of succession, a Brak had to belong to one of the main three royal matriclans before being eligible to succeed to the throne. These three maternal clans were the reigning maternal dynasties of Waalo and included: the Joos Maternal Dynasty (of Serer origin), TedyekMany variations: T√©diek (see Brigaud) or Teedyekk (see Barry) (of Fula origin although other sources suggests a Mende origin¬´ Amadou Wade, Chronique, comment√© par Vincent Monteil, 1966 ¬ª [in] Sall, Ibrahima Abou, Mauritanie du Sud: conqu√™tes et administration coloniales fran√ßaises, 1890-1945, KARTHALA Editions (2007), p 49, note 20. : :\\"Logar (mot qui serait d'origine berb√©re), Joos (mot qui serait d'origine seereer) et Teej√´k (mot qui serait d'origine mannde)\\" :Translation: Logar (a word of Berber origin [i.e. the Moors]), Joos (a word of Serer origin) and Teej√´k (a word of Mande origine).

Succession was patrilineal (kurcala in Serer, meaning paternal inheritanceBecker, Charles: \\"Vestiges historiques, tr√©moins mat√©riels du pass√© clans les pays sereer\\", Dakar (1993), CNRS ‚Äì ORS TO M.

See also pages 38, 95-99, 104, 119‚Äì20, 123, 160, 172‚Äì4 (Retrieved 9 July 2012) in Serer). Lingeer Ndoye Demba (princess of Sine) was given in marriage to the king of Waalo (Brak Caaka Mbooj) when he visited the Sine. The royal wedding took place in Sine, and after the marriage, the princess accompanied her husband to his country (Waalo). The Joos Maternal Dynasty although long established in Sine, and just one of the many Serer matriclans, it was the newest addition to the medieval maternal dynasties of Waalo. The other maternal dynasties of Waalo (Tedyek and Loggar) were already established. The mother of Brak Caaka Mbodj was a Loggar and his first wife (Lingeer Isa Tanor) a Tedyek. Isa Tanor descended from the maternal line of Guet May Beut (the matriarch of the Tedyeks). For the next six hundred years since its foundation to the dissolution of Waalo in 1855, royal princes from these three maternal dynasties engaged in dynastic civil wars in order to secure their succession to the throne. In the 18th century, the prince M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy Mbooj (later ‚Äì Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy Mbooj, reigned c. 1734 ‚Äì 1735, according to Amadou WadeAccording to Amadou Wade, M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy reigned from 1734 to 1735 and was assassinated on the day of his coronation. see ¬´ Amadou Wade, \\"Chronique du Walo\\", in Barry (1985), p 312), who was then the head of the Joos Dynasty galvanised the support of his maternal clan and led a massacre of the other maternal dynasties of Waalo, particularly the Tedyeks, the biggest rivals to the Joos. Many prominent members of the Tedyek clan were killed by the Joos including the reigning king at the time Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou (Tedyek),Variations: Brak Y√™rim Ndat√® Bubu; also for Talaata-i-Ndeer see BIFAN 1964: \\"Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire\\", Bulletin, Volumes 26-27, IFAN (1964); & Monteil, Esquisses s√©n√©galaises) as well as his family. This historical event precipitated the Battle of Nder more commonly referred to as Talaata-i-Ndeer by the Senegambian people. The phrase \\"Talaata-i-Ndeer\\" (or Talaata i Ndeer / Nder) means \\"Tuesday of Ndeer\\", signifying the fact the event took place on a Tuesday at the then capital of Waalo (Ndeer or Nder). Other sources seems to indicate that, either the Joos family did not cause the Battle of Nder (Talaata √ë'Deer among some) or there were two historical battles of Nder (one during the reigns of Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou and Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy or during the reign of Brak Njaak Kumba Xuri Yaay). According to some, the battle was caused by the Fulani Almamy of Futa Toro who led a surprised attack at Nder after Brak Njaak Kumba Xuri Yaay (the king of Waalo)Variation: Brak Ndaak Kumba Xuri Yaay (see Universit√© de Dakar. D√©partement de langues et civilisations germaniques, √âtudes germano-africaines: revue annuelle du D√©partement de langues et civilisations germaniques de la Facult√© des lettres et sciences humaines de l'Universit√© de Dakar (S√©n√©gal), Issue 6, Le D√©partement (1988), p 51) had left his capital (Nder) on a visit to Ndar (St. Louis, in Senegal).Universit√© de Dakar.

However, this was an error, based on the previous and wrongly held belief that Ndiadiane Ndiaye (var. Ndyaadyaan Ndyay, see Barry, 1985, p. 41) was the son of the 11th century Almoravid leader (Abu Bakr ibn Umar) who died in November 1087 (a contemporary of Amar Godomat or Ama G√¥d√¥ Maat, not Ndiadiane). However, that previously held assumption has been discarded. The general consensus is that, Ndiadiane Ndiaye's reign (and thus his contemporary maternal half brother) is placed within the later half of the 14th century (1360), which was 10 years after the reign of Maysa Wali king of Sine. For a review and analysis of Amadou Waad's Chronique du Waalo, see Barry (1985, especially pages 41, 147) and 1972. For Ndiadiane's reign, see Fage, John, D., & Oliver, Roland, The Cambridge history of Africa: From c. 1600 to c. 1790, p 486, . For Maysa Wali's reign, see Sarr, Alioune's, Histoire du Sine-Saloum (S√©n√©gal) (introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker)', in Bulletin de l'IFAN, vol. 46, series B, nos 3-4, 1986‚Äì1987, p 19, . ::Also see Lingeer Ndoye Demba which contains the genealogy of this family. Another reason for this confusion is that, the original battle instigated by the Joos, created a civil war which lasted for several years (20 years according to some or 29 years) That civil war may have continued right up to the reign of Brak Njaak Kumba Xuri Yaay who reigned long after Brak Yerim Ndateh Boubou and Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy.For the kings of Waalo, see Barry (1985) The surprise attack launched in Waalo against Brak Njaak Kumba Xuri Yaay's capital (Nder) by the Almamy of Futa, was just one of many of his jihadic expeditions especially in Jolof and Cayor. He was finally defeated by the Damel of Cayor (Amari Ngoneh Ndela or Amari Ngon√© Ndella, reigned 1790‚Äì1809Diop, Papa Samba, Glossaire du roman s√©n√©galais, L'Harmattan, Paris (2010), pp 142‚Äì143, ). Following the \\"Joos Wars\\" led by their leader M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy, the throne of Waalo was secured by the Joos family who spend a long time waging wars to retain it. However, long after the death of Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy, the throne was peacefully handed over to the rightfully elected king (a Tedyek) by the Council of Electors (the Sek ak BaorThe Seb ak Baor or proper: Seb ak Baor was the noble council responsible for electing the kings (Brak) from the royal family of Waalo or Seb ak Baor). Although Brak M√∂ Mboj Maalik Mboj (a Loggar) was the last Brak of Waalo just before the collapsed of the monarchy in 1855Barry, (1985), p 41 under Lingeer Ndateh Yalla Mbooj (a Tedyek) and her husband Morosso Tasse Jobe (prince of Cayor), the political scene of Waalo was dominated by the Joos and Tedyek Dynasty for nearly 600 years.See Barry (1972 & 1985); and Wade The greatest threat to the Joos were the Tedyeks, who provided more kings of Waalo.Ogot, Bethwell A., Africa from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century, (Editors: Bethwell A.

International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa, University of California Press (1992), p 281, The \\"Joos\\" (Retrieved 11 July 2012) The Loggars were prominent during early part of the Mbooj paternal dynasty, but lost their dominance later on. In the 18th century, they tried to allied themselves with the Joos in order to gain power and succeed to the throne. The Joos ‚Äì Loggar alliances dominated the political scene of Waalo in this period. It also exacerbated the political situation of the country and the civil war. In this period where every maternal family tried to advance their own cause, alliances were formed and broken (see list of kings below, \\"Brak Yerim Kode Fara Mbune\\"). The powers of these maternal dynasties were very real. They were able to raise an army as in the Battle of Nder; had the financial capacity and backing to ensure the accession of their clan members. The enthroned Lingeer - Njombot Mbooj,Many variations: Ndieumbeutt Mbodj, see Barry (1985), or Ndy√¥mb√¥t, see BIFAN 1969, other var. Jombot. the full blood sister of Ndateh Yalla and daughter of Brak Amar Fatim Borso Mbooj (a Joos), is reported to have bribed a prominent member of the Council of Electors by the name of Jawdin SharluThere are many variations in the spelling of Jawdin (following its English spelling in the Gambia), e.g. Dyawdin (French spelling in Senegal), etc. Jawdin Sharlu was a member of the Council of Electors (Sek ak Baor, or \\"seb ak baor\\" see Barry 1972, p 286; and BIFAN 1969, p 409). His name is Sharlu. The name Jawdin is a title of nobility in Waalo. The noble Council was composed of three groups of nobles: Jawdin (Serer and Fula origin), Maalo or Malo (usually Serer) and Jogomay or Dyogomay (usually Fula). This Council elected the kings of Waalo according to a pre-defined criteria. For more on this, see the Coronation of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, see also Wade; and Barry 1972 & 1985 (var.

Both were from the Joos matriclan. Lingeer Mbarika Mbooj (var. Mborika or Mbarika Mbodje) was the mother of Brak Yerim Kode Ngone, the head of the 17 princes of Joos. Although the Jolof Empire collapsed in 1549 following the Battle of Danki, some kings of Jolof (Bourba) tried to rejuvenate the old Empire. As a council member of her son's court, Brak Yerim Kode Ngone spent many years of his reign trying to repulse the Jolof advance and liberate Waalo from the yoke of Jolof. He is reported to have died fighting his last war with Jolof. He is one of the most revered kings of Waalo for his part in achieving Waalo's independence, free from Jolof control. Waalo was totally liberated from the influence of Jolof few years after his death. List of kings The following is a list of some of the Braks of Waalo who partains to the Joos Maternal Dynasty. Their surname is Mbooj : *Brak Yerim Mbanyik Ndoye Demba Mbooj (var. Y√©rim Mbanyik Ndoy Demba), most probably reigned from c. 1403 to 1410Barry (1985) p 327 (Retrieved 21 July 2012) (or 1445‚Äì1457 according to some). Son of Lingeer Ndoye Demba and Brak Caaka Mbaar. When the Jaw and Gaye family tried to launch a war against him to have him dethroned, he defeated them with his army and forced them to seek refuge in Tekrur now Futa Toro in Senegal.Monteil, pp 39-40 *Brak Kiou Kouli (var.

He was the head of the 17 princes of Joos and one of the most revered Braks of Waalo. *Brak Fara Kumba, reigned c. 1665 ‚Äì 1673 (first), c. 1664 ‚Äì 1676 (second). According to some, he died in 1676 during the Marabout wars launched against him (the jihads of Senegambia launched by the Muslims). *Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy Mbooj, reigned c. 1734 ‚Äì 1735. One of the best known Braks of Waalo, although for the wrong reasons. Instigated and led the Joos at the Battle of Nder. The Joos were victorious. After the killing of the reigning Brak ‚Äì Yerim Ndateh Boubou (Tedyek), Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy entered the residence of his own paternal aunt ‚Äì Lingeer Condama (var. K√¥ Ndama, a Tedyek) and assassinated her. Lingeer Condama was accused of favouring her own maternal nephew (Brak Yerim Ndateh Bubou) against her paternal nephew (Brak M√∂ Mb√¥dy Kumba Khedy), and engaging in the political affairs of Waalo which were detrimental to the Joos cause. According to Amadou Wade, he was assassinated on the day of his coronation. It is advanced that, a professional assassine from Trazar, by the name of Solomono was hired to carry out the mission.For more on this see Wade, see also Barry 1985 *Brak Yerim Kode Fara Mbune Mbooj (var. Y√©rim Kod√© Mbun√®Barry (1985), p 185 or Y√©rim Kod√© Fara Mbouma), He came to power having allied himself with his matriclan (the Joos) and the Loggars, especially Ndyak Xuri (var. Njaak Xuri). His predecessor Yerim Mbanyik Anta (Tedyek) was killed along with several Tedyek princes. His Loggar ally (Ndyak Xuri) was hoping to succeed to the throne after the demise of the Tedyek, however, he didn't succeed to the throne. After their victory, Yerim Kode Fara Mbune succeeded to the throne and his Loggar ally was exiled to Jolof. About two years after his reign (according to some), Ndyak Xuri, leading the Loggar clan, formed an alliance with the Lamtoro of Futa Toro and the Emir of Trazar in order to dethrone Yerim Kode Fara Mbune. At the Battle of Mbuden, Yerim Kode Fara was killed along with many members of the Joos family.Barry, (1985), pp 185‚Äì6 *Brak Maboje Kumba (var. Mabodje Coumba) reigned 6 November 1775 ‚Äì 5 May 1776. His reigne coincided with the battles involving the Joos and Loggar, the intervention of governor O'Hara in Waalo's civil war and Moorish interference in the country's politics.Barry (1985) pp 185‚Äì7 *Brak Saayodo Yaasin Mb√¥dy Mbooj (var. Saayodo Yassin Modi or Sayodo Yacine Mbodje), reigned c. 1801 ‚Äì 1806Zaghi, Carlo, \\"L'Africa nella coscienza europea e l'imperialismo italiano\\", Guida (1973), p 288 or 1805‚Äì1810 Barr, (1985), pp 320‚Äì28 *Brak Amar Fatim Borso Mbooj (var. Amar Faatim Bors√¥ or Amar Faty Mborso), reigned 1812‚Äì1823, (probably reigned up to 1825 or 1826, because he is reported to have died in January 1826Barry, (1972), p 261). Known for his anti-Islamic views. He is cited to have said a Brak should never convert to Islam. That was after the Almamy of Futa Toro (Almamy Biran) launched his jihad in his country among other Senegambian states such as Jolof and Cayor, and converted the king of Jolof as well as Brak Fara Penda Tigereleh (a Tedyek and predecessor of Brak Amar Fatim Borso). The Joos, led by Amar Fatim and other clan members, regarded Fara Penda as too weak for converting through fear, rather than standing up to the Almany. Although Fara Penda stated his conversion was sincere, he was not believed. Amar Fatim is also the father of Lingeer Ndateh Yalla and Njombout (both Tedyeks, their mother Lingeer Awo Fatim Yamar Khuri Yaye Mbooj). *Kharfi Khari Daaro (var.

Founded in the 1730s and known in the Colonial period as \\"Moore's Morning Choice\\",Stein, p. 197. it was one of the earliest forced-labor farms in Howard County, Maryland. Its 1738 plantation house is one of the finest examples of Colonial Georgian architectural style in Maryland. From the late 17th century until 1962, the property was privately owned and associated with important personages from the late 17th century to the 20th century, including Dr. Mordecai Moore, Caleb Dorsey, Alexander Contee Hanson, and David K. E. Bruce. The property was then successively owned and maintained as the Belmont Conference Center, by the Smithsonian Institution, the American Chemical Society, and Howard Community College. It is now the 68-acre Belmont Manor and Historic Park, owned by Howard County and its Department of Recreation and Parks. It adjoins Patapsco Valley State Park. Facilities on the estate include the Belmont Manor House, a carriage house, a cottage, a large barn, formal gardens, a pond, and an aqua garden. It is listed on the Maryland Historic Trust (MHT), Inventory of Historic Properties (MIHP), and is on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as part of the Lawyers Hill Historic District, Elkridge, Maryland. History =17th‚Äì19th century= An original reproduction of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart hung in the mansion for over a hundred years. Dr. Mordecai Moore, who helped found the Society of Friends in Maryland, received a tract of 1,368 or 1,662 acres of land granted by King William III's 1695 land patent. The tract, called Moore's Morning Choice, sat on a ridge above Elkridge Landing with views of the lower Patapsco River Valley.Stein, pp. 41 and 242. About 1735, this land and an adjoining tract called Rockburn were purchased by Caleb Dorsey (1710‚Äì1722), of Hockley-in-the-Hole on the Severn River, an early industrialist and farmer. Dorsey operated forges and iron furnaces along the Patapsco River, near Elkridge. Dorsey and his sons Edward and Caleb, Jr., enslaved up to 94 people to work the land for cash crops. In 1738, Caleb Dorsey, Jr. built a house he dubbed \\"Belmont\\". A pig iron forge was operated onsite along with nearby forges at Avalon and Hockley in a Hole. Caleb Dorsey and his wife Pricilla Hill (died 1781) were buried at Belmont. Caleb Dorsey Jr.'s son Edward inherited the property and took over the enslavement of the Black people there. Edward later gave the property to his daughter, Priscilla, the wife of Alexander Contee Hanson, a United States senator. After the American Civil War, Belmont became the social center of a new wealthy elite, notably the many lawyers who built homes at \\"Lawyer's Hill\\" near the Belmont property.Stein, p. 133. From 1873 to his death in 1880, Charles Grosvenor Hanson allowed the house to fall into neglect following the death of his wife. An original reproduction portrait of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1794 or 1795 hung in the mansion for a century and was sold in 1913 by the Hanson family to a New York collector for $15,000 to $20,000. Howard Bruce, who bought the house in 1918, was the last owner to use it as a private residence. =Belmont Conference Center= Smithsonian Institution (1962‚Äì1982) In 1962, Belmont was owned by David K. E. Bruce, former ambassador to Britain, France and Germany. He sold the property for $500,000 and then donated Belmont and 339 acres to the Smithsonian Institution for $5.00 as a philanthropic gift. The Smithsonian Institution maintained the property as a conference center. The Belmont Conference Center was established in 1964 and was in almost continuous operation until 2010. Belmont hosted numerous conferences, social gatherings, weddings, meetings, and other functions. Examples of the numerous academic, government, and non-profit conferences held at Belmont include: * In 1967, a conference entitled \\"Bibliography and the historian: the conference at Belmont of the Joint Committee on Bibliographical Services to History\\" * In February 1976, a four-day conference on the use of Human Subjects for Research took place at the Belmont Conference Center. The Belmont Report, resulting partly from this conference, was published in 1979. American Chemical Society (1982‚Äì2004) In 1982, The Smithsonian Institution sold the Belmont Conference Center and the majority of the Center's surrounding land to the American Chemical Society for $2 million. The American Chemical Society continued to maintain the property as a conference center. The John Clare Society of North America held their first international John Clare Conference at the Belmont Conference Center on March 21‚Äì22, 2003. The Society is a non-profit literary organization devoted to the study, preservation, and publication of the works of English poet John Clare. Howard Community College (2004‚Äì2012) In 2004, the American Chemical Society sold the Belmont Estate to Howard Community College (HCC) for $5.2 million, funded in part by a $2.6 million loan from the government of Howard County. The College used it for culinary classes and continued to operate the Belmont Conference Center. On September 30, 2010, Howard Community College announced that it could no longer afford to maintain and operate the Belmont Estate, due to the effects of the economic recession. The government of Howard County, whose loan terms included the right of first refusal, conducted from September 2011 to May 2012 a detailed study of the feasibility of purchasing and operating the property for public purposes. =Belmont Manor and Historic Park= Day of Service Tree Planting in 2012 at Belmont with Governor Martin O'Malley On May 30, 2012, Howard County Executive Kenneth Ulman announced that the County would buy the Belmont Estate from the college in exchange for forgiving the $2.6 million debt and $89,000 in cash. The sale closed on June 21, 2012. The county government also sold 13 acres of the land to developers, retaining 68 acres of the original property. In a radio interview on June 29, 2012, Kenneth Ulman said that the Belmont Estate would complement other Howard County nature attractions, including the Howard County Conservancy, located in Woodstock, Maryland, on a 300-year-old, 232-acre farm; and the James and Anne Robinson Nature Center, located in Columbia, Maryland, on 18 acres of land adjacent to the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area. Howard County subsequently established Belmont Manor and Historic Park in summer/fall 2012. County of Howard. The park is operated by the County's Department of Recreation and Parks, to be used as a conference center and a site for weddings, private parties, and environmental education programs. The Manor opened for public operations in April 2015. Historic preservation The front entrance of the mansion, decorated for the holiday season A number of organizations have played an important role in promoting, and advocating for, the historic preservation of the Belmont Estate. These include the Rockburn Land Trust, the Save Belmont Coalition, Preservation Howard County, Preservation Maryland, the Maryland Environmental Trust, the Friends of Patapsco Valley & Heritage Greenway, Inc, and the Land Trust Alliance. Preservation Howard County's president, Fred Dorsey, a descendant of the original owners of the estate, has said that because of its experience, the county is the rightful owner to provide stewardship of the historic property. Maintenance issues are some of the challenges, including maintaining the exterior that had been coated with lead paint. Historic designations The original historic site nomination for Belmont was researched and prepared in the mid-1970s for the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT). Further research and updates by Howard County and the State of Maryland were carried out in 2010. The Belmont Manor House and Estate are included on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as part of the Lawyers Hill Historic District in Elkridge, Maryland, which was added to the NRHP on September 23, 1993.

Gilliam and David Unruh Alexander Schauss did extensive research into the effects of the color on emotions at the Naval Correctional Facility in Seattle, and named it after the institute directors, Baker and Miller. History In the late 1960s, Alexander Schauss, who now operates the American Institute for Biosocial Research in Tacoma, Washington, studied psychological and physiological responses to the color pink. Schauss had read studies by the Swiss psychiatrist Max Luscher, who believed that color preferences provided clues about one's personality. Luscher noticed that color preferences shifted according to psychological and physiological fluctuations in his patients. Luscher asserted that color choice reflects emotional states. He theorized that one's color choices reflect corresponding changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones. Schauss then postulated that the reverse might also be true; color might cause emotional and hormonal changes, and various wavelengths of light could trigger profound and measurable responses in the endocrine system. In early tests in 1978, Schauss observed that color did affect muscle strength, either invigorating or enervating the subject, and even influenced the cardiovascular system. Schauss began to experiment on himself, with the help of his research assistant John Ott. He discovered that a particular shade of pink had the most profound effect. He labeled this tone of pink \\"P-618\\". Schauss noted that by merely staring at an 18 √ó 24 inch card printed with this color, especially after exercising, there would result \\"a marked effect on lowering the heart rate, pulse and respiration as compared to other colors.\\" In 1979, Schauss managed to convince the directors of a Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington to paint some prison confinement cells pink in order to determine the effects this might have on prisoners. Schauss named the color after the Naval correctional institute directors, Baker and Miller. Baker-Miller Pink is now the official name of the color. At the correctional facility, the rates of assault before and after the interior was painted pink were monitored. According to the Navy's report, \\"Since the initiation of this procedure on 1 March 1979, there have been no incidents of erratic or hostile behavior during the initial phase of confinement\\". Only fifteen minutes of exposure was enough to ensure that the potential for violent or aggressive behavior had been reduced, the report observed. Effects Results of a controlled study by James E. Gilliam and David Unruh conflicted with Baker-Miller Pink's purported effect of lowering heart rate and strength. While the results of Schauss's study at the Naval correctional facility in Seattle showed that Baker-Miller pink had positive and calming effect on prisoners; when the same pink was employed at the Santa Clara County Jail, the prison incident rate increased and even peaked compared to pre-pink months, despite a small decrease in the first month.http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1981/pdf/1981-v10n03-p174.pdf Some researchers believe that the symbolism of the femininity of pink would be a bias in the results of Schauss's studies, highlighting in particular the over- representation of male prisoners in the participants. In culture The band Bakers Pink is named after the Baker-Miller pink phenomenon. A 2013 book, entitled Drunk Tank Pink, is named for the color. Written by Adam Alter, a professor of marketing and psychology at New York University's Stern School of Business, the book describes how features of the environment‚Äîincluding colors‚Äîshape how people think, feel, and behave. A chapter in William Gibson's 2020 novel, Agency is entitled \\"Baker-Miller Pink\\" referring to the color a tangential character, Janice, has painted her living room.

She is known for winning a court battle in 2008‚Äì2009 that reasserted women's right to sunbathe topless on public beaches in Poland. In mid May 2008 Krzysztofek ‚Äì along with her female companion ‚Äì were fined by local municipal officials for sunbathing topless at a public recreation area known as the Arkonka beach (pictured). Both women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to Civil Court in Szczecin. Their first September hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest. On 7 November 2008 judge Beata Szczepa≈Ñska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited, the judge ordered the two defendants to pay a fine of 230 zloty (150 zloty by different source, or ‚Ç¨40, $55) for breaking the rules of conduct. In her decision judge Szczepa≈Ñska also reprimanded the women and said that it is not up to them to teach youngsters human anatomy. However, the court decision was appealed by Krzysztofek's female friend soon afterwards, with the plea of not guilty. Arkonka beach, recreation park and pool in Szczecin The appellate court declared both women to be innocent, because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their nudity, and no complaint was ever filed, or even reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the beach against what is otherwise legal. The appellate court‚Äôs decision was binding, but ‚Äì as noted by journalist Magda Hartman ‚Äì it also created an aura of ambivalence since topless sunbathing in public was therefore declared acceptable but only if no other sunbathers (including families with children) formally object to it.

The organization was founded in 1918 by actor and impresario Maurice Schwartz, to present serious Yiddish drama and works from world literature in Yiddish. At its opening on August 30, 1918, Schwartz's company was housed at the Irving Place Theatre in Union Square, Manhattan.Zalmen Zylbercweig (ed.), \\"Moris (Avrom Moyshe)\\", Leksikon fun yidishn teater [Lexicon of the Yiddish Theatre] (in Yiddish). Vol. 3. New York: Hebrew Actors' Union; Elisheva, 1959. cols. 2327-2368; here: 2334-2340. It performed there for three theater seasons. For the beginning of the 1921/1922 theater season the company moved to the Garden Theatre at Madison Avenue and 27th Street, where they remained on and off for the next four seasons, through spring 1925. It was at the Garden Theatre that Schwartz first billed the company as the Yiddish Art Theatre.Zylbercweig (1959), col. 2336.David S. Lifson (1965). The Yiddish Theatre in America. New York: Thomas Yoseloff. pp. 350-351. Over these first years the company presented works by playwrights including Leonid Andreyev, S. Ansky, Sholem Aleichem, Jacob Gordin, Maxim Gorky, Peretz Hirschbein, David Pinski, Arthur Schnitzler, George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde. The Garden Theatre was part of the second Madison Square Garden complex, and in the face of plans to demolish the complex the Yiddish Art Theatre moved to the Nora Bayes Theater on West 44th Street in fall 1925.Zylbercweig (1959), col. 2340. Their tenancy there was brief, as the next year the Yiddish Art Theatre moved to its own purpose-built theatre: the Louis N. Jaffe Theater, a Moorish Revival theatre on Second Avenue in the heart of the Yiddish Theatre District which Brooklyn developer and prominent Jewish community leader Louis Jaffe had built in 1925‚Äì1926 to house the company. Shows produced by Maurice Schwartz at this new venue included a production of \\"Yoshe Kalb\\" which ran for 300 performances. The Yiddish Art Theatre operated for approximately 32 years from its founding, finally disbanding in 1950.Lifson (1965), p. 370.\\"Maurice Schwartz, Actor, Dead; Founder of Yiddish Art Theatre\\".

Italian writers such as Christine de Pizan, Moderata Fonte, Lucrezia Marinella, and others developed the theoretical ideas behind gender equality. In contrast to feminist movements in France and United Kingdom, early women's rights advocates in Italy emphasized women's education and improvement in social conditions. Italian feminism suffered a setback under the fascist government of Benito Mussolini in the first half of the twentieth century, with fascist ideology dictating procreation as a woman's duty. In the post-war period, feminist movements surged, with public activism over issues such as divorce and abortion during the 1970s. Italian feminism has become more prominent recently, particularly during the administration of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with a focus on opposing objectification of women in national television shows and politics. History =Renaissance and Early Modern feminists= Renaissance thinkers regularly challenged conventional thought from the Medieval period and earlier. Humanism became the new way of looking at politics, science, the arts, education, and other fields. Humanism pushed aside the Medieval Christian concept of a hierarchical social order that placed regular citizens in a subservient position relative to members of the clergy. The Renaissance man was the ideal to emulate. While the Renaissance humanists were for the most part \\"antifeminist\\", there were a small number of educated women who had the motivation to challenge assumptions that women should remain submissive to men. Christine de Pizan wrote The City of Ladies in 1404, and in it she describes women's gender as having no innate inferiority to men's: \\"[N]either the loftiness nor the lowliness of a person lies in the body according to sex, but in the perfection of conduct and virtues\\". However, she tempered her assertions by writing that men were created to rule, and women to follow. Renaissance Italy saw the development of higher education, including the establishment of several universities, to which women were not admitted. Some fortunate women who could afford it were able to gain an education on their own, or had a father who allowed them to have some education through tutoring. The rare Renaissance man who supported education for women saw it as a way of improving her virtue, and to make her more obedient to her husband. Education intended to create leaders was seen as wasted on women. Although some women made a mark during the Renaissance as remarkable individuals within their local sphere, when taken collectively, the \\"rise of the educated woman during the Renaissance\\" can be traced. Outside of a convent setting, where they had been confined during the Middle Ages, educated women were stepping out into the secular intellectual arena. From the Renaissance and continuing into the Early Modern era, they hosted salons, where men and women of intellect mingled and discussed literature, politics, and other influential topics. By the late 16th and early 17th century, women writers \\"presented themselves and were embraced by contemporary culture as learned wives, mothers, and equal partners in their household salons\\". By the late Renaissance, educated Italian women were writing \\"in every conceivable genre, from domestic correspondence to poetry, dialogues and even theology\\".

Educated women who could read and write about feminism's various aspects were in an isolated position. In order to gain supporters for feminist causes, an appeal to women at all levels of society was needed. Beginning in the mid-19th century, enterprising women began to reach out to middle-class women through new print media: mass-market books and periodicals. Italy's Casati Law of 1859 set the groundwork for a system to train young women as teachers in public schools. Women were to become the backbone of Italy's education system, and they belonged to teachers' associations, giving them experience in organizing to protect their interests, such as wages and working conditions. Anna Maria Mozzoni Anna Maria Mozzoni triggered a widespread women's movement in Italy through the publication of Woman and her social relationships on the occasion of the revision of the Italian Civil Code (La donna e i suoi rapporti sociali in occasione della revisione del codice italiano) in 1864. Women who had participated in the unification struggles were dissatisfied with the inequalities contained in the Republic of Italy's new Civil Code. Mozzoni's book raised awareness of injustices in Italy's family law that discriminated against women. Mozzoni campaigned against state regulation of prostitution. She also translated On the Subjugation of Women by John Stuart Mill into Italian. In 1881, to promote women's suffrage, she founded the League for the Promotion of the Interests of Women (Lega promotrice degli interessi femminili) in Milan. 1865 saw legal majority for unmarried women in Italy, as well as equal inheritance for women, and married women being allowed to become the legal guardian of their children and their property if abandoned by their husbands.Judith Jeffrey Howard, \\"The Civil Code of 1865 and the Origins of the Feminist Movement in Italy\\", in The Italian Immigrant Woman in North America, eds. Betty Boyd Caroli, Robert F. Harney and Lydio F. Thomasi (Toronto: The Multicultural History Society of Ontario, 1977) Alaide Gualberta Beccari, beginning in 1868 at the age of 16, began publishing the journal Women in Venice. Beccari spent much of the 1870s and 1880s immersed in spreading information about feminism. The journal covered international feminist news, such as the political and social gains being made by women in France, the United States, and Great Britain. Male legislators and teachers were among her growing readership, and in 1877, a series of articles on pro-reform topics inspired 3000 women to sign a petition for women's suffrage. Women were admitted to Italian universities in 1876. In 1877 women in Italy became able to serve as witnesses to legal acts. Italy's first national Feminist Congress was organized by Per la Donna in 1911; in it speakers called for divorce rights for women, and more non-religious schools. In 1919 married women in Italy were granted separate economy, and public offices on lower levels were opened to women. =Women in Fascist Italy (1922-1945)= Women working in a hat factory, c. 1920. The feminist movement was dealt a huge blow in 1922 when Benito Mussolini came to power, and the country's fascist era was underway. This period was generally anti-feminist. For example, fascist ideology dictated procreation as a woman's duty. However, in 1925 women in Italy gained the right to vote, though it was limited to local elections. In 1945 women in Italy gained full suffrage. =Post-war Italian feminism= In 1966, Franca Viola was one of the first Italian women to publicly refuse a \\"reparational marriage\\" to her rapist, which would have legally exonerated him for raping her. Franca Viola was only 17 years old when she was raped with the intention of marriage in 1965. (See below events in 1981.) As in other countries, feminist groups started in Italy in the 1970s as part of the second wave. In 1970, Rivolta Femminile (\\"Women's Revolt\\") was formed in Rome and Milan by Carla Lonzi and published a manifesto. In 1972 the International Feminist Collective was founded in Italy by Selma James, Brigitte Galtier, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, and Silvia Federici, to promote political debate and action around the issue of housework; the International Wages for Housework Campaign, which grew out of the Collective, was a feminist global social movement founded in 1972 in Padua, Italy. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and childcare are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid wage labor. The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality. In 1975, the family law in Italy was reformed to remove adultery as a crime, as well as making it so that male and female partners in a marriage are considered equal by the law. Specifically, Law no 151/1975 provides for gender equality within marriage, abolishing the legal dominance of the husband. 1975 Italian legal reforms also removed discrimination against children who were not born in wedlock. In 1976 in Sentenza n. 12857 del 1976, the Supreme Court of Italy ruled that \\"the spouse who compels the other spouse to carnal knowledge by violence or threats commits the crime of carnal violence\\" [meaning rape] (\\"commette il delitto di violenza carnale il coniuge che costringa con violenza o minaccia l‚Äôaltro coniuge a congiunzione carnale\\"). Among the other major achievements of feminism in Italy in this decade were the introduction of a law for divorce (1970) and of a law regulating abortion (1978). Italy signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1980, and ratified it in 1985. 1981 saw repeal of the Italian law which provided for mitigated punishment in case of honor killings; prior to 1981, the law read: Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister. Also in 1981, Italy repealed Article 544.Van Cleave, Rachel A. \\"Rape and the Querela in Italy: False Protection of Victim Agency.\\" Michigan Journal of Gender & Law, vol. 13, 2007, pp. 273‚Äì310. This article stated that if a man who raped a woman married his victim, even if she was a minor, any sexual offence would lapse. Neither the law nor society made a distinction between such premarital rape on the one hand, and consensual elopement (in Sicily commonly called fuitina) on the other. Socially, a woman raped by a man was put under heavy pressure to agree to marrying her rapist; the alternative was being shunned for the rest of her life as una donna svergognata: a \\"woman without honor\\" (literally: a shameless woman). She was held responsible for the humiliation of losing her virginity out of wedlock, bringing shame upon herself and her family. If she agreed to marry her attacker, it was considered a \\"reparational marriage\\" (matrimonio riparatore), that restored her family's honor. In Rome in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual (\\"because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex\\"). The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision \\"it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.\\" This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read \\"Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.\\" As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest against erroneous and destructive attitudes about sexual assault. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a \\"denim\\" defense to the charge of rape. In 1996, Italy amended its rape laws, toughening the punishment for sexual assault and reclassifying it from a moral offense to a criminal felony. After a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrant community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n¬∞7/2006 was passed in Italy on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning \\"Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice\\"; the Act is also known as the Legge Consolo (\\"Consolo Act\\") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-Bis and 583-Ter, punishing any practice of female genital mutilation \\"not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs\\" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation). Penalty can be reduced up to if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.Italian Law n¬∞7 1/9/2006, Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile , accessed 23 March 2009. Italian feminism has become more prominent recently, particularly during the administration of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with a focus on opposing objectification of women in national television shows and politics.

The Heartbeat Foundation defines its goals as follows: The primary target of the Heartbeat Foundation is to equip as many non-privately owned sports venues as possible with automated external defibrillators (AED). They also want to ensure that the devices are routinely serviced and that athletes, trainers and first aiders are trained to use AEDs correctly. In Germany, around 60,000 people are victims of sudden cardiac death every year (15,000 in Austria). Treating a victim with an AED within three minutes increases the chances of survival by 70%. The Heartbeat Foundation‚Äôs efforts have a global impact. The advisory council invests all donations in projects to support sports venues. These projects are initiated free of geographical or any other restrictions.

He is introduced in chapter #460 first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on March 1, 1994. Majin Buu is a genie-like magical life form awoken by the evil warlock Bibidi that terrorized galaxies by destroying entire planets, millions of years before the events of Dragon Ball take place. He was temporarily sealed away and brought to Earth; however, Bibidi was killed and Buu remained hidden. During the events of Dragon Ball, he is revived by Bibidi's son Babidi in order to carry on his father's plan to conquer the entire universe. Creation and design Manga author Akira Toriyama stated that when creating a villain in Dragon Ball, he would try to make them different from any that had come before. Although it was difficult and he was usually not entirely pleased with the results, he thinks he did achieve this with Majin Buu. The Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that Majin Buu was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Fuyuto Takeda. Buu, Bibidi and Babidi take their names from the song \\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\\" in the Walt Disney movie Cinderella. Majin Buu has several different forms, each with a different appearance and personality, however, all are pink creatures (with the exception of Pure Evil Majin Buu, which is dark grey) with an antenna on their head and several holes/pores on both sides of their heads, arms, chest and vertebrae. They have a rubbery body (again, with the exception of Pure Evil Majin Buu) that can regenerate instantly from any wound, separate parts of it from themselves and control them independently, and can even completely restore themselves from vapor. Buu can also heal damaged beings, and can absorb other organisms by enveloping them with his body or eating them, the latter done by using his signature attack that turns people into food such as candy. When first introduced he is overweight and wears gloves, boots, a vest, and a cape. His appearance, magical powers, the manner in which he appeared from his ball, longevity, and the manner in which he is summoned to Earth by an evil warlock using the life- force of his victims are all somewhat genie-esque, an aspect further implied in the Japanese word \\"Majin\\" in his name, which can read as \\"Djinn\\", which lead to Viz Media rendering his name as Djinn-Boo for the English manga release. His trousers, in all forms he takes, bear the same \\"M\\" symbol like many other characters associated with Babidi in this part of the manga; whether this is short for Buu's title of \\"Majin\\", Babidi's title of \\"Madoshi\\" in the original Japanese, or something else is unclear. In a 2007 interview printed in Shonen Jump, Akira Toriyama stated that Buu's design was inspired by adaptations of One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) that he watched as a child. Majin Buu's manner is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people. Throughout the series, he is always referred to by either Majin Buu or simply Buu, no matter what form he is in. However, each form has been given their own names in guidebooks, video games or by fans, in order to distinguish between them. When Buu expels the evil inside him, it takes on a taller and much skinnier, frail form referred to as . When this Buu absorbs the fat one, he transforms into a muscular version of himself, referred to as . Personality-wise, Evil Buu is more intelligent than Buu and is described as \\"pure rage\\". This intelligence allows him to plan ahead for the opportunity to absorb Gotenks and Piccolo, and later Gohan. After absorbing the first two, his antennae lengthen forming five full-fingers, Evil Buu gains Piccolo's intellect and momentarily wore Gotenks's vest and strength before his latter victim's fusion wore off. He then absorbed Gohan, gaining his power while wearing his d≈çgi top and undershirt. The last form shown, referred to as Kid Buu or , is actually Buu's original form. Evil Buu was forced into that state after the fat Buu was completely removed from his body along with Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo. While a child-like version of Evil Buu, Kid Buu is completely feral and animalistic, living only to destroy and is called \\"evil incarnate\\". Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide refers to him as the \\"strongest enemy in the universe\\". Even after Kid Buu is killed, the fat Majin Buu lives on Earth now completely kindhearted and known as . In the anime, Buu's \\"Evil\\" and \\"Pure\\" forms' designs differ from the manga in that they both always have five fingers. Voice actors In the original Japanese, Buu and all his forms are voiced by K≈çz≈ç Shioya in all media. He said he looked at the character as a self-centered three-year-old. Even through all the different forms of the character, Shioya explained that he tried not to deviate too far from the personality of the original while subtlety showing that he changed form. In the Funimation dub, Josh Martin voices Fat and Kid Buu, while Justin Cook voices Evil and Super Buu. (w/green checkmark) Meanwhile, in the Ocean Group dubs, Fat Buu is voiced by Scott McNeil, while Evil, Super, and Kid Buu are voiced by Brian Dobson. Powers and abilities Being the final villain faced by the protagonists in the Dragon Ball manga, Buu is the most powerful of them all, possessing vast superhuman strength, speed and reflexes beyond that of a trained Super Saiyan 2. He is able to channel his inner Ki energy for devastating offensive techniques capable of destroying planets or star systems. Buu also holds the unique ability of being able to transform objects or living things into chocolate or other sweet foods which he then consumes to satiate his greed and gluttony. Buu is also able to instantly recover and regenerate from severe trauma, dismemberment and even combustion at a sub- molecular level. Buu can instantly emulate techniques used on him, launching Goku's signature Kamehameha many times. Appearances =In Dragon Ball= Majin Buu in the anime, in the first form he is introduced in Before the events of Dragon Ball, the evil warlock Bibidi resurrected Majin Buu; a being that existed \\"solely to slaughter and destroy\\" and within a few years they destroyed hundreds of planets. Buu even killed two of the five Supreme Kais who govern the universe and absorbed another two including their leader the Grand Supreme Kai, which dulled his destructive nature and turned him into his current form. But Buu was still too ferocious even for Bibidi to control, resulting with the Majin temporarily sealed and moved to their next target, Earth. But the last surviving Supreme Kai took advantage of this to kill Bibidi with Buu sealed away on Earth. In the present day, Bibidi's son Babidi makes it his goal to revive Buu, which the surviving Supreme Kai plans to prevent by killing him. He underestimates the power of Goku and Vegeta, and their spent energy results in Majin Buu's quick revival. When Babidi threatens to re-seal him, Buu begins to obey his orders and destroys and kills everything and everyone in sight in order to get Piccolo, Trunks and Goten to come out of hiding. That is until Goku asks him why he lets Babidi boss him around, leading to Buu killing him, however he continues his mischief and destruction, unaware that what he is doing is wrong. Majin Buu attacks humans, destroying nearly all of the world's population, then builds a house by converting people into clay. He is resting in his house when Mr. Satan befriends him while waiting for an opening to kill him. The friendship coupled with the affection from a dog he healed, has Buu resolve not to kill anymore when two civilians shoot the dog and then Mr. Satan. Buu heals them, but the evil aspect of his personality takes advantage of Buu's rage to manifest out of his body, transforming into a taller and much skinnier Buu, who attacks the now weaker fat Buu. The evil Buu reflects fat Buu's attack, turning his benign counterpart into chocolate and eating him to become whole and transform into a more dangerous Majin Buu, known as Super Buu. Super Buu quickly senses Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten and goes to them, demanding Gotenks fight him. Gohan then arrives and clearly has the upper-hand over Buu, but Buu absorbs Gotenks and later Piccolo. Now stronger than Gohan, Buu, knowing that there is a time limit on Gotenks's fusion, planned ahead and is able to absorb Gohan as well. However, Goku and Vegeta fuse together into Vegito, but, despite being powerful enough to defeat him, they purposefully get absorbed by Buu in order to enter his body. Though the Potara Fusion ran its course, Goku and Vegeta manage to retrieve Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks before they completely separate the absorbed fat Buu from Super Buu. The removal of fat Buu causes Super Buu to revert to his original form, known as Kid Buu, no longer deluded by his benign counterpart as he immediately destroys the Earth. Kid Buu then follows Goku and Vegeta to the Kai's planet, where, after a battle with Goku, he is stalled by Vegeta and fat Buu, so that Goku can finish him off with a giant Spirit Bomb made with energy from the people on the newly resurrected Earth. The good fat Majin Buu goes on to live with Mr. Satan on Earth as Mr. Buu, after the Dragon Balls erase the people of Earth's memories about him. Kid Buu is reincarnated into a child named Uub, whom, ten years later, Goku meets at the Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai martial arts tournament and leaves with to train as his successor. = In Dragon Ball Super = Buu encounters Beerus during Bulma's birthday party, and quickly provoked the deity into a rampage after he childishly refused to share some pudding dessert. Buu is later selected to participate in the Universe 7 team's tournament with Universe 6. He is disqualified before the tournament begins by falling asleep during the exam. Buu agrees to fight with Goku and Gohan in the Universe Survival tournament, being matched against Universe 9's Basil.\\"The Universes' Gods are Aghast! You'll Be Obliterated if You Lose at the \\"Tournament of Power\\". Dragon Ball Super. Episode 78. February 12, 2017. Buu is initially overwhelmed, though becomes enraged over seeing Mr. Satan injured by the battle collaterally and quickly overpowers Basil. After consuming a drug that increases his power, Basil seems to gain the upper hand on Buu with a buffer form coinciding with his attacks, however, Buu is unaffected by the attacks and defeats Basil with a Kamehameha wave. Buu then heals Mr. Satan. After the mini-tournament, Buu begins to train on Earth for the Tournament of Power. Due to the intensity of his training, Buu gains a slimmer and toned body and spars against Goku, beating him. Alas, also due to the intensity of his training, Buu falls asleep and will not wake for 3 months, forcing him to miss the Tournament of Power. Shortly after the events of the Tournament of Power and Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Buu is kidnapped by the Galactic Patrol and taken to their headquarters. Goku and Vegeta are taken as well and find out their kidnapper is Merus, the Galactic Patrol's #1 elite patrolman. Merus explains that an evil criminal named Moro has escaped from galactic prison, and in order to recapture this criminal they need the Grand Kaioshin who is inside of Buu. The Galactic Patrol reveals that the Grand Kaioshin locked away the ancient demon, Moro before Buu had absorbed him. While waiting for Buu to wake, Goku and Vegeta travel to New Namek to battle Moro, who is searching for the dragon balls, but are unsuccessful and have their Saiyan powers taken from them. Buu eventually awakens and is taken to New Namek to confront Moro. During the fight, the Grand Kaioshin takes control of Buu's body and it's revealed that Buu once had god Ki, but it was destroyed when Kid Buu was killed by Goku. No longer having god ki, Grand Kaioshin can't lock away Moro and fails to stop him. After Moro wishes for all the Galactic Patrol's prisoners to escape and come to Namek; Buu, Goku, Merus and Jaco are forced to retreat back to the Galactic Patrol HQ. =In other media= In Dragon Ball GT, an anime-only sequel to the series, both Mr. Buu and Uub participate in battles against foes such as Baby, Super Android #17 and Super One-Star Dragon. They also fuse together, creating a character referred to as \\"Majuub\\" or , essentially recreating Majin Buu once more. Buu is also seen in the 2008 short film Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!! and plays a small role in the 2013 theatrical Dragon Ball Z film, Battle of Gods. Majin Buu briefly appears in an episode of the 1997 anime remake of Toriyama's Dr. Slump, and makes a brief cameo appearance in Toriyama's manga series Neko Majin Z. He also appears in chapter four of the Saiky≈ç Jump manga Dragon Ball SD, a super deformed spin-off of Dragon Ball written by Naho ≈åishi, which depicts a comedic alternate retelling of him being released. ≈åishi drew a special chapter focusing on Buu for the July 2014 issue, titled it also features Toriyama's Neko Majin. He is a playable character in the franchise's video games, the first being Dragon Ball Z: Super But≈çden 3 in 1994, but also in most of the more recent games such as the Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! series. In the 2005 game Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2, Evil Buu creates a dimensional hole that extends to the afterlife, traveling there and encountering Vegeta and Dabura, who team up against him under the conviction that their combined strength can prevail. After the fight, Evil Buu commands Dabura take him to find strong opponents, and meets Cell, pledging to smash him. Evil Buu and Dabura defeat Cell with a combined attack. He is also playable in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump crossover games Battle Stadium D.O.N and Jump Ultimate Stars. He is also referenced in the song \\"Pink Matter\\" by Frank Ocean featuring Andr√© 3000 in the lyrics \\"That soft pink matter, Cotton candy Majin Buu\\". Rapper Denzel Curry also refers to Buu in the song \\"Zuu\\" with the lyrics \\" M's all on my belt, I'm feelin' like I'm Majin Buu\\". Reception Majin Buu is a popular character in the Dragon Ball series, in 2004 Japanese fans voted him the eighth most popular character. He was rated by Wizard magazine as the 40th-greatest villain of all time, the only anime or manga character from Japan to make the list. IGN's David F. Smith states that although he is tough, Majin Buu's pink complexion prevents anybody from taking him as a serious threat. Theron Martin of Anime News Network claims Buu's \\"childlike demeanor actually gives his malicious smiles and mad faces a surprisingly chilling effect\\", claiming it sets him apart from the \\"hyper-evil badasses\\" of the series. He called Josh Martin's English vocal performance far more childish than K≈çz≈ç Shioya's, but also felt that Shioya's voice does not fit Buu's behavior. According to Dennis Amith of J!-ENT, seeing him \\"kill people for the sake of hunger or for enjoyment to hear things go 'boom makes Buu the deadliest villain of the series. Toriyama stated that the fight between Buu and Gotenks was fun to draw because he was able to come up with odd techniques in \\"the spirit of gag manga\\".

In the backstory, the radio did this routinely once every six months. The Radio was supposedly created by an experimental research group at Texas Instruments. The exclamation \\"Gesundheit!\\" (\\"Health!\\", i.e. \\"Bless you!\\") is the German response to someone who has sneezed.Wiktionary: Gesundheit In the artwork's fictional history, it was however not German, but had been designed by the \\"Attenborough Design Group\\", supposed to have been active in the 1970s and 1980s, and an experimental section within Texas Instruments, where it was their first product. Other whimsical artworks with technological inspiration supposed to have been created by the group included the AntiTouch Lamp which avoided human touch, allegedly to protect its halogen lamp. In the fiction, twice a year, the radio's case would lean back and use internal bellows to blow out the accumulated dust, supposedly to protect early microprocessors from dust and ensure a longer life for the device. The artists suggest that this feature is at odds with the built-in obsolescence of many modern gadgets. Continuing the fiction, the radio's users supposedly had the option of overriding the bi-annual sneeze manually, with a SNZ button (not a clock radio's \\"Snooze\\" function) to activate the sneeze. In the fictional history, the experimental research group within Texas Instruments was said to have examined how behaviors in nature could be applied to design; in this case, the ability to sneeze. It was said to be investigating the potential of other animal actions to be used as defense for a 'family' of between 3 and 5 products, and re-interpreting the standing hard drive (an earlier artwork) as a portable floppy disk drive so as to fit in with the Attenborough Design Group's fictional timeline.

The not for profit festival was one of the largest multicultural events in Australia with events attracting over 65,000 people. The festival supported the ‚ÄòHear and Say Centre‚Äô for children born deaf. Italian Week was the brainchild of Cav. Alessandro Sorbello, Executive Producer and researcher, as an experiment in social and cultural identification. The focus of the event design was how these elements generated 'emotional engagement' and thus affected consumer behavior. Cav. Sorbello worked extensively with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop the festival and collaborated with a wide array of cultural, educational and artistic institutions across Australia to deliver the event. History Italian Community in Queensland Beyond the economic benefits the festival provides, is the capacity to reinforce social and cultural identity, adding meaningful understanding to a community‚Äôs composition. Italian Week promoted and highlighted the composition of ethnic backgrounds, cultural panorama and adopted traditions which form the stories of a society. In order to reinvigorate a waning connection within the Queensland‚Äôs Italian community in terms of what it is to be Italian, the Italian Government commissioned a yearly festival to be held as a method of communicating the joy and value of all things Italian. In 2007, the Italian Government identified that as a result of Italian‚Äôs propensity to identify with regions of Italy rather than with a unified Italy as a whole that Queensland‚Äôs Italian community was fragmented and disjointed. At this time these fragmented entities consisted of 44 registered associations as these people identified themselves as Tuscan‚Äôs, Sicilians, and Sardinians etc rather than as Italian‚Äôs. The Consulate further identified a disconnect within second and third generation Italians who no longer identified with their Italian heritage. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a high-level week- long cultural festival be created in Queensland. Specifically developed to dispel out dated stereotypes regarding Italy and to create a platform for cultural and social cohesion. The festival used activities that created emotional engagement with the objective being to unify the Italian community. Italian Week conveyed Italian culture in a broad sense of the word culture: nationality, country, arts, language and food to mention just a few. It can thus be defined as a ‚ÄòCultural Festival‚Äô; a mix of amusement, education, and cultural interaction which triggers identification of the attendees with the Italian culture through experiential meaning, which in turn creates emotional engagement with Italian Week. Italian Week Featured Artists Over its 11-year life, Italian Week hosted over 400 events featuring Italian artists such as Andrea Bocelli, Neapolitan-Austrian baritone singer, songwriter, and producer Patrizio Buanne, Rosario La Spina, Lisa Hunt and many others. The festival hosted events in collaboration with the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Opera Queensland, The Queensland Orchestra, The Queensland Gallery of Modern Art and more. Italian Week was opened by 2 Italian Ambassadors including His Excellency Mr Stefano Starace Janfolla, Italian Ambassador in Canberra, The Premier of Queensland, two Lord Mayors of Brisbane and the Consul General of Italy. The Illumination of Superstructures Commencing in 2009, Italian Week producers developed a concept to create a point of focus for the festival as a means of creating, developing and communicating social identification. Known as the ‚ÄòIllumination‚Äô, this focus point consists of lighting up key structures in the city of Brisbane in the Italian colors of green, white and red for the duration of Italian Week. Humans develop and rely upon the interpretation of symbols for social interaction and understanding and the ‚ÄòIllumination‚Äô was designed to stimulate and create emotional engagement‚Äô engendering identity, commitment and pride within the people of Italian heritage in Queensland. A powerful and emotive symbol, the ‚ÄòIllumination‚Äù was visible for the entire week of the festival and is seen by hundreds of thousands of people. Historically significant buildings and architectural superstructures have been ‚Äòilluminated‚Äô each year, commencing with the Treasury Casino in 2009 then Brisbane‚Äôs iconic Story Bridge in 2011 and in 2012, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Queen Victoria Bridge, Kurilpa Bridge and City Hall have all been lit up in the Italian Colours. The creation of emotional engagement The festival used as a focal point in creating emotional engagement. The aim of this engagement was developing cultural unity and exploring the role emotions play in the creation of successful festival events for Italians and non- Italians alike. The success of the festivals use of engagement produced an enhanced sense of cultural unity leading to a yearning to share and repeat the experience among the attendees, as well as communicating to a wider audience increasing both visitors and an appreciation of what it is to be Italian. Italian Week featured on Qantas in-flight program around Australia and on numerous television shows including the Great South East, Channel 7, RAI international and more. Events in 2015 and 2016 in Brisbane‚Äôs New Farm Park attracted record crowds with over 50,000 visitors to the festival in 2015 and 65,000 in 2019. Academic Research and Publications Italian Week formed a longitudinal study by Italian Week producer, Cav. Alessandro Sorbello and Dr Eliane Karsaklian, senior professor from the Sorbonne (University of Paris). The research team published eight papers on the festival and defined models for creating emotional engagement and ‚Äòfest-vibe‚Äô. In 2016, Sorbello and Karsaklian were awarded International Best Research prize at the University of Florence by the International Academy of Business and Economics. In 2010, Alessandro Sorbello was awarded an Italian Knighthood for his role as Cultural Attache to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and for his ground breaking work in promoting Italian culture in the modern context.

Wasson ingested this species on June 29, 1955.Stafford 1993, p. 233. The experience became the basis for his 1957 essay. \\"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\\" is a 1957 photo essay by amateur mycologist Robert Gordon Wasson describing his experience taking psilocybin mushrooms in 1955 during a Mazatec ritual in Oaxaca, Mexico. Wasson was one of the first Westerners to participate in a Mazatec ceremony and to describe the psychoactive effects of the Psilocybe species. The essay contains photographs by Allan Richardson and illustrations of several mushroom species of Psilocybe collected and identified by French botanist Roger Heim, then director of the French National Museum of Natural History.Stevens 1998, p. 77; Singer 1958. Wasson's essay, written in a first person narrative,Cloud 2007. appeared in the May 13 issue of Life magazine as part three of the \\"Great Adventures\\" series. The essay was part of three related works about mushrooms released around the same time period. It was preceded by the limited release of Mushrooms, Russia and History, a two-volume book by Wasson and his wife, Valentina Pavlovna Wasson. The Life magazine essay was followed six days later by \\"I Ate the Sacred Mushroom\\", an interview with Valentina in This Week magazine.Harvard University Herbaria 2002; Cloud 2007; Karttunen 1994, p. 229. Against Wasson's wishes, a Life magazine editor added the term \\"Magic Mushroom\\" to the title and brought its use into popular culture. The essay influenced the nascent counterculture in the United States and led many hippies to travel to Mexico in the 1960s in search of the mushroom, including Timothy Leary.Reuters 1970; Cloud 2007. In the 1970s, Wasson expressed misgivings about the wide publicity the essay brought to the Mazatec culture and the defilement of the mushroom ritual.Wasson 1970, p. 29. Background Wasson first became interested in mycology during his honeymoon in the Catskill Mountains in 1927.Letcher 2008, pp. 80-81. His new wife, Valentina Pavlovna Wasson, a native of Moscow, Russia, was identifying and collecting mushrooms in the forest, having been brought up with an appreciation for the species. Wasson was disgusted. \\"Like all good Anglo-Saxons, I knew nothing about the fungal world and felt that the less I knew about those putrid, treacherous excrescences the better.\\"Wasson 1957, p. 113. The incident sparked Wasson's interest in mushrooms, leading to subsequent contributions to the field of ethnomycology. In 1952, English poet Robert Graves sent the Wassons a letter containing a journal article quoting American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes discussing the ritual use of mushrooms by Mesoamericans in the 16th century.Wasson et al. 1978, p. 4; Ruck 2010; Stafford 1993, pp. 225-233. Depictions of mushroom use can be seen in the Florentine Codex and the Codex Magliabechiano. Relevant papers on this topic by Schultes include: Schultes, R. E. 1939. The identification of Teonan√°catl, a narcotic basidiomycete of the Aztecs. Botanical Museum Leaflets of Harvard 7 (3): 37-54. February 21; and Schultes, R. E. 1940. Teonan√°catl: The narcotic mushroom of the Aztecs. American Anthropologist 42: 429-443. The ritual was first observed in modern times in 1938 by American anthropologist Jean Basset Johnson in Huautla de Jim√©nez, in the Sierra Mazateca region of Oaxaca, Mexico.Wasson & Wasson 1957, pp. 237-238. Beginning in 1953, Wasson repeatedly traveled to Mexico in search of the mushrooms. On a trip to the town of Huautla de Jim√©nez in June and July 1955, Wasson and New York society photographer Allan Richardson participated in a mushroom ritual with curandera Maria Sabina, where they became, in Wasson's words, \\"the first white men in recorded history to eat the divine mushrooms\\".Wasson 1957, pp. 100‚Äì102, 109‚Äì120; Ruck 2010; Cloud 2007; Erowid Character Vaults 2012; Stevens 1998, pp. 74-79. (When Wasson returned to the U.S., he sent some of the mushrooms to Dr. Andrija Puharich of the Round Table Foundation in Maine; Puharich analyzed them and identified muscarine, atropine, and bufotenin as the chemicals responsible for hallucinogenic effects, and also used them on himself and others.Annie Jacobsen, Phenomena: The Secret History of the U.S. Government's Investigations into Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis (New York: Little, Brown, 2017), p. 56. Among these was the sculptor Harry Stump, in the presence of Aldous Huxley, who paid Puharich a three-week visit in August 1955.Jacobsen, Phenomena (2017), pp. 56-59.)

She is best known for her writing The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Life  Lucrezia Marinella was the daughter of a celebrated physician and natural philosopher, Giovanni Marinelli who wrote novels, some of which were on women‚Äôs well-being, hygiene and beauty.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press (pg.4) Her brother, Curzo Marinella, was also a physician and Lucrezia married the physician Girolamo Vacca. None of her children seem to have been born in Venice.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Stampino MG. 1998. Enrico; or Byzantium Conquered: A Heroic Poem. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (pg.4) Her father might have been the vital link between her private studies and the writing and the wider world of Venetian literary circles, including the Accademia de‚Äô Desiosi.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.(pg. 3) In this era, many women entered convents or became courtesans (like the famous Veronica Franco). Entering a convent meant that a woman was not obligated to be married and could pursue education and spiritual development. But, at the same time the Roman Catholic Church maintained rigid theories of gender and expectations of women‚Äôs place and nature. However, Lucrezia Marinella did not enter the convent and wasn't pressured into marriage. She came from a professional family that very much encouraged her studies, and her father was extremely supportive.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.(pg. 1) Although Lucrezia‚Äôs writing brought her fame, she lived her life in seclusion. It is believed that Lucrezia's solitary life is what allowed her to write so much so soon. But a life of seclusion was typical for women of her social rank in sixteenth-century Italy. She did not travel, except to local shrines, there is no evidence she gathered with other authors for discussions, and there is no record of her even attending meetings held in academies outside. Women in the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance Women‚Äôs rights and the equality of women were a major focus of Marinella's writings. In the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era in Italy, women were largely wives and mothers. Many women who wanted to pursue knowledge either had to be of elite standing, enter convents, or become courtesans. Women were normally not a part of political conversations and had to be extraordinary to be fully recognized in literature. Although Marinella was one of the best recognized female writers of the time, which included Moderata Fonte, Arcangela Tarabotti and Veronica Franco. Marinella‚Äôs works mostly dealt with women‚Äôs rights and she even asserted that women were superior to men, which was a popular argument in that time for polemical and philosophical works.Deslauriers, Marguerite, \\"Lucrezia Marinella\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . Marinella also wrote in the style of pastoral romance, as in Arcadia Felice. This genre was traditionally limited to male authors and featured male characters; however Arcadia Felice explores love and eroticism as a plot complication instead of a resolution. Works  The title page of a 1601 edition of Marinella's La nobilita, et l‚Äôeccellenza delle donne. Marinella was a polished writer in many genres. Her work ranged from philosophical commentaries on poetry to religious works, and drew heavily on a wide variety of sources including scientific and mythological works. In her lifetime, Marinella published 10 books; there were sometimes as much as 10 years of silence between her works, notably after her marriage to Girolamo Vacca between 1606-1617.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (pg.8) Her first poem saw light in 1600, and was composed quickly in response to Giuseppe Passi‚Äôs diatribe about women‚Äôs defects, ‚ÄúDei donneschi difetti.‚Äù Marinella took the first part of her own title from the Italian translation of a supposedly anonymous French tract, \\"Della nobilita et eccellenza delle donne,\\" printed in Venice in 1549.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (pg. 2) The book was largely a long polemic of attacks against women and their defense. It also mounted an attack on men for exactly the same vices Passi had accused women of.Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (pg.3) Marinella was the first woman in Italy to argue with a man in print, and it was the only time she wrote explicitly about the misogyny of Passi. In her work Enrico, Marinella selected a topic that was both religious and political, and that also built on her previous works. She highlighted the fact that women were excluded from the political discussion in this time. In the work, she expresses a patriotic pride in Venice and singles out a Venetian version of the events of the Fourth Crusade, about which no contemporary Venetian documents evidently existed. This point in the history of Venice reminds the reader of Venice‚Äôs destiny and import.Marinella, Enrico. Chicago Press. (pg. 4) In Enrico, Marinella chose to write in one of the highest literary genres of her time, that was for cultural reasons out of favor in Venice. Marinella‚Äôs warrior women in Enrico wear masculine armor with grace and dignity; they were written as respectable in deed and thought, and as chaste virgins (Querelle des femmes).Marinella, Enrico.Chicago Press. (pg. 8) 'Arcadia Felice also echoes the idea that love is restricting to women and detrimental to their liberty and creativity. In another one of Lucrezia's notable works Amoro Innamorato et Impazzato: \\"In Exhortations\\", however, Marinella seems to recant completely, praising the complete domestication of women and suggesting in the strongest of terms that they avoid scholarly pursuits. According to her arguments, women ought to remain firmly in what I will anachronistically call the private sphere, leaving the world of politics and philosophy for men. Like many of her contemporaries, she uses the ideas of classic authors to make her arguments...She argues in favor of sequestration for women, places the greatest value on the skills women use while managing a home and raising children, and locates all female virtue in the domestic arts.\\"Byars, Jana. \\"Byars on Marinella.\\" H-Net Reviews In The Humanities & Social Sciences (December 2012): 1-2. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost ' She also lamented the state of women in literature and urged women to avoid a literary career in her final work, Essortationi alle donne. On seclusion, Lucrezia wrote: \\"I also stated this in my book entitled The Nobility and Excellence of Women, but now considering the issue in a more mature fashion, I am of the view that it is not the result of conscious manipulation nor the action of an angry soul, but the will and providence of nature and God.\\" =List of works= \\\\---Marinella, L. , 1595, La Colomba sacra, Poema eroico.

In 2014, Kedrowski skied 20 Cascade Volcanoes in 30 days, camping on the summits of seven of the more notable volcanoes such as Mount Shasta, Mount Hood, Mount Adams, Mount Baker, and Mount Rainier. His adventure was chronicled in his second book Skiing and Sleeping on the Summits: Cascade Volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest which was released in April 2016. Kedrowski was at the Mt. Everest Basecamp when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake struck, causing avalanches on the mountain. while injuring nearly 100. Kedrowski was unhurt by the event and able to help with recovery efforts, as well as collecting data for the USGS about the earthquake.

Original style and restoration in 1960s The theater originally opened in 1927 with a capacity of 1,500 people. Its atmospheric auditorium was designed in the Neo-Pompeiien fashion, with various Spanish and Italian architectural influences present as well. One of the theater's most prominent design features is the auditorium ceiling. The ceiling replicates a night sky by use of dark blue paint, blinking lights, and clouds that are displayed on the ceiling via projector. The original horizontal theater marquee is still in place. The vertical section was removed in the 1970s. Still in place within the auditorium is the theater's original Barton pipe organ. Once used to accompany silent films, the organ fell into disrepair and was restored in the 1960s. After its restoration, it provided music for various shows and sing-alongs. Recent history The theater was shuttered in 2001 due to failure of its air conditioning chillers and issues regarding a then new license instated by the City of Chicago. Renovations began on the theater in 2010, and were finished in 2011. The theater officially reopened on June 3, 2011. The first film to touch the screen in over 10 years was Thor. The theater installed a 2k digital cinema projector in late 2012 after a Kickstarter campaign. It retains dual 35mm film projectors. After a period of showing \\"intermediate run\\" new releases, the theater transitioned to a rental-based business model in June 2013. The nonprofit Chicago Film Society was in residence there until the theater closed again in April 2014, as owner Demetri Kouvalis reported problems with heating and cooling equipment. The theater re-opened again on December 4, 2014. There was another period of closure, and the theater re-opened May 7, 2016 under new owners with a screening of Jaws. The Kouvanis family sold the theater to Eddie Caranza, who owns the Congress Theater as well.

He is also the grandson of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur, Jr.  Early life  Arthur MacArthur IV's early life was chronicled extensively in the press. His early childhood was spent around the penthouse built for his father atop the Manila Hotel. Arthur's father would play with him every morning before work. After the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, Arthur, his mother and his nanny were forced to relocate from the Manila Hotel as bombs fell nearby. They first joined Arthur's father on Corregidor Island and then were evacuated by PT boat and B-17 Flying Fortress to Brisbane, Australia. The United Press agency reported in March 1942 on the boy's escape with his family and that he was a \\"real MacArthur, a soldier like his father and grandfather\\". Life made Arthur their cover story in August 1942 and reported on such matters as the boy's life in Australia, his \\"curiously mixed-up accent\\", his kindergarten routine, and his new tricycle. Cover of Life Magazine While the fighting was going on in the Philippines, Arthur and his mother left Brisbane on the refrigerator ship Columbia Express. Upon arriving in Manila, they discovered that their old penthouse at the Manila Hotel was burned down by the Japanese, and thus they took up residence at \\"Casa Blanca,\\" the house of Russian Jewish-born American businessman Emil Bachrach in Santa Mesa, which also happens to be the house used by General Tomoyuki Yamashita before he evacuated to Baguio with his Northern Force. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the family moved to Tokyo, from where the United Press agency reported in 1946 that eight-year-old Arthur MacArthur was considered a \\"musical prodigy\\". Arthur's first meeting with Emperor Hirohito of Japan's sons, the future Emperor Akihito and Prince Masahito in September 1949, at a swimming meet, was covered by Sir Keith Murdoch's Adelaide News under the headline \\"MacArthur's son and Jap. princes\\". Even trivial childhood matters could find their way into the newspapers. When Arthur broke his arm ice skating in Tokyo in May 1947, the Australian Associated Press reported that \\"[d]octors said he behaved 'like a soldier'\\". Not only doctors assumed that Arthur had the makings of a soldier. Perhaps inevitably, as he was the son and grandson of Army generals, it was assumed by soldiers, newspaper correspondents, and even by his mother that Arthur would be a soldier. At Arthur's christening his mother was asked whether Arthur would attend the United States Military Academy at West Point and replied \\"how can he help it, having such a father?\\" The troops on Corregidor called four- year-old Arthur \\"the Sergeant\\". Inevitably, Douglas MacArthur also wished for a military career for his son, writing \\"I hope that God will let me live to see the day that young Arthur MacArthur is sworn in on The Plain as a plebe at West Point\\".  Arrival in the United States  Upon Douglas MacArthur's dismissal by President Truman, MacArthur flew home with his family on April 18, 1951. Arthur, then aged 13, had never been to the United States. The family's return to the United States brought intense media scrutiny of the General's son as well as the father. Douglas' selection as \\"Father of the Year\\" in June 1942 by the National Father's Day Committee, together with his reputation for being a particularly devoted father, drew attention to his only son. While newspapers' political correspondents focused on Douglas MacArthur's testimony before the Senate in Washington in May 1951, the general press sought out human interest stories connected to Arthur, his mother and his Chinese nanny, Ah Cheu. The New York Times ran a front-page story covering young MacArthur's first visit to a Major League Baseball game, as \\"guest of Horace Stoneham, owner of the Giants.\\" Only two days later The New York Times ran another story (this time only on page 5) covering Arthur's first visit to a circus, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus at Madison Square Garden. The article was subheadlined \\"Two Notables Meet At The Garden\\" above the photo caption \\"The 13-year-old son of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and Felix Adler, King of the clowns.\\" The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where the family had taken up residence, was besieged by press and photographers. The Scripps's Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate reported that \\"Arthur is the object of staring eyes and photographers' flash- bulbs and reporters' questions.\\" The popular interest continued. In May 1951 the United Press syndicate ran a story reporting that young MacArthur was to receive a \\"100-year old peace pipe as a gift\\" from the people of Havre, Montana. Not all the attention was flattering. The Associated Press reported the same year that Arthur MacArthur was \\"'Gifted,' But Gift Is Not Spelling.\\" The article went on to quote his tutor saying that the \\"outstanding talent of 13-year-old Arthur MacArthur is a gift for music, but spelling is his weakness\\". Phillis Gibbons said that Arthur MacArthur \\"is just an ordinary American boy, like your son or mine. He is quite intelligent but he can't spell ‚Äì what American boy can?\\" Gibbons (\\"'Gibby', Tutor of Young Mac\\" according to a front-page headline in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle) was summoned from Tokyo to tutor Arthur for some time. Thereafter, Arthur attended New York's Browning School until he entered Columbia University as a freshman in 1956. The New York Times reported Arthur MacArthur's admission along with that of the son of MacKinlay Kantor, the Pulitzer Prize winning author. Interest in Arthur MacArthur wasn't limited to the press. Hope Cooke, a contemporary in New York who later became Queen of Sikkim, commented in her autobiography that \\"all the parents want[ed] their daughters to dance with Arthur MacArthur, the general's son... when he comes to church with his parents, there is always a huge crowd on the steps to watch them go by.\\" MacArthur graduated from Columbia University in 1961, having majored in English., The only non- prizewinning student mentioned by name in The New York Times was Arthur MacArthur. The New York Times pointed out that MacArthur's parents sat in the box of the president of the university, Grayson L. Kirk.  Later life  After graduation, MacArthur avoided the public spotlight. The United Press agency reported, following his father's funeral in 1964 that, since graduating, \\"the tall handsome young man ... has made few public appearances.\\" The Associated Press reported the same year that \\"MacArthur's Son Shuns Military Life\\" but pointed out that \\"his childhood had been filled with war.\\" Arthur MacArthur reportedly lives under an assumed name. Until 2004, MacArthur apparently lived in the Mayflower Hotel on New York's Upper West Side. Forbes magazine tracked him down in 2005 but MacArthur \\"declined to be interviewed\\". In 2014, MacArthur was featured in a New York Post article that discussed his long and secret residency in the hotel. Michael Gross's 2014 book, House of Outrageous Fortune: Fifteen Central Park West, the World's Most Powerful Address, also devoted a page to the mystery of MacArthur's life and assumed name. When the hotel was demolished, he moved to Greenwich Village.

Background The objective was to clear out People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units from their base camps and infiltration routes in the hills and valleys of Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, southwest of Da Nang, particularly Happy Valley and Charlie Ridge () 20-25km southwest of Da Nang. The Marines had previously scoured the area in Operation Mameluke Thrust and Operation Maui Peak both of which ended in October 1968. Defector and prisoner interrogations gave intelligence about a renewed buildup of PAVN forces in the area and one prisoner, a captain in the 141st Regiment, gave detailed intelligence on infiltration routes into the area. He revealed that the main infiltration route was from Ai Yen along Route 614 and into Happy Valley, while another branch followed the Song Con river south to An Dien 8km northeast of Th∆∞·ªùng √ê·ª©c Camp and then along the Song Vu Gia river into Base Area 112 or Charlie Ridge. As the Marines had recently neutralized Base Area 112 in Operation Taylor Common it was decided that the next operation would be to clear the hills west of Da Nang. The terrain was expected to be a major challenge as Charlie Ridge was a steep and narrow mountain range with numerous gullies and ravines with thick undergrowth and dense overhead cover, while Happy Valley was covered by dense undergrowth, all of this would limit the effectiveness of supporting arms and make helicopter support more difficult. On 21 March the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines began a 10km march west along Route 4 from Firebase Rawhide to take Hill 52. On 24 March Company C secured Hill 52 and the Marines began construction of Firebase Mustang and on 30 March Battery K, 4th Battalion, 11th Marines was in position at Mustang. Operation After sunset on 30 March the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines landed at Hill 10 establishing Firebase Stallion and they began moving west into the operational area, at the same time 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines landed on Hill 41 and also began moving west and by the following morning both battalions were in positions along the slopes of Charlie Ridge. At 11:00 on 31 March HMM-165 helicopters landed the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 51st Regiment northeast of Th∆∞·ªùng √ê·ª©c Camp and the 3rd Battalion, 51st Regiment northwest of the camp. On 1 April the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines and the 4.2in mortar battery from 1st Battalion, 13th Marines were landed at Landing Zone Robin overlooking Happy Valley. With the forces in place the 2/7 Marines and 3/7 Marines advanced west searching Charlie Ridge while the 3/26 Marines and the ARVN battalions searched southeast and northeast. Movement was extremely difficult in the thick jungle and the forces soon restricted themselves to operating along the network of trails, establishing company base camps and then sending platoon radiating out to search the trail network. On 1 April a reconnaissance team captured a PAVN sergeant from the 141st Regiment and Company K, 3/7 Marines captured a warrant officer from the 31st Regiment and they each revealed the location of their regimental base camps. Col. Robert L. Nichols decided to attack the base camp of the 141st Regiment near the summit of Hill 1166 and the 3/26 Marines was ordered to advance south up the ridgeline towards the Hill while 3/7 Marines advance from the east. By the afternoon of 7 April 3/26 Marines had secured Hill 1166 and 3/7 Marines had secured Hill 1062 nearby. On the morning 8 April 3/26 Marines descended into the ravine containing the base camp engaging 20 PAVN soldiers as they attempted to escape to the southwest. The next day 3/26 Marines continued to search the camp area skirmishing with small groups of PAVN. On 11 April 2/7 Marines advanced on the 31st Regiment base camp on Hill 745 discovering over 200 structures. By 15 April the PAVN had abandoned their base areas. 1/7 Marines patrolled the south of the operational area along the Song Vu Gia carrying out ambushes of likely PAVN lines of communication between Charlie Ridge and the Arizona Territory to the south and on the night of 13 April ambushed a group of 30 PAVN as they crossed the river killing 14. On 21 April 2/7 Marines and Battery H 3/11 Marines were withdrawn from the operation and replaced by an ARVN battalion on Firebase Buckskin on Hill 502. The remaining units participating in the operation were now assigned general areas of responsibility sweeping Happy Valley and Charlie Ridge encountering scattered groups of PAVN. On the afternoon of 21 April intelligence indicated that a PAVN force was moving from the Arizona Territory north towards the Song Vu Gia and 1/7 Marines established ambush positions along the north bank of the river. After sunset small groups of PAVN were observed on the south bank of the river but the Marines held their fire and at 21:00 a large group of PAVN emerged from the bush on the south bank bring 17 small boats with them. When the PAVN boats started crossing the river the 1/7 Marines opened fire with recoilless rifles, 81mm mortars, machine-gun and rifle fire while pre- registered artillery engaged the PAVN remaining on the south bank. 57 PAVN dead were later counted floating in the river. At dawn on 22 April air strikes hit the south bank and at 09:30 Company B, 1/7 Marines boarded LVT-5s to cross the river and search the south bank finding a further 14 dead PAVN. On 29 April the area of operations was extended south of the Song Vu Gia into the northern Arizona Territory and that night Companies B and D, 1/7 Marines crossed the river and established positions near the village of My Hoa. On the morning of 30 April the two companies advanced southeast and Company B on the right flank was engaged by a PAVN force, Company D then swung round to the northwest and both companies then began attacking southwest into a PAVN force estimated to be two companies strong. The fighting continued throughout the day and into 1 May and the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines operating north of Go Noi Island to the northeast was sent by truck to assist the 1/7 Marines. On the morning of 2 May 3/1 Marines began advancing east and by midday had linked up with 1/7 Marines and that evening both battalions crossed north over the Song Vu Gia. The sweep of the northern Arizona Territory had killed 60 PAVN for the loss of 9 Marines. On 2 May Companies K and L, 3/26 Marines and Battery C, 1/13 Marines were withdrawn from the operation. From 6-12 May Company I, 3/7 Marines conducted a sweep of the Song Tan Thong river area west of Happy Valley with minimal results. On 9 May 3/1 Marines left the operation. On 21 May Company L, 3/7 Marines began a 5-day sweep of the Ken Valley with minimal results. On 26 May after completing the destruction of the 31st Regiment base the ARVN 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment was withdrawn from the operation and on 29 May after destroying the remaining firebases the 3/7 Marines withdrew from the area. Aftermath The operation concluded on 29 May. The operation was regarded as a success because while the PAVN generally did not stand and fight, the disruption of their base areas and lines of communication was believed to have led to a substantial decline in activity in the Da Nang area. Forty-four Marines were killed during the operation and 439 suffered injuries requiring medical evacuation. The US claimed that 589 PAVN were killed.

Qomolangma National Nature Preserve (QNNP), also known as Chomolungma Nature Reserve (QNP) protects 3.381 million hectares of the central Himalaya in the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. \\"Qomolangma\\" is the Tibetan name for Mount Everest. Located on the ‚ÄúRoof of the World,‚Äù the Qomolangma National Nature Preserve (QNNP) was one of the first nature preserves in the world to be administered and protected entirely by local volunteers. Through their continued efforts, significant achievements have been made in halting rampant deforestation, unregulated tourism and illegal hunting of rare wildlife in the Qomolangma region. Active reforestation and garbage collection programs have also been undertaken to restore the environment. The preserve, initially named Qomolangma Nature Preserve, was created on March 18, 1989 at the Tibet regional level. Support from then Governor of Tibet, Hu Jintao, was instrumental in shaping the community-based management design summarized below and also pushing through the landscape level size (in 1983, QNP was the largest nature reserve in Asia). In 1993, the State Council of the People‚Äôs Republic of China elevated its protection to the national level and the QNP became QNNP.Department of Forestry, Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, People‚Äôs Republic of China, ‚Äò‚ÄôReport on Protected Lands in the Tibet Autonomous Region‚Äô‚Äô Lhasa: Tibet Autonomous Region Government Publishing House, 2006 Physical Aspects The QNNP contains along its border with Nepal four of the world's six highest mountains: Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. Also in this preserve is Shishapangma, 14th highest, the only eight- thousander meter peak totally in China. The preserve holds Rongbuk Monastery, the highest monastery in the world at 4,500 meters and the highest agricultural fields in the world at 4,300 meters. In addition, the preserve has key pilgrimage sites for Tibetan Buddhism‚Äôs most famous poet saint, Milarepa.Robert L. Fleming Jr., Liu Wulin, Tsering Dorje ‚Äò‚ÄôAcross the Tibetan Plateau‚Äô‚Äô New York: WW Norton, 2007 The contiguous trans-border protected area that has become appended to the QNNP links with five protected areas in Nepal. These are Makalu-Barun National Park, Sagarmatha National Park, Langtang National Park, Manaslu Conservation Area, and Annapurna Conservation Area encompassing a total area of protected ecology greater than the land area of Switzerland‚Äîconserving multiple Himalayan ecosystems from very wet to very dry and from 1,000 feet of vertical elevation to 29,000 feet. Not adjacent by easy migratory distance away from the QNNP are significant protected areas in Sikkim, India, as well as the country of Bhutan which has over 40% of its land area protected. Management QNNP is distinctive because no warden force protects its natural and cultural treasures. Management is by local communities, especially the governments of the four counties that comprise the preserve (Tingri, Dinjie, Nyalam, Kyirong) with a Management Bureau in Shigatse, the prefecture headquarters. The four counties have a population estimated at over 90,000 people.Department of Forestry, ‚Äò‚ÄôOp. cit.‚Äô‚Äô The official data sheet provided by the QNNP administration reports over 2,000 species of plants, 53 species of mammals, 206 species of birds, eight species of amphibians, 10 species of fish. Forty-seven species of rare and endangered plants and animals. While the norm in community-based conservation has been co-management by science and traditional peoples under a separate management structure for conservation, the QNNP represents another model where science and traditional join in political administration and there is no separate conservation administration.Daniel C.

Taylor to the Tibetan regional and Chinese national governments when essentially no protected land was designated in the Tibet Autonomous Region. As the primary external advisers for two decades, Daniel C. Taylor and Chun-Wuei Su Chien worked first through The Mountain Institute and then through Future Generations to provide management assistance in scientific, social development, historical renovation, ecotourism planning, and initiation of the Pendeba Program.‚Äò‚Äôibid.‚Äô‚Äô Subsequent to formation of the QNNP, with the new land management model, land area of the Tibet Autonomous Region under national and regional protected status expanded steadily, utilizing the QNNP management model where local county administrations enforce the conservation policies and where people engage in conservation management as part of their livelihood activities.

At Beijing Capital International Airport, the floods resulted in the cancellation of over 500 flights, stranding 80,000 travellers.  Recent urban flooding in China  Urban flooding has recently become more frequent and severe in China. The main causes of the increase in flooding are the limited capacity of urban drainage networks, a loss of natural water bodies, and the loss of land during the urbanization of China. The flooding in Beijing resulted from these factors as well as the heaviest rainfall to hit Beijing in 60 years. The 2012 flash flood was part of a series of flooding events across China that began in late spring of 2012 and continued during the summer. In July, the areas of southwestern China, including Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and northeastern China including Beijing, Hubei and Liaoning were worst-affected. In 2011, a thunderstorm flooded Beijing and inundated Tiananmen Square. In 2007, a similar July thunderstorm claimed the lives of 22 people.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on November 23, 2012, and on Nickelodeon on December 6. In the special, Plankton tries to convince SpongeBob to transform everybody in Bikini Bottom into jerks by feeding them his special jerktonium-laced fruitcakes in order to get his Christmas wishthe Krabby Patty secret formula. The episode was produced in stop motion animation at Screen Novelties, and was directed by Mark Caballero and Seamus Walsh, two of the founders of the company. The animation style was inspired by those of the classic Rankin/Bass television specials. Written by Luke Brookshier, Marc Ceccarelli, Derek Iversen, and Mr. Lawrence, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was based on Tom Kenny and Andy Paley's 2009 song \\"Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)\\", which was also featured in the episode. John Goodman guest starred as the voice of Santa Claus. On November 6, 2012, the soundtrack album and the DVD for the episode were released simultaneously. Upon premiere, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" attracted nearly five million viewers and met positive critical reception. It received four nominations at the 40th Annie Awards including Best Animated Television Production for Children (with Dan Driscoll winning the Character Animation in an Animated Television or other Broadcast Venue Production category). It was also nominated for Best Sound Editing in Television at the 60th Golden Reel Awards. Plot summary It's Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is angry that his ill-behaved acts have landed him on Santa Claus's naughty list and he won't receive his Christmas wish‚Äîthe Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers jerktonium, an element that can turn anyone nice into a jerk. Using his discovery, he bakes it into fruitcakes he intends to spread around the town. To test it, Plankton lets SpongeBob taste a fruitcake, but he is immune to jerktonium because of a combination of his tiny brain and his big heart. Upset that his plan seemingly failed, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and turns all the residents into jerks. Plankton realizes that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium; Plankton then sends out an evil wind-up robot SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob. The next day, SpongeBob begins to notice that everyone is acting like jerks. SpongeBob and Sandy discover the antidote for jerktonium and it happens to be a song. SpongeBob begins singing, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it is too late when Santa Claus arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except Plankton, who is the only nice person there is. Santa then grants Plankton his wish and tells SpongeBob that he is the worst of them all for wreaking havoc in Bikini Bottom. The robot comes to eliminate Santa and destroy more of Christmas. SpongeBob fights and destroys the robot with the fruitcake dispenser. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him and is enraged when he realizes that Plankton was behind the chaos. His elves gives Plankton coal because of this, then Santa leaves Bikini Bottom. Production =Development, writing, and voice casting= Tom Kenny (pictured here in 2008) and Andy Paley's Christmas song \\"Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)\\", that was released in 2009, inspired Nickelodeon to produce the Christmas special. The song was used as the featured music in the episode and was re-released on the soundtrack album. Luke Brookshier, Marc Ceccarelli, Derek Iversen, and Mr. Lawrence served as the episode's writers, with Brookshier and Ceccarelli serving as storyboard directors. \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was based on the 2009 Christmas song \\"Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)\\" written by SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny and his writing partner Andy Paley. They wrote it as \\"...just sort of a little sample calling card of what we were thinking about.\\" The story of the song was conceived with the help of one of the episode's writers Mr. Lawrence. Kenny explained, \\"...Eventually somebody at Nickelodeon found it [the song] on their desk and decided to make it into a holiday special.\\" The network let Kenny and Paley write three more songs for the upcoming special episode (Nickelodeon eventually decided to release a soundtrack album, which became It's a SpongeBob Christmas! Album, containing the songs to coincide with the episode). \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was the first full-length episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square and the stop motion sequence of The Spongebob Squarepants Movie. Walsh explained, \\"They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We come from the same planet as far as our sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also wanted to make sure that it felt like a SpongeBob episode.\\" All the main SpongeBob SquarePants cast members lent their voices to the episode. Series executive producer Paul Tibbitt also had a minor speaking role as the voice of Potty the Parrot. In addition to the regular cast, American actor John Goodman guest starred in the episode as the voice of Santa Claus. =Animation and filming= The animators cited the classic television specials Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town by Rankin/Bass Productions as inspirations for the episode's animation styles. Caballero said, \\"Well, we are heavily immersed in that particular Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass style. They are big heroes of ours ... So we tapped into that knowledge for sure. We definitely use modern tricks, though. We shot everything with digital cameras directly to the hard drives of our iMacs.\\" Production on the episode officially began in October 2011 at Los Angeles, California, after several months of research and development. The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. \\"They'd check out the weeklies and go back and forth with us on the various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because we come from the same planet. It all felt very easy and natural,\\" Walsh said. About 30 peoplewhom Walsh described \\"...seemed to be thrilled to work on the show\\"worked on the making of the episode over at Screen Novelties. Walsh described the initial stage of production as \\"a very busy period for all of us ... We came in at about 8:30 in the morning and didn't leave until midnight some days. But it all zipped by pretty quickly.\\" He said that they \\"felt pretty lucky because usually executives involved with productions look at the stop-motion process as annoying, but on this special, they were very jazzed and gung-go about it.\\" To keep the production crew in the Christmas spirit, six months worth of Christmas music was played, which included 83 versions of The Nutcracker suite. According to Finnegan, it took about five months to shoot. Set construction Caballero and Walsh had conflicts on making sure the stop motion version of Bikini Bottom will resemble the 2D world of the series. Caballero said that \\"We didn't want to make exact sculptural copies of the cartoon drawings and layouts, just because it might've ended up feeling too 'perfect' or something. So we chose to re- appropriate real world objects as much as possible.\\" Art director Kelly Mazurowski focused on \\"digging through salvage yards\\", picking the right materials to be used in the set. Caballero described this process as \\"'puppetizing' the world of Bikini Bottom.\\" Six sets were constructed on which 60 pounds of baking soda were used as snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were used to make the set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float). Character design According to Caballero, SpongeBob was the most challenging character to translate to stop motion. It was so \\"...just because of the sheer number of parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure.\\" Walsh said, \\"The most important thing is to capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and you have to be careful about what to include and what to leave out.\\" On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make \\"because he has the most humanoid proportions.\\" Release =Broadcast= A sneak-peek trailer for the episode was released in June 2012. On September 9, 2012, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" premiered in Israel. On November 23, 2012, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" aired on CBS in the United States and on YTV in Canada. It also premiered in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 2, 2012. On December 6, 2012, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" aired on Nickelodeon in the United States, twelve years after the original airing of the first SpongeBob SquarePants Christmas special \\"Christmas Who?\\". According to Caballero, the decision to make the episode a CBS prime time special \\"came along later\\" and the crew \\"were stoked when [they] heard the news.\\" He said it may be because \\"most of the classic Christmas specials like Rudolph [the Red-Nosed Reindeer] , Frosty [the Snowman] . air on that channel. To be included in that line up was far out!\\" =Home media and other releases= \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was released on a DVD compilation of the same name on October 30, 2012 in Canada and on November 6, 2012 in the United States. The DVD features exclusive content including behind-the-scenes making of the special and interviews with the cast and crew, a pre-color animatic, and yule log. The initial announcement of the DVD release stated that it would contain three Christmas specials from T.U.F.F. Puppy, Fanboy & Chum Chum, and The Fairly OddParents as bonus features; however, these were dropped from the actual release. However, the Target exclusive of It's A SpongeBob Christmas! included the Christmas episodes of those shows on a bonus disc. A Blu-ray release was also announced, but was cancelled a week afterwards for unknown reasons; however, on July 22, 2013, Paramount Home Media Distribution announced that the Blu-ray would be released on October 15, 2013. \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was released for digital download on October 31, 2012 featuring over 30 minutes of exclusive behind the scenes footage, a sing along version of \\"Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas),\\" and more. On March 12, 2013, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete Eighth Season DVD, alongside all episodes of the eighth season. On June 4, 2019, \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants: The Next 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons six through nine.https://www.facebook.com/tvshowsondvd/photos/a.10151614436896063/10156879245486063/?type=3&theater; Reception =Ratings= In its original airing on CBS on November 23, the episode was viewed by an estimated 3.626 million households and received a 0.9 Nielsen rating and a 3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49.

In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd wrote, \\"I felt I'd been somewhere, watching this. When it ended, I was not ready to leave.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote, \\"It's enough to make you want to dream of a yellow Christmas.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club called the episode \\"cute, and goofy and doesn't have a mean bone in its body.\\" Mark Frauenfelder of Boing Boing said that \\"...they [the animators] perfectly captured the look and feel of those delightful old stop motion specials.\\" Judge Dawn Hunt of DVD Verdict called the episode \\"a sweet holiday treat, punctuated by musical numbers that'll leave you smiling.\\" He added \\"If you're looking for a new holiday viewing, 'It's a SpongeBob Christmas!' is definitely worthy of consideration.\\" Paul Mavis of DVD Talk applauded the episode and felt it would become a classic that would be watched every season. Director Walsh said that \\"Hopefully this will become a new tradition.\\" In her review for the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to positive and gave the episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, \\"...though I disagree with a few of the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat.\\" Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying \\"...he looks like a pig with liver spots.\\" The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying \\"We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story.\\" Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, \\"We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human.\\" =Accolades= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" width=100% + List of awards and nominations received by \\"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:4%;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25%;\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25%;\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25%;\\" Nominee(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:9%;\\" Result ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:5%;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Ref(s). - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013  Annecy International Animated Film Festival  Special Award for a TV Series    align=center - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013 rowspan=\\"4\\" Annie Awards  Best Animated Television Production for Children    align=center - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013  Directing in an Animated Television or other Broadcast Venue Production  Mark Caballero Seamus Walsh   align=center - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013  rowspan=\\"2\\"Character Animation in an Animated Television or other Broadcast Venue Production  Dan Driscoll   align=center - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013  Savelen Forrest   align=center - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2013  Golden Reel Awards  Best Sound Editing - Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue and ADR Animation in Television  Mishelle Fordham, Vincent Guisetti, Jeffrey Hutchins, James Ian Lifton, Paulette Victor Lifton, D.J.

She began her career in 1986 in Cancun doing etching, but moved to Mexico City and into painting by 1991. Most of her work is acrylics on canvas but she is also noted for her work with painting ceramics with Uriarte Talavera. She has also done painting on wood, created ceramics, collages and even shoe decoration and has been exhibited both individually and collectively in Mexico, Europe and the United States. Life Marcela Lobo Crenier was born on September 12, 1959 in Mexico City. Her father is an architect and her mother is a chef whose family has French heritage. She became involved and making craft at the very young age, remembering her childhood filled with cut paper, glue, scissors and more making objects of bright colors. She considers her talent to be a family inheritance, with a sister, Adriana, who is also a painter. Their shared interest in art bonds them rather than creates rivalry. She studied art and design at the Universidad Motolina in Mexico City, then took classes in photography and drawing the human figure at the Centro Cultural Arte Contemporaneo de M√©xico and studied painting at the workshop of Mercedes Escobar in Mexico City. Although she began her career in Cancun in etching, she continues to attend workshops and courses in various types of artistic expression such as ceramics and collage. However, she says that most of her training comes from the fact that she paints eight hours a day, every day, constantly learning through trial and error. Career Artist in her studio in Mexico City She began her career in 1986 by doing etching work, starting her own business in Cancun. However, at the time there was no art scene and most of the area‚Äôs development had not yet taken off. She had no teachers or others to help her develop and she sometimes networked through friends and family elsewhere to get enough work to survive. In 1991, she moved back to her hometown of Mexico City. She took classes in painting and began her habit of painting eight hours a day, which continues to this day. However, she also worked at an etching workshop with notable masters of the craft such as Jos√© Luis Cuevas, Manuel Felgu√©rez and Carmen Parra. In addition to creating her own work she has worked on collaborative projects in places such as the Centro Cultural Arte Contempor√°neo, the workshop of Mercedes Escobar in Mexico City and the Alfart√≠a Traditional workshop of Gorky Gonz√°lez of Guanajuato. One notable collaborative relationship is with Uriarte Talavera, with her most recent work with them as a participant in the El Cinco de Mayo de 1862 exhibition, honoring the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Puebla. Lobo has had numerous collective exhibitions and a number of individual ones, consisting of collections of paintings, especially acrylics on canvas but also paintings on wood, collages, ceramic pieces and even decorating shoes. Her first individual exhibit was at the Club Porto Bravo in Valle de Bravo in 1991 and since then has primarily shown her work in Mexico, Europe and the United States. Showings in Mexico include the Orbe Galer√≠as de Arte in Cancun (1993 and 1997), Naturalezas Viva at the Casa de Di√°logo of the Teatro de M√©xico (1995), II Biennial Internacional de Arte Contempor√°neo in Mexico City (1998) El Color de M√©xico at the Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social and the Galer√≠a Kin in Mexico City (1999), De Mil Colores at the gallery of the Mexico City airport (2001), 18 a Todo Color at Televisa Guadalajara (2003), El Color de lo Cotidiano at the Museo Dolores Olmedo (2003), Una Fiesta para los Sentidos at the Galer√≠a de Arte de Oaxaca (2004), All√° Lejos y Tiempo Atr√°s at Casa Lamm Mexico City (2006) International shows include la Coleur du Mexique at the Mexican embassy in Paris (1997), A C√¥r do M√©xico at the Palace of Independence in Lisbon (1998), La Antigua art Gallery in Antigua Guatemala (2002) the Mexican consulate in Chicago and the Defoor Center in Atlanta, and the Jadite Gallery in New York (2011). She has also participated in numerous collective exhibitions. These include a 1999 exhibition called Bodegones at Galer√≠a Kin with her sister Adriana Lobo. Other collective exhibitions include various early shows in Quintana Roo such as the IV Exposici√≥n de Artes Pl√°sticas, the Feria del Arte of the Colegio Americano, at the Centro Cultural de Arte Contemporaneo in various years and the Arte de Nuevo Milenio show at the Florida Museum of Hispanic and Latin American Art in 2000. An important individual showing was Significaci√≥n at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Toluca in 2010, inaugurated by the then-governor of the state Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. It includes images painted on columns, folding screens and wood, both painted and collage. Her European showings have almost entirely been in France, with shows sold out in Paris and Lisbon, but her work has been sold to others on that continent and can be found in collections in various countries. She believes her colorful work is popular in Europe because it has a warmth which can be missing in cold climates. Three catalogs of her work have been published, El color de lo cotidiano, from 2003 showing at the Dolores Olmedo Museum, Sitios, Espacio y Objetos in 2008 and Significaciones from her 2010 Toluca show. In addition to her individual and collective shows, her career has included giving numerous classes in workshops such as thosededicated to engraving at the Ediciones Multiarte from 1989 to 1994, at Monumentos Conmemoratives from 1990 to 1992 and to the present at her own workshop. She has also worked as the personal secretary to a director of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes and currently works as a special events coordinator for Museo Nacional de Arte. Artistry Artist demonstrating her work at the opening of a Uriarte Talavera exhibit at the Franz Mayer Museum. Her professional art production began with etchings while still in Cancun, moving into her primary mode of painting in 1991 after moving to Mexico City. However, her work still includes etching and has expanded to include ceramics, photography, interior design, drawing the human figure, painting Talavera and serigraphy. Her preference is to work with acrylics as they allow her to trace outlines easily, dry rapidly, are odorless and do not pollute. She does not make preliminary sketches before painting, with the only preliminary work being the tracing of lines on the canvas to assure balance in the composition. Her work mostly focuses on painting still lifes and objects in general, as she states that she does not really like the human figure. Her focus is on ordinary objects which she sees mostly at people‚Äôs houses, restaurants and other locations which her daily life takes her. She states that she prefers objects that people generally do not give a second thought to and give her enough in her memory to work eight hours a day. These objects include furniture, flower vases, fruit, flowers, bird cages, handcrafts, toys, toothbrushes, combs, perfume bottles, dishes and handbags. One example of painting from memory and experience was that after a trip to the Lacondon Jungle, tropical vegetation appeared in her work. While the objects in her work are ordinary, her color scheme is distinguished by the used of bright strong colors, with an emphasis on those related to Mexico. She says she has been attracted to bright colors since she was a child and she prefers them now because of how they reflect light and the quality they give her images. She cites as influences Matisse, C√©zanne, Van Gogh and Mar√≠a Izquierdo. She states that much of her work is her interpretation of theirs. She describes her work as costumbrista and even na√Øve, in the sense that the forms are simple and uncomplicated, but with a poetic view of the world. Her work has also been described as a homage to the country‚Äôs handcraft and folk art tradition . Her work has been praised by notable figures in Mexico such as Jacobo Zabludovsky, Andr√©s Henestrosa, Magda Carranza and Ricardo Legorreta . Writer Jacobo Zabludovsky stated that her works are always cheerful, playing with color and light, never having lost her sense of childish wonder. She has stated that the purpose of her work is enjoyment, not to make anyone uncomfortable. One example of this was a small exhibit of her work at the cancer ward of the ABC Hospital in 2004, sponsored by a patient aid charity to bring color to that section of facility.

Located in the north west of Yamaguchi Prefecture, it is a part of Shimonoseki city. The island has an area of and has a coastline of . The island consists primarily of basalt, and is a part of the Kita-Nagato Kaigan Quasi-National Park. As of 28 August 2008, the population of Tsunoshima stood at 907. Geography Once separated from Honshu, Tsunoshima is now accessible via the long Tsunoshima Bridge, which was completed in the year 2000. At the time it was the longest toll free bridge in the country, though the completion of the Kouri Bridge in Okinawa prefecture pushed it into second place. On the north west of the island is the Tsunoshima Lighthouse, which has come to be the symbol of Tsunoshima. Before the war, Tsunoshima contained a military site of the former Imperial Japanese Army. To this day a part of this still remains. The whale species Balaenoptera omurai (Omura's whale) was first identified here. (reprinted on babec.org) History Tsunoshima first appears in the written record in the Nara period (710 - 794). The name of the island appears on a mokkan wooden slip excavated at the site of the Heij≈ç Palace in Nara. The mokkan is dated March 29, 746, and was attached to a tribute of seaweed to the imperial court. A reference to the island also appears in a poem in the sixteenth part of the Man'y≈çsh≈´, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, completed in 759. The Engishiki, a Japanese book of laws and regulations compiled in 927, refers to a ranch on the island, which was then part of Nagato Province. Over time the island was developed for agriculture, as well as supporting a fishing village. In the Edo period (1603 - 1868) the island became part of the Ch≈çfu Domain, but was transferred to the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain 1718. After five years the island returned to the Ch≈çfu Domain. The island was noted for the production of materials to make tatami matting, sesame seeds, and beef. As a local administrative unit, under the 1889 municipal system Tsunoshima Village was a part of the Toyoura district, under a 1955 unification it became part of H≈çhoku Town, and in 2005 as the four town which made up the Toyoura district (H≈çhoku, Kikugawa, Toyoura and Toyota) merged with the city of Shimonoseki, Tsunoshima too, became a part of the city.

Anticorruption activist and Path to Academics  In 1996, Bharat Jangam started interaction program in colleges and university to develop a new subject 'Science of Anti-corruption'. A notion \\"Science of Anticorruption\\" is an invaluable gift to the Academic-World. He has published hundreds of articles and presented dozens of papers in various seminars and meetings on anti-corruption. He is also a founder and president of the 'Forum for Independent Thinking'. The Forum has launched many activities against corruption and turmoil in Nepalese society. On 25 Dec 2011, he started the national Campaign against Corruption in the 75 districts in Nepal. The team plans to start its anti-corruption drive from Mahakali, the western order of the country and conclude it in Mechi, the eastern border. Bharat Jangam filed the writ in Supreme Court to stop constituent Assembly term extension in Nepal. Advocate Bharat Jangam also filed a writ petition on supreme court demanding annulment of the government decision to provide lifelong state facilities to former Prime Ministers, Chief Justices, Home Ministers and Speakers. The Supreme Court issued an interim order asking the government not to implement the ordinance introduced to provide lifelong state facilities to the former VVIPs. Anticorruption talk programme by Bharat Jangam was held on 9 August in Kathmandu organized by FAAN (Fulbright Alumni Association). He is also developing the science called anticorruptology. It is a branch of science which deals with the study of anticorruption and its different aspects. Anticorruptology is a branch of social science. On 23 June 2020, Tribhuwan University approved the course of Anti-Corruption in Master's Degree. With this, Tribhuwan University becomes the first University in the World to start a Master's Degree course on Anti-Corruption Studies. With more than a decade of work on development of Anti-Corruption Science and finally taking the initiation to introduce it into Academics. For this scholastic achievement, he has played a pivotal role and superintendence and his untiring and unwavering effort has been rewarded. He terms it as just the beginning of a long battle ahead to produce Anti-Corruption experts and that inturn will help to take a step forward in introducing the course in lower level of educations as well. This academic facade is one of the new dimensions of his 4 decades of activism against corruption = Father of Anti Corruption Science = Bharat Jangam has been involved in anti-corruption movement since 1970 and in 2016 developed and registered the science of anticorruption called Anticorruptology. Anticorruptology is the science to study the phenomenon of corruption and build evidence based knowledge to fight it. With his constant lobbying, Tribhuwan University approved the Science and recognized it by making it a course of study in Master's Degree. With due recognition of his work and contribution to global society with Science of Anti-Corruption and being the first person to do so, he has been conferred with the title of , \\"Father of Anticorruption Science\\".  Pashupatinath Temple  Bharat Mani Jangam is also dubbed \\"Pashupatinath Temple's lawyer\\" for frequently challenging the state's moves to interfere in the running of the 7th-century temple. He filed a PIL in the Supreme Court, pleading to strike down the decision taken by the caretaker government to open the main treasury of the fifth-century shrine. He argued that the caretaker government has no right to open the more-than-2000-year-old treasury of the Hindu shrine. In 2008‚Äì2009, he stayed against Nepal Maoist government's decision to sack the Indian priest at the Pashupati temple. Appointing Indian priests is the centuries-old tradition. The unprecedented opposition forced the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal prachanda to roll back the decision after five days. He filed another petition against a Christian cemetery in Pashupatinath. He said non-Hindus should not be allowed to encroach on Hindu land. The forest is considered sacred by Hindus and is used by them to make offerings to their ancestors. If the Christians want a burial land, they should go to the government, not encroach on the land of a Hindu shrine that is also a UNESCO-declared World Heritage site.  Doleshwor Mahadev  Sheela Lekh in Doleshwar Mahadev, Bhaktapur, Nepal Bharat Jangam had been claiming and researching that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Shri Kedarnath ji for years. On 22 August 2009 the chief priest of Shri Kedarnath ji temple, Kedarnath Swarup Bhimashankar Langa Shankarcharya unveiled the plaque claiming that Doleswore mahadev, located in Jangam math Bhaktapur, is the head part of Shri Kedarnath. This is also mentioned in the Sheela Lekh at the Doleshwar Mahadev.

The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican rebels.  Context  When Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos was advancing on the capital of Oaxaca, he routed a Spanish loyalist force at Zitlala, Guerrero. After his escape from the 72-day siege at Cuautla, Morelos joined his army together with 800 men under the command of Hermenegildo Galeana and Miguel Bravo at Chiautla. He then moved to march against the loyalist commander General Jos√© Mar√≠a A√±orve de Salas at Chilapa de √Ålvarez followed by General Cerro at Tixtla de Guerrero. The regional Mexican commander, Juan Francisco Par√≠s, did not move to further defend these towns as his army was occupied defending Ayutla de los Libres. General Cerro, knowing that :es:M√°ximo BravoM√°ximo Bravo was marching with soldiers from Chilpancingo de los Bravo, decided to attack him at Tixtla de Guerrero and informed A√±orve de Salas of his plans to that end. As Bravo marched towards Chilpancingo, he received news that Morelos was in the area around the Tlacesoutitlan River and that royalist forces under the command of Juli√°n Ayala Larraz√°bal were marching towards Petaquillas. The battle After being informed of these developments, A√±orve de Salas ordered Cerro to join his forces, however, a party of 50 men who apparently did not receive the orders or who had not yet begun their maneuvers to join the main Spanish force, were in the town of Zitlala when an insurgent force under the command of Hermenegildo Galeana arrived and gave battle. The insurgents advanced on the town in two sections and eventually were successful in obliging the loyalist forces, who were on horseback, to retreat. The retreating Spanish forces left behind weapons and prisoners which were then taken to Zacatula.

Biography =Background= His biographers state that he belonged to the Giorca (Ë¶∫ÁàæÈΩä), clan and that his father Wambulu (ÂÆåÂ∏ÉÁ•ø), remained loyal to Nurhaci despite efforts of the Janggiya (Á´üÂòâ) and Nimala (Â∞ºÁë™Ëò≠) people to tempt him to rebel. Behind this statement lies a bitter dissention in Nurhaci's own clan which the official Qing historians tried to conceal. There is no clan named Giolca among the 641 listed in the Genealogy of the Manchu Clans, (ÂÖ´ÊóóÊªøÊ¥≤Ê∞èÊóèÈÄöË≠ú Baqi Manzhou shizu tungbu, 80 + 2 j√ºan, completed early in 1745). Giolca was the place in which Nurhaci's grand-uncle, Desik≈´ Âæ∑‰∏ñÂ∫´, had settled, and it seems probable that Anfiyangg≈´ was one of Desik≈´'s descendants. Janggiya and Nimala were similarly the homes of two other of Nurhaci's grand-uncles whose descendants were hostile to Nurhaci's plans for conquest. =Military Service= Anfiyangg≈´ joined Nurhaci in all the expeditions by which between 1583 and 1593 he subdued the smaller tribes round him and crushed his hostile relatives at Janggiya and Nimala. During a battle with Hada forces in 1593 Anfiyangg≈´ saved Nurhaci's life, for which the title ≈†ongkoro Baturu, (eagle-like conquering hero), was conferred upon him. Attached to the Bordered Blue Banner, he took part in all of the larger campaigns of the next twenty years, and in 1616 with Nurhaci's proclamation of the Jin Dynasty, he was appointed as one of Nurhaci's five chief councilors in the newly organized administration, the other four being Eidu, H≈´rhan, Fiongdon, and Hohori. He died one year after he had assisted in the capture of Shenyang and Liaoyang. In 1659 the posthumous name, Minzhuang (ÊïèÁãÄ), was conferred upon him and a tablet was erected in memory of his services to the founding of the dynasty. =Legacy= Anfiyangg≈´, and his descendants held the hereditary captaincy of four companies in the first division of the Bordered Blue Banner. In memory of Anfiyangg≈´'s exploits, the minor hereditary rank of Qingche Duwei was conferred on one of his sons (1650) and on a great-grandson (1713). Another son was killed in battle and was rewarded posthumously with the hereditary Qingche Duwei. A grandson, named Sunta (Â≠´Â°î) (?-1666), was onetime president of the Board of Works (1656‚Äì60) and in 1664 was made a first class baron.

When the government upgraded Aizawl College to the status of government aided college in 1989, it became a day college and hence the need of another evening college.

Ahn is a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Her research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of cell signaling, with a speciality in phosphorylation and cancers. Ahn's work uses the tools of \\"classical chemistry\\" to work on understanding the genetic code and how genetics affects life processes. She has been a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder since 2003, where she is a Distinguished Professor. She was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator between 1994 and 2014. In 2018, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Biography  = Past education, research, and awards = Ahn earned her bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Washington, Seattle in 1979. Ahn conducted research in Lyle Jensen's lab, focusing on X-ray crystallography. Her participation in this research aided in better understanding of protein folding and visualizing of the 3-D structure of proteins by using computational techniques with X-ray crystallography. Additionally, Ahn worked as an undergraduate research assistant in David Teller's lab, which investigated protein hydrodynamics, the study of the motion of proteins relative to their aqueous environment, which they can either be suspended or dissolved within. In 1985, she received her PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Here, Ahn worked with Judith Klinman, studying enzymology. Ahn's first postdoctoral job was studying hormone receptor binding at the University of Washington with Christoph de Haen. Ahn then moved to Edwin Kreb's lab, where she began her career in signal transduction. In this lab, Ahn was \\"one of the first to describe MAP kinases and MAP kinase kinases.\\" She started working at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1992. Ahn was part of the Searle Scholars Program to fund young scientists' work in 1993. She was one of eight project collaborators who won a grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation for identifying proteins in a single cell type. In 2012, she was named College Professor of Distinction at the University of Colorado. In 2014, she became part of the Subcellular Pan-Omics for Advanced Rapid Threat Assessment (SPARTA) team which is a biochemical project supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). = Current research = Ahn is currently working at the University of Colorado and is conducting research on cell signaling, information and proteomics, and molecular biophysics. Specific topics of her research include: * Proteomics and Signal Transduction: ** The lab's goal is to investigate new mechanisms that are responsible for regulation and cell signaling. In order to do this, Ahn uses mass spectrometry for protein profiling in combination with biochemical and cellular approaches to better understand a cell's response to signaling pathways. ** In addition, Ahn investigates the internal motions of protein kinases, specifically studying their coupling protein dynamics and catalytic function. ** Ahn studies the development of cancer by examining \\"signaling pathways that are activated in melanoma and influence cancer progression and cell behavior.\\" * Wnt5A signaling: ** Wnt5A is responsible for controlling embryonic body axis formation and can be found at high levels in melanomas, resulting in cell invasion. Ahn and her lab discovered the \\"Wnt5a receptor-actin-myosin-polarity (WRAMP) structure,\\" which aids in directional cell movements by triggering membrane retraction. Ahn was able to determine WRAMP structure using organelle proteomics. * B-Raf signaling: ** In half of melanoma cells, the B-Raf protein contains a missense mutation (V600E mutation), which is responsible for cell transformation, invasion, and metastasis. In order to profile phosphoproteins, Ahn uses negative precursor ion mass spectrometry to discover and count phosphopeptides. Ahn has identified numerous different proteins with this method and with this information studied how cell mechanisms used in cancer therapy were affected by protein-protein signaling. *Proteomics Technologies: ** In Ahn's lab, she uses multi dimensional liquid chromatography-MS/MS to identify over 8,000 proteins in each sequence of MS. Ahn's goal is to be more accurate and sensitive in these 2-D-LC-MS/MS techniques in assign proteins. * Protein Kinase Dynamics: ** In Ahn's lab, she uses hydrogen-exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS) to discover and better understand protein motions on the inside of kinases, where energy fluctuations occur. Ahn's goal is to understand how the different protein dynamics are able to regulate catalytic activity in specific enzymes, most notably protein kinase. Ahn conducts research which focuses on ERK2 MAP kinases, that provide an ideal model due to their clear link between activity and protein dynamics. = Community service = Ahn was elected president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) in the summer of 2015. She was previously a member of the council.

His discoveries have led to new cancer treatments for the deadliest cancers. He is also the director of the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) scientific advisory council. He has a longstanding interest in mechanisms of T-cell development and activation, the development of novel strategies for tumor immunotherapy, and is recognized as one of the first people to isolate the T-cell antigen receptor complex protein. In 2014, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences; in 2018, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Tasuku Honjo. Early life Allison was born on 7 August 1948 in Alice, Texas, the youngest of three sons of Constance Kalula (Lynn) and Albert Murphy Allison.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VD62-RT3 He was inspired by his eighth-grade math teacher to pursue a career in science, spending a summer in a National Science Foundation‚Äìfunded summer science-training program at the University of Texas, Austin and completing high-school biology by correspondence course at Alice High School. Allison earned a bachelor of science degree in microbiology from University of Texas, Austin in 1969, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He earned his doctor of philosophy degree in biological science in 1973, also from UT Austin, as a student of G. Barrie Kitto. Career From 1974 to 1977, Allison worked as postdoctoral fellow at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in California. Then he worked as assistant biochemist and assistant professor at MD Anderson to 1984. He was appointed a professor of immunology and director of the Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 and was concurrently appointed professor at the University of California, San Francisco from 1997. In 2004, he moved to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City to become the director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and the chair of the immunology program as well as the Koch chair in immunologic studies and attending immunologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was a professor of Weill Cornell Medicine and co-chair of the Department of Graduate Program in Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences from 2004 to 2012, and also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator until 2012, when he left to join the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012. Since 2012 he has been chair of immunology at M.D. Anderson. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine), and is a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is director of the Cancer Research Institute scientific advisory council. Previously, he served as president of the American Association of Immunologists. Allison serves as a commentator in the Cancer documentary. Research Cancer Therapy by Inhibition of Negative Immune Regulation (CTLA4, PD1) Allison trained at Scripps Research under tumor-immunologist Ralph Reisfeld, Ph.D., professor emeritus, researching human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and T-cells and exploring the role HLA proteins play in enabling the immune system to distinguish self from invaders. In 1977, Allison and a colleague, G. N. Callahan, reported in a letter to Nature that they had found evidence that the immune system was prevented from attacking cancer cells due to antigens‚Äô association with additional proteins. Finding the factors that inhibited the immune attack on cancer has been key to developing checkpoint-blockade cancer immunotherapies. In 1982, Allison first discovered the T-cell receptor.Allison's research to elucidate mechanisms of T-cell responses was conducted in the 1990s at the University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1990s, Jim Allison showed that CTLA-4 acts as an inhibitory molecule to restrict T-cell responses. In 1996, Allison was the first to show that antibody blockade of a T-cell inhibitory molecule (known as CTLA-4) could lead to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and tumor rejection. This concept of blocking T-cell inhibitory pathways as a way of unleashing anti-tumor immune responses and eliciting clinical benefit laid the foundation for the development of other drugs that target T-cell inhibitory pathways, which have been labeled as \\"immune checkpoint therapies\\". This work ultimately led to the clinical development of ipilimumab (Yervoy), which was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Allison's research is in molecular immunology of the T-cell antigen receptor complex, co-stimulatory receptors, and other molecules involved in T-cell activation. He is particularly interested in finding signals that lead to differentiation of naive T-cells and also those that determine whether antigen receptor engagement will lead to functional activation or inactivation of T-cells. Once defined, the basic studies are used to develop new strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and immunotherapy of cancer. Most recently he has been interested in understanding the immune responses in cancer patients who respond to immunotherapy. He established the immunotherapy platform at MD Anderson Cancer Center to study immune responses in cancer patients. Honors According to a quantitative analysis, Allison was the top-ranking recipient of the most prestigious international science awards in the period 2010‚Äì2019, having received 13 of the top 40 such awards in any field of science. In 2011 Allison won the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award for Biotechnology and Medicine and was awarded the American Association of Immunologists Lifetime Achievement Award.

Baker Ph.D. is a Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and formally the head of the Department of Biology. She earned her B.S. in Biochemistry from University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Stanford University under the guidance of Arthur Kornberg. She joined the MIT faculty in 1992 and her research is focused on the mechanisms and regulation of DNA transposition and protein chaperones. She is a member of the National Academy of Science, fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator since 1994.  Education  Tania Baker started her major research when she became a graduate student at Stanford University. When she arrived at Stanford, there had already been work done to isolate 25 different enzymes and proteins. It had been determined that the role of these enzymes and proteins were to aid DNA replication at specific sequences found on the chromosome, but the individual role of each enzyme and protein had not yet been established. There had been tests to figure this out in vitro, but not in vivo. Baker eventually helped discover the sequential steps that each enzyme and protein performed in order to start DNA replication in vivo. Baker performed this research during the time it took to get her master's and Ph.D. Career For her postdoctoral research, she worked with Kiyoshi Mizuuchi at the National Institute of Health. This time her work was with DNA transposons. DNA transposons are also known as jumping genes because they move around the chromosome and can insert themselves into different DNA sequences. The ability of these genes to move around is extremely important in DNA's flexibility and ensuring that there are different combinations of DNA in genes. These transposons can also be the source of mutations. They can also help to increase the stability of certain DNA sequences. One aspect of some transposons that is important for research is that they can help bacteria exchange antibiotic resistance genes. Baker focused on one such transposon called the mu transposon found in E. coli. Eventually, Baker left the National Institute of Health to work as an independent researcher at MIT. Here she discovered that mu transposons behave similarly to transposons and retrotransposons involved with bacterial resistance. Retrotransposons are transposons that first transcribe the moving gene sequence into RNA. This RNA then gets retro-transcribed back into DNA, and it is this DNA that ends up being reincorporated somewhere else in the chromosome. Through her work with these different transposons, Baker started to look at unfoldases, which are a type of protein chaperone. Unfoldases serve to unfold or degrade proteins found in cells. Unfoldases are related to transposons because some of them release proteins that aid in transposition. When the proteins are released, transposition of the DNA sequence is stopped, and Baker wanted to know what caused the proteins to release from DNA. Currently, most of Baker's work focuses on these unfoldases. She works specifically with the AAA+ unfoldase family and has done a lot of research on the ClpX unfoldase. In addition to unfoldases, she looks at adaptors, which are proteins that aid the unfoldases. The AAA+ family of unfoldases is in all organisms and plays an important role in maintaining which proteins are active within a cell. Unfoldases help to destroy proteins that have become damaged or proteins that have built up too much. They are important in ensuring that proteins are properly recycled so that cells do not constantly need new amino acids. Baker wants to figure how unfoldases work and how they are controlled by cells.

The story was written after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, with a 14-year-old girl having to deal with the consequences of a fictional similar disaster in Germany. It was translated into English by Patricia Crampton, published in 1997, as Fall-Out. Die Wolke, which received several awards, became a popular book for reading in class and was adapted for film and stage, has been regarded as Pausewang's signature work.  History  Pausewang wrote the novel Die Wolke in 1987, after the Chernobyl disaster when nuclear fallout rained down on much of Europe. She used information that the organisation \\"√Ñrzte gegen den Atomtod\\" (Physicians against nuclear death) had published at the end of the 1970s. In 1988, the book was awarded the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, the Kurd La√üwitz Award1988 Kurd La√üwitz Award and the Deutscher Science Fiction Preis in the category Best Novel.Preistr√§ger Deutscher Science Fiction Preis It soon became part of reading curriculum in many schools in Germany. The novel was adapted as a film in 2006. Pausewang wrote in 2011, after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, that she was determined to take her readers seriously regardless of age, and she wanted to warn of dangers of her time. Sales of Die Wolke surged again on that occasion.  Plot  The story deals with a Chernobyl-type nuclear disaster happening on German soil. The heroine of the story is a fourteen-year-old girl who flees the contaminating cloud of radiation and experiences the ensuing breakdown of social order. The story begins at school where Janna-Berta and the other students and teachers are alarmed of a nuclear accident in the vicinity. She returns home. Her younger brother Uli is alone because the parents are away and the grandparents on vacation. Together, they flee by bicycle, because all the neighbours have already left. They meet chaos on the roads. Uli collapses with his bicycle and is run over by a car and killed. Janna-Berta, in shock, is taken to the station in Bad Hersfeld. She wants to return to her brother to bury him, is contaminated by radiation, and collapses. She wakes up in a provisional hospital in Herleshausen, where she witnesses the hardships of others. She learns of the extent of the disaster from television and a nurse. Her hair falls out. Her aunt from Hamburg finds her and tells her that her parents and youngest brother, who had been with them, are dead. The news was intended to be kept secret. Janna-Berta stays with an aunt, who is not responsive to the girl's needs and wants to return to normality as soon as possible. She moves to another aunt who shows solidarity with the victims. When her hometown is no longer banned, she returns. On the way, she finds her brother's body and buries it. She also finds her grandparents at home. They have just returned from their vacation and cannot believe what has happened until she tells them the shocking truth.  Editions  Die Wolke was first published by Maier, Ravensburg, in 1987, in the series Ravensburger junge Reihe (Ravensburg Young Series) .Die Wolke DNB 1987 Several editions followed shortly. A paperback version was issued as Ravensburger Taschenbuch in 2006 (),Die Wolke DNB 2006 and a Jubil√§umsausgabe (anniversary edition), 25 years after the first edition, in 2012 ().Die Wolke DNB 2013 Die Wolke appeared as an audio book, and an audio play, both versions abbreviated and following the book freely.

The film, produced by Sai Korrapati and S. S. Rajamouli under Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram banner, marks the debut of actors Naveen Chandra, Rahul Ravindran and Lavanya Tripathi. The soundtrack of the film was composed by Radhan and cinematography was by Murali G. The film was released on 10 August 2012 to a mixed reception but became a commercial success. Plot In 1991, Gautham (Rahul Ravindran) a wealthy man sees Mithuna (Lavanya Tripathi) for the first time and falls in love with her. However she becomes involved in an accident and is on her death bed. Gautham pays for her surgeries and she recovers but after she gains consciousness, Mithuna asks about Surya (Naveen Chandra). Apparently, both are in love with each other but Mithuna is told that Surya is dead. Meanwhile, Gautham expresses his feelings and he takes her to Ooty and shows his love for Mithuna, who is unable to forget Surya. The two often fight and argue and one day Mithuna goes missing. Gautham thinks that Mithuna has left the house to commit suicide. He slaps her but realizes that she accepts his love and has decided to marry him. As he goes to Hyderabad to make the arrangements for the wedding, he suddenly sees a painting of Mithuna on the road. A beggar tells him that a mad man named Surya drew it, which shocks Gautham. The beggar tells him that Surya stays near a factory and to his disbelief, he finds glass bottles of different colors arranged to represent Mithuna's face. Surya is revealed to be alive and is distraught at the thought of Mithuna being dead. A flashback from three months prior shows that Surya had seen Mithuna on the same day as Gautham. He falls in love with her at first sight. Surya follows Mithuna and woos her. Mithuna always pushes him away, saying that she will never like him and that either she or he will die if she one day ends up falling for him. After months pass and Surya's attempts remain unsuccessful, he gives up. In his absence, Mithuna suddenly feels for Surya and yearns to see him. She visits his home, finds out that he is an artist, and reciprocates Surya's feelings for her. The two celebrate and near a highway Mithuna asks him if he will ever leave her and he replies that he will not. Soon after, Mithuna is involved in a car accident and her parents are unable to bear the cost of her recovery. Gautham's father arrives and proposes his son's marriage to Mithuna. Mithuna's father asks Surya to leave her. Surya, who is heartbroken, roams aimlessly on the roads of Anantagiri. After learning the truth, Gautham tells Mithuna that Surya is alive. She becomes emotional but refuses to marry him. Gautham's father plans to kill Surya for the love of his son. Gautham learns of the plan and tells his father that he will be killed instead of Surya. Gautham sacrifices his life for Mithuna but before he dies, Mithuna is walking in front of his car. Mithuna is heartbroken a second time. Later Mithuna and Surya meet each other. Gautham's love succeeds when Mithuna asks Surya for time to forget Gautham. Gautham's father understands his mistake in trying to kill Surya and regrets that his own son was killed instead. Upon his son's death, he understands that true love cannot be replaced, longs for his son, and decides to die. Later, a dead man at the graveyard is Gautham's father who has been missing.

A former Minister of Information and Communication for the national government, he was sentenced to life in prison for treason after distributing T-shirts with the slogan \\"End to Dictatorship Now\\". After international protest from organizations including Amnesty International and an appeal by US activist Jesse Jackson, Janneh was pardoned and returned to the US.  Background  Janneh was born in Gunjur village in the Kombo South district. He attended St. Augustine's High School, Banjul from 1974 to 1979, before starting in Mansa Konko as a clerical assistant. At the age of 17, he began working for Radio Gambia as a trainee reporter in June 1981. He later traveled to the U.S. in 1983, he gained a bachelor of arts in communication at Knoxville College in 1986. He then earned a master of arts in 1987 and a PhD in political science in 1990, both at the University of Tennessee. He then taught for ten years at the University of Tennessee until 2000, before moving to Savannah, Georgia, where he established a business of exporting and importing goods to and from Senegal. Six months after Janneh's 2003 return to the Gambia to work as a political/economic assistant at the U.S. Embassy in Banjul, President Yahya Jammeh appointed him as Minister for Information, Communications and Technology in April 2004. Janneh was sacked by Jammeh from the post in July 2005 while attending an international conference in Nigeria. While still a member of the Jammeh government, Janneh established Communication and Information Technology Enterprise (CommIT) in April 2005. The company was tasked to supply computers to companies in the private sector and later moved into real estate. He together with other journalist in diaspora established the Coalition for Change‚ÄìThe Gambia (CGG) in April 2011, which aimed to bring together organisations involved in human rights activities to oppose Jammeh's government.  Treason conviction  In May 2011, he purchased 100 T-shirts that had been produced by the group called Coalition for Change ‚Äì The Gambia (CCG) and began to distributing it. Janneh was arrested on 5 June 2011 by National Intelligence Agency officials for distributing them. Three other activists - fellow Gambians Modou Keita and Ebrima Jallow and a Nigerian, Michael Uche Thomas - were arrested the same day. The four were detained at Mile 2 prison. Ndey Tapha Sosseh, a human rights activist, was also charged for her involvement in the T-shirts' printing, but was no longer in the country. The four detainees were tried in November and December 2011. A number of witnesses testified for the prosecution that they had seen Janneh and the other defendants distributing the T-shirts. Police also presented e-mails in which CCG activists discussed how to change the national government. On 18 January 2012, a Special Criminal Court found Janneh guilty of treason and conspiracy to commit a felony and gave him a life sentence. The judge, Emmanuel Nkea stated that he would have preferred to give Janneh a death sentence had it been permitted under Gambian law. Janneh, Keita, Jallow, and Thomas were also each sentenced to three years of hard labor for sedition. One of them, Michael Uche Thomas (a Nigerian national), died in prison of pneumonia in March 2012. The anti-censorship group ARTICLE 19 described itself as \\"appalled\\" by the sentences and \\"deeply concerned by the state of freedom of expression in The Gambia\\". Amnesty International declared the four men prisoners of conscience and called for their immediate release, stating, \\"Gambia must stop such acts of persecution and allow criticism to be heard in the country.\\" Janneh was released in September 2012 following an appeal on his behalf by US activist and politician Jesse Jackson. Janneh returned to the US and stated that he would resume his IT business as well as work on a book.

It is situated next to the Mount Remarkable sheep station and Mount Celia Station. Dr Laver leased the station in 1904 and was struck by the similarity of the area to the Barkly Tableland in Queensland. It was the first pastoral pursuit that was established in the area. The area received of rain in 1910, which is well above average, of the fall coming in January. This resulted in excellent feed and herbage being available to cattle which thrived in the conditions. In 1923 Laver sold the leasehold to Mr T. H. Pearse of Gums Station near Burra, South Australia. At the time the station was stocked with approximately 1,400 head of cattle. Pearse also took up the lease of neighbouring Mount Celia Station to have a total holding of about . Pearse then stocked the station with sheep imported from South Australia, which thrived in the area, resulting in heavy lambing in 1924. Within a year of fencing the property, over 100 dingoes were killed within the fences, mostly by poisoning. Kangaroos continued to be a problem with the destruction of fences but rabbits were not being reported as a big pest. Two Aboriginal prospectors tried their luck in an abandoned shaft located just within the station's gates in 1933. The pair found a formation about in length and bearing over to the ton of gold. The station stockmen often had lunch at the bottom of the shaft to escape the heat of the day. In 1934 the station secured an additional 101 merino rams bred at the Koonoona stud out of Kooringa. The area around the station received very heavy rainfall in February 1942 when 490 points or of rain fell over the course of a week. A plague of mice swept over the area in 1943 and neighbouring stations reporting that it was a full-time job keeping the wells clear, with many being covered in of dead and dying mice. In 1950 the station held about 11,500 sheep and produced a yield 0f 328 bales of wool. The station received poor rains in 1952, about half the yearly average of 460 points compared with 887 points. Over 600 sheep were taken from the station in 1953 and trucked to Cashmere Downs Station, whose manager Mr J Bradshaw was in the process of restocking. Yundamindera is currently owned by Minara Resources, along with three other nearby properties: Glenorn, Nambi and Minara Stations. In 2017 Glenorn and Nambi were running approximately 4000 head of cattle; Yundamindera and Minara are both running approximately 2500 head of cattle.

Probably through the influence of his sister Eusebia, the wife of Constantius II, Eusebius was appointed the governor of the province of Hellespontus in AD 355.Martindale & Jones, pg. 308 While here, he was noted as an efficient governor, and an improvement on his predecessors.Libanius, Scott Bradbury, Selected Letters of Libanius: From the Age of Constantius and Julian (2004), pg. 153 After his term had completed, he went to Antioch where he was notified of his appointment as governor of Bithynia et Pontus, which he held in AD 356. He was then made consul prior alongside his brother Flavius Hypatius in AD 359. Eventually moving back to Antioch, it was here in AD 371 that Eusebius was accused of treason and put on trial during the reign of the emperor Valens. Although he was found guilty, fined and exiled, he was soon recalled from his exile by the emperor, and his wealth and position were restored.Martindale & Jones, pg. 309 A Christian,Barnes, T.

The CNT is an Engineering Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation to create devices to restore the body's capabilities for sensation and movement. The National Science Foundation has awarded the CNT $~30 million since 2011. The CNT is based at the University of Washington, and its main partner organizations are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and San Diego State University (SDSU). CNT researchers specialize in fields related to neural engineering including: Biological and traditional engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, neurological surgery, neuroscience and neurobiology and philosophy. Center faculty also hail from various fields of medicine and assist with real-world implementation of designs. The CNT places a strong emphasis on neuroethics, exploring how ethical issues such as identity, privacy, and moral or legal responsibility in relation to the expanding field of neural technologies. Mission The CNT's mission is to develop innovative neural devices and methods for directing engineered neuroplasticity in the brain and spinal cord, which will improve sensory and motor function for people with spinal cord injury, stroke and other neurological disorders. Engineered neuroplasticity is a new form of rehabilitation that uses engineered devices to re-wire the nervous system and restore lost or injured connections in the brain and spinal cord. Research =Testbeds= #Cortical Plasticity Testbed: The goal of this testbed is to engineer neuroplasticity in the brain, improving the brain's ability to adapt and recover after injury. It is targeted toward people with neurological disorders such as stroke. This is where center researchers test the ability of neural stimulation protocols to induce activity-dependent neuroplasticity by remodeling neural connections between cortical regions in the brain. #Spinal Plasticity Testbed: This testbed directly tests researchers ability to engineer neuroplasticity within the spinal cord after injury. For example, center researchers are using electrical spinal stimulation synchronized with residual muscle activity or movement in order to produce lasting improvements in hand and arm function after spinal cord injury. #Co-adaptation Testbed: This testbed focuses on understanding and developing mathematical algorithms designed to help a brain‚Äìcomputer interface co-adapt with the brain itself in a neural stimulation system. An example of work in this testbed is to quantify large-scale cortical dynamics during learning and neuroplasticity induction, as well as changes in cortical dynamics that occur when users directly control brain stimulation using their thoughts. =Thrusts= A Research Thrust is the fundamental knowledge or basic research that investigators bring to the Center. These thrusts feed into technologies that exist and that CNT researchers are focusing on, including electrocorticography, the practice of placing electrodes on the brain to record electrical activity. These new technologies are then integrated into research testbeds. Thrust 1: Communication and Interface The Communication and Interface thrust is largely concerned with developing more intelligent ways of extracting information from the brain, interpreting them, and then providing feedback to the neural system. The objective of developing these intelligent systems is to use less power to compute faster, and, potentially, harvest their power through innovative sources. At the same time, these systems must be user- friendly. In other words, they must be easy to use and reliable in mechanical design and computation functions. An objective of this thrust is to develop an electrocorticography (ECoG) system that is compact and power efficient enough to be fully implantable. Thrust 2: Computational Neuroscience The object of Thrust 2 is to better understand neural circuit dynamics and develop co-adaptive mathematical algorithms for inducing neuroplasticity in the brain and spinal cord. A deeper understanding of the brain's computation will inform design of sensorimotor devices for neural control and allow for more targeted future work on investigating neural function. Using this knowledge, inorganic systems can be better engineered to better interact with the brain's endogenous system of computation. Thrust 3: Experimental Neuroscience The Experimental Neuroscience thrust seeks to uncover fundamental principles of sensorimotor neuroscience by performing innovative closed-loop experiments enabled by CNT hardware and computational advances. Thrust 4: Neuroethics The Neuroethics thrust is concerned with understanding and exploring ethical issues like privacy, normality, and moral or legal responsibilities in relation to neural technologies. One focus is on ensuring that people with disabilities are involved at every point in the development of the technologies that are ultimately aimed at assisting them. The neuroethics team conducts focus group discussions with these \\"end users\\" to help guide the work of other CNT researchers concerned with developing these assistive systems. Educational Programs Brain Awareness Week, 2014The CNT places emphasis on more than completing research; it also emphasizes educating the next generation of researchers. While this includes traditional programs at the graduate level, the CNT participates in programs designed to educate undergraduates, K-12 students, and K-12 teachers. The CNT uses these programs to encourage diversity and inclusion of minorities and persons with disabilities. The CNT operates as a host site for NSF programs, including: Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers. =Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)= As a host site for NSF's REU program, the CNT hosts students from across the United States for ten weeks during the summer. REU students conduct research in CNT labs, attend lectures and take part in classes covering scientific communications and research methods. =Research Experiences for Veterans (REV)= The Center sponsors a program for veterans on the University of Washington's Seattle campus. Similar to the REU program, participants from across the United States take part in research at the interface of biology and engineering for ten weeks during the summer. REV participants work in CNT labs, attend lectures and learn about scientific communications and research methods. =Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)= Similar to the NSF REU program, the RET program places teachers in CNT labs. Participating teachers develop lesson plans to take back to the classroom; these lesson plans are posted on the CNT website for anyone to access and use. =Young Scholars Program (YSP)= The Young Scholars Program is a summer program designed to give high school students the opportunity to conduct research in an academic laboratory setting before entering college. In 2017, the CNT piloted a condensed version of this program called YSP-REACH. YSP-REACH is a five-day summer program at the University of Washington. High school students receive an introduction to neuroscience and neural engineering, neuroethics, scientific communication and the latest developments in brain-computer interfaces. The goal of YSP and YSP- REACH is to provide students with exposure to the field of neural engineering and provide basic preparation for college studies in STEM subjects as well as future STEM careers. =Undergraduate Curriculum= The CNT has developed new undergraduate curriculum for the University of Washington that includes the course Neural Engineering, Neural Engineering Lab and Neural Engineering Tech Studio. An undergraduate minor in Neural Computation and Engineering is now available. Materials from these courses will be disseminated to partner institutions. =Graduate Curriculum= The CNT has developed new curriculum for a graduate certificate in Neural Computation and Engineering that includes two new courses. In addition, the CNT supports exchange students to promote an international spirit of collaboration within the field.

Biography Shipman was born in Norwich, Norfolk, After a period in London, the family was evacuated to Pensilva, Cornwall, in 1940. He did his national service in the RAF, partly in Singapore, then briefly attended Merton College, Oxford.James Fergusson in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: OUP, 2004‚Äì2006) Retrieved 4 November 2018. He worked as a sales representative in publishing from 1955 to 1965, mostly in Europe, then returned to Britain to work for the publishers Thames & Hudson. In 1968, Shipman began work on his first book, The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years, which was published two years later and sold well. He also worked as a lecturer, journalist and film consultant, and from 1986 until his death wrote obituaries for The Independent newspaper. Shipman died of a heart attack aged 63 in Overton, Hampshire. At the time, he was writing a biography of Fred Astaire. He was survived by his partner since 1964, the art director Felix Brenner. Richard Cohen, writing Shipman's obituary for The Independent, stated: > For over a quarter of a century David Shipman was the most influential > writer on film in the world. He was never [a] film critic for a national > newspaper, and was generally not seen by the cinema establishment as a > heavyweight; but in the 10 books he wrote, most notably the three volumes > that made up The Great Movie Stars and the two-volume The Story of Cinema, > he exerted an influence no other writer on film has matched.

The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. This Spanish siege of the town, lasting 111 days, was the longest of the entire war. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican insurgents. The siege was defended against by a group of local insurgents commanded by Colonel Valerio Trujano. This siege is considered one of the most important battles of the second phase of the Mexican War for Independence.  Context  The insurgent forces commanded by Valerio Trujano and Miguel Bravo had joined together with those of the priest, Father Mendoza at the beginning of March 1812 at Tamazulapan, Oaxaca. Their goal was to defeat the royalist General Jos√© Mar√≠a de R√©gules Villasante who had fortified himself at Yanhuitl√°n At the beginning of the insurgent attacks, R√©gules Villasante decided to occupy only the town square and the buildings in its immediate vicinity. The insurgent attackers, who initially believed their assault to be a complete success, were turned back and obliged to retreat once they reached the fierce Spanish resistance in the city center. Miguel Bravo marched from there with his forces to Cuautla to aid Generalissimo Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n who was there besieged by royalist forces. Trujano, for his part, marched with his own troops to Huajuapan where he fortified the city and recovered from the defeat at Yanhuitl√°n.  The Siege  A royalist commander named Bemardino Bonavia who controlled one royalist division, began the siege against the town in an effort to regain Spanish control. He was quickly aided by more royalist troops under the command of Jos√© Mar√≠a de R√©gules Villasante on 5 April 1812 beginning the siege. The Spanish forces numbered about 1,500 men with 14 pieces of artillery. Five days after their arrival at Huajuapan, the royalist troops opened fire on the city, unleashing all their firepower on the rebel defenses. Valerio Trujano, who had no artillery of his own with which to defend the city, was unable to return fire until the fabrication of new artillery pieces made from the town's church bells.Z√°rate, 1880; 318-319 Royalist attacks on the town were almost constant, however, they were continually repulsed by the insurgent defenders. On 17 May, a messenger, Jos√© Remigio Sarabia, an Indian from the town of Santiago Nuyoo, managed to get through the blockaded city and get word to General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, who was in Chilapa at the time. He informed the General that the Spanish were besieging the city. Morelos decided to come to Trujano's aid and ordered Miguel Bravo's forces to march to Huajuapan de Le√≥n to lift the siege where Morelos himself would follow a short time later. On 23 July, the rebel forces managed to break the siege around four o clock in the afternoon. The Mexican relief army consisted of a few thousand men and included such people as Vicente Guerrero, the Galeana brothers and the Bravo brothers. The division under the control of Morelos was split into four columns that formed four fronts of attack. These attacks were successful in breaking the Spanish siege positions. The Spanish royalists decided to withdraw from the battle, leaving behind 30 cannons, over 1,000 muskets, horses, various supplies and over 400 dead.  Celebration at Huajuapan  Upon liberating the city, Morelos, being an extremely devoted Catholic, ordered a public holiday in the Catholic tradition to honor the Se√±or de los Corazones to acknowledge his help in the resistance to the siege. The novena concluded exactly on 23 July and coincided with the breaking of the siege. Since then, Huajuapan observes a public holiday on this day to commemorate its date. From 14 July through 24 July, the novena is celebrated with daily masses and processions through the different parishes of the city to the cathedral, where the image of the Se√±or de los Corazones can be found. Much of these festivities are organized by the brotherhood of the Se√±or de los Corazones. At the conclusion of the religious observances, various cultural, artistic and recreational activities take place throughout the town as well as a fireworks show. On the night of 23 July, the bishop of the town together with the bulk of the clergy from the diocese, celebrates a mass in the atrium of the central cathedral to give thanks for the heroic defense of the city. On 24 July, the streets of the city are decorated with different chalk drawings as supplementary decoration for the largest procession which occurs in conjunction with religious songs, mariachi music and flowers and follows the main streets of the city.

Directed by the Dutchmen Albert Balink and Mannus Franken, it featured an amateur native cast and starred Raden Mochtar and Soekarsih. The story follows the forbidden love between a fisherman and a farmer's daughter. Balink began work on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They gathered a budget of 75,000 gulden ‚Äì several times the budget of other local productions ‚Äì and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers. Pareh resulted in a change in the cinema of Dutch East Indies, which had been Chinese-oriented for several years; films began to make more effort at targeting local audiences. Balink later found commercial success with Terang Boelan (1937). The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh and Terang Boelan the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s. Premise Mahmud (Rd. Mochtar), a fisherman, is in love with Wagini (Soekarsih), a farmer's daughter. However, local superstition dictates that their relationship will bring disaster. This seems to prove true after the village leader's keris is stolen, but eventually Mahmud and Wagini are able to unite with the help of his fellow villagers. Production During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions. One of the Wong brothers, 1947 Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, began work on what was to become Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio ‚Äì an old tapioca flour factory ‚Äì as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra. Balink and the Wongs spent most of two years compiling the necessary funds, with Balink in charge of general operations as the head of Java Pacific Film, a joint operation. Balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in the film. Unlike earlier filmmakers in the country, Balink invested time and money in searching for the best locations and actors possible, without considering whether a person was already a celebrity. Ultimately, most of those cast for Pareh had not acted before, including stars Mochtar and Soekarsih. The role of Mahmud was filled when Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome ‚Äì as he expected for the role ‚Äì driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which he and his family had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience. Artistic direction and some of the screenwriting was handled by Mannus Franken, an avant-garde documentary filmmaker from the Netherlands, whom Balink had brought to the Indies. Franken insisted on including ethnographic shots to better present the local culture to international audiences. Franken took an interest in the documentary and ethnographic aspects of the film, directing the shots for these portions, while the Wongs handled the general shots. According to Biran, this was reflected in the camera angles used. Pareh, which had been recorded on 35 mm film using single-system devices, was brought to the Netherlands for editing. There the original voices of the cast were dubbed by actors in the Netherlands, resulting in stilted language use and heavy Dutch accents. Though initially the filmmakers had planned on using gamelan music, the poor quality of the recording equipment in the Indies led to the soundtrack being redone, using European-style music, in the Netherlands. From start to finish the production of Pareh cost 75,000 gulden (approximately US$ 51,000), 20 times as much as a regular local production. After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime. Release and reception Pareh was screened in the Netherlands as Pareh, een Rijstlied van Java (also noted as Het Lied van de Rijst) beginning on 20 November 1936. The film was also shown in the Indies. It was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted the producers. The film was critically acclaimed in the Netherlands, partially owing to the emphasis of Franken's involvement. Although it was a commercial success amongst the intelligentsia in the Indies, Pareh was a failure with lower-class native audiences. Mochtar never viewed the film in full. Historical reception of Pareh has generally been positive. Writing in 1955, the Indonesian author and cultural critic Armijn Pane opined that Pareh was technically unparalleled in contemporary Indies cinema, with careful continuity and dynamic cuts. He was critical, however, of the film's tendency to see the Indies' native population through European eyes and depict them as \\"primitive\\". The American film historian John Lent, writing in 1990, described Pareh as a \\"meticulously detailed and costly\\" film which attempted to not only earn money, but show the local culture. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's later work Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) was the other. Heider, John H. McGlynn, and Salim Said note that the film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing the path of cinematic developments in the country. Legacy The release of Pareh was followed by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who ‚Äì together with Balink ‚Äì continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by Pareh. Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by Pareh, began to improve the quality of the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following Pareh, films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts. Mochtar and Soekarsih, who first met on the set of Pareh, married after appearing together in Terang Boelan. This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies. Terang Boelan proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's Krisis (Crisis), released after Indonesia had become independent.

Salandy-Brown has spoken of her realisation after returning to Trinidad that locally \\"There was no place for people who read to get together, in a forum to talk about books and there were so many Caribbean writers abroad who had not been to other islands ‚Äî something was missing.\\" As she stated in 2011: \\"In Britain there are a hundred and how many literary festivals. Little Dominica, which is so poor and so tiny, has a literary festival. Jamaica had one for 10 years, the Calabash. I think Antigua has one.

They issued three studio albums on Zombie Penis Death Records, which were distributed by Waterfront Records, Breakfast (1991), Gratuitous (1992) and The Unbearable Lightness of Being a Dickhead (1993). They enjoyed a cult following; however, the band broke up in 1994. They were compared to TISM throughout their career, with some people actually claiming Mr Floppy were a TISM side project, although the band members hated such comparisons. Band history Mr Floppy were formed in Ascot Vale, a suburb of Melbourne, in 1989 by Tim Aylward on guitar (ex-The Swarm); Mick Carroll (aka Michael Kuarroll) on guitar; Paul Johnson on bass guitar and lead vocals and Joseph Kennedy (ex- Pray TV) on drums. The band's name comes the fourth and final series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, Blackadder Goes Forth, \\"Mr Floppy\\" being one the Trinity College Tiddlywinkers mentioned by Lt George. They set up their own label, Zombie Penis Death, which was distributed by Waterfront Records. Sometime before the release of their first single, Kennedy left the band and was replaced with a drum machine, dubbed \\"Bonecrusher Roland\\" by the band. Their debut single, \\"100,000 Morrisseys\\", appeared in late 1989, which was written by Aylward and Johnson. The lyrics deal with English rock group The Smiths' front man, Morrissey. The single received many negative reviews but was played on John Peel's radio show. It uses a sample of the beginning of \\"This Charming Man\\" and samples other Smiths' songs (including \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\" and \\"Accept Yourself\\") throughout the track. It was seen by Jason Heller of The A.V. Club as an anti-Morrisey song where the lyrics ask listeners to \\"imagine a nightmarish apocalypse where the fearful question on humanity's lips is 'What shall we do? / What shall we do? / When 100,000 Morrisseys come marching over the hill?'\\". In mid-1990, they signed to Waterfront, who reissued \\"100,000 Morrisseys\\". Late in 1990 they issued a six- track extended play, Firm and Fruity, which had been recorded in that October at Whirled Records Studios. For a Firm and Fruity track, \\"Stir Fry Baby\\", Australian blues musician, Chris Wilson, guested on harmonica. Nick Radford of Tharunka felt, \\"[they] have come up with a few more funny, irreverent tasty ones... [it's] not bad value. The sort of thing you play before going out on a stupid, drunken night on the town.\\" Carroll left the band at the end of 1990 and was replaced by Bernard Blake. On 16 December 1991, Mr Floppy released their debut studio album, Breakfast, which included three cover versions of Australian Crawl's 1983 single, \\"Reckless\\" written by James Reyne, parodied as \\"Breakfast\\". Also included was the entire contents of Firm and Fruity. \\"Breakfast\\" peaked at No. 5 on the 2XX Independent Chart in March 1992. In early 1992, Blake quit the band, who decided to continue as a two-piece. Later in 1992 Mr Floppy issued a seven-track album, Gratuitous. In April that year the group supported a gig by pub rockers, v. Spy v. Spy and Canadian folk- rockers, Crash Test Dummies. This turned out to be their last release on Waterfront ‚Äì they left the label shortly after and got a distribution deal with Mushroom Distribution Services. The band also headlined a show at the Lansdowne in Sydney on 29 April, from which three songs would be included on their next album. In July 1993 the band released their third and final album, The Unbearable Lightness of Being a Dickhead, which included two cover versions of Kate Bush's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". The track \\"Boring Fart\\" from this album was used by Silverchair to open up their first tours in the mid-1990s. The band split up in 1994. Some of their final performances took place between 4 and 7 March of that year at Club O in Perth.http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/pdf/posters/ps48.pdf Johnson formed a new band called Poontang* that year, reusing the old Mr Floppy PO Box. They played 24 concerts and released one album in October 1998 before disbanding. In November 2008 The Dwarf website's Matt James reviewed an EP by Melbourne band Root!, Get Up Yourself (August 2008), and noted the influence of Mr Floppy on TISM and Root!: \\"[w]hatever this kind of music is ‚Äì I'm gonna go with pop-schlock for now‚Äìis very much the wry Melbourne type that seems to have evolved from the oval ball park of Mr Floppy (punk rock), to TISM (dance punk), through to the 5-piece of Root! (roots punk?)\\". Most of the songs pre-1992 were written by Aylward and Johnson. The album The Unbearable Lightness of Being a Dickhead credits all songs to Johnson except \\"Get a Dog Up Ya\\", written by Aylward and Johnson, and \\"Birdie Num Num\\", written by Johnson and Blake. \\"Birdie Num Num\\" is first known to have been performed in late 1991 in Sydney.

It was constructed from a steel-and-wood understructure covered by a highly polished black epoxy resin surface. The construction had a total weight of about 60 tons, using 40 tons of steel. It took two years of planning, and was erected in one month. The installation was created for the occasion of the documenta 2012 exhibition, and opened to the public on 27 April 2012. Entry was free, but the number of visitors on the platform at any one time was limited to 100. Visitors were invited to take off their shoes, ascend to the platform, and experience time on the freely but nearly imperceptibly swinging construction. The mirror-finish surface showed reflections of the visitors, the steel frame architecture of the hall, and the cityscape beyond the large windows of the hall. The Hall for Contemporary Art The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on 9 September, but was extended for one week and finally closed on 16 September 2012. The field was lowered and dismantled after the exhibition. Disassembly took only a little more than a week. Most of the material was to be recycled, but 50 squares cut from the epoxy surface were offered to the public at a price of EUR 250 per piece. The installation was seen by more than 42500 visitors in the first six weeks, and by approximately 120,000 visitors in total.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Pushkinogorye Urban Settlement, the only urban settlement in the district. Population: History In 1569, Tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered to found the Svyatogorsky Monastery. The monastery was located close to the fortress of Voronich, which was protecting Pskov from the south and was later destroyed during the Livonian War. The settlement around the monastery was known as Tobolenets. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. The area was a part of Opochetsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate. In 1924, the hills around the monastery, which had been known as Sviatye Gory (Holy Mountains), were renamed to Pushkinskiye Gory. In 1925, Tobolenets was renamed Pushkinskiye Gory. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Pushkinsky District was established, with the administrative center in the selo of Pushkinskiye Gory. It included parts of former Opochetsky Uyezd. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 1, 1932 parts of abolished Krasnogorodsky District were merged into Pushkinsky District. On January 29, 1935 the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 Pushkinsky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 11, 1937 the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug and renamed Pushkinogorsky District. On February 5, 1941 the okrug was abolished. Between July 1941 and July 1944, Pushkinskiye Gory was occupied by German troops. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast. On February 29, 1960 Pushkinskiye Gory was granted urban-type settlement status. On February 1, 1963 the district was abolished and split between Novorzhevsky and Opochetsky District as a part of abortive Khrushchev's administrative reform. On December 30, 1966, it was re- established. Economy =Industry= In Pushkinskiye Gory, there are enterprises of food and timber industry. =Transportation= Pushkinskiye Gory is located on the highway between Novgorodka and Novorzhev. In Novgorodka, it has access to the M20 highway which connects St. Petersburg and Vitebsk via Pskov. There are also local roads. Culture and recreation The tomb of Alexander Pushkin Pushkinskiye Gory contains ten cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally six objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federally protected monuments are grouped in and around the Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve, a large museum complex located in Pushkinskiye Gory and the surrounding villages. The complex is devoted to Alexander Pushkin, a Russian 19th century national poet, who owned an estate in the village of Mikhaylovskoye and spent there considerable periods of his life.

History Alberton State School and students, circa 1892 The Aboriginal name for the area was Wobbomerijee (where Wobum means mud and Mudtheri means sticky). European settlement began in 1863 when the first settlers arrived, mostly German immigrants. A town reserve was established in 1865 on the southern bank near the junction of the Logan and Albert Rivers. The Ageston sugar plantation and sugar mill operated from 1866 to the 1890s and was described as \\"one of the finest plants in the Moreton district\\" in 1873.St Peter's Lutheran Church, Alberton, 2014In 1869, the first Lutheran church was established near the Lutheran cemetery on Zipfs Road. The area was known as Elkana (meaning \\"God has created and blessed\\"). Later the area was called Alberton after Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, but the name Elkana is preserved in Elkana Road. In 1870, a ferry service across the river was introduced with the first bridge being built in 1876 at Yatala. A German school was established early in the 1870s beside the church. The Alberton Provisional School opened on 13 May 1876 with children attending German school on only one day a week. On 13 October 1884 the provisional school became the Alberton State School. In 1886, a new larger Lutheran church (the present St Peter's at 187 Alberton Road) was built. It was consecrated in 1887 by Rev Hellmuth. In October 1886, a well-known property on the Albert River owned by W. K. Witty called \\"Yellowwood Estate\\" was advertised for subdivision into suitable sized farms and then auctioned by Simon Fraser & Son. A map advertising the auction states that 40 choice farms were available and the auction was to be held on Saturday 27 November at the Palm‚Äôs Hotel, Beenleigh. The Gem Hotel, 2014 The Gem Hotel was established prior to 1911, but it was destroyed by fire on 27 June 1933 but was insured. By December 1933, the hotel had been rebuilt and was still operating in April 2014 on the corner of Stapylton-Jacobs Well Road and Rotary Park Road. The German school was demolished in 1919. The Alberton State School closed in 1966. In the 1950s, a very notable Bora ceremonial site on the Logan river was destroyed, and replaced with a pineapple plantation owned by a Mr Inklemann. The site bore the characteristics of the classic twin circles, with a north-south orientation, the large northern ring measuring 70‚Äì80 feet in diameter, while the smaller ring lay some 100 feet to its south. In the middle of the latter was a native stone hut, consisting of several stone slabs supporting a stone roof, not unlike the dolmen structures of prehistoric Europe.

It began operations in October 1936 at the behest of the autonomous Basque Government. The main Basque naval base was at Portugalete. History During the Spanish Civil War, the Second Spanish Republic had allowed an autonomous government in those Basque areas of Spain that had not been taken by the Nationalist faction, like Biscay and parts of Guipuscoa. The coast of Galicia, along with the Ferrol naval headquarters, became part of rebel-held territory early in the Spanish Civil War. When the Republican Navy became mainly confined to the Mediterranean Sea, after the failure of the blockade of the Gibraltar Strait, its operations in the Bay of Biscay were taken over by the Basque Auxiliary Navy.La Marina de Guerra Auxiliar de Euzkadi (1936‚Äì1937) Basque Auxiliary Navy ships engaged mainly in minesweeping operations. They also played a key role in the evacuation of civilians who fled as the rebel armies advanced from coastal cities such as Gij√≥n and Santander. The first naval action against Francoist forces took place on 15 November 1936, when the rebel destroyer Velasco attempted to intercept the armed trawlers Gipuzkoa and Bizcaia (still under their peacetime names of Mistral and Euzkal-Err√≠a). The trawlers were steaming for Biarritz, France, to escort a freighter when they were spotted by the warship 40 miles off Pasaia. In the ensuing battle, the Velasco was hit and limped away, while the Gipuzkoa received some damage on her forecastle, with two seamen wounded. There was another encounter with the Velasco on 8 January 1937, when the rebel destroyer was laying down mines along with the auxiliary minelayer Genoveva Fierro off Portugalete. After a brief exchange of fire, the Nationalist warships withdrew without accomplishing their mission. The Francoist navy, however, didn't give up and nine days later they set up a minefield successfully. On 17 January the Basque armed trawler Goizeko Izarra struck one of the mines and sank with all her crew of 17 aboard. The following day, while clearing the minefield, the minesweeper Mari-Toya hit another mine and also sank; six men of her crew were lost. Two days later, after the intense work of other minesweepers, the area was declared safe. In February and April, the Nationalist navy laid down two new minefields off Bilbao, but the Basque navy neutralized the devices. The minesweepers disabled more than 200 naval mines during the campaign. The Basque auxiliary navy became a player in a series of conflicts between the Spanish Republic and Nazi Germany, when in December 1936 the German freighters Pluto and Palos were captured by the armed trawler Bizcaia. Pluto was releasead, but the Palos, which was carrying military supplies to the rebels, was taken to Bilbao, where her cargo was confiscated. The largest engagement involving the Basque navy was the Battle of Cape Machichaco, on 5 March 1937, when four naval trawlers escorting the transport ship Galdames. The armed trawlers Bizcaia, Gipuzkoa, Donostia and Nabarra tried to lure the rebel heavy cruiser to a point within firing range of the coastal batteries. The operation was unsuccessful, ending with the sinking of Nabarra, the Gipuzkoa with her bridge shot way, and the other two trawlers scattered. The transport was eventually captured by Canarias.Los bacaladeros vascos y el combate del Cabo Machichaco Gipuzkoa finally arrived at Portugalete in flames and Bizcaia headed for Bermeo, where she met the Estonian merchantman Yorbrook, previously captured by the Canarias, and forced her to make port. Donostia sought shelter in France. On 1 May 1937, Donostia, Bizcaia and Gipuzkoa shelled the port of Bermeo, which had fallen to Italian Fascist troops the day before. The Basque Auxiliary Navy was still operational after the fall of Bilbao in June 1937, moving away from Basque waters and setting its base in Santo√±a and Santander. Later, as the republic also lost those harbors, it operated off Asturias, the last Republican province in North-West Spain. Finally, following the occupation of Asturias by the Francoist armies in October 1937, the Basque Auxiliary Navy ceased its operations. Some Basque sailors became prisoners, but most of them were able to reach France.Marina de Guerra Auxiliar de Euzkadi (1936.1937) Naval units of the Basque Auxiliary Navy =Naval trawlers= The naval trawlers were usually cod fishing vessels, known in Spanish as bous, fitted with pieces of artillery.La Marina de Guerra Republicana.

This film depicts an amusing yet realistic portrayal of the issues prevalent in the Chinese society, especially during the chaotic Chunyun when everyone wants to reunite with their family for the Chinese New Year celebrations. The film is superficially similar to John Hughes's 1987 film Planes, Trains and Automobiles in depicting the journey of two mismatched companions. Plot Li Chenggong (Xu Zheng) is a wealthy and arrogant businessman who treats his employees poorly and has a secret mistress, Manni (Li Man). Although his mistress wants him to spend Chinese New Year with her in Shijiazhuang, Li feels obligated to return to his hometown Changsha to celebrate Chinese New Year with his wife Meili (Zuo Xiaoqing), daughter, and mother. Arriving at the crowded airport, Li finds he has been mistakenly booked in the economy class and sits next to the first- time flyer Niu Geng (Wang Baoqiang), a na√Øve and gullible migrant worker who works as a milk extraction technician. Niu is also setting out to Changsha to claim his defaulted wages from \\"his boss' debtor\\" with a (questionable) promissory note given to him by his boss. As Li and Niu‚Äôs lives crosses paths, the two embark in a chaotic journey together. The duo experiences a seemingly never-ending streak of bad luck as they try to make their way to Changsha. After the airplane takes off, the Changsha airport experiences a heavy snowstorm so their flight is cancelled and they are forced to turn back. Li then manages to acquire a train ticket, but once on board, he realizes the ticket he purchased was a counterfeit, which just happens to be the same seat that Niu bought. As some train tracks collapsed due to a landslide, the two leave the train and attempt to take the bus. When they are about to get on the bus to Changsha, Niu is touched by a female beggar (Zhang Xinyi) and wants to give her money. Li discourages Niu from doing so and calls him an idiot for believing in the lies of the beggar. Niu still ends up giving her money, but the beggar does not return. The closing of a bridge spanning over the Yangtze River causes them to stop at Wuhan where they spot the beggar. The two go on a fanatic chase to pin down the scam artist. The chase leads them into a peaceful complex and Li goes into the room full of children quietly drawing. The beggar is a teacher who took care of these children and needs money to pay for an operation for a blind child. The duo is touched and gives her all their money. Continuing on their farcical adventure, Niu convinces Li to buy a lottery ticket. To their surprise, they win the first prize, which is a car. They decide to drive the car to Changsha. Suffering from lack of sleep, Li decides to let Niu drive temporarily. However, Niu falls asleep and drives the car into a ditch. The two frantically jumps out of the car in anticipation of an explosion as they often see in movies, but nothing happens. They have a heartfelt conversation as they decide to spend the night in the middle of nowhere. The next day they are able to hitchhike on a tractor transporting chickens. Finally they reach Changsha covered in chicken feathers. Li is surprised to find out that his mistress is also in the city to give him a surprise. The trip is a voyage of self-discovery for Li as by the end, he has changed. He has gone from scoffing beggars to believing that honesty still exists in the world; from a cold-blooded boss to a real human being. Finally realizing what is important to him, he breaks up with his mistress and returns to his family. Knowing that Niu will never get his defaulted wage from anyone else, Li secretly provides money to an associate so that Niu is happily paid. Although Niu was not his real creditor, what he owed Niu are the lessons he learned throughout the journey and the epiphanies regarding the importance of honesty and trust. One year later, Li is boarding a plane and questioning a stewardess why it was not taking off despite being forty minutes overdue, receiving the answer that one last passenger was late. The final passenger arrives just after that and calls out excitedly to Li upon seeing him, revealing himself to be Niu in a suit, who had quit his job after receiving his ‚Äúwage‚Äù and became his own successful boss.

Another review stated the plot was deeper than the superficial farce of traveling woes in rallying human spirit to overcome an indifferent world.

In addition, the company was facing issues after MTV was banned from producing any more Super Bowl halftime shows after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004. Copyright complaints against YouTube In February 2007, Viacom sent upwards of 100,000 DMCA takedown notices to the video-sharing site YouTube. Of the 100,000 notices, approximately 60‚Äì70 non-infringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement.Media Companies Blast YouTube for Anti- Piracy Policy.

YouTube, Inc.) against Google and YouTube alleging massive copyright infringement, alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to YouTube‚Äîenough to cause a hit in revenue for Viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for YouTube. The complaint contended that almost 160,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom's programming were made available on YouTube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than 1.5 billion times. In July 2008, the case generated controversy when District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site. Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request for YouTube to hand over the source code of its search engine system, saying that the code was a trade secret. Google and Viacom later agreed to allow Google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to Viacom. On June 23, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in Google's favor in a motion for summary judgment, holding that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling. BET Networks =BET= Public Enemy rapper Chuck D, journalist George Curry, writer Keith Boykin, comic book creator Christopher Priest, filmmaker Spike Lee, Syracuse University professor of finance Dr. Boyce Watkins and cartoonist Aaron McGruder (who, in addition to numerous critical references throughout his series, The Boondocks, made a particular episode criticizing the channel), all have protested BET's programming and actions. As a result, BET heavily censors suggestive content from the videos that it airs, often with entire verses and scenes removed from certain rap videos. Furthermore, scholars within the black community maintain that BET perpetuates and justifies racism by affecting the interpersonal beliefs others may generalize out black people, and also by affecting the psyche of its young viewers through its bombardment of negative images of black people. The New York Times reported that the Reverend Delman L. Coates and his organization Enough is Enough led protests every weekend outside the residences of BET executives against what they claim are negative stereotypes of black people perpetuated by BET music videos. Enough is Enough backed an April 2008 report titled The Rap on Rap by the Parents Television Council that claimed that BET rap programming, which they believed contained gratuitous sexual, violent, and profane content, was targeting children and teens. BET announced in March 2010 that Gordon would return to the network to host \\"a variety of news programs and specials.\\" In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder Sheila Johnson said she herself is \\"ashamed\\" of what the network has become. \\"I don't watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it,\\" she said. \\"When we started BET, it was going to be the Ebony magazine on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called Teen Summit, we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos.\\" MTV Networks MTV Networks channels have been cited as suffering from channel drift. Music Television (as MTV was originally known) was originally a channel devoted to popular music videos upon its launch in 1981, but began adding entertainment and reality programs geared toward a young adult audience in the 1990s, beginning a progression toward its current focus of reality and scripted programming targeted primarily at teenagers and young adults. (The music videos transitioned to MTV2, then to MTV Hits, the current-day NickMusic.) Video Hits One likewise began as an outlet for adult contemporary music before transitioning to an urban pop culture channel as VH1; Country Music Television drifted to southern culture and general rerun programming as CMT; and The Nashville Network, perhaps the most dramatic, drifted to a male-heavy program lineup now known as Spike. =Entertainment Group= Comedy Central Comedy Central has been a frequent target of criticism from the conservative group Parents Television Council, which accuses them of bigotry and blasphemy, especially within the programs South Park, The Sarah Silverman Program, Halfway Home, and the annual \\"Roast\\" special. PTC has used their criticisms against Comedy Central for their support of the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which would allow American cable TV subscribers to choose which channels they subscribe to, and to persuade advertisers to stop advertising on the channel. PTC founder and former president L. Brent Bozell III has called the channel unfunny, claiming the channel has managed \\"to reach the top of its field in spite of ‚Äì or, better put, because of ‚Äì the network's sheer lack of comedic talent\\" by its \\"extensive reliance on shocking or disgusting humor\\". The channel has also received criticism from certain parentsParents Television Council ‚Äì Letters to the Editor ‚Äì Offensive Ads for airing advertisements for \\"Girls Gone Wild\\". The channel also airs the least cut version of the popular film Not Another Teen Movie, as well as uncut versions of films such as Coming to America, Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. On November 5, 2007, an open letter was written by VideoSift to protest publicly the blocking of Comedy Central's embedded video content for non U.S. based viewers. On April 21, 2010, Comedy Central censored the South Park episode, \\"201\\", in response to a death threat issued by users of a radical Muslim website over the episode's planned depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which led several newspaper columnists to condemn the network's actions as tantamount to abetting terrorism. Since then, as a result, neither \\"201\\" nor the episode that preceded it have been aired. Spike/Paramount Network The name change to \\"Spike TV\\" was supposed to be official on June 16, 2003. However, on June 13, film director Spike Lee won a New York Supreme Court injunction preventing the name change. Lee claimed that because of his well-known popularity in Hollywood, viewers would therefore assume that he was associated with the new channel. Lee stated in court papers that: \\"The media description of this change of name, as well as comments made to me and my wife, confirmed what was obvious‚Äîthat Spike TV referred to Spike Lee.\\" The channel had planned an official launch of its new name at a star-studded, televised party at the Playboy Mansion in mid-June. But due to Lee's injunction, the special‚Äîtitled Party With Spike‚Äîhad to be heavily edited and the impact of the event was considerably muted. During the lawsuit, even the name \\"TNN\\" was significantly scaled back, as logos and voice-overs referred to the channel only as \\"The First Network for Men\\". Spike Jones Jr., son of comic musician Spike Jones, became a party of the lawsuit as part of Viacom's defense to protect the rights to his father's name. The suit was settled on July 8, 2003, and TNN was allowed to call itself Spike TV. In announcing the settlement, Lee admitted that he did not believe that the channel intentionally tried to trade on his name. The name change became official on August 11, 2003. In September 2005, all WWE programs departed Viacom networks after a new program agreement was made with USA Network. WWE Raw moved back to USA, while WWE Sunday Night HEAT and WWE Velocity moved to WWE.com due to neglect by MTV and Spike to promote or schedule the shows on acceptable terms to WWE. On October 1, 2005, wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling began airing its weekly program TNA Impact! in the Saturday night time slot formerly occupied by WWE Velocity. In WWE's last Raw broadcast on the channel, Viacom chose to censor and prevent mention of the USA move in Spike's last airing of Raw by anyone on the show, an effort which eventually proved futile when a \\"next week on USA\\" mention was not removed in time. On October 15, 2005 Viacom acquired iFilm.com, which was initially launched in 1997. After acquiring the website for $49 million, it was eventually re-branded to Spike.com and provided hosting of user-uploaded videos; this failed to gain any traction and it eventually became a general network information and video portal. YouTube was also launched in 2005, which later suffered a class action lawsuit reported to be over $1 billion.

April 27, 2010 =Music & Logo Group= MTV The channel has been a target of criticism by various groups about programming choices, social issues, political correctness, sensitivity, censorship, and a perceived negative social influence on young people. Portions of the content of MTV's programs and productions have come under controversy in the general news media and among social groups that have taken offense. During MTV's first few years on the air, very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel. Those who were in MTV's rotation included Eddy Grant, Tina Turner, Donna Summer, Musical Youth, Herbie Hancock, Grace Jones, and Prince. The very first non-white act played on MTV in the U.S. was UK band The Specials, which featured an integrated line-up of white and black musicians and vocalists. The Specials' video \\"Rat Race\\" was played as the 58th video on the station's first day of broadcasting.Hoye, Jacob. MTV Uncensored. Pocket Books, 2001. . MTV rejected other black artists' videos, such as Rick James' \\"Super Freak\\", because they didn't fit the channel's carefully selected AOR format at the time. The exclusion enraged James; he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists' videos on the channel. Rock legend David Bowie also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983. MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as had a few others outside the network. \\"The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the \\"research\\",\\" said Baker years later. \\"But the research was based on ignorance... we were young, we were cutting edge. We didn't have to be on the cutting edge of racism.\\" Nevertheless, it was Baker who had personally rejected Rick James' video for Super Freak \\"because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece of c--p. As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV.\\"Marks, Craig & Tannebaum, Rob, I Want My MTV, Penguin Books, 2011, pg. 167‚Äì168 The network's director of music programming Buzz Brindle told an interviewer in 2006, \\"MTV was originally designed to be a rock music channel. It was difficult for MTV to find African American artists whose music fit the channel's format that leaned toward rock at the outset.\\" Writers Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum noted that the channel \\"aired videos by plenty of white artists who didn't play rock.\\" Andrew Goodwin later wrote, \\"[MTV] denied racism, on the grounds that it merely followed the rules of the rock business (which were, nonetheless, the consequence of a long history of racism).\\"Marks, Craig & Tannebaum, Rob, I Want My MTV, Penguin Books, 2011, pg. 166 MTV senior executive vice president Les Garland complained decades later, \\"The worst thing was that \\"racism\\" b------t... there were hardly any videos being made by black artists. Record companies weren't funding them. They never got charged with racism.\\" Before 1983, Michael Jackson also struggled to receive airtime on MTV. To resolve the struggle and finally \\"break the color barrier,\\" the president of CBS Records at the time, Walter Yetnikoff, denounced MTV in a strong, profane statement, threatening to take away MTV's ability to play any of the record label's music videos.The quote from Walter Yetnikoff reads, \\"I'm pulling everything we have off the air... I'm not going to give you any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.\\" However, Les Garland, then acquisitions head, said he decided to air Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" video without pressure from CBS. This was contradicted by CBS head of Business Affairs David Benjamin in Vanity Fair. According to The Austin Chronicle, Jackson's video for the song \\"Billie Jean\\" was \\"the video that broke the color barrier, even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place.\\" But change was not immediate. \\"Billie Jean\\" was not added to MTV's \\"medium rotation\\" playlist (two to three airings per day) until after it had already reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. A month later, it was bumped up into \\"heavy rotation,\\" one week before the MTV debut of Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" video. Both videos were played several times a day for the next two months; by early summer, the channel had ceased playing both songs. But the impact was permanent. When Jackson's elaborate video for \\"Thriller\\" was released late in the year, which raised the ambition bar for what a video could be, the network's support for it was total; subsequently more pop and R & B videos were played on MTV. Eventually, videos from the emerging genre of rap and hip hop would also begin to enter rotation on MTV. A majority of the rap artists appearing on MTV in the mid-1980s, such as Run- DMC, The Fat Boys, Whodini, L.L. Cool J and the Beastie Boys, were from the East Coast. Video director Don Letts has a different view of the timeline, saying, \\"People often say \\"Billie Jean\\" was the first black music video on MTV. \\"Pass the Dutchie\\" was first. Because they were little and spoke in funny British accents, Musical Youth were deemed as non-threatening, and therefore non-black.\\" In 1983, Rolling Stones Steven Levy wrote, \\"MTV's greatest achievement has been to coax rock & roll into the video arena where you can't distinguish between entertainment and the sales pitch.\\" The Dead Kennedys released a song in 1985 titled \\"MTV, Get Off The Air\\". MTV has edited a number of music videos to remove references to drugs, In this case, a reference to crack cocaine was removed from the video for \\"My Band\\" by D12. sex, violence, weapons, racism, homophobia, or advertising. Many music videos aired on the channel were censored, moved to late-night rotation, or banned entirely from the channel. In the 1980s, parent-media watchdog groups such as the Parents Music Resource Center criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism. MTV developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict devil worship or anti-religious themes. Oocities.com, MTV This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" by Soundgarden in 1991Prato, Greg. [ \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" review]. Allmusic and \\"Megalomaniac\\" by Incubus in 2004. Although MTV reached its 30th year of broadcasting in 2011, the channel itself passed over this milestone in favor of its current programming schedule. The channel instead aired its 30th anniversary celebrations on its sister networks MTV2 and VH1 Classic. Nathaniel Brown, senior vice president of communications for MTV, confirmed that there were no plans for an on-air MTV celebration similar to the channel's 20th anniversary. Brown explained, \\"MTV as a brand doesn't age with our viewers. We are really focused on our current viewers, and our feeling was that our anniversary wasn't something that would be meaningful to them, many of whom weren't even alive in 1981.\\"MTV Apparently Wants To Be 29 Forever ‚Äì Yahoo! Music (released August 1, 2011) Despite targeted efforts to play certain types of music videos in limited rotation, MTV greatly reduced its overall rotation of music videos by the mid-2000s. While music videos were featured on MTV up to eight hours per day in 2000, the year 2008 saw an average of just three hours of music videos per day on MTV. The rise of the Internet as a convenient outlet for the promotion and viewing of music videos signaled this reduction. As the decade progressed, MTV continued to play some music videos instead of relegating them exclusively to its sister channels, but around this time, the channel began to air music videos only in the early morning hours or in a condensed form on Total Request Live. As a result of these programming changes, Justin Timberlake challenged MTV to \\"play more damn videos!\\" while giving an acceptance speech at the 2007 Video Music Awards. Despite the challenge from Timberlake, MTV continued to decrease its total rotation time for music videos in 2007, and the channel eliminated its long- running special tags for music videos such as \\"Buzzworthy\\" (for under- represented artists), \\"Breakthrough\\" (for visually stunning videos), and \\"Spankin' New\\" (for brand new videos). Additionally, the historic Kabel typeface, which MTV displayed at the beginning and end of all music videos since 1981, was phased out in favor of larger text and less information about the video's record label and director. The classic font can still be seen in \\"prechyroned\\" versions of old videos on sister network VH1 Classic, which had their title information recorded onto the same tape as the video itself. Prior to its finale in 2008, MTV's main source of music videos was Total Request Live, airing four times per week, featuring short clips of music videos along with VJs and guests. MTV was experimenting at the time with new ideas for music programs to replace the purpose of TRL but with a new format. In the summer of 2008, MTV premiered new music video programming blocks called FNMTV and a weekly special event called FNMTV Premieres, hosted from Los Angeles by Pete Wentz of the band Fall Out Boy, which was designed to premiere new music videos and have viewers provide instantaneous feedback. The FNMTV Premieres event ended before the 2008 Video Music Awards in September. With the exception of a holiday themed episode in December 2008 and an unrelated Spring Break special in March 2009 with the same title, FNMTV Premieres never returned to the channel's regular program schedule, leaving MTV without any music video programs hosted by VJs for the first time in its history. Shortly after Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, the channel aired several hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities. The temporary shift in MTV's programming culminated the following week with the channel's live coverage of Jackson's memorial service. MTV aired similar one-hour live specials with music videos and news updates following the death of Whitney Houston on February 11, 2012, and the death of Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys on May 4, 2012. In 2007, MTV aired the reality show A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, chronicling MySpace sensation Tila Tequila's journey to find a companion. Her bisexuality played into the series ‚Äì both male and female contestants were vying for love ‚Äì and was the subject of criticism. It was \\"...the #2 show...\\" airing on MTV at that time, behind The Hills. A spin-off series from A Shot at Love, titled That's Amor√©!, followed a similar pursuit from previous A Shot at Love contestant Domenico Nesci. In late 2009, MTV shifted its focus back to Real World-style reality programming with the premiere of Jersey Shore, a program that brought high ratings to the channel and also caused controversy due to some of its content. With backlash towards what some consider too much superficial content on the network, a recent New York Times article also stated the intention of MTV to shift its focus towards more socially conscious media, which the article labels \\"MTV for the Obama era.\\" Shows in that vein included T.I.'s Road to Redemption and Fonzworth Bentley's finishing school show From G's to Gents. The channel also began showing presidential campaign commercials for the first time during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. This has led to criticism from the right, with Jonah Goldberg opining that \\"MTV serves as the Democrats' main youth outreach program.\\" VH1 VH1 endured criticism for the short-lived Music Behind Bars, which mainly focuses on musicians in custody. Critics have claimed prisoners, mainly those convicted of murder, should not be entitled to any exposure, especially nationally.

Solar photovoltaic systems transform solar energy into electric power. The power output depends on the incoming radiation and on the solar panel characteristics. Photovoltaic power production is increasing nowadays. Forecast information is essential for an efficient use, the management of the electricity grid and for solar energy trading. Common solar forecasting method include stochastic learning methods, local and remote sensing methods, and hybrid methods (Chu et al. 2016). Generation forecasting The energy generation forecasting problem is closely linked to the problem of weather variables forecasting. Indeed, this problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV or any other meteorological variable and on the other hand estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource. In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in, which yields to different approaches that can be found in the literature. In this sense, it is useful to classify these techniques depending on the forecasting horizon, so it is possible to distinguish between now-casting (forecasting 3‚Äì4 hours ahead), short-term forecasting (up to 7 days ahead) and long-term forecasting (months, years...) Solar radiation closely follows the physical and biological development of the earth. Its spatial and sequential heterogeneity powerfully influence the forcing of environmental and hydrological organisms by manipulating air temperature, soil moisture and vapor transpiration, snow cover and lots of photochemical procedures. Therefore, solar radiation drives place efficiency and plant life allotment, organism a key feature in undeveloped and forestry sciences that be obliged to be known precisely. The quantity of solar radiation obtainable at the earth‚Äô surface is at the outset controlled at worldwide balance, organism above all precious by the Sun Earth geometry and the atmosphere. On the other hand, a complete explanation of its freedom time unpredictability require deliberation of limited procedure which frequently turn out to be also applicable, as is the casing in mountainous region. Predominantly, limited territory adjust the inward bound solar radiation by shadow casts, slope of elevation, surface gradient and compass reading, as a result, precise spatial model of inward bound solar radiation be supposed to regard as the pressure of the terrain surface. In the final time, more than a few events to consist of the confined terrain special effects in the solar radiation countryside have been projected, such as the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), artificial intelligence or post dispensation of satellite stand technique. Solar radiation can be also evaluated using numerical weather forecast (NWP) models. Nevertheless, the space and time balance determined with them and the incomplete computational ability frequently avoid the deliberation of terrain connected property. Otherwise, exclamation technique agree to us to acquire spatially persistent database from data evidence at inaccessible station greater than wide region. Even though their dependability is powerfully needy on the opening coldness between position, they eventually rely on experiential statistics, which have a superior precision than extra method. Therefore, while an adequate footage spatial thickness is accessible, disturbance method are preferred. Conventionally, solar radiation has not been as densely example as additional variables as temperature or rainfall, therefore the ease of use of capacity is frequently in short supply. Though, the number of experimental system which record solar radiation has developed and interruption has been converted into an appropriate technique for solar radiation evaluation. Nevertheless, radiometric stations are frequently come together approximately farmland or occupied region, typically during basin and plane area, while mountains at rest require enough footage thickness. This truth is particularly applicable afford the tall spatial unpredictability of solar radiation in these province. As an outcome, particular interruption method that tolerate include outdoor foundation should be used to make clear this extra spatial unpredictability. Several diverse spatial interruption techniques can be established. On the other hand, data ease of use in mountainous region is often extremely restricted. As a result, it is hard to construct a precise solar radiation climatology in hilly area to be used in environmental science, climate change. Solar radiation is a hardly illustration changeable with reverence to supplementary ecological variables such as temperature or precipitation, in fraction payable to the high maintenance price of the necessary radiometric sensors. It is extremely sensitive to ecological feature on or after local to limited balance. Predominantly, terrain surface confronts the conventional interruption method while forecast through far above the ground spatial decision are required, particularly due to the lack of measurement stations in mountainous areas. Geo-statistics front a stochastic move toward to resolve the spatial forecast difficulty that stop dependence on before imagine deterministic models and permit us to consist of the consequence of outside in sequence foundation stand on investigation data-sets. Nowcasting The term \\"Nowcasting\\" in the context of solar power forecasting, generally refers to same spatial and temporal scales as meteorological Nowcasting, which focuses on forecast horizons from a few minutes ahead, out to 4‚Äì6 hours ahead. In general, the 'Nowcasting' forecast horizon refers to those not well-served by global numerical weather prediction models, which produce outputs at up to hourly resolutions and only update every 6 hours. Solar power nowcasting then refers to the prediction of solar power output (or energy generation) over time horizons of tens to hundreds of minutes ahead of time with up to 90% predictability. It has historically been very important for electrical grid operators in order to guarantee the matching of supply and demand on energy markets. Such solar power nowcasting services are usually related to temporal resolutions of 5 to 15 minutes, with updates as frequent as every 5 minutes. The regular updates and relatively high resolutions required from these methods require automatic weather data acquisition and processing techniques, which are chiefly accomplished by two primary means: #Statistical techniques. These are usually based on time series processing of measurement data, including meteorological observations and power output measurements from a solar power facility. What then follows is the creation of a training dataset to tune the parameters of a model (I. Espino eta al, 2011), before evaluation of model performance against a separate testing dataset. This class of techniques includes the use of any kind of statistical approach, such as autoregressive moving averages (ARMA, ARIMA, etc.), as well as machine learning techniques such as neural networks, support vector machines (etc.). These approaches are usually benchmarked to a persistence approach in order to evaluate their improvements. This persistence approach just assumes that any variable at time step t is the value it took in a previous time. #An example of satellite-based cloud cover nowcasting, which is used to generate predication of solar power outputs. Credit: SolcastSatellite based methods. These methods leverage the several geostationary Earth observing weather satellites (such as Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) fleet) to detect, characterise, track and predict the future locations of cloud cover. These satellites make it possible to generate solar power forecasts over broad regions through the application of image processing and forecasting algorithms. Key forecasting algorithms include cloud motion vectors (CMVs). Relevant methods for applying physical models based on satellite image processing techniques provide an estimation of future atmospheric values can be found in Alvarez et al., 2010. #An example of sky-imager used for detecting, tracking and predicting cloud cover conditions in the vicinity of a solar energy facility of interest. Most often, these devices are used to make estimates of solar irradiance from the images using local calibration by a pyranometer. The solar irradiance short-term forecasts are then fed into PV power modelling routines to generate a solar power forecast. Credit: UC San DiegoGround based techniques. These techniques are generally used to derive irradiance forecasts with much higher spatial and temporal resolution compared with the satellite-based forecasts. Local cloud information is acquired by one or several ground-based sky imagers at a high frequency (1 minute or less). The combination of these images and local weather measurement information are processed to simulate cloud motion vectors and optical depth to obtain forecasts up to 30 minutes ahead. Short-term solar power forecasting Short-term forecasting provides predictions up to 7 days ahead. This kind of forecast is also valuable for grid operators in order to make decisions of grid operation, as well as, for electric market operators. Under this perspective, the meteorological resources are estimated at a different temporal and spatial resolution. This implies that meteorological variables and phenomena are looked from a more general perspective, not as local as nowcasting services do. In this sense, most of the approaches make use of different numerical weather prediction models (NWP) that provide an initial estimation of weather variables. Currently, several models are available for this purpose, such as Global Forecast System (GFS) or data provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). These two models are considered the state of the art of global forecast models, which provide meteorological forecasts all over the world. In order to increase spatial and temporal resolution of these models, other models have been developed which are generally called mesoscale models. Among others, HIRLAM, WRF or MM5 are the most representative of these models since they are widely used by different communities. To run these models a wide expertise is needed in order to obtain accurate results, due to the wide variety of parameters that can be configured in the models. In addition, sophisticated techniques such as data assimilation might be used in order to produce more realistic simulations. Finally, some communities argue for the use of post-processing techniques, once the models‚Äô output is obtained, in order to obtain a probabilistic point of view of the accuracy of the output. This is usually done with ensemble techniques that mix different outputs of different models perturbed in strategic meteorological values and finally provide a better estimate of those variables and a degree of uncertainty, like in the model proposed by Bacher et al. (2009) Long-term solar power forecasting Long-term forecasting usually refers to forecasting of the annual or monthly available resource. This is useful for energy producers and to negotiate contracts with financial entities or utilities that distribute the generated energy. In general, these long-term forecasting is usually done at a lower scale than any of the two previous approaches. Hence, most of these models are run with mesoscale models fed with reanalysis data as input and whose output is postprocessed with statistical approaches based on measured data. Energetic models Any output from any model described above must then be converted to the electric energy that a particular solar PV plant will produce. This step is usually done with statistical approaches that try to correlate the amount of available resource with the metered power output. The main advantage of these methods is that the meteorological prediction error, which is the main component of the global error, might be reduced taking into account the uncertainty of the prediction. As it was mentioned before and detailed in Heinemann et al., these statistical approaches comprises from ARMA models, neural networks, support vector machines, etc. On the other hand, there also exist theoretical models that describe how a power plant converts the meteorological resource into electric energy, as described in Alonso et al. The main advantage of this type of models is that when they are fitted, they are really accurate, although they are too sensitive to the meteorological prediction error, which is usually amplified by these models. Hybrid models, finally, are a combination of these two models and they seem to be a promising approach that can outperform each of them individually. See also * Energy forecasting References * Y.
