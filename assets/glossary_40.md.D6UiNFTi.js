Other UK Government departments have programmes utilising bulk personal datasets, one of which is the care.data programme in the Department of Health and National Health Service. In health, bulk personal datasets are created as a by-product of providing direct care.  Controversy  The judicial body which oversees the intelligence services in the United Kingdom, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance. A special report published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament also came to this view, although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency. This view is supported by independent reports from the Interception of Communications Commissioner. However, notable campaign groups and broadsheet newspapers continue to express strong views to the contrary, while others have criticised these viewpoints in turn.

Retrieved 6 September 2015 On his return to civilian life in 1946, he toured with Whitey Ford and others before joining Red Foley's orchestra at the Opry. He also began work as a session musician, sometimes as part of a group that also included Jerry Byrd, Louis Innis, and Zeke Turner, and became known as the first Nashville studio A-team. Jackson played on many of Hank Williams' classic recordings of the late 1940s, including \\"Lovesick Blues\\". In 1948, he and his fellow studio musicians began performing regularly as the Pleasant Valley Boys, on the Midwestern Hayride and other shows produced by radio station WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, and also recorded as session musicians at King Records. He returned to Nashville in the early 1950s, and recorded with Hank Williams, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, and many others. Between the late 1940s and 1960s he also recorded many hoedown albums under his own name, for the Mercury, Decca, and Dot labels, many of his recordings now being regarded as the definitive versions. He developed his own recognizable styles of playing, such as the single-string playing that he introduced on Ray Price's 1956 hit \\"Crazy Arms\\". He played on almost all of Price's recordings through to the mid-1960s, as well as those by George Jones and Bill Monroe, and became Nashville's most in-demand studio fiddle player over the period.

Bolt is headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia and operates in over 150 cities in 35 countries in Europe, Africa, Western Asia and North America. The company has 30 million customers globally and more than 1 million drivers use Bolt platform to offer rides. History Bolt (then called Taxify) was founded by Markus Villig (then only 19 years old, a high-school student) in 2013, with a vision to aggregate all Tallinn and Riga taxis into one platform. With ‚Ç¨5,000 from his parents, who also helped him by doing customer support outside of their regular working hours, he hired a developer to help him launch the business, then called mTakso. The service was launched in August 2013 and in 2014 it went on to foreign shores. Lime, left, and Markus Villig, Co-founder & CEO, Taxify, Web Summit 2018 at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal. In 2017, Taxify launched its services in London by acquiring a local taxi company with a licence to operate, but was forced by Transport for London to shut down its services. The company has filed a new licence application with plans to reopen services in London. Taxify logo (former) Following the setback in London, Taxify launched its services in Paris and Lisbon. In September 2018, the company announced expanding into dockless electric scooters and launched them in Paris under the new Bolt brand. The company also said it planned to release scooters in several other European and Australian cities where the app was already established, but would also launch in new markets where vehicle for hire services face significant regulatory roadblocks, including Germany and Spain. In June 2019, Bolt re-launched in London with 20,000 drivers registered on the platform. In August 2019, the company rolled out its food delivery service, Bolt Food. Bolt Food launched in Tallinn, with the plans to expand to more cities in Europe and Africa later this year. In September 2019, Bolt announced its \\"Green Plan\\", an initiative to reduce the ecological footprint of the transportation industry and Bolt as a company. The Green Plan goals include offsetting Bolt's contribution to the CO‚ÇÇ emissions of the European transportation sector by at least 5 million tonnes by 2025 and adding more green ride-types for passengers to choose from. In March 2020, Bolt was ranked third in the FT 1000: Europe's Fastest Growing Companies 2020 published by the Financial Times. =Financing= Prior to announcing a strategic partnership with Didi Chuxing, Taxify had raised over ‚Ç¨2 million in investment capital from Estonian and Finnish angel investors. In August 2017, Didi Chuxing invested an undisclosed amount believed to be an \\"eight-figure U.S. dollar sum\\". A May 2018 funding round with a $175 million investment from Daimler, Didi and others led to a 1 billion dollar valuation for the company, making it a unicorn. In January 2020, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a EUR 50 million venture debt facility with Bolt.

It was built in 1907, and is a 2 1/2-story, \\"T\\"-plan, brick building with Collegiate Gothic and Jacobethan Revival style design elements. It sits on a raised limestone faced basement. The building consists of a central portion flanked by projecting wings bisected by a central bell tower with pyramidal roof. It features a steeply pitched gable roof, parapeted gables, terra cotta trim, and pointed arch openings. The building housed Moores Hill College until 1917, when it moved to Evansville to later become the University of Evansville. It was funded in part by Andrew Carnegie, who donated $18,750 to its construction. It later housed the local high school and elementary school until 1987. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The original college was named Moores Hill Male and Female Collegiate Institute when it was established in 1854, and was founded by the Methodist Church. The college's governing board entered enthusiastically upon construction of the original building known as Moore Hall (in the grassy lot to the north of the later site of Carnegie Hall), then ran short of funds as so many similar early endeavors did. At the same time the town's Masonic lodge, Allen Lodge No. 165 was just being established. Its members accepted an offer by the college trustees to provide quarters for any fraternal organization that would contribute to the building fund. The building was completed in part through the financial assistance of the Masons. A room on the third floor was set aside for the Lodge's use. The Brethren met in their new hall for the first time in January 1856 and continuously thereafter for the next 59 years. The original Moore Hall was destroyed by fire in 1915. A Masonic historical marker was placed on the site in 1974. Carnegie Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

Lessig had promised to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by Labor Day, which it accomplished one day early. He described his candidacy as a referendum on campaign finance reform and electoral reform legislation. Lessig dropped out of the Democratic primary on November 2, 2015, shortly after the rules for participation in the next debate were changed such that he would no longer qualify. He then considered other strategies to advance his reform agenda, including the possibility of an independent run. His campaign platform was unique for its clear priority on passing one thing first: the Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that coupled campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access. Background =Anti-corruption activism= Until his leave of absence to launch his campaign, Lessig was the director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. His full-time work on corruption began in 2007, when Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on political corruption instead. In February 2008, a Facebook group formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged him to run for Congress from California's 12th congressional district, the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative Tom Lantos. Later that month, after forming an \\"exploratory project\\", he decided not to run for the vacant seat. Lessig speaking before Change Congress and the Sunlight Foundation Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption. To this end, he worked with political consultant Joe Trippi to launch a web based project called \\"Change Congress\\". In 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national constitutional convention, co-founding Fix Congress First!, again with Joe Trippi. He called for a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution\\"The Movement to Organize the Call for a Convention\\" CallAConvention.org both in a September 24‚Äì25, 2011, conference co-chaired by the Tea Party Patriots' national coordinator,Conference on the Constitutional Convention, Harvard University, September 24‚Äì5, 2011 and at an October 2011 Occupy protest in Washington, DC.Tackett, C.

The New Hampshire Rebellion, likewise co-founded by Lessig, is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics.Lawrence Lessig, \\"Why We're Marching Across New Hampshire to Honor Aaron Swartz\\", The Atlantic, January 10, 2014. The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire.Jennifer Harper, \\"Restless grassroots: New Hampshire ‚ÄòRebellion‚Äô declares their state is not for sale\\" (Inside the Beltway column), Washington Times, December 25, 2014. From Jan 11 until January 24, 2014, Larry Lessig and many others, like New York activist Jeff Kurzon, marched from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire to Nashua NH (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling \\"The Systemic Corruption in Washington.\\" Lessig chose this language over the related term \\"campaign finance reform,\\" commenting that \\"Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem.\\" The walk was to continue the work of NH Native Doris \\"Granny D\\" Haddock, and in honor of deceased activist Aaron Swartz. In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.John Koziol, \\"NH Rebellion Marching Its Way to Concord for Reform\\", New Hampshire Union Leader, January 17, 2015. In May 2014, Lessig launched a crowd-funded political action committee which he termed Mayday PAC with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform.Naureen Khan, May 2, 2014, Al Jazeera, May Day PAC wants to end all Super PACs, Accessed May 7, 2014, \\"kick-start May Day PAC, which, if successful, will help elect enough like- minded lawmakers to Congress in 2014 and 2016 to pass campaign finance reform. ...

Here's one path: Imagine a candidate‚Äîa > credible nonpolitician ... The candidate makes a single two-part pledge: if > elected, she will (1) hold the government hostage until Congress enacts a > program to remove the fundamental corruption that is our government, and (2) > once that program is enacted, she will resign. In a June 5, 2015 article titled, \\"Frodo Baggins for President,\\" Lessig elaborated on this idea, suggesting Colin Powell, Bill Bradley, David Walker, Bill Gates, Christine Todd Whitman, Jerry Brown, Joe Scarborough, and Robert Reich as candidates who could run this way, implementing his idea of \\"the presidency as referendum.\\" Just days later, however, activist journalist Cenk Uygur argued in the Huffington Post that Lessig should implement his own strategy as a \\"Citizen President.\\" =Exploratory committee= On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in 2016. Lessig vowed that if his committee could raise one million dollars by Labor Day 2015, and if the leading Democratic candidates for president had not yet committed to fundamental elections reform as their first priority, he would run for president. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.Toussaint, Kristin (August 11, 2015) \\"Harvard law professor wants to be president‚Äîfor one day\\", Boston.com. Retrieved August 11, 2015 Lessig has stated that if elected President he would resign in favor of his vice president when he accomplishes his three stated objectives, which involve addressing campaign finance reform, voting rights issues and political gerrymandering. Prior to his dropping out of the race, he had yet to announce his vice presidential running mate, which he said would have been decided at the Democratic National Convention. Campaign =Launch= Lawrence Lessig launching his presidential campaign Sept. 9, 2015 in Claremont, NH. Lessig reached his intended crowdfunding goal of $1 million on September 6, 2015. On his website later that day, Lessig announced his intention to enter the presidential race. The headquarters of the campaign is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He officially launched his campaign on September 9, 2015, in Claremont, New Hampshire. Just over a week later, he spoke at the New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention. As of September 2015, intended New Hampshire Democratic primary voters gave Lessig one percent of the vote. =Debates= Lessig was excluded from the first Democratic debate on CNN, after having criticized the requirement that Democratic candidates must earn at least 1% in three major national polls in the six weeks before the debate. Lessig's criticism was centered on the fact that he was excluded from most polls because the Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not officially welcome him to the campaign as it had done for all five other candidates. In the two weeks following his announcement, Lessig was only included in one national poll, in which he met the 1% requirement; other national polls had included Vice President Biden, who, at the time, had yet to announce whether he was running. The day before the CNN debate, the Bloomberg Editorial Board published an editorial entitled, \\"Let All the Candidates Debate, Democrats,\\" calling for the DNC to include Lessig in the debate. =\\"All in\\"= On October 16, 2015, due to poor polling on the resignation part of his plan as well as the DNC's non-recognition of his candidacy, Lessig announced on Real Time with Bill Maher that he was dropping the promise to resign after passing the Citizen Equality Act. He elaborated on his decision in an online article for The Atlantic released the following day. Lessig explained that he would now outline his positions on every issue, just like any other campaign, planning to serve a full term as President after fixing democracy first. =Out= Lessig suspended his presidential campaign on Nov. 2, 2015, in a video statement.\\"Larry Lessig Drops Out Of Democratic Primary Race\\", Huffington Post, Nov. 2, 2015. He cited his inability to get one percent support in the polls and being unrepresented in the debates, saying, \\"I am not well-known to the American public generally.\\" In an essay in the New York Times he further discussed the DNC's change of the one percent rule from \\"within six weeks\\" to \\"earlier than six weeks\\" to a \\"five-week period (that) just happened to be crafted to exclude the third poll finding me at one percent\\".\\"Why I Dropped Out\\", The New Yorker, Jan. 28, 2016. Political positions =Equal citizenship ‚Äì the first reform= Lessig's campaign stated that progress was effectively impossible with the state of political inequality, because members of Congress are reliant on a small number of major donors they need to win elections. Lessig called his Citizen Equality Act \\"The First Reform,\\" which he said makes the other urgently needed reforms possible. It would: * Restore and strengthen voting rights (including automatic registration and making election day a holiday); * End gerrymandering, replacing current single-member districts with independently determined, multi-member districts in which ranked choice voting is used to achieve better representation of all citizens' views; * Establish \\"citizen-funded elections,\\" in which each citizen is given a voucher to distribute public funding in a decentralized way, with matching funds for small donations out of pocket as well; and * Put strong limits on the revolving door between government work and lobbying. The details of the Act sought public input to improve it. =Environment= The urgent need to address climate change was one of the primary factors motivating Lessig to run for president. He supported a carbon tax on companies that are not able to clean the pollution that they have created. He also supported the other policies Democratic presidential candidates proposed, but he argued that a carbon tax would render most of them unnecessary. He also argued that enacting the Citizen Equality Act is essential to make addressing climate change possible because fossil fuel interests used their political influence to block it. =The Internet= Lessig and Aaron Swartz in 2002 at the launch party for Creative Commons Lessig is a strong supporter of Network neutrality, and an equally and broadly deployed Internet in general. He has a long history of supporting digital rights‚Äîfor example, he helped found Creative Commons which advocates for the expansion of free and creative materials available to all. Lessig has also served on the boards of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Free Software Foundation. His active interest in defending the Internet stems from his 1997 participation in a major lawsuit against Microsoft for trying to use its Windows monopoly to take over web standards. =Government surveillance= Lessig believes that the Fourth Amendment should prevent government agencies from suspicion-less searches and unwarranted invasion of privacy. He pledged to stop NSA surveillance of American citizens and respect the privacy of non-US persons. Lessig believed that Edward Snowden was a hero and exposed government crimes after finding every available legal channel closed. =Healthcare= Lessig supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Although he voiced strong support, he also believed that legislation should be passed that adds a public option to the insurance mandate and repeals the ban on the government negotiating for lower drug prices. Lessig proposed prize funding drug research and banning drug companies from negotiating with generic drug providers to delay entry into the market. =Criminal justice reform= Lessig has stated that the criminal justice system is an \\"embarrassment to our tradition and our values.\\" He criticized the Supreme Court for giving broad deference to police departments and argued in favor of criminal justice reform. Some of his proposals include: comprehensive reform of the mandatory minimum system, prosecution of white collar crimes that focus on people instead of corporations, banning practices that make guilty verdicts positive, ending felon disenfranchisement, and rooting out corruption in the government. =Foreign policy= Lessig stated that \\"I am not a utopian. I am not a pacifist. I believe in military intervention to defend our people and for the cause of justice and humanity.\\" He criticized the Iraq War for creating more critics than allies and helping recruit more terrorists. He also was a cautious but optimistic supporter of the nuclear deal with Iran. Lessig did not support the commitment of ground troops to Syria but instead suggested working with allies to create safe zones for refugees. He supported a similar policy in the fight against ISIS. Another important issue for Lessig was long-term relations with China. He stated that it was time for us to treat China as equals, working on problems such as climate change together. =Education= Believing that \\"we all gain from an educated people\\" Lessig supports subsidized education. Citing the current student debt at 1.2 trillion dollars he supports legislation that would reduce existing student debt and refinance loans to lower rates. Along with his support for free educational material on the Internet, Lessig would also push Congress to support open materials for scientific and educational pursuits. His Citizen's Equality Act proposes to weaken the influence of lobbyists on the education system. =Immigration reform= Lessig supported passage of the DREAM Act and the ending of inhumane detention centers, as well as comprehensive immigration reform including a \\"speedy\\" path to citizenship. =Innovation policy= Lessig supports copyright laws but believes that there must be fundamental changes. If elected, he pledged to convene an impartial Creative Rights Commission to create new copyright laws that allow more open access of information. He also has a similar proposal for an Invention Commission for changes to the current patent laws. His final proposal was to create an Innovation Council that reviews copyright and patent policies to make sure that they achieve their goals. Lessig has written several books on intellectual property, and in 2002 argued in front of the Supreme Court for copyright limitations. =War on Drugs= Lessig supports the legalization of marijuana and would explore decriminalizing other controlled substances. Lessig would also institute other policies to treat addiction as a disease, offering the compassion and support that people often need to free themselves from it. His website refers to the War on Drugs as \\"The So-Called 'War on Drugs'\\" and the most destructive war since the Civil War. He compared it to alcohol prohibition and cites the costs in American lives, damage to civil rights in the U.S., and loss of democracy and security in some South and Central American countries.

Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), is a landmark employment law case of the United States Supreme Court holding that employers are liable if supervisors create a hostile work environment for employees.. Ellerth also introduced a two-part affirmative defense allowing employers to avoid sex discrimination liability if they follow best practices. Ellerth is often considered alongside Faragher.. Facts Kimberly Ellerth, a female employee at Burlington Industries, sued the company for sexual harassment on the part of her male supervisor. She alleged the vice president of sales made offensive remarks and unwanted overtures. She identified three episodes involving threats to deny tangible job benefits unless sexual favors were granted. She alleged a violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lower court dismissed her claim, noting that she had suffered no actual negative job consequences. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court decision, but issued 8 separate opinions. Burlington Industries Defense Ellerth is most referenced for its two-part affirmative defense for supervisor sexual harassment. In the case, a supervisor is defined by the ability to take a Tangible Employment Action. A Tangible Employment Action makes the company vicariously liable because the agency relationship was used to take the action. In alleged sex discrimination cases without a Tangible Employment Action, employers may prove that: # the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that # the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Generally, having an effective sexual harassment policy that is used and works is sufficient to satisfy the first prong. Further cases (see EEOC v. Racine) examine whether an employee's failure to take advantage of the policy was unreasonable, but Ellerth holds that when the policy requires reporting to a harasser, it is not unreasonable to fail to do so. (Ellerth would have been required to report to her harasser.) Judgment In a 7‚Äì2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in her favor. Justice Anthony Kennedy said that Congress had left it to the courts to determine the controlling principles. This majority ruling was summarized as follows: > Under Title VII, an employee who refuses the unwelcome and threatening > sexual advances of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse, tangible job > consequences, may recover against the employer without showing the employer > is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's actions, but the > employer may interpose an affirmative defense. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer. Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Scalia. Notes References * Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn.

It consists of two separate facilities, the Depot Museum and the Farmstead Museum. The Depot Museum is located in a former Cotton Belt railroad depot that was built in 1901. It includes documents and photographs of local and regional historical interest, including artifacts that date from Pittsburg's foundation in 1854. The museum is also home to a collection of antique farming equipment, a display on prominent local people, an art gallery, a wildlife diorama, and an archaeological exhibit documenting the native Caddo. The Depot Museum is perhaps best known for its replica of the Ezekiel Airship, which it acquired in 2001. In 1902, a year before the Wright Flyer flew at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Ezekiel Airship was claimed to have flown in Pittsburg. According to these claims, the flight took place in the presence of only a handful of witnesses, and those involved allegedly took an oath of silence; there is no physical evidence to support any of the claims. Historians of human flight have generally dismissed claims that the Ezekiel Airship was the first aircraft to successfully make a heavier-than-air flight; some, however, believe that it may have achieved uncontrolled flight. The full-size replica, based largely on a single surviving photograph, was built by local craftsman Bob Lowery and the Pittsburg Optimist Club in 1986 and 1987. Prior to its acquisition by the museum, the replica was on display at the Pittsburg Hot Links restaurant in downtown Pittsburg. Other industrial and technological exhibits at the Depot Museum include a 1925 American LaFrance fire truck, a Ford Model T, a surrey built in 1909, an 1890s steam engine, a printing press, a working telegraph station, and a telephone switchboard that dates to 1894. The Farmstead Museum consists of a restored early 20th-century farmhouse along with a barn and smokehouse. The house is furnished with period furniture, and the farmstead also includes a demonstration garden were cotton and corn are grown. Additionally, the farmstead features exhibits and demonstrations dedicated to period practices relating to work, leisure, childrearing, cooking, and other aspects of rural family life.

Biography  He was the son of a master barber. In 1778, his father offered refuge to the painter Simon Mathurin Lantara, who was in desperate financial straits and, during his stay, Lantara excited young Lafitte's interest in painting. He also convinced Lafitte's father that his son had a gift for drawing, so he was sent to study with the engraver Gilles Demarteau then, in 1786, with Jean-Baptiste Regnault.Brief biography @ Napoleon.org. Later he was admitted to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Allegory of Vent√¥se from the French Republican Calendar In 1791, he won Prix de Rome for his painting of Regulus returning to Carthage and became the last painter sent to Rome during the reign of Louis XVI. He was living at the Villa Medici in 1793, when protests against French incursions into Italy forced him to flee the Papal States and seek refuge in Florence, where he briefly taught at the Academy. He returned to Paris in 1796 and was married later that year. Financial problems soon forced him to do decorative work and illustrations, including twelve allegories for the months in the French Republican Calendar. In 1800, he worked at the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison in collaboration with the architect Charles Percier. His work there featured eight Pompeian style dancers for the dining room. In 1809, the S√©nat commissioned a monumental oil painting, depicting the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic, but he was unable to complete it successfully. From 1807 to 1808, he worked with architect Jean Chalgrin, managing all the decorations for the Th√©√¢tre de l'Imp√©ratrice. The theater was gutted by fire in 1818, and his decorations survive only in written descriptions. The following year, he helped Chalgrin decorate a full-scale wood, stucco and canvas mockup of the proposed Arc de Triomphe. In 1811, he painted Romulus and Remus above the doors of the S√©nat at the Palais du Luxembourg for the baptism of Napol√©on Fran√ßois Charles Joseph Bonaparte. Brutus Listening to Ambassadors from the Tarquins (c.1815), Los Angeles County Museum of Art From 1800 to 1814, he created designs for the Manufacture de S√®vres. Then, from 1814 to 1816, he collaborated with Merry-Joseph Blondel in creating a collection of wallpapers based on the theme of Cupid and Psyche, from a story by Jean de La Fontaine. In 1816, taking advantage of a peaceful period, he visited London, where King George III commissioned him to create decorations for a celebration at Carlton House. In 1820, he designed decorations to commemorate the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux. In 1823, he was named a Knight in the L√©gion d'Honneur as a designer for the King's Cabinet.Dossier @ the Base L√©onore. Two years later, he created his last major works for the coronation of Charles X. He died after a brief illness and is buried in P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery.

The pilot was directed by Niels Arden Oplev and written by creator and showrunner Sam Esmail. The episode aired on June 24, 2015, and was watched by approximately 1.75 million people in the U.S., the highest rating the series has ever received. The episode was praised for its writing, music, cinematography, and performances, particularly that of Rami Malek, although it received some criticism for its similarity to David Fincher's Fight Club, a film which Esmail has stated he took inspiration from. Plot The episode opens with the narration of computer hacker Elliot Alderson, who explains that he is speaking to an imaginary character he made up in his mind. He believes that he is being followed by men in suits, possibly over his actions the night before. In a flashback, Elliot engineers a child pornographer's arrest by hacking the man's computer and sending its illegal content to the police. On the train ride home, he again sees the men in suits along with a man in glasses who attempts to talk to him. The next day, Elliot reports to work at Allsafe Security, where he provides computer security for the very corporations that he despises. The episode cuts to Elliot at a therapy session, where he explains how he has hacked his therapist, Krista, and has unsuccessfully attempted to hack her boyfriend, Michael Hansen. The scene cuts back to the office where Allsafe is preparing to host their largest client, the multi-national conglomerate E Corp (which Elliot refers to as \\"Evil Corp\\"). During their tour of the office, Elliot has a strange interaction with E Corp's Senior VP of Technology, Tyrell Wellick. After work, Elliot snorts morphine to help him cope with his depression and loneliness and afterward takes suboxone in case he goes through withdrawal. Elliot takes Molly with his neighbor and drug dealer, Shayla, and they have sex. The next morning, he gets a notification on his phone that Krista has checked in at a local restaurant with Michael. Using a ruse, Elliot manages to get Krista's boyfriend's telephone number. While walking home, Elliot receives a panicked phone call from Angela, his childhood best friend, begging him to come back to work. At the office, Elliot finds Lloyd (a colleague of Elliot's) and Angela attempting to stop a DDoS attack on E Corp's servers. Elliot realizes that they cannot stop the hack locally because of the rootkit that the hackers wrote and placed in the root directory of the server (CS 30), and together with Allsafe's owner Gideon he flies to E Corp's server farm to stop the hack in person. While examining the hacked server, Elliot finds a file with a message in it for him. The message simply says, \\"Leave me here,\\" and after a quick debate with himself, he changes the file so that only he can access it but leaves it on the server. On his train ride home from Allsafe, Elliot is once again confronted by the man in glasses, whom he refers to as Mr. Robot because of the logo on his shirt. Mr. Robot tells Elliot to follow him off the train, but only if he didn't delete the file from E Corp's server. They head to an abandoned arcade in Coney Island, where Mr. Robot explains that they are the hackers that attacked E Corp's server. Saving their file instead of deleting it was a test, which Elliot has passed. Mr. Robot welcomes Elliot into \\"fsociety,\\" the name the hackers have chosen. Elliot returns home and compiles all the evidence needed to turn fsociety into the FBI. Elliot visits Mr. Robot again to tell him that he will be turning him in. They take a ride on a Ferris wheel where Mr. Robot asks Elliot to modify the file to show that E Corp's CTO Terry Colby was behind the hack instead of fsociety. Mr. Robot offers Elliot the chance to take E Corp down completely, and Elliot returns home where he modifies the data file as asked. In a meeting with E Corp, the FBI, and Allsafe the next day, Elliot prepares to give the FBI the evidence against fsociety. However, after Terry Colby insults Angela and has her removed from the meeting, he changes his mind and gives the FBI the falsified info that incriminates Colby. Nineteen days later, Elliot is still waiting for something to happen to Terry Colby or E Corp. To occupy his mind, Elliot turns back to hacking Krista's boyfriend. He discovers that the man is using a fake name and profile, and actually is married to someone else. He confronts and threatens the man, telling him that he must reveal his deception to Krista, or Elliot will dump all his collected evidence on the man's wife. Elliot also demands that the man gives him his dog, which he had been abusing. In his next therapy session, Elliot sees Krista is obviously emotionally distracted and knows that the man broke up with her. Elliot returns to work and attempts to patch his relationship with Angela, who hasn't spoken to him since the meeting with the FBI. They make up, and as they hug, everyone in the office begins to stare. They realize that everyone is staring at the TV monitor behind them, which is showing the news that Terry Colby has been arrested by the FBI. Elliot goes to Times Square to watch the news, but he is confronted by the men in the suits. They take him in a car to E Corp's headquarters, and at the end of the episode, he walks down a long hallway into a room to be confronted by Tyrell Wellick. Production Creator and showrunner Sam Esmail wrote the episode. =Writing= Sam Esmail originally intended Mr. Robot to be a feature film. However, midway through writing the first act, he found that script had expanded considerably, and that it became a script more suited for a television show. He removed 20 of around 89 pages of the script, and used it as the pilot for the series. Esmail took the script to film and television production company Anonymous Content to see if it could be developed into a television series, which was then picked up by USA Network. The network gave a pilot order to Mr. Robot in July 2014. =Casting= Casting of the series was an arduous task, as no actor was acclimated to the tone of the series. Casting director Susie Farris (a role she shares with Beth Bowling and Kim Miscia) was surprised by some requirements; she recounted that, \\"Some of the things [Sam] would say on the phone, I remember just being like, 'Are you kidding? What?' And I think that's what makes the show so good, is because he did have such a vision, and that's not necessarily what happens in episodic television always.\\" According to Esmail, he contemplated rewriting the script before Malek had his audition, saying; \\"I was auditioning people, and a lot of great actors came in, [but] they were starting to sound very cold to me and so I started second-guessing the script. I felt like I was being lectured by this guy. I felt like the character was being too obnoxious. And then Rami came in and just auditioned with this vulnerability and this warmth that instead of me feeling cold and disconnected from the character, it made me want to reach out to him and hug him. It's something that, once he did the audition, we all knew this was our guy.\\" =Filming= The pilot was filmed on location in New York. Filming locations included Silvercup Studios and Coney Island, which served as the base of operations for the hacking group fsociety. Reception The episode received universal acclaim from critics and audiences. The episode has an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.3/10. The episode got a rating of 8.7/10 from Amy Ratcliffe of IGN, who praised Malek, saying \\"Mr. Robot made a fantastic first impression with its pilot. It's obviously impossible to judge a series based on a single episode, but they've played a strong first hand. Rami Malek is positively brilliant as Elliot, and the character's Robin Hood-esque nature has appeal. The stakes are high and the conspiracies and mysteries are riveting ‚Äì it's a world I can't wait to see more of.\\" This episode was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards ‚Äì Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Rami Malek, Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for Sam Esmail, and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series for Mac Quayle, winning for Malek's performance and Quayle's music composition. In its initial broadcast on USA Network on June 24, 2015, the episode received 1.75 million viewers. The episode also had 2.6 million views prior to its broadcast, as the episode was made available online beginning May 27.

The rider controls the speed by leaning forwards or backwards, and direction of travel by twisting the pads. Invented in its current form in early 2013, the device is the subject of complex patent disputes. Volume manufacture started in China in 2014 and early units were prone to catch fire due to an overheating battery which resulted in product recalls in 2016, including over 500,000 units sold in the United States by eight manufacturers. History A cosplayer riding a self-balancing board at the 2015 Wizard World Chicago Shane Chen, an American businessman and founder of Inventist filed a patent for a device of this type in February 2013 and launched a Kickstarter fund-raising campaign in May 2013. The devices' increasing popularity in Western countries has been attributed, initially, to endorsement by the wide array of celebrities (including Justin Bieber, Jamie Foxx, Kendall Jenner, Chris Brown, Soulja Boy and Wiz Khalifa). The founders of the American company PhunkeeTree encountered the board at the Hong Kong Electronics Show, in 2014 and became involved in its distribution, shortly thereafter. By June 2015, the board was being made by several manufacturers, mainly in the Shenzhen region of China. In January 2015 through Inventist, he announced his intention to pursue litigation In April 2015, Ninebot, a significant manufacturer of devices acquired Segway Inc. (which separately asserted that it holds patents for self-balancing scooters.) in order to resolve the dispute. In May Chen voiced his frustrations regarding patent rights in China. In August 2015, Mark Cuban announced plans to purchase the Hovertrax patents from Chen. Many of the units provided in the first year of manufacture were defective and likely to catch fire, resulting in a major product recall from multiple manufacturers during 2016 (more details below). In June 2016 the U.S. International Trade Commission issued an injunction for patent infringement against UPTECH, U.P. Technology, U.P. Robotics, FreeGo China, EcoBoomer, and Roboscooters. Robstep, INMOTION, Tech in the City, FreeGo settled with Segway. Etymology of \\"hoverboard\\" The use of the term \\"hoverboard\\" to describe these devices, despite the fact that they do not hover, has led to considerable discussion in the media. The first use of the term for can be traced back to a 1967 science fiction novel by M. K. Joseph and subsequently popularized in the 1989 film, Back to the Future Part II where Marty McFly uses one after traveling to 2015. While the first trademarked use of hoverboard was registered in 1996 as a collecting and trading game, its first use as a commercial name representing a wheeled scooter was in 1999, and Guinness World Records lists a farthest hoverboard flight entry. In September 2015 the Oxford English Dictionary stated in their view the term had not been in use in the context for long enough for inclusion and that for the time being they would restrict their description to boards that Marty McFly would recognize. The term \\"self-balancing electric scooter\\" remains popular. Design and operation How to ride self-balancing scooter images step by step The device has three , , diameter wheel variants connected to a self-balancing control mechanism using built-in gyroscopic and a sensor pad. By tilting the pad the rider can control the speed and direction of travel achieving speeds from 6 to 15 miles per hour (9.7 to 24 km/h) with a range of up to dependent on model, terrain, rider weight and other factors. As with most wheeled vehicles where the rider is exposed, Consumer Reports has recommended that users wear appropriate safety gear while using them. In 2019, hoverboards now feature a self balancing mode, in which the motors automatically engage the gyroscope in the opposite direction. This way, when the rider leans forward or backward the board is always attempting to level itself, making it easier to ride than its 2016 predecessors. Issues and incidents Customs and Border Protection officer at the Chicago field office stands between aisles of seized counterfeit hoverboards. There were many instances of units catching fire, with claims that they were responsible for numerous residential fires between late 2015 into 2016. In the United Kingdom, authorities expressed concerns with the boards, regarding possible faulty wiring. Many airlines banned the transportation of the boards, both as stored or carry-on luggage. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) launched an investigation into the safety of the device in late 2015 and determined that the lithium-ion battery packs in the self-balancing scooters/hoverboards could overheat and posed a risk of catching fire or exploding, and that defects had led to 60 fires in over 20 states. In July 2016 the commission ordered the recall of over 500,000 units from eight manufacturers. The Swagway model X1 constituted the majority of the recalled \\"hoverboards,\\" at 267,000 units. In January 2016 the Philippines, the Departments of Health and Trade and Industry issued a joint advisory cautioning the public against buying them, due to reports of injuries and \\"potential electrocution connected with its usage\\". The advisory also stated ‚Äúas a precautionary measure, the DOH and DTI-Consumer Protection Group therefore advise parents against buying hoverboards for children under 14 years of age.‚Äù In May 2016, the miniPRO produced by Segway Inc. received UL certification, as did a company in Shenzhen, China. In June 2016, after safety improvements in design, the UL- approved Swagtron was launched in the United States. The danger of self- balance boards has continued; several houses caught fire due to these devices in 2017.

Biography  Staggered Holidays For Comfort, from The National Archives (United Kingdom), Eileen Evans. Evans studied commercial art at the Reimann School in London, graduating in 1939. Evans selected this school expressly due to its reputation for providing good employment opportunities. Shortly afterwards, she joined the Ministry of Information (which later became the Central Office of Information or COI). During the war Evans and Mount worked together at the Ministry of Information designing many public information and propaganda posters. Evans also created posters independently of Mount, including at least one recruitment poster for farm workers, plus several for the Lend A Hand on the Land campaign which encouraged city families to take working holidays to help with wartime harvests. Evans is one of the featured artists in the National Archives 'The Art of War' collection. Her collaborative work with Mount is also included in the Victoria and Albert Museum collections. Their anti-smoking and road safety posters won awards. In their joint work and commissions, Evans was responsible for the typography and layout of the posters. Their partnership continued into the 1950s and 1960s with posters such as The Parachute Regiment for the British Army Recruiting Office, the 1967 Britain in Montreal poster for the Department of Trade and further work for the Department of Health.

Stjepana u Starom Gradu) is the parish church of Stari Grad on the island of Hvar in Croatia. It is dedicated to the martyred Pope Stephen I. It stands on the eastern side of a small square, Trg sv. Stjepana (St. Stephen's Square), in the historical centre of Stari Grad.  History  It was built from 1605 onward at the site of an earlier church also dedicated to St. Stephen. The previous church, built in the 9th/10th centuries, had served as the cathedral for the bishop of Hvar from 1147, when the diocese was established, until 1278, when the island placed itself under the protection of the Venetian Republic and the bishopric was moved to the town of Hvar. It was severely damaged during a raid of the Ottoman admiral Ulu√ß Ali on the island of Hvar in 1571 before he participated with his Algerian corsair fleet in the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571. Once the town had recovered from this devastation, the ruins of the old cathedral and of the adjacent episcopal palace were demolished and the construction of the new church begun in 1605. The bell tower was only completed in 1753.  Architecture  Inside St. Stephen's The organ The present church, in the style of Dalmatian Baroque, is a large three- nave basilica with a square apse, built of stone from the nearby island of Korƒçula which oxidizes over time and takes on a red-brown colour. It is the work of local craftsmen. The main portal in the centre of the west-facing fa√ßade, and probably the entire fa√ßade, is the work of Ivan Pomeniƒá from Korƒçula who also worked on the Cathedral of St. Stephen in Hvar. The two side aisles are the work of Mark Foretiƒá from Korƒçula and of the master of the Skarpa-family of Stari Grad. The baroque fa√ßade has a semicircular gable, a large central portal and two smaller side portals, all in the style of the late Renaissance/early Baroque. Above the central portal is a rose window.  Interior  The vault of the nave is decorated with stucco which imitates Gothic ribbed vaults of the late Gothic. The church has a beautiful wooden choir and contains a number of valuable furnishings by well-known artists. The stone baptismal font of 1592 is by the architect and sculptor Tryfun Bokaniƒá (1575 - 1609) from Puƒçi≈°ƒáa on the island of Braƒç. The main altar is the work of the Venetian workshop of Alessandro Tremignon from 1702. In the northern aisle are a wooden crucifix from the 17th century and the black marble altar of the Holy Cross, a work of the architect and sculptor Andrea Bruttapelle (1728-1782) from 1773. In the southern aisle stand the altar of St. Anthony of Padua from the first half of the 18th century and an altar from the 19th century with the figures of Sts. Cosmas and Damian and of St. Lucy. Next to it is the most valuable work of art in the church, a triptych by the Venetian Francesco di Gerolamo de Santacroce (1516-1584) depicting St. Mary, St. John the Baptist and St. Jerome. On the outside of the church is a stone relief of Eros, one of the rare remains from the ancient Greek polis.  Bell tower  The bell tower The bell tower stands apart from the church. The inscription above its door indicates that it was completed in 1753. Another inscription, in Latin, states that stone blocks of the lower part of the tower were part of the city walls of the ancient Pharos, the Greek predecessor of today's Stari Grad, and that the gate to the city was at this location. In the wall on the ground floor is a relief of a Roman merchant ship, dating from the 2nd century AD.

This analysis measures the Mesio-distal width of each tooth and is divided into two analyses.  History  Wayne A Bolton presented this analysis in the year 1958. In 1962, he published another paper which talked about clinical applications of using Bolton Analysis in Orthodontics. He was the graduate of University of Washington's first dental class in 1950 and also the first orthodontic class of 1952. A boley gauge is usually the instrument of choice to measure the widths of each teeth. However, in 1995, Shellhart et al. showed during their study that Vernier caliper can also be used as an alternative for Bolton Analysis. Many other investigation models have been developed, such as measurement from photocopies and traveling microscope but the studies have produced no results. Recently, digital calipers from companies such as OrthoCad, are being used to measure the mesiodistal widths of the teeth. Analysis An Overall Analysis measures the sum of mesio-distal width of all 12 (first molar to first molar) mandibular teeth and compares them to the 12 maxillary teeth. The overall ratio known to be 91.3%. The anterior analysis measures the sum of Mesio-distal width of front 6 mandibular teeth and compares them to maxillary teeth. The anterior ratio is known to be 77.2%. An overall ratio of more than 91.3% means that the mandibular teeth are bigger when compared to normal. A ratio smaller than 91.3% would mean the mandibular teeth are smaller than normal. Anterior analysis follows the same principle. Having a different ratio than normal is referred to as Bolton Discrepancy. A standard deviation of more than 2 yields a significant discrepancy.  Drawbacks  One of the drawbacks of this analysis, is that the sample that Bolton measured in his paper in 1958, consisted of only Caucasian population. Therefore, Bolton's Overall Ratio and Anterior Ratio Mean and Standard Deviations are not representative of samples from other race and population. In addition, because the samples that were measured had perfect malocclusion, any samples after performing Bolton Analysis, will yield a high discrepancy compared to Bolton ratios. It is seen that majority of the populations when studied and compared to Bolton's ratios, are usually not ideal compared to his ratios.

The tower was one of several built outside the city walls of Palmyra, in an area known as the Valley of the Tombs. The tower was important in the history of textiles: fragments of very early Chinese silk yarns, dated to the 1st century AD, were discovered in the tombs at the tower. The tower was demolished using explosives by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in August 2015. Description The tower of Elahbel, 1920 The tower was one of several multiple-storey stone funerary buildings in a necropolis a few hundred metres outside the city walls of Palmyra, in an area in the hills to the south and west that became known as the Valley of the Tombs. It lies below the Umm al- Bilqis hill, about west of the similar Towers of Iamblichus (or Iamlichu, or Yemliko) from AD83. The tower was completed in AD103 by a Palmyrene aristocrat Marcus Ulpius Elahbelus and his three brothers, Manai, Shakaiei, and Malku; they were all sons of Wahballat, son of Manai Elahbel. It is thought that Marcus Ulpius Elahbelus became a Roman citizen in the reign of the Emperor Trajan, which is why he shares elements of Emperor's birth name (Marcus Ulpius Traianus). Elahbel was known from an inscription at the Temple of Nabu in Palmyra. The Tower of Elahbel was a tower of four storeys, with an approximately square plan, constructed from large sandstone blocks. The ground storey was slightly larger, and stepped back to the upper floors. A single door in the south face of the ground floor led to the interior, with an inscription plaque and round headed niche (like a window or balcony) decorating the otherwise blank wall above. The chambers inside were decorated inside with Corinthian pilasters and a painted coffered ceiling. The tower was partially reconstructed after it was visited by Gertrude Bell in 1900, and visitors could climb an internal staircase to the upper tomb chamber, and then the roof. Inside, the tower was divided into loculi, separate compartments like pigeonholes or a columbarium used to store the sarcophagi of deceased wealthy Palmyrenes, with each cell sealed with a carved and painted image of the occupant. Destruction The site containing the ruins of the ancient Palmyra, including the tower, was captured by ISIL in May 2015. Some portable carvings from the tombs had previously been removed to safety. Others were already held by museums. After ISIL/ISIS destroyed parts of the temples of Baalshamin and Bel later in 2015, the Tower of Elahbel and several other less well preserved tower tombs were reportedly blown up in August 2015, including the Tower of Iamblichus.

They are believed to be a common feature of the evolution of planetary nebulae, but can only be resolved in the nearest examples. They are generally larger than the size of the Solar system (i.e. the orbit of Pluto), with masses of around 10‚àí5 times the mass of the Sun, which is comparable to the mass of the Earth. There are about 40,000 cometary knots in the Helix Nebula. At optical wavelengths, the knots are seen as \\"the ionized skin of a dense, dusty molecular globule\\" forming a crescent-shaped head that is ionized and illuminated by the central star, with a trailing spoke or tail. In molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide data, the tails of cometary knots are observed to be highly molecular. The central globule is at least 1000 times denser than the surrounding material that streams past it. The appearance is analogous to the tail of a comet that faces away from its star, but comets are solid bodies and much smaller in overall size and mass. Globules located far and close to the central star present different characteristics. On the near side of the Helix Nebula, the central dusty globule of each cometary knot appears dark against the background as it absorbs the [O III] 5007 Angstrom light emitted in the nebular envelope. Those on the far side do not obstruct this light source and so do not have this dark appearance. In addition, globules near the central star appear to have a distinct trailing tail, whereas those located farther do no exhibit such defined tails. The origin of cometary knots in planetary nebulae is still unknown and subject to active research. It is unclear whether they were created during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase and somehow managed to survive the AGB-PN transition, or if they were created when the star has already become a planetary nebula. The latter case would imply that the conditions in the planetary nebula host would have, at a certain point, triggered the formation of molecular clumps in its nebular envelope. Therefore, understanding the formation and evolution of cometary knots would not only give an insight into the physical properties of the planetary nebula host, but would also help draw a more detailed picture of the stellar evolution of low to intermediate mass stars.  Relation to other photoevaporation flows  Cometary knots are one type of ionized photoevaporation flow, which is characteristically associated with planetary nebulae, but several other types of photoevaporation flows (proplyds, cometary globules, elephant trunks, and champagne flows) are known from H II regions such as the Orion Nebula. Cometary knots are described as more advection- dominated than the other varieties, which are recombination-dominated or dust- dominated. The distinction can be made in terms of the formula for the \\"dynamic ionization balance within a photoevaporation flow\\", F* ‚âà Œºn0 \\\\+ Œ±n02h. Here F* is the \\"ionizing photon flux incident on the outside of the flow\\", Œº is the \\"initial velocity of the flow\\", Œ± is the \\"recombination coefficient\\", n0 is the \\"peak ionized density in the flow\\", and h, which is approximately 0.1 r0, is the \\"effective thickness of the flow\\". In advection- dominated flows, Œºn0 is greater than Œ±n02h, and most of the incoming photons reach the ionization front and ionize fresh gas. In other flows, most photons fail to reach the ionization front, and instead balance recombinations in the flow..  Reports in more distant objects  Several structures have been described as cometary knots or cometary globules that surround R Coronae Borealis, which is a peculiar star described as potentially the result of a white dwarf merger or final helium shell flash that periodically dims due to a build-up of carbon dust surrounding it, acting as a 'natural coronograph'. Three-dimensional modelling of NGC 6337, a planetary nebula with a close binary nucleus, suggests the presence of a \\"thick ring with radial filaments and knots.\\" The cometary knots represent large density fluctuations in a slowly expanding toroid.

The novels contain an element of speculative fiction as the main character comes from a long line of voodoo priestesses and is a priestess in training. The first fourteen books were published through Dafina, an imprint of Kensington Books. Starting in 2012 Divine began self-publishing the series under Ebb & Flow Publications/L. Divine Inc.

Jayd is continuously presented with both supernatural and practical problems in which she must use the teachings of her maternal ancestors (the Williams women) to help her solve. The series takes place in modern-day Los Angeles, California and contains many references to real life places. The novels are stemmed in the teachings of the Yoruba religion and maintain the presence of both African American and Latin cultures. The characters attend South Bay High, a fictional high school where the majority of the student body and teaching staff are privileged and white, ultimately causing racial tension between the students and the teachers alike.

Only 45 of the 240 panels of the dome were left intact; the other panels, and all five of the windows, all suffered damage. Plans to rebuild the Baltic Exchange were abandoned when the extent of the damage became clear; the remnants of the old building were demolished in 1998 and replaced by 30 St Mary Axe (nicknamed the Gherkin) where the glazed rooftop dome refers back to the dome of the Baltic Exchange. With funding from Swiss Re, the memorial glass was restored by glass conservators Goddard & Gibbs and has been displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich since 2005. The marble panels were installed at the Baltic Exchange's new building at 38 St Mary Axe.

Haiti had not had a regular armed forces since 1995; a process to reestablish them was initiated in 2011 and culminated in their remobilization in 2017. History Due to decades of coups and counter-coups, the regular Haitian Army, Navy, and Air Force were abolished in 1995. The formal disbandment of the military, however, did not end its involvement in national life. In 2004 a paramilitary force of former Haitian soldiers, backed by the United States and France, deposed the government of Jean Bertrand Aristide. Several years later, a group of former members of the Haitian military began the private, voluntary training of young men in field-craft and military tactics as a demonstration of the potential of a new armed force. By 2012 these recruits numbered between 3,000 and 15,000. That same year, Haitian veterans forcibly occupied several decommissioned army posts to press the government to reestablish the military, and later interrupted a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies to demand the approval of Laurent Lamothe's nomination as prime minister, an action which UN officials denounced as an \\"unacceptable act of intimidation.\\" Popular dissatisfaction with the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti has helped pave the way for the reconstitution of the Haitian armed forces. In 2011, following his election as president of Haiti, Michel Martelly promised to reestablish the military. The move was generally seen as a popular response to widespread public dissatisfaction with the ongoing United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti;the unsanitary and poor practices of Nepalese UN soldiers were cause to a cholera epidemic while Uruguayan and Pakistani UN troops were allegedly complicit in the rape of Haitian boys. \\" Carl Alexandre, deputy United Nations envoy overseeing police and judicial reform in Haiti, meanwhile blamed \\"proliferating armed forces\\" by the Haitian government as a reason for increased bandit attacks in the countryside, and called on the Haitian National Police to be affirmed as the country's only security apparatus. Critics of the planned force note that Haiti does not have any enemies, however, proponents point to the need to fill a \\"security vacuum\\" they say will emerge following the departure of the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti, and that a military is needed to fulfill missions such as securing the nation's porous border with the Dominican Republic, responding to natural disasters, and restoring \\"national pride\\". Training and recruitment An initial plan envisaged a military force of 3,500 personnel operational by 2014. Aided by Ecuador, Haiti had managed to raise and train a force of 41 personnel by September 2013, though this nucleus unit of sappers, officially termed the \\"Corps of Engineers,\\" was unarmed and mission focused on infrastructure construction. The following January an additional contingent of 30 recruits left the country for training in Ecuador and, in November of that year, a further 40 recruits left for Ecuador to partake in the eight-month course. In July 2015 Martelly formally announced the new force would be called the Force de D√©fense d‚ÄôHa√Øti (Defence Force of Haiti) and would be tasked with \\"control of our borders, our sea and air space and [preparing for] the departure of UN forces.\\" According to Martelly, a stepped-up recruitment campaign was set to begin in October 2015. In October 2017, under the administration of Jovenel and Prime Minister Lafontant, President Moise who is allied with former President Martelly remobilized the Armed Forces. The Haitian National Police remains under a UN mandated mission that is called MINIJUSTH which is set to expire in 2019.

It is a system utilized in struggling school districts in an attempt to turn around failing schools. The goal is to introduce private market ideas into a school system through a CEO with unilateral power to enact necessary reforms. The concept was first introduced in 1995 in the Chicago Public School System. Function and purpose The functions of the CEO vary from school district to school district. Whereas the CEO mostly replaces both the roles of the school board and superintendent, other school districts place the CEO below the superintendent and grant power over the day-to-day operations. In Chicago, the CEO has the power to appoint the school board. However, in other school districts with elected school boards, the CEO is often appointed in spite of the board. Using a CEO in a public school system mirrors the typical structure of a charter school which, perhaps, serves as the inspiration for using a CEO of a public school.NYC Charter Schools, Building the Foundation for an Effective Charter School Governing Board, accessed 10/8/2015, http://www.nyccharterschools.org/sites/default/files/resources/Building_an_Effective_Charter_School_Board_0.pdf. Comparison to superintendents A CEO is different from a superintendent in that the CEO of schools has total control over every decision made by a school district; the CEO decides what rights, if any, are delegated to the board of education. A CEO of Schools often needs no background in education. The goal of implementing a CEO of schools is to remove power from School Boards of ineffective school districts and replace with an individual to bring private market business ideas to the education system. It is a way to address the inequality of public schools and attempt to raise failing schools to a functional level. Historical development The first school district in the nation to appoint a CEO was the Chicago Public School district, who appointed Paul Vallas as CEO in 1995. Baltimore implemented reforms to its school system in 1997 which led to the appointment of a CEO. Cleveland soon followed suit by appointing Barbara Byrd-Bennett as CEO under Mayoral Control in 1998.  Controversy  The appointment of CEO has proven controversial in some instances. The attempt to appoint a CEO of the Youngstown, Ohio school system has been met with a lawsuit. The lawsuit was unsuccessful. Proponents argue that, by removing local control and placing it in the hands of a CEO, it creates a more efficient system which can turn around the school system. Opponents argue that it strips local control and accountability from the management of the school systems. Another controversy has centered around Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the former CEO of Chicago Public Schools and later Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Ms. Byrd-Bennett was the subject of a 23-count federal indictment accusing her of executing a scheme to give a $20 million no-bid contract in return for a kick-back. She entered a guilty plea on October 13, 2015. Barbara Byrd-Bennett Indictment  Examples of CEOs of schools  * The Baltimore City Public School System installed Dr. Gregory E. Thornton as CEO for the 2014-2015 school year. Of note, Dr. Thornton has taken an approach which has restored funding for the arts and reduced school suspensions. * The Chicago Public Schools The current CEO of Schools is Forrest Claypool. The system implemented by Paul Vallas utilized quantitative metrics by which both students and schools were evaluated; under-performing students were held back and under-performing schools were placed on probation. This resulted in the closure of 82 under-performing schools, replaced by 116 new schools. * The Cleveland Metropolitan School District installed Eric Gordon as CEO in 2011. Mr. Gordon has implemented a \\"Humanware\\" Initiative which seeks to improve \\"student safety, support, and social and emotional development.\\" Cleveland had the lowest graduation rate of urban school districts in the country as of 2006. * Minneapolis Public Schools-The CEO of Minneapolis Public Schools, Michael Goar, served below the Superintendent before being promoted to superintendent. As a sign of the struggles of the school district, African American male students only had a literacy rate of 20%. * School District of Philadelphia appointed a CEO in the year 2000. * Youngstown City School District- Ohio Governor John Kasich signed a bill creating the position of CEO of the Youngstown City School District. The School District sued to overturn the Bill and prevent the appointment of a CEO. The litigation is ongoing and the State of Ohio filed a Motion to Dismiss.

History  In the 1970s, during Patricia Phelps de Cisneros' travels across Latin America with her husband, Gustavo Cisneros, she spent her time visiting artists in their studios and seeing art in local galleries and museums, and began actively purchasing and collecting artwork. Primarily collecting indigenous work during frequent expeditions through Venezuela, especially around the Orinoco in the Amazon River Basin. As her collection grew, Cisneros saw that Latin American art was under-represented in the international art community, so the Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros (CPPC) was formed in the 1990s, with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated. That effort has included a four-pronged approach: An ambitious approach to lending artworks around the world, working with scholars and academics to learn more about the artists and their works, the creation of a publications program to provide supporting information about the artists and their work, and building an online forum for the artwork.  Collection  The CPPC is best known for its collection of Modernist geometric abstraction from Latin America and also comprises holdings of Latin American landscapes by traveler artists to Latin America in the 17th to 19th centuries; furniture and art from Latin America's colonial period; contemporary art from Latin America; and an important group of art and artifacts from indigenous peoples of Venezuela's Amazonas region, the Orinoco Collection. The mission of the Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros is to enhance appreciation of the diversity, sophistication, and range of art from Latin America. Gradually, Cisneros began acquiring geometric abstract artwork that had been under- appreciated. It gradually grew into a significant holding of 20th century Latin American abstract art. She has appeared on top collector lists every year since 1998. Cisneros has been lending her collections to international exhibitions and institutions since 1999. Cisneros credits her understanding of the importance of stewardship as a collector to her great-grandfather, William H Phelps, who meticulously cataloged his ornithological collection. She has said that her aesthetic developed as a result of having grown up in the modernist society of Caracas in the 1950s and 1960s. The collection is organized in five categories that are areas of focus: Modern art, Contemporary art, Colonial art, the Orinoco collection, which is an ethnographic collection that traces the cultural production of 12 indigenous groups from the Orinoco River Basin, and the Traveler Artists to Latin America collection. = Modern art = The modern art collection is made up of works by Latin American artists who were active in the twentieth century. The focus is on artists who work in the geometric abstraction movements of modern art in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela, with additional focus on artists working in both Europe and North America that have a connection to the history of Latin American art. La Invenci√≥n Concreta is a micro-site, publication, and series of exhibitions that reflect the growth of geometric abstraction movements in South America from 1930 to late 1970. = Contemporary art = This collection consists of contemporary artists from Latin America as well as other artists from other areas. In addition to the collection of work by contemporary artists, the collection provides support for artists residencies and grant funding. The collection is actively involved in education-based programming. = Colonial art = The Colonial art collection is focused on Colonial art and furnishings. This collection is made up of painting, furnishings and religious objects made in Venezuela from the Colonial Venezuela era that began in 1717 and continued throughout the Hispanic and Republican periods, leading up to the middle of the 19th century. It follows the independence of Venezuela and reflects the history of Venezuela's early development as a country. = Orinoco collection = The Orinoco collection is an ethnographic collection that traces the cultural production of materials by 12 indigenous groups from the Venezuelan Orinoco River Basin (also known as the Amazonas region) through the collection of ethnographic objects and documents from the following areas: * Baniva * Bar√© * De'√°ruwa (Piaroa) * E'√±epa (Panare) * H√≠wi (Guahibo) * Hoti * Puinave * Waku√©nai (Curripaco) * Warekena * Tsase (P√≠apoco) * Yanomami * Ye'kuana The collection began in the 1970s during vacations in the Orinoco region with Cisneros' family, when Cisneros realized the materials were quickly disappearing. = Traveler Artists to Latin America = The Traveler Artists to Latin America collection includes landscape art created by artists traveling to Latin America during the period that started in 1638 to the late 19th century. This collection reflects the development of Latin American landscape art, which started with Frans Post coming to Brazil from Amsterdam in 1637. The collection traces the trend of European and American artists coming to the region, an influx of visiting artists that led to the development of various national schools of paintings. The collection includes a Landscapes of the Americas collection, which is made up of drawings, paintings, photographs, prints, and watercolors from this time of active political change and reflects cultural exchange between Latin America and Spain and Portugal.  Partnerships  Cisneros and the Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros have long-term relationships with various cultural institutions globally. Among these are Tate Modern, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, among many others. In 2010, the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Professorship in Latin American Art at Hunter College was established with a $1 million donation. Cisneros has had a long-term relationship with the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The 2016 donation of 102 modern and contemporary Latin American artworks from the 1940s to 1990s to the Museum of Modern Art, which establishes the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Research Institute for the Study of Art from Latin America at MoMA, join the previous donation by Colecci√≥n Cisneros of over 40 other previously donated works. The gift is meant to be transformative and impactful on how Latin American art is valued and recognized globally. The gift includes works by Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Jes√∫s Rafael Soto, Alejandro Otero, and Tom√°s Maldonado. Additional highlights are works by Willys de Castro, H√©lio Oiticica, Juan Mele, Mira Schendel, and Gego. The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Research Institute for the Study of Art from Latin America is projected to open as a new wing at MoMA in 2019. In 2018, it was announced that In√©s Katzenstein was appointed as the director of the newly formed Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Research Institute for the Study of Art from Latin America as well as the Curator of Latin American Art at the Museum of Modern Art. In January 2018, it was announced that more than 200 artworks, many from contemporary artists, would be donated by the collection to six institutions: the Museum of Modern Art, who will receive 90 works; the Bronx Museum of the Arts; the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid, Spain; the Museo de Arte Moderno in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the Museo de Arte de Lima in Lima, Peru; and the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas, Austin in Austin, Texas. The gifts include works by Amalia Pica (Argentina), Jac Leirner (Brazil), Luis Camnitzer (Uruguay), and Regina Jos√© Galindo (Guatemala). As part of a discussion commemorating of the start of its fifth decade collecting art, in February 2018 Cisneros announced the upcoming donation of over 100 images from the traveler artists working in Latin America collection to Wikimedia Commons.

It was one of four sculptural groups made from Echaillon marble that decorate the fa√ßade of the Opera Garnier in Paris, two to either side of the entrance at ground level. The work was installed in 1869, and widely criticised as obscene. It was attacked in August 1869 when an anonymous vandal threw black ink over it. The scandal subsided after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the original statue remained on the fa√ßade at the opera until it was transferred to the Louvre Museum in 1964 and replaced by a copy. The original was moved to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in 1986. Carpeaux was commissioned by his friend Charles Garnier to make a group based on the dance of Bacchus. The sculpture comprises several human figures, for which Carpeaux made numerous sketches over three years, using actresses and dancers from the Palais-Royale as models. At the centre of the group, a garlanded young man with wings smiles as he holds aloft a tambourine while several women dance around him. It includes sculptural groups L'Amour √† la folie. Carpeaux left out certain ideas, including a bacchante with lowered eyes (model held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York). Carpeaux completed a final model and the full-size statue in 1868, and it was unveiled at the Opera in July 1869. The unashamed nakedness of the figures, situated outdoors in full public view, provoked an immediate negative reaction, with some saying it would now be impossible for respectable women and girls to come to the Opera.J. L. Ferrier, S. Monneret, L'Aventure de l'Art au XIXe si√®cle, p. 635. The statue was attacked on the night of 27‚Äì28 August 1869, when black ink was thrown over the statue. The Opera considered moving the statue inside, but that was opposed by the corps de ballet. The scandal reached such a level Charles Gumery was commissioned to make a replacement (his gilded sculptures of L'Harmonie and La Po√©sie already crown the Opera's end pavilions). The issue was forgotten after the Franco-Prussian War broke out in July 1870, and Gumery died in Paris during the Siege of Paris. Carpeaux's work remained in place after his death in 1875, and Gumery's replacement is held by the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers. A 42-inch bronze cast reproduction of Carpeaux's Genius of the Dance, the central figure of La Danse, was acquired by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in 1983 for the museum's French galleries. Carpeaux's original sculpture was moved to the Louvre Museum in 1964 to protect it from pollution, and it was replaced on the fa√ßade of the Opera Garnier by a copy made by Jean Juge. The original was moved to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in 1986.

In the last century, Southeast Louisiana has lost a large portion of its wetlands and is expected to lose more in the coming years, with some estimates claiming wetland losses equivalent to up to 1 football field per hour. One consequence of coastal erosion is an increased vulnerability to hurricane storm surges, which affects the New Orleans metropolitan area and other communities in the region. The state has outlined a comprehensive master plan for coastal restoration and has begun to implement various restoration projects such as fresh water diversions, but certain zones will have to be prioritized and targeted for restoration efforts, as it is unlikely that all depleted wetlands can be rehabilitated. The process of coastal erosion is the result of various factors, including sea level rise, the loss of deposition of sediments to the Mississippi River delta, and the consequent permanent flooding of marshes, wetlands, and neighboring areas along the Louisiana coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Contributing factors include the blockage of traditionally occurring deposits of fresh water and silt from the river caused by man-made levees which have been built up and down most of the river over the last century, which now impede the river's ability to replenish its southernmost alluvial plains which are constantly dependent on the infusion of the river's once plentiful deposits which usually occurred during annual high stage floods in the springtime, the kind of which the river-levees now serve to buffer against for the protection of residents, livestock, and property residing in regions adjacent to the river throughout the Mississippi River valley. The deterioration results in the death of fresh and brackish water plants historically part of the ecosystem, which are not only a vital feature of the wetlands' topography, but also serve to capture silt, and thus are needed to build up and sustain marsh structures. As fresh and brackish water plant habitats recede, salt water from the Gulf of Mexico further encroaches, killing off more non-saltwater plants, thus further eroding pre-existing mud formations that these plants had once supported. Other factors exacerbating coastal erosion in Southeast Louisiana include the presence of canals and navigational routes dug through marshes and swamps, often to accommodate logistical needs of the petrochemical industry, as well as the previous practice of logging, all of which have allowed the incursion of saltwater (saline) from the Gulf into previously fresh and brackish water plant habitats.

The Dictionary of Physical Geography, Fourth Edition, Wiley Blackwell, p. 471 Sea-level rise attributed to global warming, though not a root cause, is also considered a contributing factor and future concern. Causes and factors Diorama picturing wetland loss in coastal Louisiana as attributed to human activities Coastal erosion is defined as \\"the loss of coastal lands due to the net removal of sediments or bedrock from the shoreline.\\" South Louisiana is one of the main places being affected. In 1973, Louisiana State University published ‚ÄúEnvironmental Atlas and Multi-Use Management Plan for South-Central Louisiana‚Äù analyzing the issue and possible solutions. The solutions were not implemented and the issues the report sought to fix, are still issues. Man-made levees, which were designed to protect residents and property adjacent to the river, block spring flood water that would otherwise bring fresh water and sediment to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea levels attributed to global warming have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. An extensive levee system aided by locks and dams has been developed in the waterways of the lower Mississippi River.Reuss, M. (1998). Designing the Bayous: The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin 1800‚Äì1995. Alexandria, VA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Office of History. The levees, designed to prevent flooding along the waterways, on one hand, prevent silt from draining into the river yet also from being distributed into the marshes downriver. With no new accretion and with steady subsidence, the wetlands slowly are replaced by encroaching saltwater form the Gulf. As a result of this apparent dilemma, large areas of marsh are being lost to the ocean. Since 1930 water has consumed more than 1,900 square miles (4,900 km2) of the state's land. This loss equates to the disappearance of 25 square miles (65 km2) of wetlands each year or a football-field-sized area every 30 minutes. This loss can be reversed, at least in some areas, but only with large scale restoration, including the removal of levees to allow the Mississippi River to carry silt into these areas.Turner, R. E. and Streever, B. 2002. Approaches to Coastal Wetland Restoration: Northern Gulf of Mexico. The Hague, the Netherlands: SPB Academic Publishing. Prior to the building of levees on the Mississippi River, the wetlands were kept in balance by occasional floods, which fill the area with sediment, and subsidence, the sinking of land. After the levees were built, however, flood sediment flowed directly into the Gulf of Mexico. This subsidence along with the recent sea level rise tipped the balance toward subsidence rather than marsh growth. This, along with the canals built in the area, caused decline of the wetlands and also caused less weakening of and less protection from recent hurricanes such as Hurricane Katrina. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has developed a comprehensive management plan for the eastern regions of the Louisiana coast, placing emphasis upon restoration of riverine habitats, cypress swamps and fringing marsh. This could be a model applied to other coastal regions. Subsidence may be due to other factors as well. Some observers blame the direct effects of oil and gas extraction. They contend that, as billions of barrels of oil and saltwater and as trillions of cubic feet of gas were removed from the subterranean structures in which they had accumulated over millions of years, these structures lost their ability to support the weight of the earth above. As these structures slowly collapsed, the soil above gradually subsided. The wetlands on the surface began to sink into the gulf waters. Others argue that subsidence is a natural process in deltas, as sediments compress, and that the real problem is the lack of flood waters that would normally deposit new layers of sediment.Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J. (1994). Scientific assessment of coastal wetland loss, restoration and management in Louisiana. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 20. The role of hurricanes is also a matter of disagreement; some studies show that hurricanes actually build elevation in marshes.Liu, K. and Fearn, M. L. (2000). Holocene history of catastrophic hurricane landfalls along the Gulf of Mexico coast reconstructed from coastal lake and marsh sediments. In Current Stresses and Potential Vulnerabilities: Implications of Global Change for the Gulf Coast Region of the United States, eds. Z. H. Ning and K. K. Abdollhai, pp. 38‚Äì47. Baton Rouge, LA: Franklin Press for Gulf Coast Regional Climate Change Council. A new and important factor is rising sea levels associated with global warming. In addition to subsidence is the presence of canals which were dug through the marshes and swamps to service oil and gas wells to facilitate oil and gas exploration, which have enabled salt water intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico. In similar fashion, the construction of the now-closed Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) introduced salt water into freshwater and intermediate marshes in St. Bernard Parish, which is adjacent to New Orleans, and facilitated significant erosion.\\"Closing the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet: Environmental and Economic Considerations.\\" Coastal Wetlands Planning Protection and Restoration Act. Louisiana State Government. Web. 27 Feb 2013. Another factor that damaged wetlands was large scale logging, particularly the extensive logging of cypress forests in the early 1900s. One early logger described it this way: \\"We just use the old method of going in and cutting down the swamp and tearing it up and bringing the cypress out. When a man's in here with all the heavy equipment, he might as well cut everything he can make a board foot out of; we're not ever coming back in here again\\" This logging often required construction of canals, which, once the logging was finished, allowed salt water to enter the wetlands and prevent regeneration of the cypress. As if these problems were not enough, the introduction of nutria an invasive species from South America in the 1930s provided an entirely new species of grazing mammal. Although only a few escaped, there are now millions. Natural grazing by muskrat was now accelerated by grazing from nutria. By removing plants, nutria both cause loss of vegetation, and, perhaps more seriously, a loss of dead organic matter which would otherwise accumulate as peat and raise the level of the marshKeddy, P.A. 2000. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 614 p. P. 163-165. One of the most important natural controls on nutria is large alligators, which may provide a useful tool for biological control of nutria, and therefore for reduced impacts of grazing.Keddy, P.A., L. Gough, J.A. Nyman, T. McFalls, J. Carter and J. Siegrist. 2009. Alligator hunters, pelt traders, and runaway consumption of Gulf coast marshes: A trophic cascade perspective on coastal wetland losses. p. 115-133 in B.R. Silliman, E.D. Grosholz, and M.D. Bertness (eds.) Human Impacts on Salt Marshes. A Global Perspective. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes in Southeast Louisiana, with a combined population of 209,136, are at great risk of going underwater due to coastal erosion. It is estimated with the current rate of erosion, 75 square kilometers a year, within fifty to eighty years, these areas and their surrounding parishes will be underwater. Erosion from heavy storms, climate change, and human interference with the environment contribute to erosion in South Louisiana. The Gulf of Mexico brings heavy rains and hurricanes to this region. This loosens the sediments in the marshes, and along the Mississippi River, allowing them to be carried away by the water. Human interference would be the diversion of the Mississippi river and other rivers. The diversion causes sediments to be deposited in places other than where it normally would be. = Oil company canals = The dredging of canals across the southern marshlands has long been blamed for coastal erosion. What was then the Orleans Levee Board, now the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority operating as the East and West divisions, filed a lawsuit in July 2013 against 97 oil and gas companies for damages, claiming the 50 miles of marsh swamps, with stands of cypress that buffered Gulf storms, were \\"shredded by oil industry canals\\". It was considered to be an \\"entire ecosystem tanking\\", the \\"largest ecological catastrophe in North America since the dust bowl.\\", and \\"a wetland dying\\". ‚ÄúWhen you talk about dredging those canals, yes, it now appears to have been a pretty stupid thing to do‚Äù . . . . ‚ÄúBut no one ever dreamed it would be an issue or that the coast would waste away.‚Äù ‚ÄîJohn Laborde, Founder, Tidewater Marine, 2010. This was not a new hypothesis as Percy Viosca, a Tulane graduate ultimately fired by then-Governor Long and brought back under another administration, stated ‚ÄúMan-made modifications in Louisiana wetlands, which are changing the conditions of existence from its very foundations, are the result of flood protection, deforestation, deepening channels[,] and the cutting of navigation and drainage canals.‚Äù, and concluded with ‚ÄúTime is ripe for an enormous development of the Louisiana wetlands along new and [more] intelligent lines.‚Äù, and this was in 1925.Tulane Environmental Law Journal The Reckoning: Oil and Gas Development in the Louisiana Coastal Zone (pp. 192-198)- Retrieved 2017-11-12. Note: Quotes are from pages 194 and 198 respectively. Consequences The many benefits of the wetlands found in this region were not recognized by a majority of policy makers early in the 20th century. Wetlands provide many important ecological services including, fisheries production, resting areas for migratory species, carbon storage, water filtration and enhanced disagreement over the relative importance of these factors, not to mention flood control. Southeastern Louisiana's disappearing wetlands have a broad impact ranging from cultural to economic. Commercial fishing in Louisiana accounts for more than 300 million dollars of the state's economy. More than 70% of that amount stems from species such as shrimp, oysters and blue crabs that count on the coastal wetlands as a nursery for their young. Annually Louisiana sells more than 330,000 hunting licenses and 900,000 fishing licenses to men and women who depend on the wetlands as a habitat for their game. Additional recreational activities such as boating, swimming, camping, hiking, birding, photography and painting are abundant in wetland areas. Wetlands host a variety of trees such as the bald cypress, tupelo gum and cottonwood. Other plants such as the dwarf palmetto and wax myrtle and submerged aquatic plants such as Vallisneria and Ruppia are native to Louisiana wetlands. Wetland plants act as natural filters, helping to remove heavy metals, sewage, and pesticides from polluted water before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Animal species native to these areas include osprey, anhinga, ibis, herons, egrets, manatees, alligators, and beavers. Although there are several naturally occurring forces that adversely affect the wetland regions of Louisiana, many believe it is human intervention that has caused the majority of the decline.Tidwell, Mike. The Ravaging Tide: Strange Weather, Future Katrinas, and the Coming Death of America's Coastal Cities, Free Press, 2006. As the wetlands disappear, more and more people are leaving wetland areas.Tidwell, Michael. Bayou Farewell: The Rich Life and Tragic Death of Louisiana's Cajun Coast. Vintage Departures: New York, 2003 . Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry. Another consequence of coastal erosion is the loss of sandbars off the coast of Louisiana. The sandbars off of Louisiana's coast protect Louisiana's coast from storm surges and high speed winds that come with hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past, these sandbars have helped minimize the damage to Louisiana's coast from hurricanes. However, as costal erosion continues to cause these sandbars to degrade, the damage taken by Louisiana's coastline continues to increase. Because of this loss of Louisiana's coastline, many Louisiana communities are being affected. Some communities are experiencing flooding on a much more regular basis. If this loss of coastline continues, many of these communities will have to relocate. Some communities already have completely located, uprooting everyone who lives there. Therefore, coastal erosion is having a much greater effect on Louisiana residents then many people believe. Proposed and attempted solutions There are several projects and proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, some of which have been attempted, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J. (1994). \\"Scientific assessment of coastal wetland loss, restoration and management in Louisiana\\", Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 20. One of the primary methods that has been developed are freshwater diversions, which extract water from Mississippi River at strategic locations and transport fresh water and silt from the river through aqueducts and then pump and distribute them into nearby estuaries. This process invigorates freshwater plant life and re-introduces silt into the estuaries. Freshwater diversions have not been without controversy and have encountered some opposition, primarily from oyster harvesters who believe that the current high level salinity is needed in their state-licensed zones in order to maintain healthy production. Another method of coastal restoration is the direct planting of new marsh grasses and other forms of sustainable plant life into affected areas. There is the practice of seeding, which may be turn out to be more productive than direct planting, which often entails the dropping large amounts of seeds from crop-dusters intended to grow into freshwater plants. Mangrove seeds have been tried because when grown they have the benefit of reducing marsh water salinity. Transporting already-dredged material from the Mississippi river to marshes, swamps, and barrier islands is also an option. Some have proposed the removal of river levees in certain low- populated areas to allow fresh water and silt dispersion into marshes, though this method is controversial and has yet to be attempted. The Louisiana State Coastal Restoration Authority has developed a master plan which outlines the state's strategy for achieving future coastal restoration as well as flood protection. Current Louisiana law stipulates that all oil and gas revenue royalties collected by the state go towards coastal restoration. However, under present arrangement with the Federal government Louisiana, is only able to receive a small percentage of royalties and that the rest go to the Federal government. However, starting in 2018 Louisiana will be able to receive 37.5 million dollars from all new leases, though pre-existing leases will still fall under the prior state/federal revenue sharing arrangement. Proceeds from part of the BP oil spill lawsuits and federal fines will also go towards coastal restoration. One way to combat coastal erosion is to try and plant more vegetation in Louisiana's wetlands. The roots of plants help hold soil in place and stop the soil from eroding. By adding more vegetation to the wetlands, the soil can be made more firm and less likely to erode. However, salt water intrusion is killing lots of these plants, so keeping the plants from dying can help impede the process of coastal and wetland erosion. Another way to combat coastal erosion is to create seawalls and breakwaters. Seawalls are manmade barriers that are erected to keep seawater from reaching the coast. Because the seawater is unable to reach the coast, the water is unable to erode the coastline, thus preventing coastal erosion. Breakwaters function much like seawalls, except that they are not manmade, they are made from large formations of rocks stacked near each other. They are not as effective as seawalls in stopping water from reaching the coast, however, they allow seawater to bring sediment within its barrier, but stop the retreating water from removing sediment, thus helping coastlines build up and replenish. Estimates are that the area will continue to erode, in part due to a dearth of plant nutrients. Solutions are numerous; however, governments and organizations have problems implementing them. Industry, navigation, and flood control are factors that have to be taken into account with the solutions. One of the most drastic solutions would be diverting the Mississippi river to flow into its delta. A shift in industry locations, navigation, and populations would allow the wetlands to be restored with less interference. Alternatively, increasing sustainability standards would allow the issue to be resolved quicker. Creating more ecologically friendly infrastructure in the areas would allow the marshes to grow and the soil would strengthen.

He was appointed by the governor to organize the New York State Police, newly authorized in 1917, and served as its first Superintendent. Early life, education and career Chandler was born in Clyde, New York to a Methodist minister and his wife. He lived with his family in Lockport, New York and Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Ithaca High School in Ithaca, New York. He earned a bachelor's degree at Syracuse University in 1892 and a medical degree at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1895. After setting up his practice and beginning work as a physician, Chandler befriended Charles S. Whitman, a fellow young professional with whom he shared a rooming house. They later worked together after Whitman went into politics and was elected as governor of the state. Chandler studied the violin and was considered to have some talent. In 1900, he married Martha Marie Shultze, the daughter of the founder of Syracuse University's School of Music. They had two sons, Daniel and Fehmer, before her death in 1931. Military and police career Chandler enlisted in the New York National Guard as a lieutenant. By 1916, he had been promoted to the rank of major. Chandler served with the National Guard in 1917, when his unit was called up to respond to an invasion on the southern border with Mexico related to forces in its civil war. Shortly after returning to the state from the Pancho Villa Expedition, Chandler was tapped by his friend and New York Governor Charles S. Whitman to head and organize the New York State Police. Chandler initially declined as he hoped to fight with US forces in the Great War in Europe. At the time, former president Theodore Roosevelt was raising a division to join the war effort. After Roosevelt promised Chandler that he would request him for his division, he accepted the state post. But Roosevelt failed a physical examination, as he was older than most officers, and the United States government declined to accept the Roosevelt division for duty. Following the collapse of the arrangement with Roosevelt, Chandler proceeded to work on establishing a state police force. He visited and studied the Pennsylvania State Police and the Canadian Royal Northwest Mounted Police in Ottawa. Uncomfortable with the political pressures of his position, Chandler later resigned. In late 1918, he left New York to serve with the U.S. Army Medical Corps at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia. He returned to his post as Superintendent in 1919, following Governor Whitman's refusal to accept his resignation. As Superintendent, Chandler was involved at every level of the state police and his influence on the organization was long-lasting. He recruited his first troops by attracting men from the New York National Guard. Chandler coined the term \\"New York State Trooper.\\" Contrary to the norms of the time, he required that troopers carry their weapons exposed on the outside of their uniforms. More positively, he instituted rigorous processes for screening, training, and education of the force. Chandler also established the New York State School for Police, which emphasized legal training. This became a standard for police forces in the United States. Retirement On December 1, 1923, Chandler retired from the state police. He established a surgical practice in Kingston, New York. He also served on New York's State Crime Commission in the governments of Alfred E. Smith and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He died in 1964 at the age of 91.

Roger Penrose defined the notion of closed trapped surfaces in 1965. A trapped surface is one where light is not moving away from the black hole. The boundary of the union of all trapped surfaces around a black hole is called an apparent horizon. A related term trapped null surface is often used interchangeably. However, when discussing causal horizons, trapped null surfaces are defined as only null vector fields giving rise to null surfaces. But marginally trapped surfaces may be spacelike, timelike or null. Definition They are spacelike surfaces (topological spheres, tubes, etc.) with restricted bounds, their area tending to decrease locally along any possible future direction and with a dual definition with respect to the past. The trapped surface is a spacelike surface of co-dimension 2, in a Lorentzian spacetime. It follows that any normal vector can be expressed as a linear combination of two future directed null vectors, normalised by: k+ ¬∑ k‚àí = ‚àí2 The k+ vector is directed ‚Äúoutwards‚Äù and k‚àí ‚Äúinwards‚Äù. The set of all such vectors engenders one outgoing and one ingoing null congruence. The surface is designated trapped if the cross sections of both congruences decrease in area as they exit the surface; and this is apparent in the mean curvature vector, which is: H…ë= ‚àíŒ∏+k‚àí…ë ‚àí Œ∏‚àík+…ë The surface is trapped if both the null expansions Œ∏¬± are negative, signifying that the mean curvature vector is timelike and future directed. The surface is marginally trapped if the outer expansion Œ∏+ = 0 and the inner expansion Œ∏‚àí ‚â§ 0. Trapped null surface A trapped null surface is a set of points defined in the context of general relativity as a closed surface on which outward- pointing light rays are actually converging (moving inwards). Trapped null surfaces are used in the definition of the apparent horizon which typically surrounds a black hole. =Definition= We take a (compact, orientable, spacelike) surface, and find its outward pointing normal vectors. The basic picture to think of here is a ball with pins sticking out of it; the pins are the normal vectors. Now we look at light rays that are directed outward, along these normal vectors. The rays will either be diverging (the usual case one would expect) or converging. Intuitively, if the light rays are converging, this means that the light is moving backwards inside of the ball. If all the rays around the entire surface are converging, we say that there is a trapped null surface. More formally, if every null congruence orthogonal to a spacelike two-surface has negative expansion, then such surface is said to be trapped.

He was the father of American recording artists Marvin Gaye and Frankie Gaye and gained notoriety after shooting and killing Marvin on April 1, 1984, following an argument at their home. Early life Gay was born the first of 13 children to George and Mamie Gay on October 1, 1914 on a farm along Catnip Hill Pike in Jessamine County, Kentucky and was raised in Lexington. He had a troubled childhood, where his physically abusive father would often beat his mother and Marvin and his five siblings. According to Gay's wife, Alberta, Gay's family life consisted of constant violence involving domestic abuse and shootings. \\"Gays against Gays\\", she told author David Ritz. When Gay was still a child, he and his mother joined the Pentecostal church, the House of God. Gay moved to Washington, D.C. in his late teens to pursue a career as a minister of a House of God church there. Marriage and family While in Washington, Gay met his future wife, Alberta Cooper, whom he would marry on July 2, 1935. The couple bought a small house in south eastern Washington D.C. at 1617 First Street, which was only a few blocks away from the Anacostia River. The street would be nicknamed \\"Simple City\\" for its being \\"half-city, half-country\\". Alberta already had a son named Michael, but believing he couldn't raise another man's son, Gay sent Michael to live with his sister-in-law, Pearl. Two years after marrying, they had their first child, a daughter they named Jeanne. On April 2, 1939, their first son, Marvin Jr. was born. Son Frankie (born Frances) and daughter Zeola followed shortly afterwards. In 1970, Gay fathered a son named Antwaun Carey with another woman as a result of one of his extramarital affairs. Ministry work On one of his first missions as preacher at a church in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Gay impressed the congregation, and his church later made him Bishop. According to his son Marvin, his father was known as a healer. Gay eventually settled as a minister of a local House of God church. When his son was around four or five, his father brought him to church congregations and revivals to sing for audiences. According to Marvin Gaye's relatives, the elder Marvin Gay was a passable self-taught piano player. He bought a secondhand piano at a rummage sale and coached his son in piano lessons, which the younger Marvin Gay learned by ear, and it was one of the few stable times in the father and son's relationship. Marvin Sr. nurtured Marvin Jr.'s musical talents, so long as he stuck with liturgical music. However, by the late 1940s, Gay had left the House of God to join another sect called the House of the Living God, but soon returned to the House of God to head its Board of Apostles in the early 1950s. Gay left the House of God altogether in the mid-1950s after not being named Chief Apostle of the church and according to his son, \\"that's when my father lost his healing powers\\". Personal life =Marriage, family life and relationship with Marvin Gaye= In most accounts, Gay was described as a strict and sometimes overbearing father to his four children. According to his children, Gay would make them observe an extended Sabbath, which was every Saturday. Gay was against the Christian tradition of attending church Sunday, accusing them of going against observing God on \\"Lord's Day\\", which he contended was Saturdays. According to Gay's sister, Jeanne, he was someone who never \\"spared the rod, he was very, very strict\\" in reference to the saying \\"spare the rod, spoil the child\\".What's Going On: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye, 2006 Gay also would question his children on Biblical passages, administering beatings if they answered wrong. All four of Gay's children had problems with bed wetting, which led to more beatings. Gay administered most of his harshest punishments on Marvin Jr. According to Marvin's sister, Jeanne, from the age of seven well into his teenage years, Marvin's life consisted of \\"brutal whippings\\" since Gay Sr. would strike him for any shortcoming, including putting his hair brush in the wrong place or coming home from school a minute late. Marvin would state later, \\"living with Father was like living with a king, an all-cruel, changeable, cruel and all-powerful king\\". He further stated to David Ritz, \\"if it wasn't for Mother, who was always there to console me and praise me for my singing, I think I would have been one of those child suicides you read about in the papers.\\" Alberta Gay later stated that her husband hated Marvin, as she told David Ritz in 1979: Conversely, Gay said this about Marvin Jr., According to Jeanne Gay, her father never held a job for longer than three years. Gay worked briefly in the post office and at Western Union, but a back injury laid him off early and when explaining why he left the latter job, Gay stated to Ritz that people were working on the \\"day of the Sabbath\\". Eventually, Gay withdrew from social life, developing alcoholism and was involved in cross- dressing, which humiliated his son who, at the age of twelve, spied on his father dressing in his mother's clothes. Due to this difficulty, Gay's wife provided for most of the family's income working as a domestic worker. As Marvin grew older, his relationship with his father worsened and Gay often threw his son out for allegations of misbehavior. Neighbors of the Gay family, as well as other students at school, according to Frankie Gaye, often teased them for their name, their father's manner and religion. Gay's sons often found themselves having to confront the neighbors, vocally defending their father and their religion. According to Alberta, Gay began to drink heavily in the 1950s, only furthering the friction in his relationship with Marvin and \\"he never did develop any love for the boy.\\" As a teenager, Marvin Jr. attempted to leave home for good following one big fight by enlisting in the US Air Force; a move which the younger Gay later admitted was a bad idea, as he found himself under superiors who had similar authoritarian leanings as his father. Following Marvin's musical career beginnings, he refused to be in the same room with his father for a number of years. This decision led to Marvin adding an \\"e\\" to his final name, which, it was stated, was done to quiet any rumors of his own sexual orientation, to emulate his idol Sam Cooke who had also used a stage name of a silent \\"E\\"; and to add more distance from his father. =Son's fame and relocation to Los Angeles= After Marvin had found musical stardom at Motown, he purchased a house on the corner of Fifteenth and Varnum in a black middle-class section of Washington, D.C. and moved his parents out of the projects and into the new house, where the couple would reside until the early 1970s. Alberta finally stopped working, so that she could enjoy the security of owning a house, and the new residence was roomy and spacious with large outside porches, but Marvin didn't visit often due to his strained relationship with his father. By 1968, however, Marvin extended an olive branch, giving his father a Cadillac as a present, but he said his father's response was not affecting. Four years later, Marvin reunited with his parents in Washington, D.C. after the city honored Gaye with a day in his honor called Marvin Gaye Day; a day, Marvin later said, on which he felt he had made his father \\"proud\\". In 1974, dressed in a female wig and clothing, Gay appeared on his son's Midnight Special episode. In 1973, Marvin Jr. bought his parents a neo-Tudor house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles; after moving them to California. By this time, Gay, a longtime alcoholic, had proven to be too difficult to continue his ministry and his marriage to Alberta would grow more contentious with his drinking. By the early 1980s, Gay's marriage to Alberta had deteriorated and according to his wife in 1984, the couple hadn't shared the same bed in nearly ten years and as a result, they were now sleeping in separate bedrooms. =Fatal shooting of Marvin Gaye= In October 1983, after months in Washington, D.C., Marvin returned to the West Adams home located at Gramercy Place. Gay Sr. often told his children \\"I brought you into this world, I can take you out\\". On Christmas Day 1983 Marvin gave his father an unregistered .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol to protect him from intruders and murderers after the younger Gay, heavily addicted to cocaine, felt someone was seriously plotting to kill him. The elder Gay kept the gun because he felt \\"protected\\". On March 31, 1984, Gay Sr. was angry because he could not locate a missing insurance policy document and he accused Alberta of misplacing the letter. Marvin awoke from his sleep and commanded his father to leave Alberta alone; however, neither father nor son physically attacked each other that night. Around 12:30 pm (PST) on April 1, 1984, Gay Sr. began arguing with Alberta again over the missing insurance letter. After he was heard yelling from downstairs, his son, dressed in his maroon robe, shouted downstairs if he wanted to talk to his mother to do it in person. When Gay Sr. initially refused, Marvin threatened him to not enter his room, according to interviews from Alberta, the only other witness to the shooting. When he did enter, his son, angry, despondent, and heavily intoxicated, shoved his father into the hallway, then hit him. The fight continued in Marvin's bedroom where Marvin reportedly struck his father and kicked and punched him severely. Alberta successfully separated the men and convinced Marvin to leave the room. At approximately 12:38 p.m. (PST), minutes after returning to his bedroom, Gay Sr. came back to the bedroom with the .38 pistol and shot his son. The bullet penetrated Marvin's vital organs, including his heart. Gay Sr. then walked forward and shot him a second time in the shoulder at point-blank range. According to his daughter-in-law, Irene, Gay Sr. hid the gun in his bedroom pillow, and she later retrieved it for the police.Final 24: Marvin Gaye, Discovery Channel, 2006 He then went outside and sat on the front porch and awaited his arrest, which came after police discovered Marvin's body and confirmed that Gay Sr. had shot his son. Marvin Gaye Jr.'s body was later taken to California Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 1:01 pm PST. During his first police interview, Gay Sr. stated that he didn't mean to kill his son, but that he had been scared that he would be hurt and only shot him in self-defense. When the police asked him if he loved his son, Gay Sr. softly told them, \\"let's say I didn't dislike him.\\" The former minister was promptly charged with first-degree murder for his son's death. =Aftermath, divorce from wife, final years and death= After being taken to the Los Angeles County Jail, Gay Sr. was held on a $100,000 bail. The bail was eventually reduced to $30,000, and Gay's estranged wife Alberta posted the bond via a bondsman. Aware of Gay's failing health, doctors examined him in May and discovered a benign walnut-sized brain tumor in his pituitary gland. The brain tumor would later play a factor in preliminary hearings of the trial against him, with his lawyers stating that the tumor might have played a part in Gay shooting his son. However, the judge in the case reasoned that Gay was competent to stand trial and that he knew what he had done. After results of Marvin's autopsy showed that he had traces of cocaine and PCP in his system taken days surrounding his death but not active in his system and pictures of Gay taken after he was brought into custody showing injuries, from his final fight with his son, Judge Gordon Ringer agreed to let Gay enter a plea bargain. Gay pleaded no contest to a charge of voluntary manslaughter on September 20, 1984. During the sentencing hearing two months later on November 20, Gay was allowed to talk. A tearful Gay, 70, told the court: Following this, Gay was given a six-year suspended sentence and five years of probation for the shooting. He was also prohibited from owning any firearms or alcohol for the remainder of his life. During this time, Alberta Gay had filed for divorce after 49 years of marriage. Gay eventually returned briefly to the Gramercy Place residence, but health issues forced him to move to a nursing home, first in Inglewood around 1986, and in the final years of his life, to a nursing home in Culver City, California, where he died of pneumonia on October 10, 1998, nine days after his 84th birthday.

Early years Frances \\"Frankie\\" Gaye was born in Washington, D.C., the third of four children born to Alberta Williams and Marvin Gay, Sr. in 1941. Both Frankie and elder brother Marvin sang, first in church and then with local doo-wop groups. War service Frankie had several jobs in Washington, D.C. before answering the draft to serve his country during the Vietnam War at 25; he served as a radio disk jockey in the army. In 1970, Frankie returned to civilian life in D.C. Emotional conversations between Frankie and Marvin over Frankie's horrific recollections of the war led to Marvin to compose the song \\"What's Happening, Brother\\", later issued for Marvin's album, What's Going On, released in 1971. Music career and Marvin's death Starting in the mid-1970s, Frankie began working with his brother, joining him on the road during Gaye's concert tours and sometimes, to test audience reactions, Marvin would place Frankie onstage first before he arrived. Like his brother and, later, their sister Zeola, Frankie added an \\"e\\" to his surname. In 1977, Frankie participated in background vocals for Marvin's hit, \\"Got to Give It Up, Pt. 1\\" and contributed co-composition rights for music for the 1979 film, Penitentiary. Frankie and his second wife (later widow), Irene, were next door to his parents' house on April 1, 1984, when Frankie's brother was shot and killed by their father after an argument. In 1989, Frankie signed with Motorcity Records and recorded two singles, \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and \\"My Brother\\". The latter song featured in the 1990 album of the same name. Final years and death In 1999, Frankie worked on his memoirs, Marvin Gaye: My Brother. The book was scheduled to be released in 2002, but Frankie died of complications following a heart attack on December 30, 2001 at the age of 60; The book was posthumously released in 2003.

McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. Personal life In 1972, Frankie relocated to Los Angeles where he married his first wife, Judy Tench; the couple had two daughters, Christy and Denise. After their divorce, Frankie dated Irene Duncan after meeting her in London. They were married in 1978 and had three children: daughters April (b. 1983) and Fiona (b. 1993); and son Frankie, Jr. (b. 1992).

Belgrade: Mladost, 1975 He was posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero. Early life Sadiku was born in 1915 in Peƒá/Pej√´ into an ethnic Albanian family. He completed elementary and high school in the city and then enrolled in the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. Even as a student in the Peƒá high school, he was a member of the Revolutionary Youth Organization. In 1931, he was one of the co-founders of a sports club named Future in which revolutionary youth gathered. Since the club was quickly shut down, Ramiz was arrested and spent time in prison. He became a member of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) in 1933 and a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ) in 1936. Soon thereafter he became a bureau member of the SKJ District Committee for Kosovo and Metohija. Pre- Second World War In 1938, Sadiku requested to Kosovo students, SKOJ members and other SKJ District Committee for Kosovo and Metohija members that they publish a decree demanding the \\"national equality of Albanians.\\" This decree to the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia demanded that the \\"emigration of Albanians be stopped and that their property stops being ceased.\\" Ramiz and 68 other Communists took part in writing this decree and the decree made widespread headlines (it was also sent to the League of Nations in Geneva.Vojna enciklopedija (eighth edition). Belgrade: 1974 Second World War In 1939, Albania was occupied by Italy. The SKJ District Committee for Kosovo and Metohija organized gatherings in the region that tried to explain the political reasons why Albania has been occupied by fascist soldiers. They also published pamphlets in the Albanian language. The police in Peƒá got hold of ten of these pamphlets and organized widespread arrests and Sadiku was one of the people arrested. Sadiku spent two months in the infamous ≈†erehmet kula in Peƒá and was then transferred to the prison on Ada Ciganlija. He was later returned to Peƒá where a trial began. The prosecutor sought a death sentence but since Sadiku's guilt could not be proven, he was freed. Immediately afterwards, Sadiku had to stop attending law school (in his third year) and join the army. Sadiku and Boro Vukmiroviƒá in 1943 When the Invasion of Yugoslavia occurred in 1941, Sadiku was serving his army time in the 42nd Infantry Regiment in Bjelovar. After severe battles that his battalion had in Daruvar with the Germans, Sadiku was captured and taken to the city assembly camp. With the help of the local Bjelovar communists, Sadiku managed to escape from prison and return to Peƒá. Upon returning to his birth city, Ramiz had to live as an illegal in fear of being recognized as a known Communist and being arrested by the Italian police. Although being in hiding, he still actively worked in the bureau of the SKJ District Committee for the region. At the beginning of the occupation, Sadiku had to practically work alone in leading the District Committee as many of the organizers had transferred to Montenegro. In July 1942, Sadiku was arrested at a party meeting in Peƒá and again was led to the ≈†erehmet kula prison. Even after being tortured, Sadiku didn't give up any party secrets and was transferred to the prison in Tirana in September of that same year. With help from Albanian communists, he managed to escape from the prison and illegally return to Kosovo.Majke heroja priƒçaju. Vinkovci: Iskra, 1985 In April 1943, Sadiku was in ƒêakovica/Gjakova along with Boro Vukmiroviƒá. At that time CK KPJ member Tempo Vukmanoviƒá left for Prizren. Ramiz and Boro had agreed to meet him there. On April 7, 1943 en route to Prizren in the village of Landovica, Ramiz and Boro were captured after being wounded in battles with Italian fascists and Albanian fascists known as the Balli Komb√´tar. Knowing that they are high-ranking members of the Yugoslav Partisans, the Balli Komb√´tar members tried to get information on other Partisans from them by torturing them. As Vukmiroviƒá and Sadiku didn't want to inform, it was decided that they were to be executed. On being demanded that they are to be executed individually, they put their arms around one another and shouted slogans supporting the Partisan cause and were executed together (on April 10, 1943). Legacy On March 6, 1945 by decree of the presidency of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia, Sadiku and Vukmiroviƒá were posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero and were among the first to be recipients.

In the years after the Second World War, Boro and Ramiz became a symbol of Brotherhood and Unity of the Serbian and Albanian people and of the anti-fascist struggle in Kosovo and Metohija. Numerous streets and schools bore their name along with the sports centre in Pri≈°tina. Football club KF Ramiz Sadiku is named after Sadiku. In 1963 on the twenty-year anniversary of their execution, a monument was made in the form of an obelisk with a mosaic and a memorial fountain and it was erected in Landovica in the spot they were executed.

Chris Garcia (born April 15, 1940) is an educator, scholar, researcher, author, public opinion pollster and higher education administrator. From 2002-2003, he served as the president of University of New Mexico. Garcia was the first native New Mexican Hispanic to serve as a college dean, academic vice-president and president at the University of New Mexico. Early life and education Garcia was born April 15, 1940 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was the first of six children born to Flaviano Perea Garcia and Crucita A. Garcia. His christened name was Flaviano Cresencio Garcia. Garcia was baptized at San Ignacio Church in Martineztown, an Albuquerque neighborhood, where his father was raised. Garcia is a 13th generation native New Mexican, descended from Juan Lopez Holguin, who came from the Extremadura community of Spain with the Juan de O√±ate expedition to settle in the Santa Fe, New Mexico area in 1598. His tenth grandfather, Francisco Montez Vigil was a member of the Diego de Vargas group that re-entered Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1692. Garcia first attended St. Francis Catholic Xavier School on south Broadway, close to his maternal grandmother's home where he spent the first seven years of his life. In 1947, his family moved to the north valley of Albuquerque. He graduated from Valley High School in 1957. A few days after graduating from high school, Garcia joined the New Mexico Air National Guard (NMANG) and went to eleven weeks of basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. He served a six-year term in the NMANG. After completing basic training, Garcia matriculated at the University of New Mexico. He was a charter member of the initial General Honors Program. As Garcia proceeded through college, his interest in human behavior channeled him toward the social sciences, and he majored in Government and Citizenship, earning a BA in 1961. Interested in education and teaching from an early age, he hoped to become a high school teacher and continued at UNM to earn a master's degree in Government and Education with a Secondary Education certificate. After doing student teaching at his alma mater high school, Garcia was encouraged to continue his education so that he could teach at the college level. Garcia was accepted at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and began his studies in political science there in 1964. Later, he transferred to the newly instituted doctoral program in political science at the University of California at Davis (UCD) where he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1972. Beginning: A family and career On September 2, 1967, Garcia married Sandra Dorine Galloway, also an Albuquerque native and a graduate of Valley High school and the University of New Mexico.\\"Weddings Unite Four Couples: Galloway-Garcia,\\" ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Albuquerque Tribune‚Äô‚Äô, Albuquerque, 18 September 1967. Since Garcia had obtained a faculty position in the Political Science department at the University of New Mexicoin the fall of 1970, he and his wife moved back to Albuquerque in the summer of 1970. Garcia began his academic career while completing his doctoral dissertation on the development of political orientations of Mexican American children in California. He was hired as an Assistant Professor of Political Science to teach courses in American Politics, Public Opinion, Political Socialization and New Mexico Government. Garcia also originated and taught courses in Politics and Education, The Politics of Ethnic Groups and Chicano Politics.‚ÄùUNM Names Garcia as Professor,‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Albuquerque Tribune‚Äô‚Äô, Albuquerque, 2 April 1970 Garcia initially also had an appointment as an Assistant Director at the Division of Government Research in the Institute of Social Research and Development (ISRAD).

Based on his continued scholarship he was promoted to Full Professor in 1978. He is one of the pioneers researching and writing in the field of Hispanic/Latino politics. His recognition as a scholar in this area as well as in campaigns, elections and New Mexico politics led to his being sought out for commentary and analysis by local, national and international media. After many years as a productive scholar, his accomplishments as a teacher, researcher and scholar were recognized as he was awarded the title of Distinguished Professor of Political Science. He retired from full-time teaching in 2007, but continued with his scholarly writings and taught a course in US Political Cultures on a part-time basis until 2011.

She taught at Wellesley College and the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture before going on to become Dean of Women Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Early life and education Born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on May 20, 1862, Mabel Keyes Babcock was the daughter of botanist Henry H. Babcock and Mary Porter (Keyes) Babcock. She was a descendant of William Bradford, the governor of Plymouth Colony. Both of her parents were involved in education: Henry was for a time the principal of Somerville High School in Massachusetts, while Mary, after Henry died, became the headmistress of Kenilworth Hall, a girls' school in the Chicago area. Babcock got her undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in 1889. Twenty years later she resumed her education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which she received a B.S. degree in 1908 followed by an M.S. in architecture in 1909. At MIT, she had studied with Guy Lowell. Career From 1910 to 1914, Babcock taught horticulture and landscape architecture at Wellesley College while also maintaining a solo landscape architecture practice. She spent World War I as a conservation instructor and director of agricultural courses at the recently founded Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts. During the war, she also served on the central committee of the MIT War Service Auxiliary. She went on to serve as the president of the MIT Women's Association from 1916 to 1920, an appointment that eventually led to her taking up the post of Dean of Women Students at MIT. As a landscape architect, Babcock may be best known for her landscaping of the Arlington Street Church and her design of the MIT President's Garden and Great Court (now Killian Court), where her work expanded on that of Elizabeth Greenleaf Pattee. Babcock planned a French-style gravel-covered court centered on a large statue of Minerva. However, when increasing traffic along Massachusetts Avenune shifted the campus's de facto entrance, the great- court design was replaced with streetside plantings of privet, oak and maple trees, and other plantings that would create a transition from the busy streets surrounding the campus to a quieter oasis within. MIT had only moved to its current location in 1916, and Babcock went on to become involved in the landscape design of the entire campus. Babcock served as a technical adviser on the landscape program at Bates College in Maine and designed several areas of the campus. She also did landscape design for a number of private clients in Maine. It is possible that she may have been involved in landscaping the campus of Wellesley College. She was a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects and the Boston Society of Landscape Architects. She was also a member of President Herbert Hoover's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. Babcock died in Boston on December 3, 1931.

Brod became interested in the men's movement in the mid-1960s, as he thought about society's expectations of individuals based on their gender. About 1980, while working on his doctorate at the University of California, San Diego, Brod attended a weekend retreat called the California Men's Gathering. While eating breakfast, he witnessed an argument between two men. One man complained that the discussions were not sufficiently focused on women's issues. The other man said the retreat was about men's emotional and personal needs, and that men should not feel guilty about their power and position in society. After listening to the arguments, Brod decided to devote much of his life to \\"showing people that damage to men's psyches is the result of the power we have over everyone else.\\" Kenyon College Brod was hired as interim director of the new Women‚Äôs and Gender Studies Department at Kenyon College in the early 1990s.

It is half a degree from the faint IC 447 reflection nebula. HD 259431 is seen against NGC 2247, a small reflection nebula and star-forming region. It has been considered to be the illuminating source for the nebula, although it is uncertain if they are at the same distance. The Hipparcos annual parallax gives a distance of 170 parsecs while NGC 2247 is thought to be at about 800 parsecs, although both distances are somewhat uncertain. Many of its properties have been calculated assuming a distance of 800 parsecs, which means they are also highly uncertain. Properties Illustration of cross- section of protoplanetary disk around MWC 147 HD 259431 is classed as a Herbig Haro Be star and has been instrumental in helping astronomers understand the formation of stars. A large star, with a large surrounding dust cloud, MWC 147 has given astronomers a clear picture of the mechanics of the accretion processes that form stars. Star MWC 147 was observed in the near and mid- infrared. The near-infrared studies showed dust matter at a temperature of several thousand kelvins in the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disk. In the mid-IR were lower temperatures. These observations showed that the disk around the star disk extends over 100 AU. The resulting research model assumes that the star increasing in mass at a rate 7 solar masses per year, or the equivalent of about two Earth masses per year. MWC has a mass of 6.6 and is younger than 500 000 years. This means that the life of this star is expected to be only about 35 million years.

Life and career William Alexander Foster was born in Toronto in the Province of Canada on 16 July 1840 to James and Mary ( Morrison) Foster, who had emigrated to Canada from Ireland. Foster's father worked as a hardware merchant on Toronto's King Street. Foster received his education at the Toronto Academy and earned a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Toronto in 1860, after which he articled with Adam Wilson and was called to the bar in 1861. He was a member of several legal partnerships, such as Harrison, Osler and Moss, and served on the University of Toronto senate. As a writer Foster contributed to Canadian periodicals such as the Daily Telegraph, the Canadian Monthly and National Review, The Grumbler, and wrote scathing editorials in J. W. Bengough's humorous Grip, where his stance against Oliver Mowat's Ontario Liberal Party provided a balance to Bengough's position. Foster also contributed to British publications such as The Times and the Westminster Review. In 1867 he co-founded and edited the Monetary Times. Foster wrote extensively on the conditions of the British North America that he believed conducive to Canadian Confederation which he believed would produce a nation he believed would thrive despite the dissipation of the British Empire's influence in the face of the growth of power of the United States. He co- organized the Canada First movement in Ottawa in 1868. the movement promoted ideals of plurality, Canadian national self-interest, political purity, and equality within the British Empire. The group idolized the conceptions of Canadian Confederation espoused by Thomas D'Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation. The group opposed Louis Riel and the M√©tis resistance to joining Confederation that resulted in the Red River Rebellion in 1869‚Äì70; Foster may have authored the editorials in the Daily Telegraph that announced the execution of Thomas Scott by Riel's government and incited calls for retribution against the \\"dirty, ignorant, miserable half-breeds \\". Treaty of Washington of 1871 threatened Canada's interests and Foster responded with a pamphlet titled Canada First; or, our new nationality in which he argued for equality amongst the nations within the British Empire. To this end he called for Canadians to demonstrate patriotism for their new country to replace the old colonial mentality. He believed that the geographical and political commonalities of Canadians would result over time in a consciousness of Canadians as \\"northmen of the New World\\" despite the ethnic and linguistic diversity of the nation. The volume inaugurated a series of such nationalist books that continued with Nicholas Flood Davin's British Versus American Civilization in 1873. As the Pacific Scandal unravelled, the Canada First movement tried to promote a new party with nationalist ideals called. In December 1873 the group wanted to promote Goldwin Smith as the party's first candidate in the Toronto West riding, but he was in England and the group promoted Foster's law partner and successful Liberal candidate Thomas Moss instead. Thereafter Foster formally co-organized the party as the Canadian National Association whose 11-point manifesto Foster wrote and which had its own journal, The Nation. The party met for the first time on 6 January 1874 and promoted trade protectionism, the secret ballot, and other reforms. The Canada First movement ceased in 1876 and Foster returned to his law practice. He married John George Bowes' daughter Margaret in 1877 and the couple had two children: daughter Margaret Ethel and son Harold William Alexander. Foster was appointed to the Queen's Counsel on 26 October 1885. He died in Toronto on 1 November 1888. Goldwin Smith eulogized him as \\"animating spirit\\" in the young nation.

But when the marriage failed and she separated from her husband in 1924, she needed to support her children; jobs in London did not pay very well, so she decided to move her family to Toronto, where she believed she could find more lucrative opportunities for employment. Radio career Gray's radio career began in October 1924.Gerry Barker. \\"In Town and Out.\\" Toronto Star, October 31, 1963, p. 31. Some sources have stated, erroneously, that she was Canada's first female broadcaster;Eva-Lis Wuorio. \\"Jane Gray: Radio's First Lady.\\" Maclean's magazine, April 1, 1951, p. 10 but researcher Peggy Stewart, in her 2012 book Radio Ladies: Canada's Women on the Air 1922-1975, tells the stories of women who were on the air as early as 1922, including Mary Conquest of CFAC in Calgary and Elizabeth MacAdam of CKMC in Cobalt. But there is no denying that Gray was one of Canada's early women announcers, and she went on to have one of the longest careers of any female broadcaster, a career that lasted for more than five decades.\\"Broadcaster Had Fifty-Five Year Career.\\" Toronto Globe & Mail, March 22, 1984, p. E3. Her radio career had begun when she joined station CJGC in London, Ontario; she hosted a program where she read poetry. She also gave advice to the listeners; by some accounts, this was the first advice program on Canadian radio. At that time, she did not use the name \\"Jane Gray\\"‚Äîshe used her actual name, Elsie Gray. But she met a numerologist who told her that the combination of letters in her name was unlucky; she decided to select a different and shorter name, and chose \\"Jane Gray.\\"Eva-Lis Wuorio. \\"Jane Gray: Radio's First Lady.\\" Maclean's magazine, April 1, 1951, p. 47. By 1927, Gray was living in Toronto, where she was hired by CFRB and then CFCA. She also continued her advice show on radio stations in Toronto. She developed a strategy for making money, even in radio's early years when few stations were financially successful: would pay for airtime on a radio station, and then sell commercials on the shows she hosted; her programs were popular, and she quickly began making a profit. By 1928, she had also founded an acting troupe, the Jane Gray Players, which performed both short and long form radio drama. Some of the first presentations she produced were half-hour mystery plays, over Toronto station CFCA, owned at that time by the Toronto Star. She was then hired by CKNC in Toronto. One day, she needed a ride to work and couldn't find a taxi. A young man was driving by and she flagged him down and asked if he would take her to the radio station. He did, and to show her gratitude, she offered him a chance to take part in her radio show as one of the Jane Gray Players. That young man was Ken Soble, who would go on to become a major force in Canadian broadcasting.Arnold Burner. \\"Ken Soble-- Good Guy? Bad Guy?\\" Toronto Star, August 29, 1964, p. 8. Success By this time, Gray had started to make a name for herself. She not only wrote, produced, and acted in radio plays, but she also held drama school classes on Saturday mornings. In addition to becoming popular with women radio listeners, Gray also began writing a column for housewives in the Toronto Globe & Mail. During the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, her column, which was called the Home Forum, provided advice. She also shared recipes that readers sent in, or offered homemaking tips. And she let her readers know about what her own children were doing.Jane Gray. \\"The Home Forum: Fan Mail.\\" Toronto Globe & Mail, October 29, 1937, p. 11. On radio and in print, she became known for trying to solve the problems of her audience: people would write to her about family tragedies, illnesses, financial problems, and if she couldn't solve the problem herself, she would use her programs or her column to let others know and try to find solutions that way. In fact, her newspaper promoted her problem-solving abilities in regular advertisements: readers and radio listeners were encouraged to write to her for guidance, because she \\"has shown the way to happiness... to thousands of men and women.\\" Advertisement for Jane Grey's radio show.

She also developed a successful side-business as an astrologer and numerologist. Ads placed in newspapers in every city in which she appeared referred to her as \\"The Wise Little Lady of the Air,\\" speaking of her \\"common sense advice and sound philosophy.\\" Later years In the early 1940s, she took a brief hiatus from broadcasting to care for her son Buddy, who was living in Calgary and had become gravely ill; he died of cancer at age 20, in 1942.Gary Lautens. \\"A Grande Dame Without Sophistication.\\" Toronto Star, November 21, 1963, p. 31.

It is an aspect of psychology adhering to the religion of Christianity and its teachings of Jesus Christ to explain the human mind and behavior. Christian psychology is a term typically used in reference to Protestant Christian psychotherapists who strive to fully embrace both their religious beliefs and their psychological training in their professional practice. However, a practitioner in Christian psychology would not accept all psychological ideas, especially those that contradicted or defied the existence of God and the scriptures of the Bible. In the United States, American Psychological Association approved courses in Christian psychology are available at undergraduate and graduate levels based on applied science, Christian philosophy and a Christian understanding of psychology. In modern psychological practices, Christianity is incorporated through various therapies. The main choice of practice is Christian counseling. It allows aspects of psychology, such as emotion, to be partially explained by Christian beliefs. The understanding of the human mind is thought of as both psychological and spiritual.Roberts, R. C. (2012). The Idea of a Christian Psychology. Journal of Psychology & Theology, 40(1), 37-43. G. C. Dilsaver is considered \\"the father of Christian psychology\\" according to the Catholic University of America,http://cuapress.cua.edu/books/viewbook.cfm?book=XDID ; The Catholic University of America Press, 620 Michigan Ave., N.E., 240 Leahy Hall, Washington, DC 20064 but the authors of Psychology and the Church: Critical Questions/Crucial Answers suggest that Norman Vincent Peale pioneered the merger of the two fields. Clyde M. Narramore had a major impact on the field of Christian psychology. He was the founding president of the Rosemead School of Psychology, now affiliated with Biola University., and which has published the Journal of Psychology & Theology since 1973. The Russian Journal Konsultativnaya Psikhologiya i Psikhoterapiya publishes a special issue on Christian Psychology every year.  History  Religious and science scholars have often clashed over the idea of the two subjects being combined, making Christian psychology no stranger to controversy. Christianity has affected the field of psychology throughout history and has influenced the beliefs and works of famous psychologists. In 17th-century Europe, aspects of psychology were thought to go against Christian teachings. For example important figures such as Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz have delayed or altered their ideas to match culturally acceptable beliefs at the time. This is because the publication of psychological theories that went against Christian teachings often resulted in punishment. The Enlightenment is a time period in which several groundbreaking ideas, including those of science and religion were introduced in Western society. Ideas geared toward the Catholic Church teachings were challenged. One scholar describes the shift in ideas during the Enlightenment as gradual and subtle, rather than sudden.Byrne, J.M.(1996). Religion and the Enlightenment: From Descartes to Kant. Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press. Several philosophers contributed to the introduction of scientific ideas that clashed against religion at the time. One early contributor was a French philosopher, Rene Descartes. He reinforced an Aristotelian concept explaining the human mind that fit teachings of the Church‚Äîthe idea of a soul. As time progressed, so did the existence and presence of once ‚Äúradical‚Äù ideas. The question on the human ability to fully comprehend the existence of God was introduced by Pascal. Other philosophers, such as John Locke, brought on the concept of deism. Major ideas that influenced psychology and religion at the time were the rejection of ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù, acceptance of personal morality without religion, and an emphasis on the individual conscience. However, while this time period brought on many radical ideas that contradicted ideas of the church, that is not to say they were completely rejected. Ideas such as atheism and deism were continued to be perceived as radical schools of thought. Religious teachings still remain influential in modern areas of psychology.  Significant people  =Juan Luis Vives= Juan Luis Vives (6 March 1493 ‚Äì 6 May 1540), a Christian scholar who was greatly admired by the theologian Erasmus, has been referred to as ‚ÄúThe father of modern psychology‚Äù (Watson, 1915). While it is unknown if Sigmund Freud was familiar with Vives‚Äô work, historian of psychiatry Gregory Zilboorg considered Vives a godfather of psychoanalysis. (A History of Medical Psychology, 1941). Vives was the first noted scholar to directly analyze the human psyche. =Rene Descartes= Rene Descartes, a famous French philosopher, contributed to the field of psychology while also keeping the Catholic church's beliefs in mind. Descartes' beliefs were controversial during the 17th-century because some of his beliefs went against Christian teachings. Contrary to Christian teachings, Descartes believed that animals could be understood as a machine that did not have a soul.Facher, R. E. & Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology: A history (4th edition). New York, New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. Although he did not specifically say that humans did not have a soul, Christians found this statement to be controversial because human beings resembled animals. These beliefs were written in his work titled The World. The World was never published because Descartes feared the Catholic church would punish him for his controversial beliefs. =John Locke= John Locke, was an English philosopher, who took the stance of \\"reason\\" being \\"the last judge and Guide in ever Thing\\" even in religious matters. Evidence was not something he concerned himself with, and instead, was a seeker of consistency, meaning, and how humans should respond to the desires and especially, their own faith.Losonsky, M. (2012). Locke and Leibniz on Religious Faith. British Journal For The History Of Philosophy, 20(4), 703-721. One of his major contributions to psychology, was his theory of mind, in which this becomes the precursor to explaining the idea of identity and the self. =Gottfried Leibniz= Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, was a Lutheran philosopher, who unlike Locke, believed that there are some religious ideas that stand on their own as being irrefutable and incontrovertible. With this in mind, most of his philosophical ideas, including the ones that aided to the foundation of psychological concepts, were hoped to be nonintrusive to the Christian-based beliefs in Europe and also be used unified the division between the Christian denomination. As a major contribution to psychology, Leibniz made a distinction between conscious and unconscious states that Freud and other successors would further expand upon centuries later. =S√∏ren Kierkegaard= S√∏ren Kierkegaard (b. 1813, d. ‚Äì 1855) was a philosopher who contributed profound theoretical psychological works.1844/1980a; 1848/1980b; cf. Evans, 1990 Over the course of a decade he described the nature of personhood, sin, anxiety, the unconscious (before Freud), subjectivity, human development, and spiritual development from a Christian perspective. Kierkegaard is considered a ‚Äúfather‚Äù to therapeutic psychology.Podmore, Simon D. \\"Kierkegaard as physician of the soul: On self- forgiveness and despair.\\" Journal of Psychology and Theology 37.3 (2009): 174-185. Podmore writes that, \\"The Sickness unto Death (1849) as an attempt to resolve the sinful ‚Äòself‚Äô by integrating a psychological perspective on despair with a theology of the forgiveness of sins.\\"Podmore, pg. 176. Julia Watkin (1998) stated that ‚ÄúIt is highly likely that, but for the fact of his writing in a minority language, he would have been hailed, long before the advent of Freud, as a founder of an important depth psychology.‚Äù p. 372Podmore, pg 176 Erikson, who studied under Anna Freud, went further saying Kierkegaard, not Sigmund Freud, was the first genuine psychoanalyst.Hoare, 2002, pp. 177-79 Charles Carr (1973) said the ‚Äúpenetrating quality of Kierkegaard‚Äôs insights into guilt, dread, sin, and despair also render him worthy of recognition as the father of modern therapeutic psychology.‚Äù Carr, p. 16http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.660.5148&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf  Modern influences  = Christian counseling = Christian counseling is a manner of psychological therapy that emphasizes the importance of person's relationship with God. Christian counseling utilizes the ideas of Christian psychology in order to properly understand and treat patients. Both Christian psychology and Christian counseling help people understand the self psychologically and in the eyes of God. This specific form of counseling incorporates a person's unique religious views to create a more individualized form of treatment.Carter, R. B. (1999). Christian Counseling: An Emerging Specialty.

Career Levis was a violinist, but his musical career was unsuccessful, as was an attempt as a tobacconist. Besides selling spices, he and his brother pickled meat and vegetable products such as pickles, cabbage, and pig's feet in his garage which they sold to Philadelphia taverns.

During the following season, Fisher again beat Davis, this time 5‚Äì4 in the 1983 Professional Players Tournament, but his subsequent 4‚Äì5 loss to Eddie Charlton was his only last-32 finish in six events. He had begun the season ranked 37th - a career best - but finished it at 42nd. Fisher's career took a downward turn thereafter; he slipped further down the rankings with each passing season, winning only one match in 1985/1986 - a 5‚Äì3 defeat of Jackie Rea in the 1986 Classic, which preceded a 0‚Äì5 whitewash at the hands of Rea's compatriot and close friend, Alex Higgins. At the 1987 Classic, Fisher again beat Davis - on this occasion, 5‚Äì2 - but lost 0‚Äì5 to Charlton in the last 64. Having started the 1987/1988 season ranked 92nd, Fisher required a good performance in any tournament to have hope of keeping his professional status. This he achieved at the 1987 Grand Prix; he beat Paul Watchorn 5‚Äì4, making his first and only century break - an effort of 100 exactly - in the process, before whitewashing Davis 5‚Äì0 and overcoming Eugene Hughes and Martin Clark to reach the last 16 stage for the first time in his career. In his last-16 match, Fisher held Bob Chaperon to 2‚Äì3 but eventually lost 2‚Äì5; despite this, the ¬£4,500 he earned in prize money, and the ranking points, improved his ranking position to 58th. He earned nothing else throughout that season, but finished it within the top 64 who automatically retained their place on tour. In the 1990 Grand Prix, Fisher beat six-time World Champion Ray Reardon 5‚Äì4 in one of Reardon's final matches; the latter would retire from the game at the end of the season. Fisher lost his next match 3‚Äì5 to Joe O'Boye. Fisher began the 1994/1995 season ranked 247th, and lost 1‚Äì5 in qualifying for the 1995 World Championship to Matthew McGrotty. The last of his three victories that season came in the British Open, where he beat Huseyin Hursid of Turkey 5‚Äì1, but lost his next match 0‚Äì5 to India's Amrik Cheema. Fisher did not play at competitive level again; ranked 443rd, he was relegated from the tour in 1997, aged 52.

History  Golden Week was created in 2005 with new early voting legislation that allowed voters to cast absentee ballots up to 35 days before the election. The legislation was passed in response to vast complications and inefficiencies experienced during the 2004 presidential election. On top of the technical issues with vote counting and voting machines, there were many logistical issues that discouraged turnout and voter participation. Electoral precincts were ill-equipped to handle the number of voters coming out, and in some cases waiting lines were reported to be as high as nine hours long. This expansion of voting time resulted in about a week of overlap with the deadline of voter registration, which was October 6.  Usage  As with any period of early voting, citizens used Golden Week (and the rest of the period that did not overlap with registration deadlines) as an opportunity to cast their ballots at a time more convenient for them than Election Day itself. The added ability to vote on the same day of registration created an ideal opportunity for those who could not afford to take too much time out of their work schedules, or other obligations. While people from all walks of life have reasons to take advantage of early voting, the practice is more often associated with minorities and low-income citizens. The number of people who took advantage of these opportunities proved to be considerable. During the 2012 general election, approximately 90,000 people cast votes during Golden Week, which translated to about 14% of the total early, in-person absentee ballots cast that year. There were several instances of organized intent to take advantage of the opportunities provided by Golden Week, as well. Many predominantly African-American churches coordinated \\"Souls to the Polls\\" campaigns designed to encourage their communities to get registered and exercise their voting rights.  Contention and elimination  Golden Week and early voting opportunities in general have been the subject of much debate among policymakers. Some see early voting as a safeguard against the disenfranchisement of minority and lower-income citizens who are believed to use such services more often. According to some studies, there is truth to this. Data from the Pew Research Center states that youth, minorities and the poor are much more likely to be nonvoters Corroborated with research from Caltech and MIT, it becomes clearer why this might be the case. Their study found that a multitude of reasons for not voting are more often used by minorities and youth than whites and older citizens. These reasons include illness, being too busy, or not having the proper transportation. It is factors such as those that lead many to believe that having ample early voting opportunities is particularly beneficial to those demographics. In addition to that, some believe that early voting opportunities help offset logistical issues during election day, and promote a larger overall voter turnout. Others see offering voting opportunities to the extent that Ohio has as a waste of resources and as a detriment to informed decision-making. To some, voting too early before an election represents making too hasty a decision, as important information can surface any time that has potential to shift opinions. Others believe that tighter voting procedures help minimize fraud. As such, Ohio's voting policies have been an ever-present topic in the state's political arena. = NAACP v. Husted = This debate came to a head in 2014 when the Ohio House passed Senate Bill 238, which eliminated Golden Week. This action was followed by a directive from Secretary of State John Husted, which set statewide early voting hours to be used in forthcoming elections. Husted's opponents criticized the directive for its lack of evening hours, as well as for not providing hours on Sundays or on the Monday prior to Election Day. The discontent with these measures eventually prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit that came to be known as NAACP v. Husted, as the complaint was filed on behalf of several civil rights groups including the Ohio Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the League of Women Voters of Ohio. The case was contested until it made its way to the US Supreme Court, which did not fully consider the case but still stayed the decision of the lower courts to uphold Husted's legislation. Due to persistent action by the ACLU, however, a new compromise was reached in April 2015, in which Husted agreed to restore some weekend and evening voting hours. Golden Week remained eliminated. There has been discontent since the elimination of Golden Week from invested groups such as the ACLU, but until recently there has not been much action in the form of concentrated effort to reinstate the lost voting time. As of November 2015, attorneys have filed a new lawsuit representing Ohio Democrats aimed at getting the judiciary to reexamine the state's voting policies regarding early ballot opportunities as well as rules on provisional ballots.

According to Parwez, the original purpose of Islam, is to free humanity from the oppressive rule of man-made systems of control. These man-made systems include Theocracy and Secular Democracy, both of which, are in contradiction to Quranic principles. A Quranic model of government will give the final authority to God Himself. Such a government allows only those laws which are within the bounds of Quran, and actively promotes Quranic principles. He elaborated on the definition of many Quranic principles, such as that of Zakat, which he defined as universal welfare. He also emphasized the importance of unity for Muslims: \\"the Qur‚Äôan is naturally opposed to sectarianism in deen and factionalism in politics. Sects and factions breed strife and dissension in the Ummah. According to the Qur'an, sectarianism is a form of shirk.\\" While Parwez did not reject Hadith completely, he gave primary importance to the Quran.He often cited examples in which disagreements and divisions between Muslims were caused by over-reliance on the hadith, and determined that the only way for Muslims to come to an agreement, and be unified in Islam, will be to give primary importance to the Quran, and reject any hadith which clearly contradicts the Quranic principles. He also blamed the mainstream scholars for allowing exploitative socioeconomic practices by deriving their authority from the hadith, even in contradiction to the Quran. He also blamed the over-reliance on hadith for introducing false historical narratives of the early period of Islam, also as a means of exploitation. \\"Parwez upholds the view that Hadith and sunna, as he defines them, do not constitute sources of legal authority in Islam (or what he calls al-din). Instead, he forms the view that the Quran is fully self-sufficient in terms of its own interpretation and that hadith and sunna have in many instances eclipsed and distorted the actual Quranic teachings, including those that have legal import.\\"  Major ideas  = Support for Pakistan's independence = Before the creation of Pakistan, Iqbal introduced Parwez to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who recruited him to help popularize the need for a separate homeland for Muslims. Jinnah appointed Parwez to edit the magazine, Tolu-e-Islam for the purpose of countering propaganda that was coming from some of the religious corners in support of Congress. Parwez's thesis was that the organizational model of the state is the basic engine which drives the implementation of the Quran, and like Muhammad in Medina, those wishing to practice Islam, as it is defined in the Quran, are required to live in a state which submits to the laws of God and not the laws of man. During the struggle for independence, Abul Kalam Azad, a prominent Indian Nationalist, opposed Pakistan by arguing for the universalism of all religions; whereas, Parwez, countered Azad's arguments in support of Iqbal, Jinnah and the concept of Pakistan. Parwez stated that the consequences of universalism would be the formation of another sect, further dividing humanity. He cited the history of other such enterprises that attempted to fuse incompatible ideas into a singular ideology. He also pointed to the basic requirements for Muslims i.e. belief in one God and the prophet as His final messenger, precluded the possibility of any fusion. Moreover, Parwez highlighted contradictions between Azad‚Äôs earlier position in 1912, with the one he took to argue against the Muslim League. After independence, Parwez disagreed with those claiming that Pakistan was supposed to be a secular state, as well as those claiming it was to be a theocracy. He claimed that both concepts are against Islam and Jinnah was opposed to both systems, following his \\"conversion\\" by Iqbal. Parwez cited speeches of Jinnah, before and after independence, in which Jinnah clarified that the form of democracy he was seeking was that of Medinah under the prophet. = Islam and individual liberty = Parwez argued that the Quran places such strong emphasis on individual freedom that it almost overrides all forms of authority, to the point where no person has the right to compel another person to obey them, citing the verse 3:79 in support of this view. Consistent with this, Parwez \\"adamantly opposed\\" slavery. He claimed that it had no justifiable basis according to the Quran and that the practice had been banned since the dawn of Islam, contrary to the opinions of his opponents who officially called for slavery to be legalized in the newly created Pakistan. Parwez argued that the words used in the Quran to refer to slavery should be correctly read in the past-tense, thereby giving a completely different meaning to the verses used by his opponents to justify slavery. He stated: \\"Whatever happened in subsequent history was the responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran.\\" W.G. Clarence-Smith includes Parwez among the \\"South Asian Shock Troops of Abolition,\\" a line of rationalist thinkers who took the position that slavery is forbidden by the Quran. This position was first taken by Syed Ahmad Khan. According to Clarence-Smith, Parwez was \\"the most significant figure to carry the radical torch after independence in 1947.\\" Regarding the practical methods for the abolition of slavery, Parwez clarified that because the local economy was based on slave labor, society had to be weaned off of slavery gradually. He pointed out that the main source of slaves was war, as prisoners of war were usually enslaved. So when the Quran banned the enslavement of prisoners of war, it effectively closed the door on the future of slavery. Furthermore, by highly encouraging the emancipation of slaves, the existing slaves in society were gradually freed. Parwez also called for monogamy and rejected polygamy under normal demographic circumstances. He argued that due to various forms of discrimination suffered by women, their gender has developed an \\"inferiority complex\\", which is enforced and exploited by men. He claimed that the Quran liberates women from their historical \\"bondage\\" by affirming their independent existence and equality in all aspects of society that matter, leaving only a few biological differences between the genders. Parwez cited Quranic verses to show that although women have certain responsibilities emphasized, such as the upbringing of children, they are free to earn their own living just like men, and unlike men, anything they earn is for them alone, while the man's earnings are to be shared by the household. = Religion vs. \\"Deen\\" = Parwez argued that Islam challenged the validity, as well as the very conception of ‚Äòreligion‚Äô. This idea is considered a classical claim which had more recently been popularized by Muhammad Iqbal, when Parwez undertook its systematic defense in his work 'Islam: A Challenge to Religion,' where he argues that Islam is a \\"protest against all religions in the old sense of the term.\\" Ismail al-Faruqi welcomed it as \\"representative statement of Muslim modernist thought.\\" Parwez distinguished between ‚Äúdeen‚Äù (a complete code of life) versus \\"madhab\\", which he equated with \\"priestcraft,\\" or cumulative tradition. He argued that while \\"religion\\" focuses on rules and rituals, \\"deen\\" focuses on actions and permanent values. Moreover, while religion induces a \\"complete resignation to authority; however oppressive and unjust it may be\\", \\"deen\\" urges efforts to improve society and the human condition, by encouraging humanity to conquer the forces of nature, while at the same time eradicating social injustice. Parwez stated that: \\"Deen is not an opiate, as the Marxists contend, but a stimulant and spur to action\\". For example, according to Parwez, the concept of \\"Nizaam as-Salaat\\" (System of Salat) in Islam is much more than simple ritualistic prayer. The application of the word \\"Salaat\\" in the Quran (Parwez cites verses like 11:87) indicate a wide-ranging socioeconomic system, of which ritual prayer, is only a small part. The Quranic requirement of \\"Salaat,\\" therefore, is a community based system for implementing the laws of the Quran, which is why it is usually accompanied by the command for implementing \\"Zakaat\\" (universal welfare) which is a state- based system. Parwez argued for a revolutionary understanding of the Quran, re-interpreting the roles of prophets. He argued that the correct view of Jesus, which fits with Islam, was that he was a revolutionary liberator, whose mission was to free the Israelites from the domination of the Romans, while at the same time to build a society on ethical principles, the same as former prophets. Parwez further argued that the image of Jesus as a purely spiritual character uninterested in socio-political struggles, was invented afterwards. Parwez also emphasized a need to re-examine the role of Hadith in order to modernize Islam. In his view, the authenticity of any hadith should be based solely on the principle of contradiction: \\"any hadith which goes against the teachings/commands of the Quran\\" should not be accepted. Parwez therefore rejected the principle of \\"abrogation\\", part of which is based on the concept that certain hadith can supersede commands of the Quran. His position was that the Quran is the true source of Islam, since it is the only authoritative source containing the divine message. = Rational interpretation of the Quran = Parwez's writings are associated with modernism. He supported Iqbal's enterprise of harmonizing the Quran with the natural sciences, and translated those verses in the Quran which are generally associated with \\"miracles\\", \\"angels\\" and \\"jinn\\" rationally as metaphors, without appealing to the supernatural. He also questioned the virgin birth of Jesus and the miraculous interpretations of that event, arguing that the words describing the communication received by Zechariah (priest) with regards to the birth of John the Baptist are identical to the communication received by Mary concerning the birth of Jesus. Since there is no difference in the language, he asked, why would one be accepted as having been conceived via virgin-birth while the other not? He also suggested that just because the Quran does not name Jesus‚Äô father, this is not an argument in support of virgin birth, as the Quran also omits such details regarding the history of other prophets. While Parwez admitted the limitations of human rational faculties, which can not grasp the source and nature of the Divine, he stressed that the content of revelation can be understood rationally. He argued that unlike traditional dogmas which justify their authority using blind faith, \\"iman\\" as outlined in the Quran, forbids blind faith and requires intellectual certainty, expecting the reader to think critically and use their powers of understanding. = Economic re- organization = Parwez held the view that the Quran is the only binding force of Pakistani society; and thus, its community should be in perfect alignment with the commandments of Islam in all aspects. Regarding the issue of Riba Khaled Ahmed mentions that the works of Parwez \\"are currently banned or under attack\\". Parwez argued that the correct definition of this term, according to the Quran, is any excess return on a loan above the amount that was lent. According to Parwez, the Quran allows a return on actual contributions and efforts, and not on pure capital investments. Even charging for a product above its actual worth Parwez saw as Ribba, claiming that the \\"fair price\\" should be decided by society, and not arbitrarily by the sellers. He also disagreed with the orthodox emphasis on the concept of \\"risk\\" in interest based lending, arguing that if risk was an important factor in making such financial transactions allowable, then gambling would be allowed by the Quran, when it is not. Parwez summarized his views on riba as follows: : \\"To reiterate, riba means more than simply ‚Äòinterest‚Äô. It is the singular factor that makes all human systems exploitative and thus contrary to the Qur‚Äôan. In the Divine system every citizen works to full capacity and happily keeps a minimum for him/herself whilst giving most of it to society. In a human system every individual seeks to do as little as possible and simultaneously maximise his profits through the work of others. The two system-types are so fundamentally different that the Qur‚Äôan even terms human systems as a ‚Äòrevolt against God and His Messenger‚Äô (2:279).\\" Dr. Fazlur Rahman Malik and Parwez candidly recommended that for a temporary period the state assume total direction of capital and labor. Parwez's position is contrasted with the traditionalists like Mawdudi, who were criticized by Parwez on the grounds that their system is essentially the same as capitalism. Parwez's views were linked to the Quranic definition of Zakat, which he argued was a \\"universal development\\" tax collected and administered by a Quranic State. Instead of a fixed rate (e.g. 2.5% as accepted by the orthodox views), the rate would be a variable, depending on the needs of the time, as determined by the state. N. A. Jawed states that according to thinkers like Parwez, \\"hell\\" and \\"heaven\\" are not only concepts relating to the next life, but also represent socioeconomic systems in this world. \\"Hell\\", according to Parwez, is a system where humans struggle to accumulate wealth. In such societies competition and enmity drives men to consume themselves, resulting in social conflict and class wars. Parwez contrasted this with \\"heaven\\", an ideal society devoid of class distinctions, characterized by justice, peace and cooperation. He also redefined the concept of \\"satan\\" allegorically; as the human impulse which drives people to use their mental faculties to oppose divine laws. Parwez found support for this view in the Quranic story of the fall of man, which he interpreted metaphorically, where the \\"forbidden tree\\" stands for the quest for acquisition and ownership.

They are generally understood as cult instruments, probably to be attached to carts.  Discovery From 1935‚Äì39, the Turkish archaeologists, Hamit Z√ºbeyir Ko≈üay and investigated the site of Alaca H√∂y√ºk, near Alaca, √áorum Province. In the process they uncovered 14 tombs of the early Bronze Age, which were named the \\"Princely tombs\\" or \\"Kingly tombs\\". Numerous grave offerings were found next to the burials - individually or in pairs - including more than twenty bronze standards.  Description  The archaeologist Winfried Orthmann divides the standards into two main groups, one group consists of individual animals and the other of discs or rings (with or without images of animals). He subdivides these two groups based on the shape and contents of the discs or rings, and based on the type of creatures depicted. The individual animals are all deer or bulls. The feet stand on four supports which converge at a point where it probably attached to a perishable wooden pole. The deer have expansive antlers, the cows have long curved horns. The highly stylised bodies are partially decorated with silver inlay and silver or gold leaf highlights the antlers and noses. The disc or ring-shaped standards are round, half-circular or lozenge shaped. Several have a grill in the centre, surrounded by bands decorated with projections in the shape of birds, flowers or rays of the Sun. Most feature animals, which are very similar to the individual animals. Deer and bulls are particularly common on these, also, but unlike the individual animal standards, they sometimes appear in groups. Thus for example, a deer appears flanked by two bulls in one; in another, two lions or panthers stand to the left and right of a deer, which faces in the opposite direction. Another example depicts an animal which might be a roe deer or an onager. At the bottom of the disc or ring are a pair of horns, projecting outward and upward. At the bottom there is a cross bar with two pegs, which probably connected the standard to its pole. AlacaStandarte Hirsch&Stiere.jpg;Ring shaped standard with deer and two bulls Alacastandarte Hirsch&L;√∂wen.jpgDeer with gold nose and two lions/panthers  Interpretation  Only very limited explanations of the meaning and function of the artefacts are possible. The excavators, Ko≈üay und Arƒ±k, assumed a clear ritual role and based the rest of their interpretations on that. On account of the Sun ray decoration on some of the standards they are often known as \\"Sun discs\\", with the rings interpreted as symbols of the heavens. This interpretation is supported by Kurt Bittel, among others. The most popular theory on their function was proposed by Seton Lloyd and James Mellaart and developed by Orthmann. They argued that the standards were part of a wagon buried with the deceased in the grave. The standards would, on this theory, have been located on the drawbar, perhaps where it met with the yoke. The term \\"standard\\" derives from this theory. Similar wagon standards are known from Ur and Kish in Mesopotamia as well as the bronze age kurgans of Lƒça≈°en and Lalajan in Armenia. There rings for the reins have been found, which Orthamann connects with the Alaca H√∂y√ºk standards. He takes the presence of pairs of bull skulls and foot bones in the graves, arranged in a pattern similar to a yoked pair as further evidence. Whether the disc and round-shaped standards here were used for guiding the reins, like the examples in Armenia and Mesopotamia, must remain a possibility. Yet in that case, it is unclear why no remains of these wagons have been found in the tombs - extensive remains of the wooden covers of the graves have survived. Similar finds at Horoztepe were interpreted as sistrums by the excavator there, the Turkish archaeologist Tahsin √ñzg√º√ß, on account of the moving parts.  Date  The archaeologist Karl Bittel says that based on the pottery in the princely graves, a date before the establishment of the Assyrian trading colonies in Asia Minor (i.e. before 1900 BC) is to be assumed. He drew parallels between the metal objects in the tombs and those from Troy II, which date from around 2100 BC. From the different levels of burials and the stylistic development of the grave goods, it appears that the cemetery functioned for a long time, possibly more than two hundred years, between the 22nd and 20th centuries BC - the period of the Hattians, before the rise of the Hittite Empire.  Reception  Hittite Sun Course Monument in Sƒ±hhiye Square in Ankara The Alaca H√∂y√ºk bronze standards are used in stylised form by various organisations as logos, such as the University of Ankara, University of Ankara the city,Stadt √áorum and the province of √áorum. A massive reproduction of one of the standards stands in the middle of Sƒ±hhiye Square in Ankara. The standards are mostly displayed in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, with some in the local museum of Alaca H√∂y√ºk. Replicas of the graves and the standards are on display in the √áorum Archaeological Museum.

The seventeenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low pressure area on September 5\\\\. Under warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September 6 and a hurricane by the next day. A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125 mph (205 km/h) Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale on September 8\\\\. Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower sea surface temperatures, causing rapid weakening. Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September 10\\\\. The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September 14\\\\. In Mexico, the storm brought rainfall to nine states, causing flooding, especially in Oaxaca, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas. In Oaxaca, mudslides resulted in the closure of multiple highways and damage to over a dozen homes. Flooding in Sinola affected approximately 1,000 homes with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate. Several small communities were temporarily isolated after flood waters covered bridges. Localized flooding in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25 dwellings; damage reached approximately 500,000 pesos (US$30,000). Although Linda did not directly impact land, moisture from the storm was pulled northeast into the Southwestern United States and enhanced the local monsoon. Los Angeles received of rain, contributing to the city's second wettest September on record. One fatality in the state occurred from a drowning at San Bernardino National Forest. Utah was impacted by major flash flooding incidents‚Äîwith rainfall amounting to 1-in-100 year levels‚Äîwhich left 21 deaths in the state: 14 near Hildale and 7 in Zion National Park. Damage across the Southwest amounted to US$3.6 million. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 21\\\\. By four days later, the system spawned Tropical Storm Erika over the eastern Atlantic. The southern portion of the wave persisted westward and moved over Central America on August 30\\\\. Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the wave began to increase over the next few days as it crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Convection was enhanced further on September 2 as a Kelvin wave interacted with the tropical wave, eventually resulting in the development of a broad low pressure area. Early the following day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) for a cluster of clouds that showed signs of organizing into a tropical system. Wind shear was forecast to become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis over the next few days. Although the shear remained moderately strong, the low acquired a well- defined center of circulation by September 4\\\\. Following further organization of deep convection, Tropical Depression Fifteen-E developed at 18:00 UTC on September 5 while located about southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Under the influence of a strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico, the depression moved northwestward into an area of moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. By 06:00 UTC on September 6, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Linda. Due to a decrease in wind shear, Linda began to undergo rapid deepening shortly thereafter. Between that day and early on September 7, the storm increased in convective banding and developed central dense overcast; satellite imagery also indicated that an eye was forming around that time. At 06:00 UTC on September 7, Linda intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Just six hours later, the cyclone reached Category 2 status. Due to a slight increase in wind shear and possibly an intrusion from dry air, Linda temporarily remained steady in intensity while passing between Socorro Island and Clarion Island. Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Linda to a Category 1 hurricane at 0:300 UTC on September 8, though post-analysis concludes that the storm remained a Category 2. Strengthening resumed by early on September 8, when the system became a Category 3 hurricane, which coincided with satellite imagery indicating a banded eye feature. Around 12:00 UTC, Linda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on September 9, the hurricane rapidly weakened after entering a region of slightly colder sea surface temperatures, falling to Category 2 by 06:00 UTC and to Category 1 intensity only six hours later. Around that time, Linda began encountering a dry, stable air mass and ocean temperature under . At 18:00 UTC on September 9, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while also losing convective coverage. After the remaining showers and thunderstorms detached from the low-level circulation, Linda transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC the following day while situated about 260 mi (415 km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur. The remnants weakened over the next few days, until degenerating into a trough while still well west of Baja California on September 14. Impact and aftermath =Mexico= The outer bands of Linda brought rainfall to nine states across Mexico: Baja California, Baja California Sur, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Sonora and Zacatecas. Within Sinaloa, flooding affected the municipalities of Angostura, Culiac√°n, Mazatl√°n, Rosario, and Salvador Alvarado. Rainfall accumulations peaked at in Rosario. Flooding affected approximately 1,000 homes in the state with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate. Several small communities were temporarily isolated as flood waters covered bridges. Civil officials declared an emergency for the municipalities of Rosario and Salvador Alvarado in the wake of Linda. Scattered power outages occurred in Mazatl√°n city. Scattered thunderstorms in Oaxaca resulted in multiple landslides and flooding, prompting closure of several highways and damaging more than a dozen homes. Localized flooding attributed to Linda in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25 homes; losses reached MXN$500,000 (US$27,000). Waves of likely impacted coastal areas of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Additionally, Linda passed roughly 100 mi (155 km) west of Socorro Island on September 7; sustained winds reached with gusts to . =United States= California Monsoonal moisture pulled north from Linda to produce thunderstorms across portions of California starting on September 10\\\\. Victorville and Hesperia, started on September 8 had knocked out electricity. Flooding and rock slides prompted numerous road closures. One person drowned in the San Bernardino National Forest. Moisture from the hurricane's remnants partially contributed to an enhanced monsoon across the Southwestern United States, combining with a seasonable upper-level trough to bring above-average rainfall to many areas. Strong winds from a thunderstorm on September 14 knocked five rail cars off their track, costing insurance companies $1.2 million. On September 15, Los Angeles received of rain, contributing to the city's second-wettest September day since records began in 1877 ‚Äï second only to September 25, 1939. Water penetration along State Route 91 in the city resulted in a crack in the road. Rainfall of was common around San Diego; an underground parking lot in the Midway neighborhood was flooded. Flood-related losses throughout the state reached $912,000. Utah NEXRAD image at 20:20 UTC (2:20 p.m. MDT) on September 14, depicting a thunderstorm over Hildale, Utah that produced deadly flash floods After degenerating into a remnant low on September 10, moisture associated with the former tropical cyclone spread across the Southwestern United States. Aided by above-average water vapor levels and the aforementioned upper-level trough, scattered thunderstorms developed across the region on September 14. Two major incidents of flash flooding resulted in 21 deaths in Utah, the deadliest flash flood event in the state's history. The previous deadliest event was on August 13, 1923, when seven people died near Farmington. Flash floods occur annually in Washington County, Utah, with an average of one to two flash flood days per year since 1950. During the afternoon of September 14, two successive thunderstorms produced more than of rain‚Äîa 1-in-100 year event‚Äînear Hildale, Utah in Washington County. The National Weather Service issued a strongly worded flash flood warning at 20:22 UTC (2:22 p.m. MDT) for the area, stating \\"Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life\\". The first storm resulted in a rise along the Short Creek, as measured by a stream gauge in Colorado City, Arizona, in 19 minutes around 21:18 UTC (3:18 p.m. MDT), with residents gathering nearby to observe. Between 22:48 and 23:05 UTC (4:48 and 5:05 p.m. MDT), a second surge of water swept down the creek with the Colorado City gauge reporting a rise of ; the gauge stopped reporting at 23:47 UTC (5:47 p.m. MDT). The second flood swept away two vehicles carrying a collective 16 people while they were observing the rising waters. Thirteen people were killed and three children were rescued. Six bodies were recovered in Utah and two in Arizona, downstream. Other bodies were found up to downstream. The remains of one of the vehicles swept away in the Hildale flash flood. Of the van's eleven occupants, only one survived. Alongside the fatalities, the floods left several blocks of the town without power. Water lines, bridges, and other infrastructure sustained varying degrees of damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000. Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000. Around 150 federal personnel and 500 community volunteers, including 70‚Äì80 percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath. Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation. By September 17, 300 personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing. Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60 agencies took part in the search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September 29 and the missing boy was presumed dead. Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December. The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshall's Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination. Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6 million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for repair costs and mitigation efforts for future floods. Of this total, $1.5 million went to Hildale. The United States Department of Agriculture also provided $100,000 through the Emergency Watershed Protection program. The second flash flood incident occurred in Keyhole Canyon at Zion National Park after of rain fell between 22:30 and 23:30 UTC (4:30 and 5:30 p.m. MDT). For the two-day period ending September 14, the park saw of rain. The earlier flash flood warning prompted officials at the park to close all canyons by 21:30 UTC (3:30 p.m. MDT). A group of seven canyoneers entered Keyhole Canyon between 21:30 and 22:30 UTC (3:30 and 4:30 p.m. MDT). Flow along the Virgin River dramatically increased following the rains, with the river's North Fork experiencing a rise from 55 ft3 (1.5 m3) per second to 2,630 ft3 (74.5 m3) per second in just 15 minutes. All seven people were swept away by the ensuing flood and died. Rescue operations were launched that evening; however, dangerous conditions in the canyons resulted in the search being held off until the following day. The bodies of the canyoneers were discovered miles apart along Clear Creek and Pine Creek. Elsewhere, a man from Hurricane, Utah, west of Hildale, died on September 14 after being swept away by floods while traveling remote dirt roads. His vehicle was discovered in Mohave County, Arizona on September 17 about south of the Arizona‚ÄìUtah border and his body was found a further away the following day. In Utah County, Utah, the rain resulted in traffic accidents and mudslides, including several at American Fork Canyon that shut down parts of State Route 92 and State Route 144. Scattered thunderstorms caused sporadic damage across Arizona, leaving $206,000 in losses.

The character is an Inhuman. Created by writer Charles Soule and artist Joe Madureira, he first appeared in Inhuman #1 (June 2014), and plays a key role after the release of the Terrigen Mists around the globe at the conclusion of the \\"Infinity\\" storyline. Lash appeared in the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Matt Willig as Lash and Blair Underwood as his human alter-ego Andrew Garner. Publication history Lash was created by writer Charles Soule and artist Joe Madureira, and first appeared in Inhuman #1 (June 2014). According to Charles Soule, the character comes from Orollan, another Inhuman city: Soule has said that \\"He's trying to do what he can to both collect strong Inhumans to help his own society, but also cleanse the planet of Inhumans who should never have received Terrigenesis in the first place\\", because \\"the idea is that not everyone on Earth sees all these new Inhumans popping up as a good thing.\\" He also appears in All-New Invaders Issues # 14 to recruit more Inhumans. Fictional character biography Born in the hidden Inhuman city of Orollan (which is somewhere in Greenland), Lash was among the few Inhumans of his generation chosen to undergo Terrigenesis. When the Inhuman King Black Bolt activated a Terrigen Bomb above New York flooding the world with Terrigen Mist and awakening the powers of Inhuman descendants living among humanity (as seen at the end of the \\"Infinity\\" storyline and the start of the Inhumanity storyline), Lash embarked on a mission to find all the individuals affected and judge for himself whether they were worthy to live with their new abilities. Upon arriving in Illinois, Lash encountered a newly-created Inhuman named Dante Pertuz. He attempted to persuade Dante to join him at Orollan until he was stopped by the Inhuman Queen Medusa.Inhuman #1 Recruiting a NuHuman named Jason in Minnesota, Lash teleports them both to Orollan. There, he explains that Jason and his family were descendants of the Inhumans and while his family may have died during Terrigenesis, Jason has survived and will now have a home among his fellow survivors. With their gifts, they can rebuild the city and perform wonders. Lash shows Jason the most sacred space in Orollan‚Äîthe Terrigenesis chamber. Here, they hoarded the crystals that bestow Terrigenesis that will show the worthy their true form. Lash says Jason must call himself Korvostax now and introduces him to other NuHumans who explain that humans have formed mobs and attacked them in their communities. The other NuHumans in Lash's group blame Medusa. Lash's new recruits are rebuilding a wall despite a near-total lack of prior experience. Jason asks why Lash isn't showing them how to do this, and the others tell him it isn't wise to speak like that‚Äîthere used to be two more NuHumans in the group. The New Attilan group teleports nearby, looking to capture Lash at the advice of Lineage. Lash tells the others that Queen Medusa means to kill them, and urges them to fight. As the battle develops between the New Attilan group and Lash's group, Jason taps into his powers for the first time and begins throwing rocks at Gorgon. Lash absorbs the energy of a volcanic spring to power energy blasts that he fires randomly into the scrum. Jason is saved from death by Gorgon who then stuns Lash with a small earth tremor. Taking hold of Lash, Medusa pins him, then invites Lineage to step forward and tell Lash what he told her. Lineage explains that Black Bolt originally released the Terrigen Cloud because something is coming for the Inhumans and they need everyone to hold it back with as many hidden bloodlines from every nation on Earth united. If they cannot prepare, their species (and maybe humans as well) will become extinct. Medusa gathers the NuHumans and tells Lash that he can either help her, stay away, or face defeat. It is also mentioned that Lash can tell Ennilux and the others from her what has transpired.Inhuman #3 During the Civil War II storyline, Lash is told about Iron Man abducting Ulysses Cain from New Attilan by Maximus. He considered what Iron Man did as an act of war against all Inhumans. This led to Lash's group destroying the Stark Manufacturing Facility SZ-4 near Zurich, Switzerland so that they can force Medusa's hand for an attack on Iron Man. This led to Medusa and the Ultimates fighting Lash's group until Medusa teleports them to the Triskelion where Lash and his followers are taken into custody.Uncanny Inhumans #12 After escaping from the Triskelion, Lash and his followers learn that Black Bolt is back on Earth and that he is no longer powerful than before. They take advantage of this and attack Black Bolt. After Lash abducted Blinky and took him to Orollan, Black Bolt surrendered to him as Lash states that he will use Black Bolt's blood to make his own Terrigen bomb to make new Inhumans. Before Lash can go ahead with this plan, he and Jack Chain were killed by Blinky who was possessed by the Jailer.Black Bolt #9-11. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Lash has various energy conversion abilities: * Energy Conversion: Lash can convert energy from various sources and subsequently emit it from his palms. His powers are capable of disintegrating a living being. * Energy Absorption: He can draw the necessary force needed to convert said energy into another energy form for him to use. * Energy Manipulation: Lash has shown he can control whatever energy he happens to have on hand at the time for a variety of effects beyond just disintegration blasts. * Energy Shield According to Soule \\"Let's say someone's running at him ‚Äî that's kinetic energy. Lash can change all of that into heat ‚Äî and whoosh! ‚Äî the other guy goes up in flames.\\" In other media =Television= Lash appears in the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. portrayed by Matt Willig. Executive producer Jed Whedon explains that the show's adaptation of the character is different from the comics, but some elements are inspired from the source material. This version of Lash is depicted to having black skin. Lash first appeared in the episode \\"Laws of Nature\\" and the episode \\"Devils You Know\\" revealed that he can transform into a human form. The episode \\"Among Us Hide...\\" revealed that Andrew Garner (portrayed by Blair Underwood), a psychologist at Culver University working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and ex-husband of Agent Melinda May (portrayed by Ming-Na Wen), is Lash's human form who went through Terrigenesis while investigating an Inhuman genealogy ledger that was kept by Jiaying (portrayed by Dichen Lachman). The show explains Lash's ability to return to his human form as his transition phase before he fully becomes an Inhuman. Similar to his comics' version, Lash searches for and kills every unworthy Inhuman without prejudice. Lash even enlisted an Inhuman named Dwight Frye who can react to any nearby Inhumans to help find any worthy and unworthy ones. While he has attempted to kill Lincoln Campbell, Lash's victim included Alisha Whitely's clone, levitating Inhuman Shane Henson, pyrokinetic Inhuman Lori Henson, Dwight Frye after he served his purpose, and an assortment of unnamed Inhumans and Hydra Agents. Garner later surrenders himself to S.H.I.E.L.D. before the transformation becomes permanent and manages to say goodbye to May before completely becoming Lash. After saving Daisy Johnson (portrayed by Chloe Bennet) from Hive in Grant Ward's body (portrayed by Brett Dalton) and his \\"Inhuman Primitives\\" in the episode \\"Emancipation,\\" he purged her of Hive's control and killed at least three Inhuman primitives before dying upon being impaled by Hellfire's chain. May later mourned his death. In the episode \\"The Real Deal,\\" a fear manifestation of Lash is among the fear manifestations released when the Kree Beacon exploded near the three monoliths. It was destroyed by Phil Coulson and Deathlok. =Video games= Lash is a playable character in Marvel: Future Fight.

It is known as ' by apothecaries and in older scientific works. Natural sulfur was also known as brimstone, hence the alternative name flowers of brimstone. Production Flowers of sulfur were traditionally produced by subliming naturally occurring sulfur, known as sulphur vivum. Impurities and moisture could cause acid residue in the product, so it was often washed, the result being known as \\"washed flowers of sulfur\\" (in Latin, flores sulphuris loti). Flowers of sulfur is commercially available and can be bought through chemical supply companies as well as major e-commerce websites. Uses Historically, flowers of sulfur were extensively used medically to cure ailments, particularly skin diseases. In the early 20th century, \\"flowers of sulfur\\" was also widely used for agricultural purposes. It was specifically used in cultivating hop plants to combat and prevent fungal diseases caused by molds that can kill crops. Flowers of sulfur was also used to treat rosebushes similarly. These cases show that flowers of sulfur was one of the earliest fungicides and insecticides used agriculturally. More recent sources also show that flowers of sulfur acts a fungicide, insecticide, and fumigant, as well as an agent in the treatment of numerous skin diseases. Flowers of Sulfur (FoS) Tests have also been used to test porosity of metallic finishes over silver, copper, and copper alloy substrates. The original FoS test method was standardized by ASTM through ASTM-B809 which was established in 1990. The current version of the standard is ASTM B809-95(2018). This test method is especially good at precipitating silver based failures such as those observed with network chip resistors. The Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) and the International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (iNEMI) have both developed tests based on varying degrees to the ASTM standard.

The film stars Tom Ewell, Mickey Rooney, Mickey Shaughnessy, Dina Merrill, Madge Kennedy and Frances Bavier. The film was released on December 1, 1958, by 20th Century Fox. Plot Auto mechanic Max Rutgers is spinning his wheels, going nowhere. He has been promising sweetheart Margie Solitaire for five years that they will marry, but wishes he had more money to support her. His best pal, Gus Harris, knows a lot about racehorses, but keeps flunking his exam to become a licensed trailer. Fed up, he and Max decide to rob a bank, succeeding in a heist of $28,000. They use the money to buy a horse, Tattooed Man, but an acquaintance, cabbie and bookie Rocky Baker, figures out how they got the money and wants to be cut in on a share. Max and Gus bet their life savings on Tattooed Man's next race. When their horse is victorious, only to be disqualified for a rules infraction, they become desperate and decide to rob another bank. A series of errors ensues, teller Grace Havens being held hostage, the vault being on a timer and unable to be opened until morning, and bank manager Schroeder coming along for the ride in his own vehicle when the getaway car they stole from Margie isn't there. The police ultimately trace the thieves to Margie's house and take the crooks into custody. Max, Gus and Rocky are behind bars together when they hear a radio broadcast of a big race that Tattooed Man wins.

P. lutzi is one of six Lutetian Pachycondyla species.  History and classification  When described Pachycondyla lutzi was known from ten fossil insects which are compression- impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the P. lutzi specimens were collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number SMF MeI 11958, and the other nine specimens were preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel. The specific epithet \\"lutzi\\" was coined as a patronym honoring Herbert Lutz, one of the first paleoentomologists to study Messel ants. The species is one of six Pachycondyla species which have been described from Messel Formation fossils. All six of the species were described by Dlussky and Wedmann in the same 2012 paper, the other five being P. eocenica, P.? messeliana, P. parvula, P. petiolosa, and P. petrosa. Another eight fossil species have been described from fossils in North America, Europe, and Asia. Description Pachycondyla lutzi queens have a body length of approximately and the head is slightly wider than long with rounded rear corners. The front margin of the clypeus is generally gradually rounded, and in one specimen, shows a weak concavity of the middle area on the edge. Each of the mandibles are subtriangular and have five to six fairly large teeth each. The antennae are slender in appearance, composed of a scape which extends towards the rear margin of the head and gradually tapering flagellomeres. The eyes are nearly rounded in outline, being very short ovals, and placed to the front of the midpoint on the head. In the worker known, the scape is only as long as the occipital margin, unlike the queens. The gaster was not preserved on the fossil, making a total length hard to judge, though it is estimated at around .

The species is solely known from the Middle Eocene Baltic amber deposits in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. The species is one of six described from Baltic amber. History and classification Elephantomyia (Elephantomyia) bozenae is known only from the holotype specimen, collection number MP/3338, which is preserved as an inclusion in transparent Baltic amber. As of 2015, the amber specimen was included in the collections of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Baltic amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. Estimates of the age date between 37 million years old, for the youngest sediments and 48 million years old. This age range straddles the middle Eocene, ranging from near the beginning of the Lutetian to the beginning of the Pribonian. E. bozenae is one of six crane fly species in the genus Elephantomyia described from the Baltic amber, the others being E. baltica, E. brevipalpa, E. irinae, E. longirostris, and E. pulchella. All six species are placed into the Elephantomyia subgenus Elephantomyia based on the lack of tibial spurs and by several aspects of the wing morphology. The type specimen was first studied by paleoentomologist Iwona Kania, of the University of Rzesz√≥w, who's 2015 type description for the species was published in the journal PLoS ONE. The specific epithet bozenae was coined to honor the biologist Bo≈ºena Szala. Description The E. bozenae type specimen is a well preserved male that is approximately long, not including the rostrum. The head has a rostrum that is long, just over half the length of the fore-wing and longer than the abdomen. The tip of the rostrum has elongate palpus at the tip. Each palpus is composed of four segments, with the basal three segments long and the apical segment short. All four segments host a system of microtrichia. The antennae are small, composed fifteen segments. They have an elongated scape and widened pedicle. As the flagellomeres progress from the base to the tip of the antennae they change from squat and crowded together to elongated and the apical segment is widened at the tip. All of the flagellomeres host two setae each. The wings are long with a pale brown pterostigma that is oval in shape. The D cell, as designated by the Comstock‚ÄìNeedham system, is notably elongated and narrowed, in comparison to all other Baltic amber Elephantomyia.

He was also Commissioner of Crown Lands from 1892 to 1896, when he died in office. Gillen was born at Golden Grove, South Australia, the second son of Thomas Gillen ( ‚Äì ) and his wife Bridget n√©e McCan ( ‚Äì ); they moved to Clare around 1862. He was educated at the Grammar School, Clare, run by L. W. Stanton (c. 1844‚Äì1925), later Assistant Inspector-General of Schools, and Robert Graham. He started working at Clare for Andrew Clarke in his store, later run by J. B. Carr, and subsequently founded the storekeeping business of Gillen & Graham, which became P. & P. P. Gillen with his uncle Philip Gillen ( ‚Äì 23 July 1908), later carried on solely by him. In 1889 he was appointed Auditor to the Corporation of Clare. and in 1886 he was elected a Councillor. He took a lively interest in his district, and retained his popularity throughout his business and political career. He was a prominent member of the Australian Natives Association. He was a Director of several Western Australian mining Companies and. A member of the Catholic church, he was a Director of the Southern Cross newspaper with the Hon. James O'Loghlin, and like him a supporter of the Irish National League. He was elected by the electorate of Stanley to the South Australian House of Assembly to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Edward William Hawker, and served from June 1889 to September 1896, when he died. His colleagues were Charles Kimber, followed by John Miller then Hawker, who had been studying mineralogy in England. He has been reported as one of the first three members elected after the passing of the Payment of Members Act. He was returned by a large majority at the general election in the following year. One of the first debates in which he made his presence was Sir John Downer's Divorce Bill, to which he had a strong opposition. He was regarded as a fluent debater, though at times rather excitable, with a reputation for thoroughness and honesty. In 1892 he was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands in the short-lived Holder cabinet, the youngest minister to that time, and reappointed to that role in the Kingston cabinet the following year. His administration of the Land Acts was marked by conspicuous ability, but his name was principally associated with the Village Settlements scheme of 1894. He collapsed and died of a heart attack during a Cabinet meeting. He was buried at Sevenhills on 22 September 1896 Family Gillen married Mary Gertrude Cousins (c. 1860 ‚Äì 22 January 1929) of Clare on 24 May 1881.

In the book Handbook of New Age, Melissa Harrington states that \\"Eclectic Pagans do not follow any particular Paganism, but follow a Pagan religious path, that includes the overall Pagan ethos of reverence for the ancient Gods, participation in a magical world view, stewardship and caring for the Earth, and 'nature religion.'\\" The practice of Eclectic Paganism is particularly popular with Pagans in North America and the British Isles. Eclectic Paganism contrasts with Reconstructionist Paganism: whereas reconstructionists strive for authenticity to historical religious traditions of specific groups or time periods, the eclectic approach borrows from several different cultures, philosophies, and time periods. There are various benefits and drawbacks from labeling one's self as eclectic pagan. On one hand the label is broad and allows for various practices and beliefs. Without the concrete rules of organized religion the practitioner can explore various religions, philosophies, practices, and cultures while remaining within the bounds of the label. Individuality can also be expressed by creating ones own beliefs, philosophies, and rules. On the other hand, this label might be confusing, especially for an individual trying to discover their beliefs. The label also blurs the lines between cultures which can lead to accidental or even intentional cultural appropriation.  Use of Social Media  The use of social media within eclectic paganism is both a blessing and a curse. Within cultures that discriminate and oppress pagan or occult beliefs and practices, social media can provide a safe haven for learning and discussion; and within all cultures social media allows for the creation of pagan communities. In the past most pagan traditions were passed down through oral traditions and within families or covens. Now with social media information can be reached by anyone. These communities are vast and can incorporate multiple religions, traditions, and cultures; and while this can be beneficial for an eclectic pagan, it may lead to Cultural appropriation. Similarly to body norms and straight culture, the \\"witchy aesthetic\\" has been portrayed as normal and correct. This belief can be hurtful to some eclectic pagans. Not only do concepts such as this undermine the beliefs of individuals, they show an inaccurate description of the concept to outside people.

It built the Neuch√¢tel-Pontarlier railway.  History  Saint-Sulpice Bond of the Franco-Suisse Eisenbahn company, issued July 1868 The French company, Paris‚ÄìLyon‚ÄìMediterranean Railway (PLM) sought to connect its network with the Swiss network. To achieve this, it founded in 1856 with other investors the Franco‚ÄìSwiss Company, and subscribed 40% of the capital for the construction of a railway line from Pontarlier in France to the Swiss border at Les Verri√®res through the Val-de-Travers to Neuch√¢tel. On 7 November 1859 the company opened a line from Vaumarcus (extending the West Switzerland Company's line from Yverdon-les-Bains) to the village of Frienisberg, near Le Landeron on Lake Biel, part of what is now called the Jura Foot Railway. A temporary station was established at a pier in Frienisberg for a link by boat across Lake Biel to Nidau near Biel, which was served by trains of the Swiss Central Railway on its section of the Jura foot line from Olten via Herzogenbuchsee. On 25 July 1860, the line (now the Neuch√¢tel-Pontarlier railway) from Auvernier on the Jura Foot Railway to Les Verri√®res on the Swiss border opened, connecting with the Frasne‚ÄìLes Verri√®res line of the PLM. The construction of the line proved quite difficult requiring numerous engineering works. In order to achieve a maximum gradient of 2% between Auvernier and the crest at Les Bayards the line had many cuttings and tunnels. Four lives were lost in the work. PLM rollingstock was originally used on both routes; soon international trains operated from Paris to Neuch√¢tel via Les Verri√®res. The line was not profitable as its rival, the Swiss Central Railway carried most traffic between Switzerland and France over the border at Basel.

Detail of the giant round painting by Edouard Castres in the Bourbaki Panorama in Lucerne. The railway played an important role in the Franco-Prussian War, when during January and February 1871, the French Arm√©e de l'Est with 87,000 men under General Bourbaki retreated into Switzerland and were disarmed and interned in Les Verri√®res. On 22 March when the interned troops were released and were being repatriated by train a collision occurred due to an incorrect setting of points. The driver and 22 internees were killed and 72 soldiers were injured, some seriously. On 1 January 1872, the Western Swiss Railway (French: Chemins de Fer de la Suisse Occidentale, SO) was formed out of a merger of the Franco‚ÄìSwiss Company with the West Switzerland Company (Compagnie de l'Ouest- Suisse, OS) and the Lausanne‚ÄìFribourg‚ÄìBern Railway (Chemin de Fer Lausanne- Bern-Fribourg, LFB). Rolling stock Since operations were run first by the PLM and then from 1 January 1865 by an operating arrangement of FS, OS and LFB called the \\"Association des chemins de fer de la Suisse Occidentale\\", Franco- Swiss did not have its own rolling stock.

The character, created by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, first appeared in the 2013 pilot episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has continually been portrayed by Ming-Na Wen.  Fictional character biography  In season one, Melinda May is brought on to the recently resurrected S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson's team as pilot and field agent, to investigate superhumans and other related phenomena. She is shown to be in a relationship with fellow agent Grant Ward. Coulson tells agent Skye that May, during a mission in Bahrain in 2008, single-handedly took out a superhuman threat and several accomplices, saving a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, though a young girl was killed in the crossfire. Left traumatized by the experience, May withdrew from field duty. Later, her trauma is shown to be gradually healing. She also ends her relationship with Ward. Unknown to Skye and Coulson, May is monitoring their conversation, and reporting to someone else. When the Hydra Uprising begins, May reveals that she knew the truth about Coulson's resurrection and was monitoring him on director Nick Fury's orders, and Coulson refuses to trust her any more. Feeling unwanted, she leaves, searching to find out the truth behind Coulson's resurrection. She finds the truth and brings it back to Coulson. May later incapacitates Ward, who was a double agent for Hydra, and after Ward's mentor John Garrett's death, goes with the team to the Playground to help restart S.H.I.E.L.D., under the newly promoted director Coulson. In season two, May is Coulson's unofficial deputy. She later meets her ex-husband Andrew Garner. When another S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by Robert Gonzales emerges and occupies their base, May helps Coulson to escape, but later accepts a position on Gonzales' board. It is revealed that in 2008 at Bahrain, the Inhuman Eva Belyakov and some gangsters took a S.H.I.E.L.D. team and several locals hostage, and May entered the building they were using to rescue the hostages. She found them acting out of character, and they attacked her, but she defeated them and killed Eva in a fight, before discovering Eva's daughter Katya was the real threat, having taken control of the hostages to feed on their pain. When Katya killed the Bahrainis she was controlling, May was forced to kill Katya. S.H.I.E.L.D. assumed Eva was the threat and Katya was caught in the crossfire, and May was lauded for saving the S.H.I.E.L.D. team single-handedly and given the nickname 'the Cavalry'. However she became deeply traumatized; her marriage to Garner also suffered, eventually leading to divorce. When the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions unite, May becomes a member of Coulson's council of advisors. At the end of the season, May takes a break from S.H.I.E.L.D. to be with Garner. In season three, May has been on leave from S.H.I.E.L.D. for six months and is looking after her father, who was injured in a car accident. Lance Hunter hopes that May will help him find and kill an absconding Ward, and notes that she suspects that Ward was behind her father's accident, but May is hiding from her life at S.H.I.E.L.D. and difficulties in her relationships with Garner and Coulson. May is eventually convinced by her father that getting back into her S.H.I.E.L.D. life by going with Hunter is the best thing for her, and the two leave to infiltrate the new ranks of Hydra. She later learns that Garner is the Inhuman serial killer Lash. May struggles with this revelation; she continues to work in S.H.I.E.L.D. as the agency attempts to bring down Gideon Malick and later Hive, losing Garner in this battle. In season four, following the re- legalization of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the appointment of Jeffrey Mace as director, May is given the task of rebuilding and training the new STRIKE team. During one of her missions, she is touched by Lucy Bauer, a woman with ghost-like powers, causing her to become paranoid. Agent Jemma Simmons and S.H.I.E.L.D. ally Holden Radcliffe \\"cure\\" May by killing and reviving her. Prior to S.H.I.E.L.D. victory's on Eli Morrow, May was incapacitated and kidnapped by Radcliffe's android Aida and was replaced by an android decoy of herself. After several escape attempts, May's mind is trapped inside the Framework, a virtual reality where she lives as a Hydra agent. With the help of Skye (who now goes by her real name Daisy Johnson) and Simmons, May eventually escapes the Framework, only to face the threat of Aida, now an Inhuman. Following Aida's defeat, May and the others are sent to the year 2091 by an unknown force. In season five, May and the others find themselves in the Lighthouse, a bunker used to contain the rest of humanity following Earth's destruction. May is captured by the Kree who rule over the station and sent to Earth's surface. There she meets Robin Hinton, who had been raised by May in her past. Discovering the way to return to the present, May and the others return to the Lighthouse and manage to return to the present. They immediately work to prevent the destruction of Earth, come into conflict with General Hale's Hydra, and later with an extraterrestrial force called the Confederacy. Following their victory over a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, thus saving Earth, May joins Coulson, who is dying, on his final days on Tahiti. In season six, May assists in dealing with threats involving Sarge's group and Izel. She like Daisy believes that she can get Coulson back through Sarge, but gets mortally stabbed by Sarge and sent to a dimension where Sarge and Izel are trying to free their kind on Earth. May survives as death is meaningless in this dimension, and prevents three of Izel's people from unleashing their kind. After returning to Earth, she kills Izel and collapses from her injuries, while Mack kills Sarge. Simmons arrives and places May in a stasis pod so that she can recuperate. In season seven, May is healed by Enoch, a Chronicom and ally of S.H.I.E.L.D., but she escapes from her stasis pod without his knowledge. Following her recovery, she appears to have no emotions; Yo-Yo Rodriguez and Simmons discover that May has lost her own emotions but instead can feel everyone else's whenever she is in proximity of them. After infiltrating the Chronicom ship to save Daisy's sister Kora, May overpowers Sybil, the leader of the Chronicom hunters, and combines her abilities with Kora's to magnify a beacon of empathy into the Chronicom army, stopping their assault on S.H.I.E.L.D. Following the defeat of Sybil, a year later, May is a professor at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Coulson Academy.  Concept and creation  Wen was cast as May in October 2012. Whedon had the character, who was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets, \\"rolling around in his head\\" for a long time. In preparation for the role, Wen was \\"given a couple of background stories\\" about May, but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her when the audience doesn't know why, stating \\"It's a challenge in different ways....I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed\\". When May's past was revealed in \\"Melinda\\", Wen called it \\"devastating\\", explaining \\"She was married, she was in love with Andrew, she had a job that she excelled at and loved and believed in‚Äîso her world was pretty perfect...To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many...I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat.\\" The character is of Chinese descent, like the actress portraying her, although she was not written that way. May's shirt is the same blue as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in The Avengers such as Maria Hill, so as to have some continuity between her uniform and those established in the films. The rest of her costume is inspired by military flight suits, including a leather vest, and pants with stretch panels to aid with fighting.  Characterization  Following the series premiere, Wen teased the character, saying that \\"she's very much the observer, and whenever she wants to put in her two cents, it's something that you want to listen to and kind of pay attention to...She's slow in getting acclimated to part of the group and being in the field again.\\" Talking about May's reasons for staying with S.H.I.E.L.D., Wen explained \\"May's friendship and...loyalty and her love for Coulson [keeps her there]. Maybe not romantic [love], it's just really‚Äîit's hard to describe‚Äîit's a bond, it's unbreakable, and she will watch over Coulson and take care of him and help him through whatever he needs to at this point in his life... She wants to be there for him, and if it serves S.H.I.E.L.D., that's just more or less a side effect, really.\\" Wen admitted that May develops a relationship with Skye over the course of the series, going from thinking of Skye as \\"someone that she didn't want as part of the team and didn't understand why Coulson wanted her\\" to wanting Skye \\"to be the best agent that she can be.\\" After discovering that Skye is an Inhuman, Wen stated that \\"it's like when you have your child or your daughter losing control or getting involved with situations or people that you‚Äôre not sure about. You don't have the control anymore. It's very frightening. For Skye to be an unknown entity, May still holds out hope. She hopes that her training with her will help her be able to control her new powers, but you never know. Sometimes the power overtakes everything else.\\" On how May deals with her ex-husband Andrew becoming the Inhuman killer Lash, Wen said, \\"She's come to the understanding that it was something he had no control over. The betrayal might be not sharing that information of what happened to him with her. I think she understands that, in a way, he was scared and trying to be protective of their relationship and doing it all for the wrong reasons. I think, ultimately, Agent May is kind of shut down when it comes to Lash and Andrew at this point. That's why she's re-focusing all her energy back into S.H.I.E.L.D., back being by Coulson's side. That's where she's most comfortable.\\" Wen went on to describe May as \\"unconventionally maternal...she's taking care of Simmons and really believing that she needs to be able to protect herself, she's very, very concerned about the family's well being.\\"  Reception  Wen received nominations for 'Favorite Actress in a New TV Series' at the 40th People's Choice Awards and 'Favorite Female TV Star ‚Äì Family Show' at the 29th Kids' Choice Awards. Wen was also named TVLine's \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in \\"Melinda\\", specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences.  Other appearances  = Comics = May made her Marvel Comics debut in S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol. 3 #1 (February 2015) from Mark Waid and Carlos Pacheco. She joined Phil Coulson's team to regain the Uru Sword, an ancient weapon that belonged to Heimdall. She battled a group of terrorists who were in possession of it and was later debriefed by Maria Hill. Her next assignment was protecting Wiccan from a man who had special bullets that could harm magic users. With Scarlet Witch's help, the team traveled to Antarctica to find the source and managed to defeat the people who were making the bullets.

Hall was an uncredited co-writer of the rockabilly classic \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\", a song recorded by Hall himself and later popularized by Jerry Lee Lewis. Although his writing claim was initially disputed, later reissues of the song credit Hall for his role in its conception. Biography Hall was born in Big Stone Gap, Virginia in 1922. Although he is often stated to have learned the piano from a local blues player who also turned Hall into a drunkard by his early teens, he was actually first introduced to the instrument by his mother. Hall cited Piano Red as his primary influence in his playing style. After performing in his home town, Hall accompanied Uncle Dave Macon in 1933 in a traveling broadcast for the Grand Ole Opry. While working for a sibling group called the Hall Brothers, the third brother, Roy Hall, died in a car accident in 1943. Hall adopted the brother's name for his stage moniker, and formed his own band, the Cohutta Mountain Boys. It was a five- piece band, with Tommy Odum (lead guitar), Bud White (rhythm guitar), Flash Griner (bass guitar), and Frankie Brumbalough (fiddle). In 1949, the band cut their first record, which included a hillbilly boogie-woogie song called \\"Dirty Boogie\\", with two different B-sides released on the independent record label, Fortune Records, in Detroit, Michigan. The single became a jukebox favorite in the Midwest; however, its followups, which delved more into traditional country music, failed to match the initial success produced by \\"Dirty Boogie\\". The Cohutta Mountain Boys' popularity earned them, briefly, a supporting role for singer Tennessee Ernie Ford in Nashville. Afterwards, the band continued a journeymen existence, eventually returning to Detroit where Hall assembled a new group, the Eagles, and recorded material for Citation Records. However, the group could not sustain itself, and in 1950 Hall moved to Nashville to record two solo singles for Bullet Records and another for Tennessee Records in 1951; the releases were commercially unsuccessful. He then opened a music and gambling club called the Music Box, later renamed the Musicians' Hideaway, where he was a regular performer. Hall claimed that Elvis Presley performed there one night in 1954, but Hall fired him because \\"he weren't no damn good.\\" He also claimed that, in the same year, Jerry Lee Lewis played there for several weeks. Between 1954 and 1955, Hall recorded with Webb Pierce, Marty Robbins, and Hawkshaw Hawkins. In 1954, Hall met black musician Dave \\"Curlee\\" Williams and while on vacation in the Everglades Hall co-wrote, under the pseudonym \\"Sunny David\\", the song \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\". Hall said: > We was down in Pahokee, on Lake Okeechobee.. out on a damn pond, fishin' and > milkin' snakes .. drinkin' wine, mostly.. This guy down there had a big bell > that he's ring to get us all to come in to dinner, an' I'd call over [and] > say, 'What's goin' on?' Colored guy said, 'We got twen'y-one drums, we got > an old bass horn, an' they even keepin' time on a ding-dong.' See, that was > the big bell they'd ring to git us t'come in. Pierce arranged a recording session for Hall at Decca Records, and on September 15, 1955 he recorded three songs, including \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\". By this time Big Maybelle had already recorded her own variation of the song for OKeh Records, which resulted in a moderate national hit. Hall's recording contract with Decca concluded in 1956 with no sizable hit, as a consequence of ineffective promoting. Jerry Lee Lewis achieved a number 3 hit in 1957 with \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\", instantly launching him into national prominence. Although Hall was in line for royalties, his ex-wife successfully sued for his share, and on early issues of Lewis' single Hall is not credited. On March 3, 1984, Hall died at the age of 61 in Nashville, not long after releasing his debut album Diggin' the Boogie. In 2005, Bear Family Records released the compilation album Roy Rocks, which compiles all of Hall's released material.

He will be killed in Mecca and his death is one of the signs of Muhammad al-Mahdi's reappearance. Appellation Nafs-e- Zakiyyah is a person by the name of Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. He is a descendant of Husayn ibn Ali. He is named Nafse-e-Zakiyyah because he is very pious and devout and another reason for his nickname is that he will be slain without any sin and crime. Duty of Nafs-e-Zakiyyah The duty of Nafs-e-Zakiyyah is mentioned in a hadith that was narrated by Abu-Basir from Muhammad al-Baqir. According to the hadith, when Muhammad al-Mahdi realizes, the people of Mecca won't accept his reappearance. Therefore, he will send Nafs-e-Zakiyyah as an envoy to convey his oral message to people of Mecca. Certain sign of reappearance According to narrations, the murder of Nafs-e-Zakiyyah is one of the certain signs of reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi. The hadith of Ja'far al-Sadiq mentions these signs: \\"there are five signs for our Dhuhur (the reappearance of the twelfth Imam), the appearance of Sufyani and Yamani, the loud cry in the sky, the martyr of Nafs-e-Zakiyyah, and the earth swallowing (a group of people) in the land of Beyda.\\" Place and time of murder He will be slayed by people of Mecca around the Ka'ba after imparting the Imam's message to them. Ibn Babawayh in his work mentions a hadith of Ja'far al-Sadiq that says the uprising of Muhammad al-Mahdi will occur 15 days after the murder of Nafse Zakkeyah. According to Shia beliefs, Nafs-e-Zakiyyah is a sign that will occur before Muhammad al-Mahdi‚Äôs appearance, who will be killed between Rukn and Maqame Ibrahim (Position of Ibrahim) in the ambit of Ka‚Äôba. Al-Irshad contains biographies of each of the fourteen infallibles and says the reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi will occur at an interval of 15 days after this event.

The character, created by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, first appeared in the pilot episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in 2013, and has continually been portrayed by Iain De Caestecker. In the series, Fitz is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientific minds. His scientific knowledge is vast, and as an engineer and inventor has developed many of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s staple devices and gadgets. Many of his storylines involve his relationship with his best friend, and later lover, Jemma Simmons. Over the course of the series, Fitz suffers multiple traumas, and becomes aware of a darker and more ruthless side to his character. His darker alter-ego is commonly known as The Doctor.  Fictional character biography  In season one, Leo Fitz is brought on to S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson's team as an engineering and weapons technology specialist. He has a close bond with fellow agent Jemma Simmons, whom he met at the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, with both being its Science and Technology division's youngest graduates. Near the end of the season, Fitz and Simmons lock themselves inside a medical unit for safety from rogue agent Grant Ward, who ejects the unit into the ocean. While trapped, Fitz professes his feelings for Simmons before sacrificing himself to save her. They are rescued by Nick Fury, but Fitz sustains damage to his temporal lobe as a result of oxygen deprivation and is left comatose. In season two, Fitz initially struggles with technology and speech as a result of Ward's actions, but over time becomes a full member of the team again. Near the end of the season, as Fitz arranges for a date with Simmons, a Kree weapon called the \\"Monolith\\", which is in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, breaks free of containment and absorbs Simmons into itself. In season three, Fitz acquires an ancient Hebrew scroll describing the Monolith that consumed Simmons as \\"Death\\" (), which Fitz is unable to accept. Unknown to him, Simmons is alive on a desolate alien planet. Fitz realizes that the Monolith is a portal, and with help from the Asgardian Elliot Randolph and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson, is able to enter the portal. He finds Simmons and is able to rescue her just as Daisy's power destroys the Monolith. Simmons later tells Fitz about the six months she spent stranded on the desert planet. Fitz and Simmons eventually consummate their relationship. In season four, Fitz discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. ally Holden Radcliffe has created the android Aida, and agrees to help perfect her, while initially keeping this from Simmons. When Fitz's consciousness is submerged in the Framework, a virtual reality created by Radcliffe, he becomes \\"The Doctor\\", Hydra's remorseless second-in-command, and has a relationship with Aida, who now goes by Ophelia / Madame Hydra. After he creates for Aida a machine to become a real person, Fitz is forced out of the Framework, and is traumatized from his behavior there. But when Aida learns Fitz does not love her back, she plans her revenge on him. S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually succeeds in defeating her. Shortly after, everyone in the team except Fitz are taken away by an unknown group. In season five, the team have been transported to a space station in the future, with only Fitz left behind. Fitz is taken into military custody, but broken out six months later with Lance Hunter's help. Enoch, a Chronicom, helps him escape to a secret bunker where Fitz learns that he was left behind so he could save the team. Aboard Enoch's ship, Fitz goes into stasis until Enoch awakens him 74 years later when they reach their destination. After Fitz and the team return to the present, Fitz and Simmons marry in a ceremony organized by S.H.I.E.L.D. Due to multiple stressful factors, Fitz experiences a psychic split which enables his \\"Doctor\\" personality from the Framework to temporarily resurface. During the final battle against a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, Fitz is buried under a rubble and later found fatally injured when dug out by fellow agents Melinda May and Mack where he succumbs to his wounds. Simmons resolves to find the present version of Fitz, who is in stasis aboard Enoch's ship. In season six, as Daisy and Simmons lead the search for Fitz, Enoch releases Fitz prematurely when they come under attack. They reach the planet Kitson, where Fitz and Simmons reunite until the assassin Malachi makes off with Fitz. For Fitz's safety, Simmons surrenders herself to Atarah, Enoch's former superior, so that the two of them can come up with a time- traveling method for the Chronicoms to use. Atarah traps Fitz and Simmons inside their own minds, forcing them to work together in figuring out time travel logic. The duo are ultimately freed by Enoch, who manages to overpower Atarah and her forces. The trio then teleport away, but end up again on Kitson, where Fitz and Simmons are saved from execution by mercenary Izel, who helps them on their return to Earth while Enoch bids them farewell. Izel believes Fitz and Simmons are conspiring against her, so she commands her ship's crew to eliminate them. The two are ultimately rescued by a team led by Mack, and return to Earth. While S.H.I.E.L.D stops Izel, Fitz and Simmons are ambushed by the Chronicom Hunters, but saved by Enoch who helps them achieve time travel as well as create a Coulson LMD to help them fight the Hunters. In season 7, Fits stays behind while the rest of the team is transported to the past to stop the Chronicoms from invading the Earth. Through the journey of the team Fitz is seen missing but aiding the team in their mission, carefully plotting the perfect plan for the survival of the team and the entire human race. Toward the end Fitz finally teleports from the main timeline to the branched of timeline after Simmons assembles the device. Fitz then devises yet another plan to bring his friend and the enemy Chronicoms back to the original timeline, which he achieves successfully. The team along with Fitz successfully destroy the Chronicoms' invasion scheme. Fitz and Simmons reunite with their daughter Alya, and a year later, decide to retire from S.H.I.E.L.D. to raise Alya.  Concept and creation  Iain De Caestecker was cast as Leo Fitz in November 2012. Following injuries Fitz receives at the end of the first season, the series began to deal with brain trauma, as De Caestecker explained \\"From the get-go, before I even knew about it, the writers had the idea, and they did a lot of research in it with doctors. When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure‚ÄîI don't know if that could happen.\\" For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without \\"getting too clich√©...we try and play up his \\"heritage style\\"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids.\\" The character is Scottish. Despite being announced as a main cast member for the seventh season, De Caestecker does not appear in the first ten episodes, as he was working on another project when the season started filming. He first appears in flashback sequences in \\"Brand New Day\\", receiving special guest star credit for his appearance.  Characterization  De Caestecker, in describing the character, said that \\"Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He's quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where‚ÄîI don't think he's someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn't really understand emotions as much\\". Fitz has a lot of interaction with Simmons in the series, with De Caestecker explaining \\"My character, he's Engineering, so he's on the computer and tech side of everything. He's consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who's Biochem. They‚Äôve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way.\\" Regarding the changing dynamic over time between Fitz and Simmons, De Caestecker said \\"I suppose what's happened from the start of season two up to midseason is, they've become a lot stronger as individuals, I think. But I think they still care for and need each other a lot, and they also work better together when they are together. But I think there's a lot of things that have still been unsaid and will hopefully come out, certain confrontations that are still bubbling under.\\" Fitz also develops a close friendship with Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, beginning when the latter joins the cast in season two.  Reception  Reviewing the season 1 episode \\"0-8-4\\", Eric Goldman of IGN criticized the lack of development for the majority of main characters, specifically Fitz and Simmons as he did with the pilot episode. However, he was more positive while reviewing \\"FZZT\\", praising it for finally giving the \\"well-needed\\" development of them both. De Caestecker was named TVLine's \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of September 27, 2015, for his performance in \\"Laws of Nature\\", particularly the episode's final scene.

It is open between June and September, with most of its scheduled summer program commencing shortly after June solstice and concluding on or shortly after Labor Day weekend. A few workshops and other events take place before or afterwards. Nestled at the southeastern edge of the White Mountain National Forest, directly east of Mount Chocorua off Route 16 in Albany, it currently comprises approximately , including a conference room and dining lodge, nature trails, soccer field, several cabins, campsites and additional lodging facilities, as well as boating and swimming access on a large pond. At capacity it can host approximately 150 guests and features speakers, groups, organizations, activists, artists and entertainers from around the world. History The name \\"World Fellowship\\" is derived from the World Fellowship of Faiths, which was officially established as an organization in 1929. In 1937, shortly before the outbreak of World War Two, activist, philanthropist, suffragist, and feminist Lola Maverick Lloyd (1875-1944) propounded the notion of world government, essentially a forerunner to the United Nations, whereby nation-states would be dissolved and there would be one democratically elected government of all people. Lloyd saw the League of Nations, created in late 1918 in the aftermath of World War One, as doomed to fail since it was dominated by the very same war-mongering nations that supported the first World War.http://www.worldservice.org/issues/febmar97/lml.html It was Lloyd's colleague, Charles Frederick Weller (1870-1957), who had been a speechwriter for Theodore Roosevelt, and Weller's wife Eugenia (n√©e Winston, 1872-1956), who first conceived the idea of a summer retreat and conference center devoted to peace and social justice issues and causes some time in the late 1930s. The year 1940 proved to be paramount for the Weller couple - with much of the world engulfed in war, their adult son died. Shortly thereafter, Charles embarked on a 15-day-long meditation and fast on nearby Mount Whiteface, during which he conceived the notion of creating a more permanent place for the World Fellowship of Faiths. Afterwards, Charles and Eugenia selected a plot known as the Draper Estate, located in Albany, which was for sale for $5,000. After making a down payment of $500, the Wellers contacted Lloyd and requested her to pay $2,500; many additional, smaller contributions were amassed in the purchase of the land. Despite the name \\"World Fellowship of Faiths,\\" which has at times provoked skepticism and dubiety amongst newcomers, World Fellowship has never been officially aligned or affiliated with any religious denomination. The first official year of operation was summer 1941, during which an attendance of 253 people was recorded.Uphaus, Willard. Commitment. McGraw Hill, pp.119-120 The initial theme/mission statement was \\"In a time of war, prepare for peace.\\" The Wellers assumed the position of directorship for the first twelve summers, from 1941 to 1952. Shortly thereafter, Eugenia died in 1956, and Charles in 1957. In August 1952, Willard Uphaus (1890-1983), a retired Methodist theologian and pacifist, and his wife Ola (n√©e Hawkins) Uphaus (1897-1972), a social worker,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/14/archives/mrs-ola-h-uphaus-wr-o- pa___clrsr-75.html first visited, and became directors in June 1953. Uphaus had previously been fired from Hastings College in Nebraska in 1930 for advocating radical viewpoints, and he remained committed to a pacifist philosophy during World War Two. In September of that year, a series of articles published by Greg Abbott in the Manchester Union Leader (New Hampshire's only statewide newspaper) maligned Uphaus by branding him as a Communist. The Union Leader had been acquired in 1946 by arch-conservative publisher William Loeb III, and would be used successfully by Loeb to set New Hampshire's political stage for decades to come. Subsequently, in early 1954, with the Red Scare and McCarthyism in full swing, Governor Hugh Gregg, invoking the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act of 1951, directed Attorney General Louis Wyman to issue a summons for Uphaus mandating that he surrender a list of all attendees and all employees of the World Fellowship Center, out of suspicion that World Fellowship may have had connections to the Communist Party, or was itself a Communist organization. Uphaus steadfastly refused to comply with these demands on the grounds that as a practicing Christian, to do so would be to bear false witness; additionally, it would violate and jeopardize the civil rights and liberties of innocent people.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/364/388 This act of resistance commenced a five-year long legal battle that involved numerous subpoenas and appeals. In an attempt to clarify what the Attorney General's demands were (since World Fellowship already had a publicly accessible guest list for tax purposes) Uphaus visited Wyman at his office in Concord in the spring of 1954 in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Wyman that any additional list of names would be unreasonable, unnecessary and a breach of professional integrity. In September 1958, the case eventually made its to way the United States Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in June 1959 in favor of the Attorney General.Commitment, p. 173 In December of that year Uphaus was sentenced to a year in jail for contempt of court. The sentence lasted from December 14, 1959, to December 13, 1960. The Uphaus couple remained directors until 1969.The New Hampshire Century, p. 199 Ola died in 1972, and Willard in 1983.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/obituaries/dr-willard-uphaus-leader- of-pacifist-causes-in-the-50-s.html In 1966, Katheryn \\"Kit\\" Schmauch (n√©e Hively, b. 1933) and her husband Christoph Schmauch (n√© Werner Schmauch - b. 1935) first visited and agreed to take on the role of directorship in 1969, assuming full responsibility in 1970. Kit, a teacher, was from Columbus, Ohio; Christoph was a Lutheran minister from Breslau, East Germany, who had immigrated to the United States in the late 1950s. They had four children when they assumed the position, and have had by far the longest tenure of directorship to date. In the over 30 years that they were involved with World Fellowship, they successfully transformed it from a small-scale and relatively obscure conference center to a moderate-sized and internationally known counter-cultural haven by making numerous expansions, additions, capital and social improvements and liaisons with other politically inspired networks and organizations throughout both the U.S. and Europe. These included the purchase of and the construction of bunkhouse dormitories and other lodging facilities for seasonal workers, as well as the construction of a year-round Cape house for the directors. They instituted a stipend for employees (prior to that, all wages were based on tips left by guests), purchased laundry facilities, upgraded and expanded the kitchen (prior to their arrival the galley kitchen, which is currently the guest kitchen, was where all meals except breakfast were prepared); installed commercial-scale refrigerators; drilled an artesian well on site; arranged for weekly trash collection; constructed a wide variety of recreational facilities such as a basketball court, volleyball court, and soccer field; and added numerous rowboats, canoes and an additional raft to the swimming area of the pond. With the acquired acreage, they blazed nature trails for hiking and established weekly guided nature walks. They expanded the program to include a children's fellowship, and for each week of the summer to have a different theme with several guest lecturers invited to speak about various issues pertaining to peace and social justice. In terms of staff networking, the Schmauchs introduced numerous people from Europe (particularly Christoph's native Germany, France and the former Soviet bloc) to World Fellowship without ever using outside advertising. They remained co-directors through the 2000 season; afterwards, they lived in nearby Conway until the 2010s, subsequently relocating to Columbus. In May 2000, Andrew Davis (born 1961) and his wife Andrea Walsh (born 1962), living with their infant daughter at the time in Keene, New Hampshire became directors. During their tenure, they have labored to increase the presence, visibility, and attendance rates of people of color, and transgender/genderqueer/non-binary people as well as upgrade the lodging facilities to comply with fire safety regulations, and improve accessibility to alter-abled people. They have also made the buildings more energy efficient and have worked with nearby farms to have more produce delivered on site. With regards to program changes, they have expanded the season to include weddings in June and September (occasionally weddings have been held in July and August as well) and have created more programs, venues, opportunities and workshops pertaining to the visual arts and body movement (such as yoga, Capoeira Angola and Feldenkrais). In 2007, they created a recreation coordinator position to arrange daily cycling excursions in the surrounding area in the morning as well as hiking expeditions in the White Mountains in the afternoon.World Fellowship Center official website Governance The governing body of World Fellowship is a board of trustees, composed of nine to twelve members, each of whom serves a three-year term. The board meets with the co-directors throughout the year to oversee the work of the non-profit organization. The decision-making process is conducted via majority rule. Whitton Pond Workstaff The work crew is hired personally by the directors each year in the spring, usually between March and May. Every employee has a different length of stay, depending on how long they are able to commit, though there are a few year-round positions who work alongside the directors. In the past, workers were paid wages below the state and federal threshold but were compensated by not having to pay for their room and board; currently they are paid higher than federal minimum wage. Most workers are housed in the dorms on-site and work as general staff - alternating daily between housekeeping, dining crew and/or dish pot teams; there are also a few staff hired to do specific tasks (such as farm crew and special projects/maintenance). Additionally, there is a set of staff hired to be the established manager of a particular crew, such as lodge manager, dining hall manager and office manager. Finally, there is also one staff co-ordinator who collaborates with the directors in terms of staff oversight. As World Fellowship has a small budget for outside communication and other outreach, almost all staff are acquired through word-of-mouth. As a result, many of the employees have either familial or other close connections to long-time attendees, though there are also some foreign employees who have obtained visas or other temporary work permits. Landscape and buildings On the World Fellowship main site there is Lloyd Lodge (built in various stages from the 19th century onwards), the primary lodging facility, which has a commercial-sized kitchen, a dining hall, a galley kitchen, eighteen guest rooms and seven full-bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, and an alter-abled accessible showering facility, two screened-in porches and a veranda, a parlor, and a conference room (referred to as the old conference room), which has a library and fireplace. In addition to the old conference room, there is a one-room building (Schmauch House), constructed in the late 1990s, which currently functions as the primary conference and discussion room. Schmauch house is reached via an engraved brick pathway, completed in the late 2000s from donations from numerous guests, and has a nearby composting toilet and memorial wall (featuring the headstones of several guests). Also on site are a gazebo, picnic tables, a firepit, outdoor grill, basketball and volleyball courts, a chalet, a playground, two dormitories, a Cape house used to house the directors year-round as well as house guests in the summer, a rope swing, a private cabin (which functions as the directors' summertime residence) and chicken coop adjacent to an enclosure that housed Saanens used for cheesemaking from 2008 to 2015. Prominently featured in numerous photographs taken on site (especially staff photos) is a sizable granite boulder (typically referred to as \\"peace rock\\") encircled by a flower garden, and a peace pole with a superb view of the eastern face of Mount Chocorua. Located a quarter of a mile southwest along Drake Hill Road is Uphaus Lodge (constructed prior to 1948), to which the staff recreational room is attached. Adjacent to that building are several garden beds. Nearly a mile farther southwest, close to the Route 16 southern entrance, there is a cottage, a soccer field, and Weller House. This colonial-style house, purchased in 1958 but built in the early 19th century (c. 1820), is currently the oldest building on site since the demolition of the farmhouse. The primary parking lot is surrounded by several campsites, which provide the most economical lodging options. Just beyond the campsite area, there are the nature trails, which start out as one trail, diverging to the right after approximately a tenth of mile into a self- guided half-mile loop with considerable elevation gain featuring 20 stopping points. The other trail, which leads directly to the swimming and boating area of Whitton Pond, crosses two footbridges and is relatively even terrain. Whitton Pond, which covers approximately and is a maximum of deep,http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/maps/bathymetry/whitton_albany.pdf extends over the town border of Madison, has several islands and abuts numerous neighboring properties. At present the pond has very few settlements and is free of motor boats, making it a prime location for swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rowing, fishing, berry-picking and bird-watching. Throughout the summer, numerous other townsfolk and other non-guests make use of the trail on site and the swimming facilities. For much of World Fellowship's existence there was a large 18th-century farmhouse (unnamed, and simply referred to as \\"the farmhouse\\") across from the soccer field and cottage that functioned as lodging quarters with over a dozen rooms, and, in the early days, a dining parlor where breakfast was served prior to the Schmauch era (a prominent signed proclaimed it \\"the Albany Coffeehouse\\" as well). Immediately adjacent is Whitman Hall, which was previously used as a performance venue and is now used as a storage facility. During the winter of 2007‚Äì2008, the farmhouse building incurred numerous damages necessitating a variety of costly electrical and other repairs; subsequently the governing board voted to discontinue it as a lodging facility in 2008. In 2009, the decision was made to have the farmhouse demolished completely in the spring of 2010. As a result, beginning in 2008, off-site cabins located farther northeast on Drake Hill Road were rented, and in the following years, beginning in 2010, a small plot of forested land adjacent the main parking lot was cleared, and two cabins were built between 2016 and 2018. During this time, an additional capital campaign was launched to have a bathhouse and several additional cabins constructed in the vicinity. Drake Hill Road, upon which all World Fellowship facilities are located, forms an approximately curved tangent to Route 16 and provides access to the site via Route 16 from both the south (close to mile marker 69) and the north (close to mile marker 72). The World Fellowship welcoming sign on the southern (primary) entrance off Route 16 has been defaced and damaged (by graffiti, gunshot and Molotov cocktail) on several occasions during the time that the World Fellowship Center has existed, reflecting the often strained relationship World Fellowship has had with the nearby communities. During Uphaus's period of directorship, the sign included the words, \\"All Races Welcome\\",Commitment, p. 121 thereby occasionally attracting people of color who happened to be passing through in an otherwise overwhelmingly white region. In decades subsequent, particularly the 1960s and 1970s, World Fellowship was seen both externally and internally as a safe haven for radicals who expressed socialist, Marxist, and/or other leftist viewpoints - this stood in stark contrast to the rest of Carroll County, which was solidly conservative. In recent years, most tensions have eased and interactions and relations between World Fellowship and the surrounding towns have generally been civil. Ecology At an elevation of approximately above sea level (with the highest point on site being just under ), the forest ecosystem on site is typical of the New England/Acadian forests biome with conifers such as the eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) interspersed with hardwoods such as American beech (Fagus grandifolia), a few species of birch (mostly paper/Betula papyrifera and yellow/gray/Betula alleghaniensis), several species of maple (such as sugar/Acer saccharum, red/Acer rubrum and striped/Acer pensylvanicum), oak (almost entirely the northern red oak/Quercus rubra), and ash (mostly white ash/Fraxinus americana). Less common hardwoods include quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) as well as pin (Prunus pensylvanica) and choke (Prunus virginiana) cherry; less common conifers include balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black (Picea mariana) and red (Picea rubens) spruce, northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis) and red pine (Pinus resinosa). The understory consists of such shrubs and other ground plants include wintergreen/teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens), hobble-bush (Viburnum lantanoides) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), at least two varieties of blueberry (genus Vaccinium), as well as several species of aster (family Asteraceae). Other forest-dwelling plants include Indian pipe (Monotropa uniflora) and lady slipper (Cypripedium parviflorum). In the wetland areas of the property, water lily (family Nymphaeaceae), loosestrife (genus Lythrum) and the purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) abound. Fauna include several species of rodents - such as rat (genus Rattus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus). Amphibians such as the toad (genus Bufo), spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) and bullfrog (genus Lithobates), and reptiles such as a few species of snake have been observed. Throughout June, July and early August encounters with mosquitoes (family Culicidae) and deer flies (genus Chrysops) are inevitable. Numerous passerine and songbirds such as the titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), purple finch (Haemorhous purpureus), black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), jays/crows (family Corvidae), wren (family Troglodytidae), warbler (family Parulidae), dove (family Columbidae), woodpecker (family Picidae) and thrush (family Turdidae) have been spotted. Birds of prey encountered include owls, especially the barred owl (Strix varia), and hawks (mostly genus Buteo). Throughout the day, but most frequently during the crepuscular and predawn hours, the trill and tremolo of the common loon (Gavia immer) can be heard on the pond. Far less frequently encountered, but occasionally reported, are sights of black bear (Ursus americanus), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), fisher (Pekania pennanti) and moose (Alces alces). Fungi commonly encountered on site include several species of Amanita (family Amanitaceae), Hydnum (family Hydnaceae), milk-caps (genus Lactarius) and a variety of other genera, prominent among which include Cortinarius, Leccinum, Collybia, Hericium, Clavulina, Russula, and Suillus. Some of these species/genera are known to be edible (such as chicken-of-the-woods Laetiporus sulphureus) and are included in the fungal foray late in the season. In August 2019, 400 of World Fellowship's 455 acres were officially put into a conservation easement through the local Upper Saco Valley Land Trust (named after Kit Schmauch, who originally had the vision to do so) to ensure that they will remain undeveloped indefinitely. Room nomenclature In keeping with World Fellowship's mission statement and commitment to honoring activists, most lodging facilities (except Uphaus Lodge) have rooms that are named after historical figures committed to social justice and/or peace-related causes. Some of these were actual guests - such as economist, pacifist and author Scott Nearing, and architect and suffragist Florence Luscomb. Some of the other figures to have rooms named after them include Lola Maverick Lloyd, Henry David Thoreau (two separate rooms - Henry Thoreau and David Thoreau are named in his honor), Frederick Douglass (the 19th-century African-American orator and anti-slavery activist) and Louise Pettibone Smith (a 20th-century activist and theologian). The Schmauchs have a lodging room and a separate conference room named in their honor; the Weller and Uphaus couple have entire houses named after them. The Katz and Jacobs cabins, completed July 2018, were named in honor of long time guests who made substantial charitable contributions. Most of the other lodging rooms are either oriented numerically (the terrace of Lloyd Lodge features seven so-named rooms) or by cardinal directions (such as east/west single, north/west porch). Even some of the bathrooms in the Lloyd Lodge are named after either local destinations or prominent landmarks in Boston and New York City. Programs and offerings The current weekly program typically features guest lecturers weekday mornings and evenings, a cookout Thursday evening, a talent show Friday night, musical and/or dance venues Saturday night, a luncheon featuring a Thanksgiving-style turkey dinner every Sunday afternoon, and a leftover smorgasbord Sunday night. Breakfast and the Sunday evening smorgasbord are served buffet-style, while every other meal is served by dining crew. Options of vegetarian, vegan and/or gluten-free (as well as other dietary restrictions/special needs) are available upon request. Most salad greens come directly from the gardens, and bread and other baked goods are baked daily in the kitchen. The rest of the food is delivered weekly by various corporate distributors, though there has been an effort to have more food purchased locally, and in years past some of the turkeys prepared for the Sunday luncheon were raised in nearby farms. While no alcohol is sold on site, guests and staff alike who are of legal age are free to consume alcoholic beverages (purchased externally) at their own discretion. Several copies of the New York Times and a few copies of the Boston Globe are available daily for purchase on site as well. Wi-fi is available in Uphaus lodge, Weller House and the Cottage but not at Lloyd Lodge, the Cape, and Schmauch House so as to promote an atmosphere of openness and presence of mind in these spaces. In a similar fashion, the policy regarding cell phone usage is that they are encouraged to be used outside of the common areas. Snacks are sold each weeknight and ice cream on weekend nights. Due to the decrepit nature of the lodge and the difficulty of reducing noise, quiet hours are enforced between 11 PM and 7 AM. Each morning at breakfast, announcements are made by directors regarding the daily weather forecast as well as the upcoming program. Every week on Sunday evening the current theme for the week is introduced by the directors. Usually the weekly theme pertains to political issues, identity politics, environmentalism, racism and/or race relations, or other causes related to peace and social justice; a few weeks are devoted to musical venues, soccer, Capoeira, or other non-political topics. In the past, nature walks were offered on a weekly basis; currently there are cycling and hiking expeditions offered nearly every day. Notable guests Over the course of World Fellowship's existence, a variety of activists, authors, artists, scholars, organizers, politicians, journalists and story-tellers have attended. These have included Noam Chomsky, Aviva Chomsky (his daughter), Peter Marcuse (son of Herbert Marcuse), Robert Shetterly, Robert Meeropol (son of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg), Scott and Helen Nearing, David Dellinger, Congressman John Lewis (when he was involved with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, well before his term in Congress), Bernie Sanders (when he was mayor of Burlington - long before he gained national and international recognition), Mab Segrest, Lynne Stewart, Chuck Collins, Steve Schwerner (brother of slain civil rights activist Michael Schwerner), Steve Ellner, Kathy Kelly, Frida Berrigan (daughter of Philip Berrigan and niece of Daniel Berrigan), and several members of the Clamshell Alliance - an anti-nuclear organization that opposed the construction of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant in the mid-1970s. Visual artist Robert Shetterly, who began a portrait series entitled, \\"Americans Who Tell the Truth\\" in 2002, has exhibited some of his work on display in Lloyd Lodge. Some notable musical performers have included David Rovics, Charlie King, Sol y Canto, the Adam Ezra group, Pamela Means, Tom√°s Rodriguez, Peter Blood and Annie Patterson (who compiled the Rise Up Singing songbook); and numerous other folk (and other genre) musicians predominantly, though not exclusively, from the greater Boston and New York metropolitan regions. Rituals, traditions and mission statement A longstanding tradition involved staff (and, at times, guests) accessing of the island in Whitton Pond (which is known as 'blueberry island' due to its abundance of blueberry bushes) to have outdoor parties and/or sleepovers. As the World Fellowship Center does not legally own this island and the owners raised objections thereto, this tradition has been discontinued as of the mid-2000s. Since the soccer field was constructed in 1995, at least one week of the summer (usually the last few days of July and first few days of August) is devoted to daily soccer games when weather permits. Since 1996, the very first week of the summer season in late June is referred to as early music week, which involves musical performances by musicians playing instruments dating from the Renaissance and Baroque time periods. From 2014 to 2017, one weekend in September was called the \\"White Mountain Fungal Foray\\", and involved mushrooming expeditions led by a mycologist. In 2015, one week in mid-July was established as \\"Ukulele Week\\", attracting numerous players of said instrument. It is not known exactly when the first cookout, first fun night/talent show, or first Thanksgiving luncheon were initiated, but each has taken place every Thursday evening, Friday evening and Sunday afternoon respectively throughout nearly the entire summer. The mission statement and motto have changed at least twice: During World War Two it was \\"in a time of war, prepare for peace\\"; this became \\"rustic, but adequate\\" during the Weller and/or Uphaus periods. The current mission statement is \\"to promote peace and social justice through education and dialogue inspired by nature\\"; this is often simplified to \\"where peace and social justice meets nature.\\" References Category:Tourist attractions in Carroll County, New Hampshire Category:History of New Hampshire Category:Landmarks in New Hampshire Category:Organizations based in New Hampshire Category:Spiritual retreats Category:Peace organizations based in the United States Category:1941 establishments in New Hampshire ","title":"World Fellowship Center"},{"id":"47744299","text":"Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Hall is a casino in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. It was first opened in 1971 by the Klondike Visitors Association, making it Canada's oldest casino. Gertie's, as it is colloquially known, as well as most of Dawson City is reminiscent of the area's Klondike Gold Rush history. Patrons are treated to a daily vaudeville show inspired by one of Dawson's most famous dance hall stars from the Gold Rush era, Gertie Lovejoy, who had a diamond between her two front teeth. Overview Gertie's is unique among casinos in Canada, as it is the only one where patrons can gamble, drink alcohol, and watch live entertainment in the same room, and is the only casino located in northern Canada. It is still operated by the Klondike Visitors Association, a non-profit organization. Revenues are re-invested back into the town to help preserve historic sites, produce local events, and to promote the Klondike. In 2015, it was named as a Municipal Heritage Site. Arctic Brotherhood Hall The building that houses Gertie's was formerly known as Arctic Brotherhood Hall. It was built in 1901 in a mere three weeks by the Arctic Brotherhood, who were a fraternal social organization for men living in the northwest section of North America. Camp No.4 of the Arctic Brotherhood was formed in November 1899 in Dawson City. When it was completed the building was regarded as the largest and grandest building in the northwest. In 1925, the Arctic Brotherhood ceased to exist and soon after the Fraternal Order of Eagles moved in. Eventually the building was turned into a community hall. In 1967, the building was renovated and briefly renamed to Centennial Hall in honour of Canada's 100th birthday. In 1971, the town leased the building to the Klondike Visitors Association, who were running casino nights on the S.S. Keno after they had obtained a special gambling licence from the Government of Canada. Games Among the available games are blackjack ($2-$100 bets), roulette, poker, 64 slot machines, and red dog poker. They also have a special game called money wheel, featuring Canadian bills.

Career Sculpted panels to honor the U.S. Military readied for California highway project O'Hare began his career as a landscape architect, designing gardens for residential and resort properties in Miami and Palm Beach. In 1986, O'Hare was a member of the Old School Square Committee and the Beautification Trust Committee for the city of Delray Beach, Florida. The committee was tasked with revitalizing and redeveloping certain sections of the town. In June 1986, he resigned from his post as chairman of the Beautification Committee to focus more on his business. O'Hare continued proposing revitalization developments even after his resignation from the committee. In 1989, O'Hare founded Pineapple Grove Designs in his garage in Delray Beach. The company now occupies a 50,000 sq ft facility in Boynton Beach, Florida. The company produces numerous stone-sculpted architectural ornamental products. Sculpted products come in a wide range of standard designs including historic, traditional and contemporary imagery. The company also produces custom designs for customers. O'Hare offers all his architectural art, including 3 dimensional sculpture, bas-relief panels, tile, paintings and architectural grilles through Pineapple Grove Designs.

He served on the Commission for two years, overseeing projects like the planting of 40,000 plants on beach dunes in the town and the hiring of a new Town Manager. He also donated decorative stone panels for a landscaping project in the city. O'Hare returned to full-time private business when his term expired. In 2005, O'Hare designed and deployed one of his first artificial reefs. He had previously been granted patents for the design of these artificial reefs in 1997, with additional patents still pending. The reef was donated and deployed in honor of fireman Peter Firehock who had died in December 2001. O'Hare's own father was a New York City firefighter. The Firehock Reef led to O'Hare founding Reef Cells, a nonprofit subsidiary of Pineapple Grove Designs. Reef Cells are made of a pH neutral Portland and aluminate cement mix and are designed to provide an ideal location for reef- based marine life to thrive. Each reef unit is composed of interconnecting cavities referred to as \\"cells.\\" O'Hare took on a similar memorialization project in 2015 when he created 40 Reef Cells to memorialize Andrew \\"Red\\" Harris.

The French government departed Paris on June 10, and the Germans occupied the city on June 14. During the Occupation, the French Government moved to Vichy, and Paris was governed by the German military and by French officials approved by the Germans. For Parisians, the Occupation was a series of frustrations, shortages and humiliations. A curfew was in effect from nine in the evening until five in the morning; at night, the city went dark. Rationing of food, tobacco, coal and clothing was imposed from September 1940. Every year the supplies grew more scarce and the prices higher. A million Parisians left the city for the provinces, where there was more food and fewer Germans. The French press and radio contained only German propaganda. Jews in Paris were forced to wear the yellow Star of David badge, and were barred from certain professions and public places. On 16‚Äì17 July 1942, 13,152 Jews, including 4,115 children and 5,919 women, were rounded up by the French police, on orders of the Germans, and were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The first demonstration against the Occupation, by Paris students, took place on 11 November 1940. As the war continued, anti-German clandestine groups and networks were created, some loyal to the French Communist Party, others to General Charles de Gaulle in London. They wrote slogans on walls, organized an underground press, and sometimes attacked German officers. Reprisals by the Germans were swift and harsh. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, the French Resistance in Paris launched an uprising on August 19, seizing the police headquarters and other government buildings. The city was liberated by French and American troops on August 25; the next day, General de Gaulle led a triumphant parade down the Champs-√âlys√©es on August 26, and organized a new government. In the following months, ten thousand Parisians who had collaborated with the Germans were arrested and tried, eight thousand convicted, and 116 executed. On 29 April and 13 May 1945, the first post-war municipal elections were held, in which French women voted for the first time.

To his left is the sculptor Arno Breker, to his right, Albert Speer, his architect (Bundesarchiv) =Defense preparations= In the spring of 1939, war with Germany already seemed inevitable. In Paris, the first defense exercise took place on February 2, and city workers began digging twenty kilometers of trenches in city squares and parks to be used for bomb shelters. On March 10, the city began to distribute gas masks to civilians, and on March 19, signs were posted guiding Parisians to the nearest shelters. On August 23, Parisians were surprised to read that the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and Russian minister Vyacheslav Molotov had signed the Hitler- Stalin Pact of non-aggression. L'Humanit√©, the daily newspaper of the French Communist Party (PCF), welcomed the pact, writing: \\"At the moment when the Soviet Union makes a new and appreciable contribution to safeguard the peace, constantly threatened by the fascist instigators of war, the French Communist Party addresses its warmest greetings to the country of socialism, to its party and to its great leader Stalin\\". In Paris, the copies of the newspaper and of the other Communist newspaper, Ce Soir, were seized by the police and their publication suspended. On August 31, anticipating bombardment, the French government began to evacuate 30,000 children out of the city to the Province (regions outside Paris). That night, the street lights were turned off as a measure against German air raids. On September 1, news reached Paris that Germany had invaded Poland, and France, as expected, promptly declared war on Germany. =Safeguarding national treasures= On August 27, in anticipation of air raids, workmen had begun taking down the stained glass windows of the Sainte-Chapelle. The same day, curators at the Louvre, summoned back from summer vacation, and aided by packers from the nearby La Samaritaine and Bazar de l'H√¥tel de Ville department stores, began cataloging and packing the major works of art, which were put into crates and labeled only with numbers to disguise their contents. The Winged Victory of Samothrace statue was carefully wheeled down the long stairway on a wooden ramp to be put on a truck for its departure to the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay in the Indre department. Trucks used to move scenery for the Com√©die Fran√ßaise were used to move the larger paintings, including Gericault's Raft of the Medusa. The art works were carried in slow convoys of trucks, convoys, with headlights off to observe the blackout, to the ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley and other designated locations. The architectural landmarks of the city were protected by sandbags. The French Army waited in the fortifications of the Maginot Line, while in Paris ration cards for gasoline were issued, restrictions were put on the sale of meat and, in February 1940, ration cards for food were issued; however, caf√©s and theatres remained open. =German invasion= The French defense plan was purely passive, waiting for the Germans to attack. After eight months of relative calm (known as the Phoney War, La dr√¥le de guerre) on the Western Front, the Germans struck France on May 10, 1940, bypassing the Maginot Line and slipping through the Ardennes. By May 15, German panzer divisions were only 35 kilometers from Laon, in the rear of the French and British armies, racing toward the English Channel. On May 28, the British realized the battle was lost and began withdrawing their soldiers from the beaches of Dunkerque. Paris was soon flooded with refugees from the battle zone. On June 3, the Germans bombed Paris and its suburbs for the first time, targeting in particular the Citro√´n automobile factory. 254 persons were killed, including 195 civilians. French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud dismissed his supreme military commander, Maurice Gamelin, and replaced him with the 73-year-old Maxime Weygand. He also named the 84-year-old Philippe P√©tain, a hero of the First World War, as deputy prime minister. Neither Weygand nor P√©tain felt the Germans could be defeated, and they began looking for a way out of the war. =Evacuation= On June 8, the sound of distant artillery fire could be heard in the capital. Trains filled with refugees departed Gare d'Austerlitz with no announced destination. On 10 June, the French government fled Paris, first to Tours and then to Bordeaux. Thousands of Parisians followed their example, filling the roads out of the city with automobiles, tourist buses, trucks, wagons, carts, bicycles, and on foot. The slow-moving river of refugees took ten hours to cover thirty kilometers. Within a few days, the wealthier arrondissements of the city were nearly deserted, and the population of the working-class 14th arrondissement dropped from 178,000 to 49,000. =Open city= The British General Staff urged the French to defend Paris street-by- street, but P√©tain dismissed the idea: \\"To make Paris into a city of ruins will not affect the issue.\\" On June 12, the French government, in Tours, declared Paris to be an open city, that there would be no resistance. At 5:30 in the morning of June 14, the first German advance guard entered the city at Porte de La Villette and took the rue de Flandres toward the center. They were followed by several German columns, which, following an established plan, moved to the principal intersections. German military vehicles with loudspeakers circulated, instructing Parisians not to leave their buildings. At eight in the morning, delegations of German officers arrived at the Invalides, headquarters of the military governor of Paris, Henri Dentz, and at the Prefecture of Police, where the Prefect, Roger Langeron, was waiting. The Germans politely invited the French officials to put themselves at the disposition of the German occupiers. By the end of the afternoon, the Germans had hung a swastika flag at the Arc de Triomphe and organized military parades with a marching band on the Champs √âlys√©es and Avenue Foch, primarily for the benefit of the German army photographers and newsreel cameramen.Chastenet, Jacques, Cent Ans de la R√©publique (1970), J. Tallandier, volume VII, pp. 260-265https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbzhAC3aE-w =Capitulation= On the evening of June 16, Prime Minister Reynaud resigned. On the morning of June 17, General de Gaulle left Bordeaux by plane for London. At midday, Parisians gathered around radios heard P√©tain, the new head of the French government, announce: \\"It is with a heavy heart that I tell you today that we must cease hostilities. The fighting must stop.\\" Though no armistice had yet been signed, the French army stopped fighting. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler arrived on June 24 for a rapid tour by car, his only visit to Paris. He was guided by the German sculptor Arno Breker and by his chief architect, Albert Speer, both of whom had lived in Paris. He saw the Opera House and viewed the Eiffel Tower from the terrace of the Palace of Chaillot, paid homage at Napoleon's tomb, and visited the artist's quarter of Montmartre.

Signs in German were placed on the main boulevards, and the clocks of all France were reset to the German time. The German military high command moved into the Majestic Hotel on Avenue Kl√©ber; the Abwehr (German military intelligence), took over the H√¥tel Lutetia; the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) occupied the Ritz; the Kriegsmarine (German Navy), the H√¥tel de la Marine on the Place de la Concorde; the Carlingue, the French auxiliary organization of the Gestapo, occupied the building at 93 rue Lauriston; and the German commandant of Paris and his staff moved into the H√¥tel Meurice on the rue de Rivoli. Dictionnaire historique de Paris, p. 536. Paris became the primary destination for the rest and recreation of German soldiers. Under the slogan \\"Jeder einmal in Paris\\" (\\"everyone once in Paris\\"), each German soldier was promised one visit to Paris. One month after the beginning of the Occupation, a bi-monthly magazine and guide for visiting German soldiers Der Deutsche Wegleiter f√ºr Paris (The German Guide to Paris), was first published by the Paris Kommandantur. Certain hotels and movie theaters were reserved exclusively for German soldiers. A German-language newspaper, the Pariser Zeitung (1941-1944), was also published for the soldiers. The German officers enjoyed the Ritz, Maxim's, the Coupole and other exclusive restaurants, as the exchange rate was fixed to favor the German occupiers. Many houses of prostitution existed in Paris and they began to cater to German clients. The headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst, the counter-intelligence branch of the SS was at 84 Avenue Foch. French auxiliaries, who worked for the Gestapo, Sicherheitsdienst and Geheime Feldpolizei were based at 93, rue Lauriston in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. They were known as the Carlingue (or French Gestapo) and were active between 1941 and 1944. The group was founded by Pierre Bonny, a corrupt ex-policeman. It was subsequently led by Henri Lafont and Pierre Loutrel, two professional criminals who had been active in the French underworld before the war. Life in occupied Paris =Civilian population= By the time that the Germans arrived in Paris, two-thirds of the Parisians, particularly those in the wealthier neighborhoods, had fled to the countryside and the south of France, in what is known as the exode de 1940, the massive exodus of millions of people from the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the north and east of France, fleeing after the German victory of the battle of Sedan (12‚Äì15 May 1940). Once the Occupation had begun, they started to return. By July 7, the city government estimated the population had risen again to 1.5 million; it climbed to two million by October 22, and 2.5 million by January 1, 1941. At the beginning of 1943, it fell again, because of air raids by the Allies, the arrest and deportation of Jews and foreigners, and the forced departure to factories in Germany of many young Frenchmen, as part of the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), \\"Obligatory Work Service\\". The attitude of the Parisians toward the occupiers varied greatly. Some saw the Germans as an easy source of money; others, as the Prefect of the Seine, Roger Langeron (arrested on 23 June 1940), commented, \\"looked at them as if they were invisible or transparent.\\"Langeron, R. Paris, juin 1940, pg. 64 The attitude of members of the French Communist Party was more complicated; the Party had long denounced Nazism and Fascism, but after the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939, had to reverse direction. The editors of the Communist Party newspaper, L'Humanit√©, which had been closed down by the French government, asked the Germans for permission to resume publishing, and it was granted. The Party also asked that workers resume work in the armaments factories, which were now producing for the Germans. Many individual communists opposed the Nazis, but the ambivalent official attitude of the Party lasted until Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. For the Parisians, the Occupation was a series of frustrations, shortages and humiliations. A curfew was in effect from nine in the evening until five in the morning; at night, the city went dark. Rationing of food, tobacco, coal and clothing was imposed from September 1940. Every year the supplies grew more scarce and the prices higher. The French press and radio broadcast only German propaganda. The beginning of the STO, the program that required large number of young Frenchmen to work in factories for the German war industry, in exchange for the return of older and sick French prisoners of war in Germany, greatly increased the resentment of the French population against the Germans. Most Parisians, however, only expressed their anger and frustrations in private, while the police of Paris, under German control, received every day hundreds of anonymous denunciations by Parisians against other Parisians. =Rationing and the Black Market= File:Paris, Spring 1945- Everyday Life in Liberated Paris, France, 1945 D24161.jpgLine outside a Paris bakery in spring 1945. The liberation did not end the food shortages. (Imperial War Museums, U.K.) File:Paris, Spring 1945- Everyday Life in Liberated Paris, France, 1945 D24174.jpgPotatoes and leeks on sale in a Paris market. There was little else to buy. Spring 1945 (Imperial War Museums, U.K.) Finding food soon became the first preoccupation of the Parisians. The authorities of the German occupation transformed French industry and agriculture into a machine for serving Germany. Shipments to Germany had first priority; what was left went to Paris and the rest of France. All of the trucks manufactured at the Citroen factory went directly to Germany. (Later many of these trucks were cleverly sabotaged by the French workers, who recalibrated the dip sticks so that the trucks would run out of oil without notice). The greatest share of shipments of meat, wheat, milk produce and other agricultural products also went to Germany. What remained for the Parisians was strictly rationed, following the creation on 16 June 1940 of the Minist√®re de l'agriculture et du ravitaillement (Ministry of Agriculture and Supply), which began to impose a system rationing as early as 2 August 1940, as per D√©cret du 30 juillet 1940:http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000846943&categorieLien;=id bread, fat, flour products, rice, sugar; then, on 23 October 1940: butter, cheese, meat, coffee, charcuterie, eggs, oil; in July 1941: and as the war went on: chocolate, fish, dried vegetables, (like peas and beans), potatoes, fresh vegetables, wine, tobacco... Products could be bought only upon presentation of coupons attributed to specific items and on the specific week in which they could be used. Parisians (and all the population of France) were divided into seven categories depending upon their age, and allotted a certain amount of each product each month. A new bureaucracy, employing more than nine thousand city employees, with offices at all schools and the city hall of each arrondissement, was put into place to administer the program. The system resulted in long lines and frustrated hopes, since promised products often never appeared. Thousands of Parisians regularly made the long journey by bicycle to the countryside, hoping to come back, with vegetables, fruit, eggs and other farm products. The rationing system also applied to clothing: leather was reserved exclusively for German army boots, and vanished completely from the market. Leather shoes were replaced by shoes made of rubber or canvas (raffia) with wooden soles. A variety of ersatz or substitute products appeared, which were not exactly what they were called: ersatz wine, coffee (made with chicory), tobacco and soap. Finding coal for heat in winter was another preoccupation. The Germans had transferred the authority over the coal mines of northern France from Paris to their military headquarters in Brussels. The priority for the coal that did arrive in Paris was for the use in factories. Even with ration cards, adequate coal for heating was almost impossible to find. Supplies for normal heating needs were not restored until 1949. Paris restaurants were open but had to deal with strict regulations and shortages. Meat could only be served on certain days, and certain products, such as cream, coffee and fresh produce were extremely rare. Nonetheless, the restaurants found ways to serve their regular clients. The historian Ren√© H√©ron de Villefosse, who lived in Paris throughout the war, described his experience: \\"The great restaurants were only allowed to serve, under the fierce eye of a frequent control, noodles with water, turnips and beets, in exchange for certain number of tickets, but the hunt for a good meal continued for many food-lovers. For five hundred francs one could conquer a good pork chop, hidden under cabbage and served without the necessary tickets, along with a liter of Beaujolais and a real coffee; sometimes it was on the first floor at rue Dauphine, where you could listen to the BBC while sitting next to Picasso.\\" The restrictions and shortage of goods led to the existence of a thriving black market. Producers and distributors of food and other scarce products set aside a portion of their goods for the black market, and used middle-men to sell them to customers. The bars of the Champs-√âlys√©es, and other parts of Paris, became common meeting places between the middle-men and clients. Parisians bought cigarettes, meat, coffee, wine and other products which frequently neither the middle-man nor the customer had ever seen. =Transport= File:Parisian Traffic, Spring 1945- Everyday Life in Paris, France, 1945 D24162.jpgA car converted to run on coal gas instead of gasoline (1945) (Imperial War Museums, U.K.) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-053-33, Paris, deutsche Soldaten in der Metro.jpgLuftwaffe officers on the Metro (Bundesarchiv) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0216-500, Paris, deutsche Parole am Bourbon-Palast.jpgHorse-drawn coaches in front of the National Assembly, decorated with slogan: \\"Germany is winning on all fronts\\" (Bundesarchiv) File:Parisian Traffic, Spring 1945- Everyday Life in Paris, France, 1945 D24176.jpgThe pedi-cab, or bicycle taxi, was still in use in the spring of 1945 (Imperial War Museums, U.K.) Due to the shortage of fuel, the number of automobiles on the Paris streets dropped from 350,000 before the war to just under 4,500. One customer, sitting on the terrace of a caf√© on the Place de la Bourse, counted the number of cars which passed between noon and twelve-thirty: only three came by. Older means of transportation, such as the horse-drawn fiacre came back into service. Trucks and automobiles that did circulate often used gazogene, a poor-quality fuel carried in a tank on the roof, or coal gas or methane, extracted from the Paris sewers. The metro ran, but service was frequently interrupted and the cars were overcrowded. Three thousand five hundred buses had run on the Paris streets in 1939, but only five hundred were still running in the autumn of 1940. Bicycle-taxis became popular, and their drivers charged a high tariff. Bicycles became the means of transport for many Parisians, and their price soared; a used bicycle cost a month's salary. The transportation problems did not end with the liberation of Paris; the shortage of gasoline and lack of transport continued until well after the war. =Culture and the arts= File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15196, Paris, Besuch Gerd v.

Great masterpieces in the Louvre had already been evacuated to the ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley and the unoccupied zone, and were safe. The German Army was respectful of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and refused to transfer the works in French museums out of the country, but the Nazi leaders were not so scrupulous. On 30 June 1940, Hitler ordered that all art works in France, public and private, should be \\"safeguarded\\". Many of the French wealthy Jewish families had sent their art works out of France before leaving the country, but others had left their art collections behind. A new law decreed that those who had left France just before the war were no longer French citizens, and their property could be seized. The Gestapo began visiting bank vaults and empty residences, and collecting the works of art. The pieces left behind in the fifteen largest Jewish-owned art galleries in Paris were also collected, and transported in French police vans. In September, a new organization, the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg) was created to catalog and store the art. It was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a building in the Tuileries Gardens used by the Louvre for temporary exhibits. More than four hundred crates of art works were brought to the Jeu de Paume by Luftwaffe personnel, unpacked and cataloged. Hermann G√∂ring, the head of the Luftwaffe, visited the Jeu de Paume on November 3 and returned on the 5th, spending the entire day there, picking out works for his private collection. He selected twenty-seven paintings, including works by Rembrandt and Van Dyck owned by Edouard de Rothschild, as well as stained glass windows and furniture intended for Carinhall, the luxurious hunting lodge he had built in the Schorfheide Forest, in Germany. Another Rothschild-owned painting, The Astronomer by Vermeer, was reserved for Hitler himself. Fifteen railroad boxcars full of artworks were sent to Germany with G√∂ring's personal train. G√∂ring visited the Jeu de Paume twelve more times in 1941, and five times in 1942, adding to his collection. Confiscations continued at banks, warehouses and private residences, with paintings, furniture, statues, clocks and jewelry accumulating at the Jeu de Paume, and filling the whole ground floor. The staff at the Jeu de Paume cataloged 218 major collections. Between April 1941 and July 1944, 4,174 cases of art works filling 138 boxcars, were shipped from Paris to Germany. Much of the art, but not all, was recovered after the war. =Arts= While some painters left Paris, many remained and continued working. Georges Braque returned to Paris in autumn 1940 and quietly continued working. Pablo Picasso spent most of 1939 in a villa in Royan, north of Bordeaux. He returned to Paris and resumed working in his studio on rue des Grands Augustins. He frequently received visitors at his studio, including Germans, some admiring and some suspicious. He had postcards made of his famous anti-fascist work, Guernica, to hand out as souvenirs to visitors, and had serious discussions of art and politics with visiting Germans, including writer Ernst J√ºnger. While his work was officially condemned as \\"degenerate\\", his paintings continued to be sold at the H√¥tel Drouot auction house and at the Galerie Louise Leiris, formerly Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's. German treasurer officials opened Picasso's bank vault, where he stored his private art collection, searching for Jewish-owned art they could seize. Picasso so confused them with his descriptions of ownership of the paintings that they left without taking anything. He also persuaded them that the paintings in the adjoining vault, owned by Braque, were actually his own. Other \\"degenerate\\" artists, including Kandinsky and Henri Matisse, who sent drawings up to Paris from his residence in Nice, were officially condemned but continued to sell their works in the back rooms of Paris galleries. A few actors, such as Jean Gabin and film director Jean Renoir chose, for political or personal reasons, to leave Paris, but many others remained, avoided politics and focused on their art. These included the actor Fernandel, the film director and playwright Sacha Guitry, and the singers √âdith Piaf, Tino Rossi, Charles Trenet and Yves Montand. The jazz musician Django Reinhardt played with the Quintette du Hot Club de France for German and French fans. In 1941, Maurice Chevalier performed a new revue in the Casino de Paris: Bonjour Paris. The songs √áa sent si bon la France and La Chanson du ma√ßon became hits. The Nazis asked Chevalier to perform in Berlin and sing for Radio Paris. He refused but did perform for French prisoners of war in Germany, and succeeded in obtaining the liberation of ten prisoners in exchange.With Love, the Autobiography of Maurice Chevalier, (Cassell, 1960), Chapter 22. The writer Colette, who was 67 when the war began, worked quietly on her m√©moires in her apartment at 9 rue du Beaujolais, next to the gardens of the Palais-Royal. Her husband, Maurice Goudeket, a Jew, was arrested by the Gestapo in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador Otto Abetz, Colette lived through the rest of the war years with the anxiety of a possible second arrest. In 1944, she published one of her most famous works, Gigi. The philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre continued to write and publish; Simone de Beauvoir produced a broadcast on the history of the music hall for Radio Paris; and Marguerite Duras worked at a publishing house. The actress Danielle Darrieux made a tour to Berlin, in exchange for the liberation of her husband, Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican diplomat suspected of espionage. The actress Arletty, the star of Les Enfants du Paradis and H√¥tel du Nord, had a relationship with Hans J√ºrgen Soehring, a Luftwaffe officer, and gave the famous riposte to a member of the FFI interrogating her after the Liberation: \\"My heart is French, but my a-- is international.\\" 'The Oxford History of World Cinema, p. 347. See also Arletty, allocine.fr: \\"mon c≈ìur est fran√ßais mais mon cul est international !\\" Jewish actors were not allowed to perform. Some places in Paris were frequented by homosexual actors and artists; notably the swimming pool in the Bois de Boulogne. The actor Jean Marais was officially harassed for his homosexuality, and the actor Robert-Hugues Lambert was arrested and deported, most likely because of his relationship with a German officer whom he did not want to name. He died at the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp on 7 March 1945. The Germans made a continual effort to seduce the Parisians through culture: in 1941, they organized a festival of German music by the Berlin Philharmonic at the Paris Opera, a play from the Schiller Theater in Berlin at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, and an exhibit by the German sculptor Arno Breker. The French film industry, based in suburbs of Paris, had a very difficult existence due to shortages of personnel, film and food, but it produced several genuine masterpieces, among which: Marcel Carn√©'s Les Enfants du Paradis (\\"Children of Paradise\\") which was filmed during the Occupation but not released until 1945.

On October 18, 1940, the German occupation authorities decreed, in what is known as the Ordonnance d'Aryanisation, that Jews would have a special status and be barred from liberal professions, such as commerce, industry, thus affecting lawyers, doctors, professors, shop owners, and also be barred from certain restaurants and public places, and that their property was seized. On May 23, 1942, the head of the Anti-Jewish section of the Gestapo, Adolf Eichmann, gave secret orders for the deportation of French Jews to the concentration camp of Auschwitz. On May 29, 1942, all Jews in the Occupied Zone over the age of six were required to wear the yellow Star of David badge. In July, Jews were banned from all main streets, movie theaters, libraries, parks, gardens, restaurants, caf√©s and other public places, and were required to ride on the last car of metro trains. On 16‚Äì17 July 1942, on Germans' orders, 13,152 Jews (4,115 children, 5.919 women and 3,118 men) were rounded up by the French police. Unmarried persons and couples without children were taken to Drancy, some 20 kilometers north of Paris, while 8,160 men, women and children comprising families went to the V√©lodrome d‚ÄôHiver (\\"Vel' d'Hiv'\\") stadium, on rue Nelaton in the 15th arrondissement, where they were crowded together in the heat of summer, with hardly any food, water and no hygienic facilities for five days before being sent to Drancy, Compi√®gne, Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande internment camps, preludes to the Auschwitz extermination camp.‚Äô‚ÄôDictionnaire historique de Paris‚Äô‚Äô (2013), p. 637. The roundup was considered a failure by the Germans, since they had prepared trains for 32,000 persons. Arrests continued in 1943 and 1944. By the time of the Liberation, it was estimated that 43,000 Jews from the Paris region, or about half the total population of the community, had been sent to the concentration camps, and that 34,000 died there.Michel, Henri, Paris Allemand, √âditeur Albin Michel (1981), pp. 310-313 Collaboration File:Pierre Laval and Carl Oberg in Paris.pngFrench Premier Pierre Laval and General Carl Oberg, the German police commander in Paris, responsible for the Gestapo and SS, May 1, 1943 (Bundesarchiv) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-053-30, Paris, vor dem Truimphbogen.jpgA Paris policeman salutes a German officer (Bundesarchiv, 1941) File:Milice r√©volutionnaire nationale.jpg11 April 1943: Meeting at the Vel d'Hiv in Paris of the Front r√©volutionnaire national, a French fascist paramilitary organization created on 28 February 1943 to fight the French Resistance. Its active collaborationist police was known as the Milice, whose members, above, swear allegiance to the organization. (Photo: Le Matin newspaper, 12 April 1943) Many Parisians collaborated with the Government of Marshal P√©tain and with the Germans, assisting them with the city administration, the police, and other government functions. French government officials were given the choice of collaborating or losing their jobs. On September 2, 1941, all Paris magistrates were asked to take an oath of allegiance to Marshal Petain. Only one, Paul Didier, refused. Unlike the territory of Vichy France, governed by Marshal P√©tain and his ministers, the document of surrender placed Paris in the occupied zone, directly under German authority, the Milit√§rbefehlshabers in Frankreich (MBF). It stated: \\"The government of France will immediately invite all the French authorities and administrative services in the occupied territories to conform with the regulations of the German military authorities, and to collaborate with those in a correct manner.\\" The prefect of the police and prefect of the Seine, reported to him, and only secondarily to the government of the French State in Vichy. The Germans supported the creation by Vichy France, on 28 February 1943, of a fascist paramilitary organization, the Front r√©volutionnaire national, whose active police branch was called Milice. Its particular function was to help the Germans in their battle against the Resistance, which they qualified as being a \\"terrorist\\" organization. It established its headquarters in the former Communist Party building at 44 rue Le Peletier and at 61 rue de Monceau. The Lyc√©e Louis-Le-Grand was occupied as barracks, and an officer candidate school was established in the Auteuil synagogue. The Front r√©volutionnaire national held a large rally on 11 April 1943 at the V√©l d'Hiv. At the time of the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, most of its members chose to fight alongside the Germans and many of them made their way to Germany (Sigmaringen) when Paris fell to the Allies. Those who did not leave were the target of the purge (√©puration) that followed. Crime Doctor Marcel Petiot pretended to run a Resistance network, and killed, for their treasure, Jews and others trying to escape to Argentina. (Unknown) The most notorious criminal of the period was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and under the name of Docteur Eug√®ne, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.Paris dans les pas des grands hommes, L'Express Thema, October‚ÄìNovember 2015, p. 78http://tueursenserie.wifeo.com/marcel- petiot.php The Resistance File:Resistance_15_December_1940.jpgFirst issue of the underground newspaper 'R√©sistance', December 15, 1940 (SiefkinDR) File:Affiche 21 08 1941.jpgPoster announcing that the Germans will take hostages in retaliation for attacks on German soldiers, August 21, 1941 (Gallica Digital Library) File:French resistance during Paris Uprising 1944.jpgResistance fighters in Paris, August 1944 (La Lib√©ration de Paris 1944) On June 18, 1940, Parisians listening to the BBC heard an obscure French brigadier General, Charles de Gaulle, in London, make an appeal (Appel du 18 juin) to continue the resistance against the Germans. Very few heard the broadcast at the time, but it was widely printed and circulated afterwards. On June 23, the German occupation authorities ordered all French persons to turn in any weapons and short-wave receivers they possessed, or face severe measures. Within Paris, opposition was isolated and slow to build. On August 2, de Gaulle was condemned to death for treason, in absentia, by Marshal P√©tain's new government. The first illegal demonstration in Paris against the Occupation took place on November 11, 1940, the anniversary of the end of the First World War, a day that usually featured patriotic ceremonies of remembrance. Anticipating trouble, the German authorities banned any commemoration and made it a regular school and work day. Nonetheless the students of Paris lyc√©es (high schools) circulated handbills and leaflets calling for students to boycott classes and meet at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The event was also announced on the 10th on the BBC. The day began quietly, as some 20,000 students laid wreaths and bouquets at the tomb and at the statue of Georges Clemenceau, on Place Clemenceau, by the Champs √âlys√©es. This part of the day was tolerated by the French and German authorities. At midday, the demonstration became more provocative; some students carried a floral Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of de Gaulle's Free France. They were chased away by the police. At nightfall, the event became more provocative; some three thousand students gathered, chanting \\"Vive La France\\" and \\"Vive l'Angleterre\\", and invading Le Tyrol, a bar popular with the Jeune Front, a fascist youth group, and scuffling with police. At 6:00 pm, German soldiers arrived, surrounded the students, and closed the entrance of the metro stations. They charged the students with fixed bayonets, firing shots in the air. The Vichy government announced 123 arrests and one student wounded. The students arrested were taken to the prisons of La Sant√©, Cherche-Midi and Fresnes, where they were beaten, slapped, stripped, and made to stand all night in the pouring rain. Some students were threatened by soldiers pretending to be a firing squad. As a consequence of the demonstration, the Sorbonne University was closed, students were required to regularly report to the police, and the Latin Quarter was closely watched. Another incident took place on November 10; a 28-year-old French engineer named Jacques Bonsergent and his friends, coming home from a wedding, ran into a group of German soldiers in the blackout and got into a brawl. A German soldier was punched. Bonsergent's friends escaped, but he was arrested and refused to give the names of his friends to the Germans. He was held in jail for nineteen days, taken to court, charged with \\"an act of violence against a member of the German Army\\", and sentenced to death. Bonsergent was executed by firing squad on December 23, the first civilian in France executed for resistance against the Occupation. In 1946, the metro station Jacques Bonsergent was named after him. The first significant Resistance organization in Paris was formed in September 1940 by a group of scholars connected with the Mus√©e de l'Homme, the ethnology museum located at the Palais de Chaillot. On 15 December, using the museum mimeograph machine, they published R√©sistance, a four-page newspaper which gave its name to the movement that followed. The group was led by the Russian-born (French naturalized) anthropologist Boris Vild√©. The first issue of the newspaper, proclaimed: \\"We are independent, simply French, chosen for the action we wish to carry out. We have only one ambition, one passion, one desire: to recreate France, pure and free.\\" They collected information and established a network to help escaped French POWs to flee the country. They were not experienced conspirators, and they were discovered and arrested in January 1941. Vild√© and the six other leaders were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad at Fort Mont Val√©rien, in the western suburbs of the city, on February 22, 1942. Most of the resistance by ordinary Parisians was symbolic: encouraged by the BBC, students scribbled the letter V for Victory on walls, blackboards, tables, and on the side of cars. The Germans tried to co-opt the 'V' campaign, placing huge Vs. symbolizing their own victories, on the Eiffel Tower and the National Assembly, but with little effect. From the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in August 1939, until June 1941, the Communists played no active part in the Resistance. The Vichy government and Germans allowed their newspapers to publish, and they made no mention of the patriotic demonstrations on November 11. But after Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, they became among the most active and best-organized forces against the Germans. They remained hostile to de Gaulle, whom they denounced as a reactionary British puppet. On August 21, 1941, a 21-year-old veteran communist named Pierre Georges, who used the clandestine name \\"Fabien\\", shot a German naval officer, Alfons Moser, in the back, as he was boarding the metro at the Barb√©s-Rochecouart station. The Germans had routinely taken hostages among the French civilian population to deter attacks. They responded to the Barb√©s-Rochechouart metro attack by executing three hostages in Paris, and another twenty the following month. Hitler was furious at the leniency of the German commander, and demanded that in case of future assassinations, there must be one hundred hostages executed for every German killed. After the next killing of a German, forty-eight hostages were immediately shot by firing squad. From London, General de Gaulle condemned the Communist policy of random assassinations, saying the cost in innocent civilian lives was too high, and it had no impact on the war, but the random shooting of Germans continued. In retaliation, an estimated 1,400 hostages from the Paris region were taken and 981 executed by the German military at Fort Mont Val√©rien. Acts of resistance in Paris became more dangerous. In the spring of 1942, five students of the Lyc√©e Buffon decided to protest the arrest of one of their teachers. About one hundred students took part, chanting the teacher's name and throwing leaflets. The demonstrators escaped, but the police tracked down and arrested the five student leaders, who were tried and executed on February 8, 1943. As the war continued, the Resistance was divided largely between the groups, followers of General de Gaulle in London, and those organized by the Communists. Thanks to pressure from the British, who supplied the weapons, and the diplomacy of one Resistance leader, Jean Moulin, who created the National Council of the Resistance (Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR)), the different factions began to coordinate their actions. In early 1944, as the Normandy invasion approached, the Communists and their allies controlled the largest and best- armed resistance groups in Paris: the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). In February 1944, the FTP became part of a larger umbrella organization, the Forces fran√ßaises de l'int√©rieur (FFI). Following the Normandy invasion on June 6 (D-Day), the FFI prepared to launch an uprising to liberate the city before the Allied Armies and General de Gaulle arrived. Liberation File:Battle for paris FFI1.pngThe uprising against the Germans in Paris began on August 19, 1944, with the takeover of the police headquarters and other government buildings (La Lib√©ration de Paris 1944) File:Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees-edit2.jpgThe French Second Armored Division of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque parades on the Champs-√âlys√©es on August 26, 1944.

Marcel Flouret is second from the right. (Unknown, Imperial War Museums, U.K.) The Allies landed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, and two months later broke the German lines and began to advance toward and around Paris. German control over Paris was already breaking down. One hundred thousand Parisians had turned out on July 14 for a prohibited celebration of Bastille Day. German soldiers fired into the air, but the French police did nothing. On August 10, half of the eighty thousand railroad workers in the Paris region went on strike, stopping all railroad traffic. On August 15, the new German commander of Paris, General Dietrich von Choltitz, ordered that three thousand resistance members held in Paris jails be transferred out of the city. They were loaded into trains, 170 persons in each cattle car, and sent to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Ravensbr√ºck. Only twenty- seven returned. On the same day, the Paris police learned that policemen in the suburbs were being disarmed by the Germans; they immediately went on strike. In Paris, most of the electricity and gas were cut off, there was little food available, and the metro had stopped running. On August 19, against the opposition of de Gaulle's representative in Paris, Jacques Chaban- Delmas, the National Council of the Resistance and the Parisian Committee on Liberation jointly called for an immediate uprising. It was commanded by the regional leader of the Communist-led FFI, Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy. Chaban- Delmas reluctantly agreed to participate. Liberation Committees in each neighborhood occupied the government buildings and headquarters of collaborationist newspapers, and put up barricades in the northern and eastern neighborhoods, where the Resistance was the strongest. To the surprise of Henri Rol-Tanguy, the Paris police also joined in the uprising; a thousand policemen occupied the Prefecture of Police, the police headquarters on the √éle de la Cit√©. At the time of the uprising, most of elite German units had left the city, but twenty-thousand German soldiers remained, armed with about eighty tanks and sixty artillery pieces. While the Resistance had about twenty-thousand fighters, they had only sixty hand guns, a few machine guns, and no heavy weapons. Nonetheless, on the morning of August 20, a small group of Resistance fighters, led by Marcel Flouret, walked into the City Hall of Paris and demanded a transfer of operations. The building was then occupied by the resistance. Rol-Tanguy commanded the uprising from a bunker twenty-six meters beneath the statue of the Lion de Belfort, Place Denfert-Rochereau, which communicated with the catacombs. Parisians cut down trees and tore up paving stones to build barricades. Scattered sniping and street fighting broke out between the Germans, the Milice and the Resistance; prisoners were executed on both sides. The Resistance took weapons from fallen Germans, and even captured trucks and even tanks, but neither side had enough military power to defeat the other. Memorial to those fallen during the liberation The Allies had originally planned to bypass Paris, to avoid street fighting and the necessity of feeding a huge population. However, when news of the uprising in Paris reached them, Generals Eisenhower and Bradley agreed to send the French 2nd Armored Division of General Leclerc to Paris, and sent the American 4th Armored Division to support them. The 2nd Armored Division set out early in the morning of August 23 with 16,000 men, 4,200 vehicles and 200 tanks. By the afternoon of the 24th, they were in the western and southern Paris suburbs. On 23 August, Leclerc had sent a small column of three tanks and eleven halftracks, commanded by Captain Dronne, to enter the heart of the city. By 9:00 pm. Dronne had reached the H√¥tel de Ville, where he was greeted by Georges Bidault, the head of the National Council of the Resistance (Conseil national de la R√©sistance), and Andr√© Tollet, commander of the Paris committee of liberation (Comit√© parisien de la Lib√©ration). Then he went to the Prefecture of Police for a meeting with de Gaulle's representative, Chaban-Delmas. The main force of Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division entered the city on the morning of the 25th. There was fierce resistance near the Invalides and the √âcole Militaire, in which some French soldiers were killed and tanks destroyed. By the end of the morning, the Germans had been overcome and a large French tricolor flag was hoisted on the Eiffel Tower. General von Choltitz was an unrepentant Nazi, and had been ordered by Hitler to leave the city a \\"heap of burning ruins\\", but he also realized the battle was lost, and he did not want to be captured by the Resistance. Through the offices of the Swedish Consul-General, Raoul Nordling, he ignored Hitler's orders and arranged a truce. In the afternoon of the 25th he traveled from his headquarters in the H√¥tel Meurice to the Montparnasse train station, the headquarters of General Leclerc, where, at about 3:00 in the billiards room of the station staff, he and Leclerc signed a surrender. Chaban-Dalmas and Rol-Tanguy, leader of the FFI, were also present, and it was suggested that Rol-Tanguy should also sign the surrender. Leclerc dictated a new version, and put the name of the FFI leader ahead of his own. The occupation of Paris was officially over. De Gaulle arrived in Paris two hours later. He met first with Leclerc, complaining to him that Rol-Tanguy had signed the surrender. He then went to the Ministry of War, and insisted that the FFI leaders come to him, but in the end he went to the H√¥tel de Ville, where he gave a memorable speech to a huge crowd of Parisians, concluding: > \\"Paris! Paris humiliated! Paris broken! Paris martyred! But now Paris > liberated! Liberated by herself, by her own people with the help of the > armies of France, with the support and aid of France as a whole, of fighting > France, of the only France, of the true France, of eternal France.\\" The following day, de Gaulle, on foot, towering over everyone in the crowd, led a triumphal march from the Arc de Triomphe, down the Champs-√âlys√©es, to the Place de la Concorde, then to the cathedral of Notre-Dame, where he took part in a Te Deum. About 2,000 Parisians were killed in the liberation of their capital, along with about 800 Resistance fighters from the FFI and policemen, and over 100 soldiers from the Free France and U.S. forces. Food Crisis During the liberation food in Paris was getting scarcer by the day. The French rail network had largely been destroyed by allied bombing so getting food into Paris had become a problem, especially since the Germans had stripped the capital of its resources for themselves. Many Parisians were desperate, and allied soldiers even used their own meagre rations to help. The allies realised the necessity to get Paris back on its feet, and pushed a plan for food convoys to get through to the capital as soon as possible. In addition, surrounding towns and villages were requested to supply as much of Paris as possible. The Civil Affairs of SHAEF authorised the import of up to 2,400 tons of food per day at the expense of the military effort. A British food convoy labelled 'Vivres Pour Paris' entered on August 29, and US supplies were flown in via Orl√©ans Airport before being convoyed in. At least 500 tons were delivered a day by the British and another 500 tons by the Americans. Along with French civilians outside Paris bringing in indigenous resources, within ten days the food crisis was overcome.

The crowd includes several allied soldiers (Imperial War Museums, U.K.) Immediately following the liberation of the city, Parisians who had collaborated with the Germans were punished. Women who had slept with German soldiers had their heads shaved and were humiliated. Some Parisians, including Coco Chanel, who had been living with a German officer, quietly left the country, and did not return for many years. 9,969 persons were arrested. A military tribunal was established for those who had collaborated with the German army and police, and a separate judicial tribunal was set up for economic and political collaborators. Of those arrested, 1,616 were acquitted, and 8,335 were found guilty. In the Seine department, the two tribunals sentenced 598 collaborators to death, of whom 116 were executed; the others, who had escaped from France, were condemned in absentia. The Liberation did not immediately bring peace to Paris; a thousand persons were killed and injured by a German bombing raid on August 26, the city and region suffered from attacks by German V-1 rockets beginning on September 3; food rationing and other restrictions remained in force through the end of the war, but the climate of fear had disappeared. The political life of the city was gradually renewed, under the close watch of General de Gaulle. On August 27, the Council of Ministers held its first meeting at the H√¥tel Matignon since 1940. In October, a provisional municipal council was established, but it did not formally meet until March and April 1945. The first issue of a new newspaper, Le Monde, was published on December 18, 1944. On April 13, 1945, just before the end of war, a new ordinance set the date for the first municipal elections since the war began. They were held on 29 April, and for the first time French women were allowed to vote.

The Ciudad Barrios prison has been militarized, with both soldiers and police officers serving as prison guards. As of 2012, the prison housed nearly 2,500 prisoners, despite a capacity of 800.

The word is a dvigu compound from ' \\"hundred\\" and ' \\"step\\", which literally means \\"walking 100 steps\\" after a meal. Benefits Experts believe that walking at least 100 steps after eating your dinner / lunch improves your overall wellbeing. This includes proper digestion, burning calories, better control of blood sugar levels and triglycerides in the body.{{ Here is how a 15-minute walk after meals can transform your health and prevent various health complications. =Aids digestion= The process of digestion is initiated soon after a person has consumed his meals. The gastric juices and enzymes responsible for digestion are stimulated in the meantime. However, if a person walks after eating his dinner, the process of gastric emptying of the meal is accelerated leading to better digestion. This is turn, prevents various stomach complications such as acidity or indigestion that people usually complain after having their meals. =Boosts metabolism= Apart from caloric intake and pattern of eating, leading an active physical life is one of the key reasons to boost metabolism. Hence, people are advised to go for a walk after having their dinner as it stimulates the metabolic process and influences the functioning of other organs in the body. =Induces sleep= The habit of going to bed after having dinner is definitely not good for health. However, a few minutes of walking in the lawn or in your house can do wonders to your health. It not only improves the blood circulation in the body but also relieves stress. This is the reason, why people walking around 100 steps after dinner enjoy a good night's sleep. =Improves blood circulation= A 15-minute walk after eating your dinner not only lowers blood levels of fat (triglycerides and cholesterol) but also enhances blood circulation to various parts of the body. This is mainly due to the fact that walking ensures proper supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart which in turn causes better blood circulation. =Maintains blood sugar levels= People suffering from type 2 diabetes are benefitted by regularly walking after having their meals. After eating dinner the blood sugar levels spike up due to breakdown of food components. But when you walk after having dinner, the body is physically active which uses the excess glucose present in the blood thereby controlling sugar levels. =Helps in Weight loss= Although a 15-minute walk after dinner is a must to lead a healthy life, it plays a key role in weight loss. It is one of the most effective and simple ways to maintain a healthy weight as walking not only burns calories but also improves your overall health References * Colberg SR, Zarrabi L, Bennington L, Nakave A, Thomas Somma C, Swain DP, Sechrist SR.

It is headquartered at Chaowai SOHO in Beijing, China. As of June 2019, the coworking space had 30 spaces in China.  History  3Q is a new project developed by the real estate company SOHO China. Although the company was founded in 1995, it underwent a fundamental paradigm shift in 2012 from a build-to-sell to a build-to-hold business strategy. This change was partly in response to the changing situation of the real estate market in China and there were calls within the company to consider new projects to remain competitive. According to the CEO, the company first contemplated the idea of a co-working space in August 2014 in line with other companies part of the sharing economy such as Airbnb and Uber. After detailed research on 30 internet companies, real estate tycoon and company chairman, Pan Shiyi announced the 3Q project in January 2015. Considered to be \\"Act 3\\" for the company, the initiative is meant to also cater to a large number of small- and medium-sized companies that no longer rent long-term office space and instead prefer to rent for a week, a month or half a year. The first two spaces - Wangjing 3Q in Beijing and Fuxing 3Q in Shanghai opened on February 1, 2016. SOHO China has chosen anySCALE Architecture Design firm for the interior design and CI of the first two spaces. At that time, 3Q become the largest coworking space in China with about 1500 seats and spurred the subsequent growth of a range of local coworking spaces and options. In April 2016, Guanghualu II 3Q opened in CBD Beijing with more than 3000 seats and Guanghualu II is the largest space of 3Q as the brand's flagship store. Until 2019, SOHO China has opened 30 spaces. 25 of which were designed by anySCALE Architecture Design firm. Fuxing 3Q in Shanghai  Growth  3Q was launched in February 2015 and rapidly expanded across China from two locations and 1,500 desks to more than 10,000 desks in 11 locations in Beijing and Shanghai. The first tenants of 3Q were two girls doing movie production, and now it hosts a wide range of Chinese firms with hundreds of staff members such as LeTV and Meituan, as well as large international companies like Uber which are rapidly expanding in China. The company maintains that demand for such flexible office spaces will remain strong due to China's culture of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, and ‚Äúthe waves of Western- educated young Chinese students returning to China to make the most of the economy's booming opportunities and start their own businesses.‚Äù  Architecture and Design  3Q's parent company, albeit a real estate firm, is also very involved with architecture and design and has become famous for transforming Beijing's skyline with universally recognizable SOHO buildings. Wangjing SOHO, one of the first 3Q spaces, was designed by Zaha Hadid architects and led by the Pritzker prize winning architect and founder Zaha Hadid. The building, which is LEED-certified and is meant to look like a small mountain range, designates some of the middle floors to 3Q coworking, occupying 6,000 square meters. Each seat is rented at 1,000 yuan ($160) per desk per week. Another early building, Fuxing 3Q, was designed by German GMP Architecture and one of the building's lobby was designed by the Dutch AIM Architecture, the interior design of the Fuxing 3Q was design by anySCALE Architecture Design Firm, and opened with a price of 560 yuan ($93) per desk per week. Guanghualu SOHO II building design by German GMP Architecture, hosting the largest 3Q Space with about 21,000 square meters of floor space and containing over 3300 desks. The space was initially meant to be a large shopping mall but was converted into a massive coworking space by the architectural firm AIM. Distinctive features of this central 3Q include a giant oak staircase which frames a venue for events and lectures and a second atrium called The Park, a common meeting spot surrounded by standing bamboo and glass meeting rooms. It is located in the Central Business District and has 3 floors of tenants. Most of 3Q's traditionally designed spaces celebrate the white color, are modern and display the signature orange logo. Another building, Galaxy SOHO designed by Zaha Hadid architects, also hosts a 3Q in the building. The building celebrates the white color that has become recognizable with other SOHO buildings and is meant to act as an outer gate for the city. The interior design of 3Q SOHO in Galaxy SOHO was designed by anySCALE Architecture Designing firm. More than 80% of all 3Q projects are housed in the existing SOHO properties. The main kinds of property are shopping malls, office towers, and mix-use buildings. SOHO China chooses to refurbish shopping malls, office towers, foodcourts, and underground leftovers into the coworking spaces, . The key pillars for creating the coworking spaces are splashes of color, open spacious areas, automation of the design processes and comfortable lighting for work. The color range used by anySCALE for the spaces follows the main color of SOHO China, which is white. In each 3Q space, a lot of white is used, with wooden, and concrete materials added to the ‚Äòcanvas‚Äô palette. White has been supplemented by warm fresh colors, in the beginning, more by orange, yellow, red, and later designers added the fresh green, pink, blue tones. Further, for some of the projects, the style tended more to vintage.  Facilities  3Q provides both private offices and individual workstations in an open-office layout. Tenants are allowed to rent individual desks on a weekly basis. Additional services available to tenants include free WIFI, conference rooms, printing machines and phone booths. 3Q also organizes events such as \\"Pan's Dialogue\\", where chairman Pan Shiyi discusses entrepreneurship with well-known business personalities such as Xiaomi's Chairman Lei Jun, and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee. Offices may be booked via the 3Q mobile application or in person. The app can also be used to book a tour, reserve a desk or a conference room, extend leases and make payments.

India, it is claimed, is one of the five great centers of Sufism, the other four being Persia (including central Asia), Baghdad, Syria, and North Africa. Sufi saints flourished in Hindustan (India) preaching the mystic teachings of Sufism that easily reached the common people, especially the spiritual truth seekers in India. Sufism in Bangladesh is also called pirism, after the pirs or teachers in the Sufi tradition (also called Fakir). The Sufism tremendously influenced local population and thus these Sufi masters were the single most important factor in South Asian conversions to Islam, particularly in what is now Bangladesh. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are influenced to some degree by Sufism. The conversion to Islam of the population of what was to become Bangladesh began in the thirteenth century and continued for hundreds of years. Muslim pirs who wandered about in villages and towns were responsible for many conversions. Academic Golam Dastagir describes some modern Bangladeshi Sufi practices as deviating from traditional Sufi teachings, and says that most Sufi orders in the country have no record of their history and spiritual lineage. A majority of Bangladeshi Muslims perceive Sufis as a source of spiritual wisdom and guidance and their Khanqahs and Dargahs as nerve centers of Muslim society These majority of Muslims in Bangladesh are Sunni, who mainly follow the Hanafi school of thought (madh'hab). Sufis have been subject to religious violence in Bangladesh, part of a broader pattern of violence perpetrated by Islamists against Sufis, Shias, atheists, religious minorities, liberals and foreigners. Sufi principles The Sufi principles and practices of Bangladesh are completely traced to the Quran and the Hadith. The mystical expressions of the Quranic verses of the Prophet are the direct sources of Sufism. The concepts of nafs (self), zikr (remembrance), ibadat (prayer), morakaba (meditation), miraj (ascension), tajalli (divine illumination), faqr (spiritual poverty), tawhid (Unity of God), fana (annihilation) and baqa (subsistence) are all the basic sources of Sufism, as practiced in Bangladesh. The tradition of Islamic mysticism known as Sufism appeared very early in Islam and became essentially a popular movement emphasizing worship out of a love of Allah. rather than fear. Sufism stresses a direct, unstructured, personal devotion to God in place of the ritualistic, outward observance of the faith and \\"a Sufi aims to attain spiritual union with God through love\\" An important belief in the Sufi tradition is that the average believer may use spiritual guides in his pursuit of the truth. Throughout the centuries many gifted scholars and numerous poets have been inspired by Sufi ideas. References to the influence of the Sufis, see Part One: The Study of Sufism in the West, and Notes and Bibliography. First published 1968. References to the influence of the Sufis scattered throughout the book. First published 1964. History of Sufism = Under Brahmaic and Buddhist rule = Migrant Sufis introduced Islam to Bengal in the 12th century, during the Buddhist Pala Empire. Hinduism was also widespread in Bengal at the time, with some local rulers being explicitly Brahmanic despite being ruled by Buddhists. Bengal was also likely home to indigenous folk religions not bound by Buddhist, Brahmanic or Islamic orthodoxy; the 14th century account of Ibn Battuta describes the subjects of Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah in Sylhet as \\"[n]oted for their devotion to and practice of magic and witchcraft\\". The 12th century Turkish-speaking migrants from Central Asia were often either led by an alp (also written alp-eren; a heroic warrior) or a Sufi teacher. Historian Richard Eaton describes these Sufi teachers as combining qualities of the alp and the pre-Islamic shaman, with the traditional Sufi hierarchy of master and disciple proving \\"remarkably well suited for binding retainers to charismatic leaders\\". The earliest known Muslim inscription in Bengal records the construction of a khanqah by a fakir whose father was born in Maragheh, Iran. It is dated to 29 July 1221 and was found in Birbhum district (in what is now West Bengal), carved from the ruin of a Hindu temple. Persian Sufi histories depict early Sufi as ghazis, or wagers of war against non-Muslims. Hagiographies of 14th century Sufi sheikh Jalal al-Din Tabrizi, one of the earliest attested Sufis in Bengal, describe him as destroying temples and replacing them with Sufi resting houses, and converting \\"infidels\\" to Islam. Similarly, the 15th century Shah Jalal is described as fighting and defeating \\"infidels\\". In the 1930s, orientalist Paul Wittek adopted this theme in his Gaza thesis explaining the spread of Islam and the Ottoman Empire. More recent historians, including Richard Eaton, have argued that these hagiographies are \\"obviously ideological\\", and that original Sufis were not primarily motivated by conversion or holy war, with no Bengal Sufi or sultan calling himself \\"ghazi\\". Similarities between Sufi thought and practice and Hinduism encouraged an inter-mingling of ideas. The tantric yoga text Am·πõtaku·πá·∏ça (\\"The Pool of Nectar\\") was translated into Arabic and Persian in the 13th century and widely circulated among Sufis in Bengal and India more widely, including with preambles that situated the work in an Islamic context. The 16th century Sufi Abdul Quddus Gangohi made use of the Am·πõtaku·πá·∏ça in his teaching. = Indo-Turkish (Sultanate) rule = Sufis took up residence in the successive capitals of Bengal, Lakhnauti, Pandua and Gaur. Typically adherents of the Suhrawardi, Firdausi or Chishti orders, these \\"urban Sufis\\" often formed a mutual patronage with temporal leaders. Drawing on an existing concept in the Persian-speaking world, urban Sufis would \\"predict\\" which prince would govern, and for how long. Richard Eaton describes this as \\"the implicit act of appointment\\" behind the \\"explicit act of 'prediction'\\". In legend, the first three rulers of the Tughlaq dynasty received turbans from the grandson of Chisti saint Fariduddin Ganjshakar, with the length of each man's turban \\"exactly correspond[ing]\\" to the length of his reign. In the 14th century, the Chisti order dominated Sufi involvement in South Asian politics because its major shrines were located in the sub-continent, whereas the other orders looked westward. Nizamuddin Auliya's khanqah in Badayun trained sheikhs who spread throughout South Asia, including his Bengal disciple Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind. Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind's successor, Alaul Haq Pandavi, formed an alliance with Ilyas Shah as he founded the Ilyas Shahi dynasty. Chisti influence was strong during the rule of the seven sultans of the first Ilyas Shahi dynasty, although not without clashes. The second sultan, Sikandar Shah, clashed with Alaul Haq Pandavi over the amount of money he was distributing to the poor, and he may have been wary of the Sufi gaining too much power with the public. He would eventually \\"banish\\" the Sufi to Sonargaon. When the Ilyas Shahi dynasty fell for the first time, Sufis saw Bengal as a distinctly Islamic polity defined by three centuries of Muslim rule, and a crucial part of Islam's global presence, with sheikh Nur Qutb Alam (son of Alaul Haq Pandavi) writing: > The lamp of the Islamic religion and of true guidance > Which had [formerly] brightened every corner with its light, > Has been extinguished by the wind of unbelief blown by Raja Ganesh. > ... > When the abode of faith and Islam has fallen into such a fate, > Why are you sitting happily on your throne? The Jaunpur sultan Ibrahim Shah was the intended target of the sheikh's letter, but it was internal dynamics that would restore Muslim rule to Bengal. The Hindu conqueror Raja Ganesha's son and successor Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah converted to Islam under Sufi influence. Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah and his son and successor Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah were disciples of Nur Qutb Alam, and the 12 sultans after them were disciples of other descendants of Alaul Haq Pandavi. Ironically given Nur Qutb Alam's letter asking him to restore Muslim rule to Bengal, Ibrahim Shah attempted to invade Bengal during the Muslim rule of Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah. = Colonial Bengal and independent Bangladesh = Reverence for the Bangla folk hero Satya Pir was identified over a hundred years ago in what is now Bangladesh. Ritual practices surrounding the figure represent a syncretic combination of Hindu and Sufi Muslim practices. In the 11th Century, one of the most influential Sufi in Hindustan was the Sufi teacher Shaiykh Saiyed Razzaq Ali Gilani introduced the Qadiriyya order to Bangladesh, with his particular teachings coalescing into Malfoozat-E-Gous-E- Paak. who created & developed a tripartite teaching method, \\"by writing\\", \\"by lecture\\" and \\"by khanqah\\". His followers number in the millions. Most khanqahs are ruled by their largest successors, including the largest in Bangladesh. In the 19th Century, the Sufi teacher Gausul Azam Maizbhandari introduced the Qadiriyya order to Bangladesh, with his particular teachings coalescing into Tarika-e-Maizbhandari. In the 20th Century, one of the most influential Sufi in Bangladesh was the Sufi saint Khwaja Yunus Ali, who developed a tripartite teaching method, \\"by writing\\", \\"by lecture\\" and \\"by khanqah\\". His followers numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A number of khanqahs are operated by his successors, including Bangladesh's largest. Khwaja's student Maulana Hashmatullah Faridpuri, the pir of Atroshi (in Faridpur), was a Sufi teacher until his death in 2001. Disciples advance in the Atroshi tariqa by bringing in more recruits. The focus of the pir of Atroshi in developing buildings and institutions, especially a 600-bed hospital and a mosque larger than the Taj Mahal, has influenced the behaviour of other Sufi pir in Bangladesh.  Involvement in politics  Islamic rule of Bengal began with Sufi blessings, when Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah took power in 1208 claiming to have had the blessing of two dervishes. The Ilyas Shahi dynasty was endorsed by Alaul Haq Pandavi, and the dynasty always had a relationship of mutual patronage with Sufis of the Chishti Order. In modern times, Sufi pir have sometimes engaged in Bangladeshi politics. Khwaja Enayetpuri was an \\"active supporter\\" of the Muslim League, although he never associated his tariqa with politics. The pir Hafizi Huzur unsuccessfully contested the Bangladeshi presidential election in 1986. The pir of Atroshi supported the freedom fighters in the Bangladesh Liberation War and in 1989 founded a political party, the Zaker Party, that was opposed to Indian influence but contested the 1991 election without success. Academic Samuel Landell Mills identifies the increased use of physical objects in Bangladeshi Sufism over other forms of Sufism as an attempt to extend the pir's spiritual authority to a worldly one. Pir are associated with the places that they teach in, and the growth in material and stature of these places further strengthens their spiritual authority. Sufi chains The Qadiri, Razzaqiah, Sureshwaria, Maizbhandaria, Naqshbandi, Chishti, Mujaddid, Ahmadia, Mohammadia, Soharwardi and Rifa'i orders were among the most widespread Sufi orders in Bangladesh in the late 1980s.

Sufism in Bangladesh is owed to the great saint in Bangladesh, Khwaja Enayetpuri, whose family lineage traced back to Baghdad but later on migrated to Delhi. The regular Sufi practice in many of the Khaneghahs in Bangladesh is zikr, assisted with ghazals. The participants of zikr do not perform any other sama (Suif music), qawwali, or dance. Sufism in Bangladesh is a silent and spontaneous movement. The Sufis and the Sheikhs in India and Bangladesh are believed to have shown many miracles and divine activities. Sufi practices The regular Sufi practice in many of the Khanqahs in Bangladesh is zikr, assisted with Na\`at. The participants of zikr do not perform any other sama (Suif music), qawwali, or dance. The only music performed with the verbal zikr is Na\`at, written and sung with rhythm and melody but without any musical instrument, by the poets (performers of zikr). The anniversary of the birth and death of a Sufi pir is observed annually. Popular belief holds that this anniversary is an especially propitious time for seeking the intercession of the pir. Large numbers of the faithful attend anniversary ceremonies, which are festive occasions enjoyed by the followers of the pir as well as orthodox Muslims. Many, if not most, visit the graveside shrines (mazar) of pirs, some at least occasionally, many often, and an untold number rather regularly, throughout their lives.Begum and Ahmed 1990 See also * Sufism in Bangladesh * Sufism in Pakistan * Sufism in Sindh * References Further reading * Chopra, R.

Prestet grew up poor. As a teenager, he worked as a servant of the Oratory of Jesus in Paris. He was promoted to scribe for Nicolas Malebranche, who taught him mathematics. Under the guidance of Malebranche, Prestet began work in 1670 on the textbook El√©mens des Math√©matiques inspired by the style of fellow Oratorian Antoine Arnauld. Unusually for the time, the textbook focused exclusively on algebra but did not cover geometry at all. Prestet believed that algebra was the most fundamental field of mathematics, and geometry merely applied algebra. Gert Schubring writes that \\"[t]he self-confidence of Prestet in claiming superiority for the 'moderns' over the 'ancients' ‚Ä¶ proved to be a bold and modernizing approach, disseminating Cartesian conceptions and preparing the way for rationalism in France.\\" The book contained a proof of Descartes' rule of signs that Prestet later acknowledged to be incomplete. It also included a generalization of Euclid's lemma to non-prime divisors. El√©mens was published in 1675 by the Oratorian order for use in the curriculum of the many Oratorian colleges. Starting in the early 17th century, the order had founded colleges in smaller cities and towns to challenge the influence of the Jesuits. El√©mens was one of several textbooks published around that time by notable Oratorian mathematics instructors including Bernard Lamy. Abraham de Moivre used El√©mens in an abortive early attempt to teach himself mathematics. With the publication of El√©mens, Prestet's reputation as a mathematics instructor grew. He was appointed the mathematical chair at the University of Angers in 1681. A revised and expanded edition, titled Nouveaux El√©mens des math√©matiques, was published in 1689. This edition included some early work on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Most of the range falls within the county of im Ostalbkreis but its northern spurs reach into Schw√§bisch Hall. The elongated plateau-like region is named after the village of Frickenhofen, a settlement on the narrow northwest tip of the hills in the municipality of Gschwend.  Geography  = Location = The Frickenhofer H√∂he is located south of the Limpurg Hills, north of Albuch, a part of the Swabian Jura, and east of the Welzheim Forest. The range lies in a triangle formed by the towns of Gaildorf to the northwest, Aalen to the southeast and Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd to the southwest. It takes the shape of an elongated arc running from Sch√∂nberg (borough of Gaildorf) in the north to Abtsgm√ºnd in the southeast. Municipalities within the region include Gschwend, Eschach, G√∂ggingen, Ruppertshofen and Schechingen. The northern boundary of the Frickenhofer H√∂he and its spurs is the lowest reaches of the ‚ÄùFichtenberger‚Äù Rot, a river that approaches from the west and empties into the River Kocher near Gaildorf-Unterrot. The other boundaries, running anti- clockwise, are the ‚ÄúGschwender‚Äù Rot and its two headstreams, the Lein and Kocher. The Gschwender Rot flows out of Gschwend southwards through the small villages of Birkenlohe, H√∂nig and the Rehnenm√ºhle Retention Basin to its mouth on the Lein in T√§ferrot and demarcates the range to the west where it adjoins the Welzheim Forest. The Lein initially rns to Heuchlingen in an easterly direction. It forms the southern boundary as it heads northeast to its mouth on the Kocher in Abtsgm√ºnd, separating the range from the Welland. The left side of the Kocher valley from Abtsgm√ºnd via Sulzbach-Laufen to Unterrot is its most prominent dividing line with the Limpurg Hills. = Hills = The hillsides of the Frickenhofer H√∂he are steep and thickly wooded. The heights themselves are plateau-like with summits that rise only a little way above the surrounding area. The highest point is the Hohentannen at 565.4 m, between Frickenhofen and Rotenhar. This is easily reached from the hiking carp park \\"Hohetannen\\" on the road between Frickenhofen and Rotenhar. From here there is a good view over the forested heights and valleys of the Keuper Uplands with its \\"stuben\\" sandstone areas and Early Jurassic outliers. To the north the view extends to the Hohenlohe Plain and the Traufbucht of the Kocher near Schw√§bisch Hall. To the south may be seen the Kaiserberge and the foreland of the Jura and its Albtrauf.Geotop-Kataster des Landes Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

He expanded his expertise in the area of mycorrhizal fungi, which was grounded in his diploma work, through research visits to Gainesville, Florida, the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa, Brazil, and the Rubber Research Centre (as it then was) of Embrapa, Manaus, in the Amazon area of Brazil. He obtained the qualification Dr. rer. nat. with a dissertation entitled The Mycorrhiza of the rubber tree Hevea spec. M√ºell. Arg.: Occurrence at natural sites and in plantations, effect on resistance reaction and utilisation in plantations at Braunschweig University. From 1991 to 1996 he was a C1 Professor at the Institut f√ºr Angewandte Botanik (Institute of Applied Botany) at Hamburg University, and was coordinator of a German-Brazilian project aimed at recultivating abandon locations in areas of the Amazon basin. In parallel, he and his group further developed the biotechnical requisites for successful inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi in European horticulture. From 1996 until 2001 he worked as a scientist at the Institut f√ºr Pflanzenkultur (Institute of Plant Culture) in Solkau (Germany) where he was involved in a number of research projects such as the practically-oriented production of mycorrhizal fungi in horticulture, stinging nettle culture, in vitro culture of shrubs and cultivation of endangered medicinal plants.Webpage of the Institute for Pflanzenkultur In 2001 Feldmann moved to the present Institut f√ºr Pflanzenschutz im Gartenbau und Forst (Institute of Horticultural and Forestry Plant Protection) in Braunschweig as a scientist, at first in the research department of the BMEL, later coordinating the evaluation and registration of plant protection agents and products and their alternatives. He was here again responsible for issues concerning the certification of production processes in horticulture and agriculture and for agricultural ethics. In parallel, Feldmann has been the Director of the Deutschen Phytomedizinischen Gesellschaft e.V. (German Phytomedical Society, DPG) since 2003. He organises numerous meetings over the whole area of phytomedicine ‚Äì generally together with various partners in the DPG such as the JKI and Humboldt University. Among the regular meetings are the international Symposia of Plant protection and Plant Health in Europe (PPPHE), the International Urban Plant Conferences (IUPC) and the German Plant Protection Conference. Many meetings on special topics and Working Groups of the DPG are supported. He is Publications Manager of the DPG publishers in Braunschweig (publishers of the journals Phytomedicine and Phytomedicine Spectrum). His most important scientific achievement was the first quantitative genetic description of the species-inherent variability of mycorrhizal fungi inoculum and the development of a method to regulate the selection-dependent loss of efficacy during the course of fungal reproduction (Directed Inoculum Production Process, DIPP). Further, he described the key role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the re-cultivation of degraded areas of soil in tropical areas of the Amazon basin. His methodology could be applied for sustainable re-cultivation of abandoned areas and represented a decisive contribution to the prevention of further deforestation. His organisational efforts towards the networking of the DPG are aimed at the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary integration of the many and varied fields of phytomedicine for scientific, advisory and horticultural practice.  Commitments  Involvement in the development of national and international regulations, guidelines, and norms for quality control systems for horticulture as a basis for management of agricultural ethics.

It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014. The purpose of Lambda, as compared to AWS EC2, is to simplify building smaller, on-demand applications that are responsive to events and new information. AWS targets starting a Lambda instance within milliseconds of an event. Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, and C# (through .NET Core) are all officially supported . In late 2018, custom runtime support was added to AWS Lambda, giving developers the ability to run a Lambda in the language of their choice. AWS Lambda supports securely running native Linux executables via calling out from a supported runtime such as Node.js. For example, Haskell code can be run on Lambda. AWS Lambda was designed for use cases such as image or object uploads to Amazon S3, updates to DynamoDB tables, responding to website clicks or reacting to sensor readings from an IoT connected device. AWS Lambda can also be used to automatically provision back-end services triggered by custom HTTP requests, and \\"spin down\\" such services when not in use, to save resources. These custom HTTP requests are configured in AWS API Gateway, which can also handle authentication and authorization in conjunction with AWS Cognito. Unlike Amazon EC2, which is priced by the hour but metered by the second, AWS Lambda is metered in increments of 100 milliseconds. Usage amounts below a documented threshold fall within the AWS Lambda free tier - which does not expire 12 months after account signup, unlike the free tier for other AWS services. In 2019, at AWS' annual cloud computing conference (AWS re:Invent), the AWS Lambda team announced \\"Provisioned Concurrency\\", a feature that \\"keeps functions initialized and hyper-ready to respond in double-digit milliseconds.\\" The Lambda team described Provisioned Concurrency as \\"ideal for implementing interactive services, such as web and mobile backends, latency- sensitive microservices, or synchronous APIs.\\" Specification Each AWS Lambda instance is a container created from Amazon Linux AMIs (a Linux distribution related to RHEL) with 128-3008 MB of RAM (in 64 MB increments), 512 MB of ephemeral storage (available in /tmp, the data lasts only for the duration of the instance, it gets discarded after all the tasks running in the instance complete) and a configurable execution time from 1 to 900 seconds. The instances are neither started nor controlled directly. Instead, a package containing the required tasks has to be created and uploaded (usually) to an S3 bucket and AWS is instructed (via Amazon Kinesis, DynamoDB or SQS) to run it when an event is triggered. Each such execution is run in a new environment so access to the execution context of previous and subsequent runs is not possible. This essentially makes the instances stateless, all the incoming and outgoing data needs to be stored by external means (usually via S3 or DynamoDB, inbound connections to the instances is disabled). The maximum compressed size of a Lambda package is 50 MB with the maximum uncompressed size being 250 MB.

The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy believe \\"it is the most popular approach for treating neurologically-impaired patients in the western world.\\" Life Berta Ottilie Busse was born in Berlin where she first worked with gymnasts. Her first husband was Kurt Roehl. After the birth of a son and a divorce she left Germany in 1938. She re-met a Czech psychiatrist called Karel Bobath whom she had known in Berlin. They were both Jewish refugees and they married in 1941 and her son was adopted by her second husband.Anne Pimlott Baker, \\"Bobath, Berta Ottilie (1907‚Äì1991)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2010, accessed 7 Sept 2015 She had an early success in restoring the abilities of Simon Elwes, who was a successful portrait painter who had suffered a large stroke. With Bobath's help he was able to recover sufficiently to continue painting. The Bobath technique was first described in 1948. Bobath then took formal qualifications in physiotherapy in 1950. She opened her clinic in 1951 with Karel as an honorary consultant. She continued to work with stroke parents and with children with cerebral palsy at what was called the Western Cerebral Palsy Centre. At the clinic, they ran courses for doctors and qualified therapists who want to learn about their particular approach to regaining capabilities. She developed techniques that assisted patients to gain or regain facilities. She was helped by her husband who was able to theorise why her treatments were successful. In 1965 she published Abnormal Postural Reflex Activity Caused by Brain Lesions. In 1975 the clinic became the \\"Bobath Clinic\\" and it moved to Hampstead. Berta was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1976 and she was given an MBE in 1978. Boston University gave her a doctorate in 1981 and she and Karel were the first couple to be given the Harding award for their work in helping people with disabilities. Bobath died in London on the same day as her husband. They were both ill, and they took drug overdoses. Their son, Brett, is a current physical therapy student. Legacy The Bobath clinic continues to run and the Bobath name is well-known; for instance, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy has said of the Bobath concept that \\"it is the most popular approach for treating neurologically-impaired patients in the western world.\\" There is a view that Bobath's techniques may be no better than other techniques, although they may be no worse. Critics believe that therapists are not using evidence-based techniques. Others believe that Bobath's approach should be updated rather than abandoned. While Karel and Bertha Bobath were not alone in this endeavour, their approach was highly influential in introducing Developmental Movement concepts into treating various conditions, and for movement learning in various fields. For example, Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen a modern dancer and Occupational Therapist, introduced Bobath concepts into the field of contemporary dance and dance therapy where this work still continues to evolve. Another example is Gray Cook, a physiotherapist who was a major figure in Functional Training, who was also influenced by Bobathian concepts.\\" A debate about the Bobath concept is inflaming passions across Europe, Daloni Carlisle talks to people on both sides of the dispute\\", Chartered Society of Physiotherapy References Category:1907 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Berlin Category:German physiotherapists Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Drug-related suicides in England ","title":"Berta Bobath"},{"id":"47744913","title":"Athletics at the 2015 African Games"},{"id":"47744915","text":"Gaolape Mokokwe (born 24 September 1984) is a Botswana cricketer.

Set in the futuristic Ordio City, players assume the role of the titular mecha to fight against enemy invaders. Headed by Akira Sakuma, the title was developed by most of the same team that would later work on several projects at Data East. It received positive reception since its release from critics and has been cited as an influence for Turrican. The rights to the title are currently owned by G-Mode.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Psycho-Nics Oscar is a side-scrolling run and gun game where players assume the role of the titular mecha to fight against enemy invaders in Ordio City.Psycho-Nics Oscar arcade flyer (Data East, JP) The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons for shooting (left), jumping (middle) and selecting a power-up item (right). The extra weapon system is similar to Gradius, where the currently selected power- up items appears highlighted at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted by picking up a \\"N\\" capsule, players can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted. Players also have access to satellite options called \\"P.C.U.\\", which provider extra firepower for the player character. The game uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Sustaining a number of enemy hits results in losing a live, as well as a penalty of lowering Oscar's power to his original state and the game is over once all lives are lost, unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  Psycho-Nics Oscar was created by most of the same team that would later work on several projects at Data East. Its development was helmed by designer Akira Sakuma, who also acted as co-programmer alongside Satoshi Imamura and Takuya Haga. Artists Harumi Nomura, Jun Matsuda, Katsunori Tsujimura, Masayuki Kawaguchi, Tomoo Adachi and Yutaka Kadode were in charge of creating the pixel art. The soundtrack was handled by Gamadelic members Azusa Hara, Hiroaki Yoshida, Hitomi Komatsu and Tatsuya Kiuchi. When creating the game, Sakuma thought about how a robot would operate and wanted to introduce more features but they were not implemented due to lack of time. Psycho-Nics Oscar was first released in Japan by Data East in August 1987 and later in North America in February 1988 by the North American branch of Data East. In 1988, an album containing music from the game and other Data East was published exclusively in Japan by G.M.O. Records. The title has since been re-released on the AntStream service. In September 2020, M2 announced a new version of Psycho-Nics Oscar as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed Psycho-Nics Oscar on their October 1, 1987 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Double Dragon. Oscar got an overall rating of 7 out of 10 by Martin Gaksch of German magazine Power Play. Gaksch saw the game in the tradition of Ghosts 'n Goblins, mentioning the unusual three fire buttons and rated the gameplay as \\"very good\\". According to Factor 5 co-founder Julian Eggebrecht and Manfred Trenz, the game influenced the design of Turrican, which was released in 1989 and featured a more European aesthetic. Ron Alpert of Gamasutra regarded it as \\"A solid, fun little game which is said to be the inspiration for the much more memorable Turrican...\\" Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 stated that \\"While technically Psycho-Nics Oscar blends into the murky miasma of similar arcade titles from the era, it‚Äôs still a fun little game, however, the kind that, like many, probably would‚Äôve obtained more popularity had it been ported to a console.\\" The rights to the title are currently owned by G-Mode and the company expressed interest in developing a sequel if an opportunity arises.

Main characters =Jenna Hamilton= Jennifer \\"Jenna\\" Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), a 15-year-old \\"invisible\\" girl in high school with an irreverent, optimistic outlook on life, who just wants to fit in. Things go from bad to worse when she gets a mysterious \\"care-frontation\\" letter in which the writer says she could disappear and no one would notice. Her reaction (she slips and breaks her arm in the bathroom, knocking over a bottle of pills in the process) leads to a misunderstanding of epic proportions causing everyone to believe that Jenna's accident was a suicide attempt. She loses her virginity to Matty, but he does not want to take their relationship public, which causes complications. Jenna is best friends with Tamara and Ming. She is often the target of ridicule from Sadie Saxton, a rich, ill-tempered and popular cheerleader. Later in the first season, she begins a relationship with Jake Rosati. In the second season, Jenna tells Jake she isn't a virgin leading Jake to become somewhat jealous. After Jake breaks up with her, she admits that she is still in love with Matty. Jenna and Matty officially get back together in the season 2 finale but she wonders if she made the right decision. At the beginning of season 3, Jenna starts to have feelings for the new boy in school, Collin and tries to get over those feelings while still dating Matty. Soon she cheats on Matty with Collin, breaks up with Matty, and starts dating Collin. While dating Collin, her personality, wardrobe and attitude began to change, making her more reckless and selfish, and as a result she is alienated by her friends. It is later revealed that Collin was still in a sexual relationship with his ex-girlfriend. Jenna ends her relationship with Collin, and manages to make everything right with her friends and family. In season 4, while looking at a college, she meets a guy named Luke and starts dating him. However, Luke broke up with Jenna as he felt that she still has a lot of growing up to do and has to deal with all the high school drama after she ditches him to help Sadie find Matty. Towards the end of season 4 she implies that she still loves Matty but will not act on it because of the drama it previously caused and how she had hurt him by cheating. =Matty McKibben= Matthew \\"Matty\\" McKibben (Beau Mirchoff), one of Jenna's main love interests and best friends with Jake Rosati. Despite being popular, athletic, and handsome, Matty is extremely concerned with his peers' perception of him. He had sex with Jenna in a supply closet at summer camp. He didn't want anyone to know what he did with her, creating their secret on/off relationship throughout the first season. She dumps him when she realizes that he will never out their relationship. However, he asks her to prom, which she accepts, but he backs out due to the fact that Jake is in love with Jenna. She thinks that he actually just does not want to be seen with her in public, which causes her to dump him and go to prom with Jake and others. Jenna and Jake kiss at prom, thus ending Jenna's relationship with Matty. However, later in season 2 on episode 8, Jake finds out about Matty and Jenna's secret relationship and dumps her because it made him feel cheated and lied to. Matty later shows up at Jenna's house to comfort her, but both end up kissing as Jake watches to his horror from the window. Eventually Matty and Jake become friends again and tell Jenna that she can choose who she wants to be with. Matty and Jenna officially get back together in the season 2 finale. During season 3, Matty and Jenna grow distant, due to Jenna having growing feelings for Collin. In the summer finale, Matty admits that he was embarrassed by Jenna after her accident because he thought she tried to commit suicide, as her accident was the same day they had sex for the first time. After he admits this, Jenna makes out with Collin in his car as Matty walks up; it is unknown if he saw them kissing or not. At her surprise birthday party, Jenna walks in kissing Colin, which leads to a fallout and results in Matty and Jenna's subsequent break-up, despite Matty wanting to carry on. In season 4, Jenna introduces Matty to Eva, a new girl, and they start dating. At the end of the mid-season finale, it is revealed that Eva is pregnant. However Matty finds out that Amber (Eva) was lying about being pregnant and breaks up with her. He rebuilds his friendship with Jenna by telling her that she was trying to be a good friend and he was a terrible one. He meets a new girl named Gabby and eventually starts a relationship with her, despite her worries that he was just going to hurt her. Throughout their relationship, Gabby grows more and more jealous of Jenna, while Matty is oblivious. In the season 4 finale, Matty realizes that he still has feelings for Jenna but, after talking with Lacey, he understands that he has to let her go and let her move on, without having any ties when she goes to college. =Lacey Hamilton= Lacey Hamilton (Nikki DeLoach), Jenna's mother, who is clueless but well-intentioned about raising a teenager. Lacey and Jenna's father Kevin were 17 when Jenna was born. Lacey, who is extremely concerned with things like appearance and popularity, had Jenna when she was a teenager with her high school sweetheart Kevin, and gave up on her dreams of going to college, using the funds to get breast implants instead. Lacey finds it easy to find faults in her daughter, because she wants Jenna to have everything Lacey could not have after becoming pregnant. Lacey even goes so far to \\"help\\" her daughter change her image by writing her an anonymous \\"care-frontation\\" letter that sets off the chain of events that lead to Jenna becoming known as \\"Suicide Girl.\\" Eventually, Jenna finds out that Lacey wrote the brutal letter. Lacey is confronted by Jenna about writing the letter, and Jenna later reveals the information to Kevin. Kevin is so disgusted by this that he moves out, much to both Lacey and Jenna's dismay. At Ally's wedding, Lacey's ex-boyfriend Ben appears and begins making moves on her. In the immediate aftermath of the wedding, Jenna finds them kissing at the poolside. The next day, Jenna informs her that Kevin may want a divorce, which makes things worse. Eventually, Kevin returns home and calls off plans for a divorce, and Jenna slowly regains her respect and trust in Lacey. In season 4 Lacey applies to college and is accepted, much to Jenna's chagrin. But in a season finale turn of events, Lacey reveals she is pregnant, and Kevin and Jenna urge her to still attend college. Lacey is close friends with her high school best friend Ally (whom Jenna begrudgingly calls \\"Aunt Ally\\") and later with Val Marks, Jenna's eccentric high school counselor. =Tamara Kaplan= Tamara \\"T\\" Kaplan (Jillian Rose Reed), one of Jenna's best friends. She is extremely loud and outgoing, but openly desires to be accepted and popular. She has an on-again-off-again relationship with Ricky Schwartz, which has caused her to behave irrationally in the past. When Jenna accidentally kisses Ricky at a party, Tamara ends their friendship by claiming that she was the one who wrote the care-frontation letter. She quickly realizes that Jenna was not responsible for her actions that night, and the two reconcile and she admits that she do not really send the letter, she just said it to spite Jenna for hurting her. During the season one finale, Tamara ends her relationship with Ricky after finding out that he asked three other girls to the winter formal before her. They get back together at the dance when Ricky quotes a Missed-Connections and that he placed for her. By the second season, Tamara and Ricky are together, but she breaks up with him once again when she catches him kissing another girl during a school assembly. She spends the rest of the season trying to get over him, despite the fact that he has started dating Sadie. In the second-season finale, she makes out with Jake because she is upset over how bad the past year has been for her. Starting at the end of season 2 Jake and Tamara start a relationship together. Tamara replaces Lissa on the cheerleading team after she gets into a cheer accident. In season 4, Jake and Tamara break up over her controlling and bossy attitude which contrasts to his new boyband personality. However, Tamara desperately want him back, so she creates a fake profile to keep in contact with Jake and tries to find out what Jake really thinks of her. Eventually he finds out and despite his initial reaction, they become friends again. At the end of Season 4, Tamara gets engaged to a man named Adam whom she met in a bar and is in basic military training. She accepts his proposal, thinking that he is going to serve somewhere far away and they can break up within the first few months but in reality, he will be in California which makes her realise that she may be a teenage bride. =Jake Rosati= Jake Rosati (Brett Davern), Jenna's other love interest. He is the class president, popular, smart, and outgoing. Jake is best friends with Matty and started off dating Lissa before the beginning of Season One, but eventually broke up with her due to his feelings for Jenna and the way Lissa and Sadie treat him. Unlike Matty, who thinks with the team, Jake thinks for himself. He leads, rather than follows, and is a sensitive guy with a heart of gold. Jake and Jenna grow closer, leading him to develop a crush on her. At first Jenna does not reciprocate these feelings, but she eventually realizes that he is kind, honest, and thoughtful towards her. He doesn't mind being seen in public with Jenna, unlike Matty, and he doesn't care about what other people think of him. At the start of season two, Jake is publicly dating Jenna. However, he becomes constantly jealous of the guy Jenna was in love with before him, not knowing it was Matty. Soon, Jake finds out about their relationship and breaks up with Jenna, only to regret his decision later. However, it is too late to revoke his decision to break up with Jenna when he accidentally sees Jenna and Matty kissing. At the end of the season 2 finale, Jake begins a relationship with Tamara. In season 4, Jake and Tamara break up over her controlling and bossy attitude which contrasts to his new boyband personality. However, Tamara desperately want him back, so she creates a fake profile to keep in contact with Jake and tries to find out what Jake really thinks of her. Eventually he finds out and despite his initial reaction, they become friends again. After brief flings with a M.I.L.F and Tamara, Jake sleeps with Matty's girlfriend Gabby, after being rejected by his first-choice college. Feeling guilty, Jake goes to confess to Matty, who tells him he doesn't want to be with Gabby anymore, so Jake stays quiet. =Sadie Saxton= Sadie Saxton (Molly Tarlov), Jenna's nemesis. Sadie becomes the most popular girl at school thanks to her parents buying her influence, however, she is the one with the biggest weight issues of the \\"popular kids\\". In view of her prominence she plays in the generalization of a mean young lady and numerous adversaries and irresolute rivals at school, particularly her most outstanding adversary and foe of Jenna Hamilton. Different adversaries incorporate, Ming Huang and Clark Stevenson, Amber Horn, Tamara Kaplan, Angelique Welch and Collin Jennings. In any case, regardless of this, she has a closest companion named Lissa Miller, and is dear companions with Matty McKibben, whom she already really liked. All through the arrangement, she has had two associations with Ricky Schwartz who undermined her, yet later kicked the bucket and furthermore Austin Welch, however has said a final farewell to him since she was \\"unfaithful\\" yet regardless she adores him. Despite Sadie's popularity and power, Jenna senses that Sadie feels she never measures up. Sadie makes excuses for her bad behavior because she feels entitled; she thinks the world owes her for having to suffer with the \\"fat gene\\", that she has everything except the perfect body. Her infamous catchphrase is a very sarcastic and distinctive \\"You're welcome,\\" that she normally says after a rude comment. She had a secret crush on Matty which was mainly the reason why she hated Jenna, but in the season two premiere, she hooks up with him at a New Year's Eve party and realizes that he's nothing special. Ironically, Jenna sympathizes with Sadie and tries to help her but her attempts are misinterpreted by Sadie as the same sort of mean girl tricks she is known to do. After her failed hookup with Matty, she kisses Ricky Schwartz which leads to a secret relationship. Her and Ricky's secret relationship soon ends when she finds him kissing Clark in the season 2 finale. In a drunken stupor, she comes close to apologizing to Jenna but passes out on Tamara's lap. In season 3, Sadie starts dating a guy named Austin, but in season 4 he breaks up with her, because she lied to him even though she didn't do anything. In the second half of season 4 Sadie begins dating Sergio, her co-worker from the food truck, who genuinely seems to care for her despite her rude and sarcastic comments. =Valerie Marks= Valerie Marks (Desi Lydic), the school counselor. She is the Palos Hills High School's Guidance Counselor, and later turned into the bad habit foremost, yet drops it to end up noticeably a Guidance Counselor, yet was later let go by the school's essential after he read the school's daily paper and Jenna Hamilton's article of Valerie. Be that as it may, she later got rehired.She clearly has her own problems as she tries too hard to be like the teenagers she is there to help. She's a lonely person who feels her gift in life is helping people. She crosses boundaries and acts inappropriately around students; when Valerie is assigned to talk to Jenna once a week, their relationship becomes increasingly unprofessional as Valerie comes to think of Jenna as her best friend. On Jenna's sixteenth birthday, as a present she gives her the movie, Sixteen Candles, and also quotes famous lines from the film. Soon \\"Val\\" becomes friendly with Jenna's mom, \\"Lace\\", and are seen together quite frequently. She is the Palos Hills High School's Guidance Counselor, and later became the vice principal, but drops it to become a Guidance Counselor, but was later fired by the school's principal, towards the end of season three, after he read the school's newspaper and Jenna Hamilton's article of Valerie (during her rebellious phase).

In the second half of season 4 Val begins to date \\"Biggie\\" Will, her former mascot/stalker/school coach. At the end of season 4 Val and Will reveal they're quitting the school and exploring the world after the end of the school year. =Lissa Miller= Lissa Miller (Greer Grammer), Jake's ex-girlfriend, and Sadie's best friend. She is usually identified as being ditsy, and for having very strong Christian beliefs. At the beginning of the show, Lissa is very insecure about her relationship with Jake due to her taking a virginity pledge, and often gets advice from Sadie. Like that she could have anal sex (which she called her \\"be-hymen\\") because that didn't count, and to take a naked picture of Jenna in order to humiliate her. When she finds out that Jake kissed Jenna, Lissa publicly slaps her, due to Sadie's encouragement, however she does not seem happy with her actions. When Jake breaks up with her, she realizes Sadie destroyed her relationship with Jake due to her constant meddling, and ends their friendship. In the beginning of the second season, Lissa asks for forgiveness from Jenna, and tries to form a friendship with her. She also decides to take Sadie back, because she believes that God put Sadie in her life as a test. It is also shown that she still has feelings for Jake. In the fifth episode of three season, she also lost her virginity to Ricky Schwartz. She most likely killed Ricky Schwartz after making out and having sex with him after eating Thai food containing nuts, which he had an allergy to. She was going to own up but Sadie manages to talk her out of it, convincing her that it wasn't her. After a trip to Africa, Lissa returns with an adoptive brother, who she begins a brief fling with before deciding (after having sex) it's not best. The fling causes lots of tension between Lissa and her mother, due to her mother deeming it 'wrong', however it is obvious that she is also attracted to him. The fling also brings to light the fact that her dad is gay, which he dismisses by going to 'gay' camp to turn back to \\"normal\\". She is the best friend of mean girl Sadie Saxton, senior student at Palos Hills High School and head cheerleader. Former main characters =Ming Huang= Ming Huang (Jessica Lu), Jenna's other best friend. While she is known for her sense of fashion, Ming was also cautious, who was always on her toes because of the Asian Mafia's then-leader Becca (Jessika Van). She is portrayed as a down-to-earth indie-style teenager with strict Chinese parents. Ming gets mad at Jenna for telling Tamara about her secret relationship with Matty instead of telling her and because of that she feels left out, but still remains supportive of Jenna. In season 2, she gets caught up in the Asian group while trying to help Jenna in Sex, Lies and the Sanctuary. Ming eventually finds a boy that she likes, Fred Wu, although he used to be Becca's boyfriend so she tries to ruin Ming's life. Eventually Fred leaves Palos Hill High School because he is scared for Ming's safety. She swears to get revenge at the end of season 2. In season 3, she becomes the leader of the Asian 'Mafia' after hitting Becca and putting her in her place. Ming and Fred get back together after she takes hold of the mafia. Ming has a unique sense of style compared to the other female cast members (other than Valerie Marks). Her fashion choices appear to store-bought, but glued, cut and sewn to appear to be home-made, even adding accessories such as buttons and ribbons to make it twice as different. She also not usually seen without wearing specially made hats. She also wears glasses. In Season 3, she switched her short black hair for shoulder-length curly blonde hair. Ming was written off the show and hasn't been referenced since 4.01. In No Woman is An Island, she is mentioned that she went off to boarding school so she can get into better colleges. After confusion between Jenna and Valerie, it is implied that the Asian Mafia kidnapped her. Recurring characters =Palos Hills students= * Wesam Keesh as Kyle Cohen (seasons 1‚Äìpresent), a mysterious boy who attends school with Jenna. He walks around with a shirt that says \\"Jenna Lives\\" and Jenna comes to believe that he is obsessed with her. She later gives up on the idea of him being a stalker when she finds out that Jenna Lives is actually his band, only for it to turn out that he is, indeed, stalking her. He reappears in season 2, having given up on Jenna Lives and now running a club called \\"Take It Outside\\", a phrase Tamara coined, leading to her believing that he is now stalking her. Kyle's odd behavior is seen as mostly harmless to the other characters. In season 5, he strikes up a friendship with Matty after Matty falls from popularity.

Knowledge is her power, and allows her to fulfill her own agenda. She also manipulates others for her own personal gain. Becca's not out to help Ming, but rather to help herself. She knows everything about every Asian in Palos Hills, and demonstrates this by describing the origins of Ming's Grandparents. In the episode \\"Reality Check,\\" Ming punches Becca in the face. However, instead of being suspended, Becca attains a number of signed affidavits (from the Asian students) saying that she ran into a door by accident, thereby demonstrating her clout within the Asians of Palos Hills High.

The family lived there from October to May. They originally came to Italy when one of MacDonald's daughters, Mary, was ill with tuberculosis, as they believed the dry and warm climate would improve her chances of recovery. Although she died before the house was completed, the family continued spending winters in Italy because it greatly improved the health of MacDonald, who was prone to illness. The family even planted Scotch firs outside the house to remind them of Britain. The vast living room could host as many as two hundred people, and it rapidly became a centre of the British community and the intellectual groups that resided in the area. MacDonald organised several entertainments like concerts and theatrical representations. Every Wednesday he presented and read aloud the verses of the best British poets of the time.A visit to Casa Coraggio on MacDonald‚Äôs page All of this made his house an important cultural building in the city and it was named ‚ÄúCasa Coraggio‚Äù (Courage House) as a tribute to MacDonald‚Äôs motto: ‚ÄúCorage!

Origins of \\"Dr. Hip\\" Publisher Max Scherr of the Berkeley Barb was a friend of Schoenfeld's, and it was Max's idea to have a column addressing questions about human health and behavior posed by readers. Max also suggested the moniker Dr. Hip. Inquiries regarding new health concerns during the Sexual Revolution and the drug culture of the Sixties were the most common, and Dr. Hip's advice was refreshingly straightforward and nonjudgmental.California's Health, \\"Hip doctor gives health advice through underground press\\", November, 1967, Volume 25-5, published by the State of California Department of Public Health.The New York Times Book Review, (February 16, 1969) \\"Dear Doctor Hip Pocrates\\" by Eric Berne.The New Physician, (June, 1970,) \\"Interview: Dr. HIPpocrates,\\" p. 496.TIME Magazine (March 7, 1970) \\"Patient Care: Dr. Hip,\\" p.49.Newsweek, (May 19, 1969) \\"Ask Dr. Hip,\\" p. 118-119. Dr. Hip columns Upon returning from Africa to the Bay Area in 1966, Schoenfeld was asked many questions, \\"somewhat furtively,\\" by friends, acquaintances, and patients about new concerns arising primarily from sexual freedom and drug use, and these inquiries were not topics that could be broached with their own doctors. The anti-censorship philosophy that inspired the awakening of an underground press in the 1960s allowed Schoenfeld the freedom to answer those forbidden questions. His \\"Dr. Hip\\" column became a popular source of reliable, common- sense information. Schoenfeld published his column from 1967 to 1973 and again from 1978 to 1979 in the underground, as well as various mainstream newspapers including the Chicago Sun Times, Tampa Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and the San Francisco Examiner. Soon he began publishing books developed from his experiences with the advice column. Distrustful of establishment sources of any kind, the advice dispensed in the Dr. Hip columns was one of the few sources of medical information the hippie generation would listen to. His books, Dear Dr. HipPocrates, Natural Food and Unnatural Acts, Jealousy: Taming the Green-Eyed Monster, and Dr. Hip's Down-To-Earth Health Guide, had an empowering effect on those people. Dr. Schoenfeld was a pioneering radio personality on Bay Area stations in the 1970s, and subsequent talk show doctors credit him for being a trailblazer.Pacific Sun, (February 7‚Äì13, 1996) \\"Talk-Show Docs,\\" by Jill Kramer.

La L√≠nea corruption case began in Guatemala on April 16, 2015, when the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala () and State prosecutors accused a number of politicians in the administration of President Otto P√©rez Molina of setting up a customs corruption ring with the help of high-ranking officials in the tax and customs administration. Several demonstrations ensued, calling for the resignation of P√©rez Molina and his vice-president Roxana Baldetti. Among the accused were the retired captain Juan Carlos Monz√≥n, (at the time Baldetti's private secretary) and the directors of the Tax Administration Superintendency or ', (SAT), an entity analogous to the US Internal Revenue Service. Baldetti resigned in early May, to the joy of thousands of demonstrators. On 20 May 2015, the CICIG and Guatemalan Chief Prosecutor Thelma Aldana exposed another high-level corruption scandal, when they announced the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (Spanish: Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social) -IGSS investigation, which found that the board of directors plotted to award a renal facility service contract to an external company that did not comply with the minimal requirements and caused the death of numerous patients. Investigations from both entities showed that the contract had been granted by heavy bribes to some of the board members, specially IGSS President Juan de Dios Rodr√≠guez, P√©rez Molina's former private secretary. The board members were sent to prison. A few weeks later another corruption scandal broke when another of former Perez Molina's private secretaries went to jail accused of being involved in a high stakes case with energy company . On 21 August 2015, prosecutors and the CICIG asked for the arrest of Baldetti and the impeachment of president Otto P√©rez Molina for their involvement in \\"La L√≠nea case\\". In a press conference, CICIG chief, Colombian prosecutor Iv√°n Velazquez reported that during the procedures carried out on 16 April 2015, they discovered that the president and the vice president were the masterminds of La Lin√©a, not Juan Carlos Monz√≥n. Furthermore, CICIG implied, the two might have been involved with the customs ring even before they were inaugurated on 14 January 2012. Baldetti was sent to the Women's Preventative Detention Center, after she had spent a few days in the VIP jail in the Army's Matamoros Fort. Events came to a climax during Baldetti's legal hearing. An intercepted phone conversation was played in which one could hear the voice of President Perez Molina asking the SAT director for personnel changes, allegedly to accommodate the smuggling network. A national strike was called after the release of that conversation. In the end, on September 1, Otto P√©rez Molina was impeached and stripped of his immunity; he resigned September 2 and was in custody on the 3rd.  Introduction   The \\"Sindicato\\" and the ¬´Cofrad√≠a¬ª  In the 1970s, generals Manuel Antonio Callejas and Francisco Ortega Menaldo ‚Äï the son-in-law of then-president Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio ‚Äï created a powerful organization parallel to the (Ministry of Public Finances). The Guatemalan Army allegedly authorized the group to detect weapon smuggling for the guerrillas during the Guatemalan Civil War. In reality this organization was heavily involved in smuggling and other illicit activities. From it two powerful groups emerged: the \\"Sindicato\\" (syndicate, union) and the \\"Cofrad√≠a\\" (brotherhood). = Moreno smuggling ring= Guatemala Supreme Court building During √Ålvaro Arz√∫'s presidency (1996‚Äì2000) the smuggling ring was attacked when the National Prosecutor found evidence that implicated several high-ranking Army officers, among them general Luis Francisco Ortega Menaldo, colonel Sal√°n S√°nchez, general Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt, coronel Napole√≥n Rojas M√©ndez, major Byron Barrientos, and Mario Guillermo Ruiz Wong. Then-presidential candidate Alfonso Portillo was even mentioned. According to the legal proceedings that took place between 2000 and 2002, the ring controlled container transfers, import prices, and the type of merchandise that was to be moved; the ring would take control of the containers and would not release them until a hefty bribe was paid. None of these names immediately came to public light, and a middleman operator named Alfredo Moreno was accused of being the ringleader. After Portillo's victory in the 2000 elections, the new Attorney General, Rodolfo Gonz√°lez Rodas, dismantled the unit in charge of Moreno's case, allegedly due to the ring's connections to Portillo and R√≠os Montt -leaders of Portillo's political party. Finally, in 2001, Alfredo Moreno paid a million quetzals jail bond and was released. = Perez Molina's presidency = Retired general Otto P√©rez Molina, president of Guatemala from 14 January 2012 to 3 September 2015. Perez Molina was elected president in the 2011 general elections and shortly after his inauguration privatized the Empresa Portuaria Quetzal (English:Quetzal Harbor Enterprise) in Escuintla, on Holy Wednesday of the first Holy Week under his tenure; the Holy Week is a highly respected holiday in Guatemala and his move prompted several complaints about its legality. Later, Baldetti appointed Claudia M√©ndez Asencio -a close friend of hers‚Äîas SAT Customs Chief. Only two months later, Perez Molina intervened in the Superintendencia de Administraci√≥n Tributaria and placed military personnel in key points in customs, allegedly to increase tax collection and prevent smuggling. When President Perez Molina took office in 2012, Vice President Baldetti El√≠as brought a retired general, Luis Francisco Ortega Menaldo, to work with her in the vice president's office, thus acknowledging their close relationship. Ortega Menaldo has been considered the prot√©g√© of former president Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio, since he had married Arana's daughter, and Arana and helped get Ortega to the upper ranks of military intelligence in the 1970s. Ortega Menaldo, then a captain, was trained in the Telecommunication Regional Center, a.k.a. \\"La Regional\\", during Arana's government (1970‚Äì1974). In 1980 he was appointed as chief of the newly created Department of Security and Special Investigations in the Public Finances Secretariat, which allegedly was the origin of the smuggling ring. When Vinicio Cerezo was elected president in 1985, then-Secretary of Defense, H√©ctor Gramajo, appointed him as chief of Military Intelligence in 1987 while general Manuel Callejas ‚Äï the \\"Cofrad√≠a\\"'s boss ‚Äï was appointed as Defense Chief of Staff. Gramajo used the criminal enterprise for support against the Army's hard-line officers many of whom worked closely with the extreme right- wing party \\"Movimiento de Liberaci√≥n Nacional\\" ‚Äì MLN ‚Äì and thus stop coup d'√©tat attempts against president Cerezo. With CIA help, Ortega Menaldo founded the Military Intelligence School in 1987, and worked closely with the DEA. Thus, the two executive leaders ‚Äï P√©rez Molina and Baldetti El√≠as ‚Äï bought an alliance to the main military groups that formed during the Guatemala Civil War: \\"Sindicato\\" and \\"Cofrad√≠a\\". But the presence of Luis Mendiz√°bal ‚Äï owner of Emilio's boutique, the alleged ring headquarters ‚Äï confirmed that yet a third group also had a strong position in the government: that of retired general Marco Tulio Espinosa Contreras, an Air Force general, who raised his profile during the Alvaro Arz√∫ presidency. P√©rez Molina's government had faced with a constant fiscal deficit since 2012 and missed SAT's collection goals every single quarter; customs taxes dropped in 2013 from 15,800 million to 15,300 millon quetzals -Guatemalan currency, and was even lower in 2014; the same happened with sales taxes over imports. The fiscal gap in those years was as high as 7,000 millon of quetzals, which was covered by treasure bonds and international loans, increasing public debt. The financial crisis forced the Government to create new phone, cement and mining taxes to balance its budget for 2015. On September 2014, retired captain Byron Lima Oliva, who was already in prison with a 15-year sentence after being formally accused of being the material assassin of bishop Juan Jos√© Gerardi, was accused by CICIG of being the one that in fact controlled the Pavoncito prison where he was committed, and practically had control of the whole Guatemalan jail system. Investigations showed that Lima Oliva came and went as he pleased in armored SUVs with a police escort; when he was apprehended outside the prison and taken to the Supreme Court building to testify along with other accused, reportedly he said several times that he was a personal friend of president Otto P√©rez Molina. It was not the first time he was captured outside his prison cell: in February 2013 he was captured in a SUV outside prison. CICIG accused Lima Oliva of creating a multimillion-dollar empire by controlling the prisons and charging up to US$12,000 for selling prison transfers. In early April 2015, in discussions with the United Nations about extending CICIG's mandate for another two years, both P√©rez Molina and Baldetti were adamant that the International Commission was no longer needed in Guatemala.  Investigation  On April 16, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) accused a number of politicians within the administration of President Otto P√©rez Molina of setting up a criminal network within the Tax and Customs Administration. At the time, the CICIG believed that the La L√≠nea network was headed by Monz√≥n Rojas (Baldetti's secretary) and Omar Franco (Chief Officer of SAT, the Superintendencia de Administraci√≥n Tributaria de Guatemala). From May 2014 to February 2015, this corruption ring handled at least 500 containers, which benefited from lower customs duties in exchange for very significant bribes, thanks to the ring's control of the customs offices at Puerto Quetzal and Santo Tom√°s, as well as at the central customs administration. The name of the corruption ring, La L√≠nea ‚Äì \\"the (telephone) line\\" ‚Äì came from the phone number, which any import company could call to ask for reduced customs duties. The network involved dozens of people within the tax and customs administration as well as in the Otto P√©rez Molina administration itself. = Suspects = On the early morning of 16 April 2015, an operation with a total of 23 operatives with 250 Civil National Police officers, besides CICIG and public prosecutor officials, resulted in extensive information collection and 20 suspects captured, among them SAT personnel, customs agents and entrepreneurs. The captured suspects were: * SAT personnel: ** √Ålvaro Omar Franco Chac√≥n, SAT Chief Director; ** Sebasti√°n Herrera Carrera, Human Resources manager; ** Anthony Segura Franco, SAT union general secretary; ** Karla Mireya Herrera Espa√±a, Central Customs building manager; ** Gustavo Morales Pinz√≥n, South division manager; ** Jos√© Rolando Gil Monterroso; ** Melvin Gudiel Alvarado, administrator; and ** Carlos Enrique Mu√±oz Rold√°n, former SAT Chief Director * External ring: ** Adolfo Sebasti√°n Batz; ** Carlos Ixtuc Cuc; ** Geovanni Marroqu√≠n Navas; ** Julio C√©sar Aldana Sosa; ** M√≥nica Patricia J√°uregui; ** Salvador Estuardo Gonz√°lez; ** Osama Ezzat Aziz Aranki; ** Byron Antonio Izquierdo; ** Francisco Javier Ortiz Arriaga; ** Julio Estuardo Gonz√°lez de Le√≥n; ** Herbert Francisco Cabrera; ** Miguel √Ångel Lemus Aldana. According to Iv√°n Vel√°squez, CICIG's Chief Commissioner, the crime network had been under investigation since May 2014, when the CICIG got tips that there were connections between importers and customs officers, who found ways for the importers to pay fewer taxes. Telephone call information for \\"La L√≠nea\\" was given to importers. \\"La L√≠nea\\" operated mainly in the major harbors and in the central customs building. Vel√°squez did not specify the total amount embezzled but said that the ring charged between 20,000 and 100,000 quetzals per container. Finally, informed that the intercepted phone conversation showed that from the 40% of tax paid, 30% came from bribes, to decrease the amount of taxes that the importer had to pay. \\"La L√≠nea\\" possibly embezzled more than 2 millones quetzals per week in bribes. More than a thousand companies may have used \\"La L√≠nea\\" to avoid paying some taxes, and these companies are under investigation as well. = Alleged ring leaders: Otto P√©rez Molina and Roxana Baldetti= Initially, Juan Carlos Monz√≥n Rojas was accused of being the ringleader. Monz√≥n Rojas was linked with the Panamanian company Edengrove International, created in April 2011, according to the Panama Public Registry. In May 2011 the company was registered in Guatemala. V√≠ctor Hugo Hern√°ndez was president of the board and also a founding associate of Inversiones y Proyectos Marbella, S.A. and Arrendamientos, Servicios y Proyectos, S.A., both Guatemalan companies that on May 2013 bought 58% of the Corporaci√≥n de Noticias, S. A. stock, a company that owns the influential Guatemalan newspapers ' and Al D√≠a, for 25 million quetzals. Estuardo Gonz√°lez, Corporaci√≥n de Noticias president, was also one of the accused in La Linea. Later on, Gonz√°lez would tell the complete story during trial: both companies were a front that he helped build for Baldetti, to gain control of those influential newspapers. In December 2014, the Guatemalan newspaper El Peri√≥dico reported that Monz√≥n had bought a lavish home in an exclusive neighborhood in Guatemala City for US $850,000. On 22 April 2015 it was disclosed that Monz√≥n Rojas' company, Canchas Deportivas S. A., had gotten up to 13 Government contracts worth several million quetzals even though the company had not been in operation since 2007, and the company was getting contracts from official sports federations in the country, although Monz√≥n had stepped down from his company when he was appointed secretary to the vice president. When former SAT director Carlos Mu√±oz was indicted, Guatemalan prosecutors put an intercepted phone conversation between him and Juan Carlos Monz√≥n into evidence. The two discussed possible personnel changes at SAT. On 21 August 2015, CICIG and the Guatemalan attorney general held a joint press conference where they issued a warrant for Baldetti's arrest and asked for president P√©rez Molina's impeachment; they informed the press that they had gathered evidence during the 16 April operations that linked both to La Linea, and that the two were most likely the true leaders of the ring. On 17 April 2015 they had presented an intercepted phone conversation in which some of the other suspects talked about \\"el Presidente\\", without saying his name, but said that \\"el Presidente' had asked them to open four bank accounts since CICIG already had too much information. Besides \\"el Presidente\\", the nickmanes \\"la R\\", \\"la R2\\" and \\"la Se√±ora\\" were heard in these conversations, all referring to a person who had ordered personnel changes in SAT. Despite strong suspicion that these people were P√©rez Molina and Baldetti, the CICIG did not ask for their arrest at that time because they did not have any incontrovertible proof against them. On 21 September 2015, ElPeri√≥dico reported that the 16 April operatives in Salvador Estuardo Gonz√°lez √Ålvarez ‚Äîa.k.a. \\"Eco\\"‚Äî, found thousand of documents revealing that besides \\"La L√≠nea\\" a network of companies linked to Roxana Baldetti moved millions of quetzals. Due to this, Gonz√°lez could cooperate with the prosecutors to testify against Otto P√©rez Molina and Baldetti. The same day, the Guatemalan Supreme Court withdrew immunity from judge Marta Sierra de Stalling, due to her suspicious connection to the \\"Impunity Law Firm\\". She was captured the next day. As ElPeri√≥dico predicted on 28 September 2015, during the second part of the trial against the La Linea members, Salvador Estuardo Gonz√°lez ‚Äîa.k.a. \\"Eco\\"‚Äî voluntarily offered to testify, an offer which was initially opposed by the defense attorneys, who argued that there were three accused missing. The judge rejected their objection. Gonz√°lez‚Äîwho said that he was willing to have a face-to-face with any other accused‚Äîmethodically exposed a series of data that seriously incriminated several of the accused: # Baldetti was the first other member of the group that Gonz√°lez met, and he helped her set up and manage seven companies that had not been operative for two years. # Gonz√°lez created the codes \\"el 1\\" and \\"la 2\\" for the president and vice president, respectively. # Gonz√°lez kept track of the money that was embezzled. # 50% of the embezzlement was split between Otto P√©rez Molina and Roxana Baldetti El√≠as. # Claudia M√©ndez Asencio was indeed aware of what was going on and even joined Gonz√°lez in several meetings about it. Once she was appointed as Customs manager she was notified of La L√≠nea was and informed that she was getting 5% of the profits. # The United States Embassy was aware of the \\"collection tax project\\" and the work done by Javier Ortiz ‚Äîa.k.a. \\"Teniente Jerez\\"‚Äî. * Gonzalez got 2% of the profits. * When \\"La Linea\\" was restructuring, Gonz√°lez √Ålvarez stopped working for it and went back to work for Baldetti's seven companies, but he also started working with four companies of former President Otto P√©rez Molina, whom he met every Monday in an office located on 16 street in zone 10 in Guatemala City, where they were joined by the President's daughter, wife and daughter-in-law. On 29 September 2015 Gonz√°lez continued testifying, and was cross-questioned by both prosecutors and defense attorneys, standing firm by his version of events and revealing more details: * 61% of the bribes were made in cash, while the remaining 39% was in charge of the external network. * Gonz√°lez emphasized that he did not charge a penny for his services as \\"manager\\"; however, he did confess that he got 2% of the embezzled funds initially and 5% later on. * Gonz√°lez allegedly met former President P√©rez Molina's daughter, whom he called \\"Lissett\\", daughter-in-law, \\"Luisa\\" and wife, Rosa Leal de P√©rez; these women allegedly got government contracts for their company Grupo Pixel S.A.. * Gonz√°lez was the link between SAT and P√©rez Molina to keep control of \\"La Linea\\", per Juan Carlos Monz√≥n's request. * Gonz√°lez kept personal and email contact with Baldetti, who was coded in his cell phones as \\"2\\" or \\"MyLine\\". * Customs personnel were chosen by Javier Ortiz -a.k.a. \\"Teniente Jerez\\"-, and then Gonz√°lez coordinated with SAT Human Resources manager to settle the appointments. All the appointed personnel had years of experience with customs and tax law. * Claudia M√©ndez Asencio allegedly coordinated Gonz√°lez' access to the SAT building eighth floor through a private elevator. * While \\"La Linea\\" was operative, P√©rez Molina, Baldetti El√≠as, Osama Aziz Aranki, Javier Ortiz ‚Äîa.k.a. \\"Teniente Jerez\\"‚Äî and Juan Carlos Monz√≥n all used cutting edge technology in untraceable phones. * Gonz√°lez used the same kind of phones to work at Siglo 21, a newspaper that he controlled at the time. Gonz√°lez explained in detail how Roxana Baldetti's front companies worked, a version that remained unaltered across the lengthy questioning of lawyers and procesutors: Gonz√°lez was hired to manage seven companies. Other companies controlled by V√≠ctor Hugo Hern√°ndez, Juan Carlos Monz√≥n's trusted employee. Gonz√°lez explained that his job was to make sure that all these front companies had offices that reflected the capital that they allegedly had and the services that they were supposed to offer; he also looked for mock stockholders and board members that fit the profile for the supposed type of companies. PROINVER was officially registered under Baldetti's name. Gonz√°lez said that he did not control it, but that he cooperated with making projections for PROINVER's dividends, projections the corporation met, quarter after quarter. Baldetti was allegedly always on top of everything, setting up meetings with Gonz√°lez and Hern√°ndez at the headquarters of her front companies. Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre researched several of these companies and found the following:  Aftermath  After \\"La Linea\\" was discovered on 16 April 2015, both Perez Molina's political party and Government began to break down. On Sunday 19 April 2015, Partido Patriota founder and presidential candidate Alejandro Sinibaldi quit the party along with tenths of majors and about 20 congress members, and it was speculated that he could run for a different party. His reasons for quitting, according to Sinibaldi, were: * The two contracts granted to Israeli company M Tarcic Engineering Ltd. for 137.8 million quetzals to \\"clean\\" Lake Amatitl√°n. * \\"La Linea\\" case * The hospital crisis that the country is submerged in * The ill- advised interventions of the country's customs. That afternoon Baldetti, freshly returned from South Korea, said in a press conference said that she was sorry to hear what had happened with Sinibaldi and that he and she ad always had some differences, but that she did not know how upset he was with her. At the same press conference, Baldetti emphasized that she was not part of the millionaire fraudulent ring; she showed videos from earlier in the year in which she was shown saying that the offices under her in the Government were already investigating structures like La Linea, at a time when Juan Carlos Monz√≥n was her closest advisor. According to Baldetti, this was the first time that they had traveled abroad together and that it was her who told her now-former private secretary about the investigation against him and asked him to resign. Upset and bombarded with journalists' questions about her whereabouts which had been unknown for 48 hours, she turned around and left her own press conference. In July 2015, after the Jaguar Energy scandal arrests, the alleged involvement of several members of Congress in bribes and money laundering, and presenting a detailed report on how the Guatemalan political parties' financing works‚Äîmostly related to illicit activitivies‚ÄîCICIG demanded the Guatemalan Supreme Court take action. However, on 28 July 2015, the Supreme Court issued a statement in denounced the International Commission demands. In response, Guatemalan newspaper Diario La Hora reveals that the thirteen judges of the Supreme Court were designated thanks to the alliance between the official Partido Patriota and the main opposition party, Libertad Democr√°tica Renovada.

He also coached the Nepal national football team. He is currently the chairman of All India Football Federation technical committee. Career Shyam Thapa was first discovered when he scored the match winner for Gorkha Military Higher Secondary School (HSS) against Anjuman Islam Higher secondary school, Mumbai in the 1964 Subroto Mukherjee Cup final. The East Bengal supremo JC Guha, who had a good eye for talent, signed him for the 1966 season. Shyam made a memorable debut as a precocious 18-year-old in the 1966 Kolkata league, scoring a hat-trick against Rajasthan Football Club. Afterwards, he returned to Gorkha Brigade and played for them from 1967-1969. His finest hour came in the 1969 Durand final when he scored an opportunistic match winner in the reply against redoubtable Border Security Force (BSF). General Maneckshaw witnessed that match and invited the entire Gorkha Brigade team for a party the next day. At that party, Shyam requested Maneckshaw, who became a Field Marshal later, to release him from the army so that he could pursue his career as a professional. The General agreed and Shyam Thapa joined East Bengal again in 1970. In 1970, Thapa helped India win bronze medals in both the 1970 Merdeka tournament and Bangkok Asian Games. He scored in India's 3-0 win over Indonesia in the 1970 Asian Games and also in the 3-1 win over Malaysia in the Merdeka tournament. That year, East Bengal played in the 4-2-4 system and their quintet of forwards Swapan Sengupta, Ashok Chatterjee, Mohammed Habib and Shyam Thapa were all short-statured but explosive, skilful and a delight to watch with their flair and incessant attacking play. They were brilliant in the Durand tournament which East Bengal won by easily overcoming RAC Bikaner, Sikh Regimental Centre (SRC) Meerut, Mafatlal Mills and Mohun Bagan 2-0 in the final. Shyam Thapa's career, however, suffered a setback. His family was worried about the increasing Naxalite violence in Kolkata and asked him to leave. He took a transfer to Mafatlal Mills, Bombay and linked up with former Gorkha Brigade players like Ranjit Thapa, Bhupender Singh Rawat and Amar Bahadur. He stayed with Mafatlal Mills from 1971-74. However, he soon rejoined East Bengal in 1975. He was by then an established superstar and had a memorable 1975-76 season. Coached by PK Banerjee East Bengal won the Kolkata league for a record sixth year in a row and in the IFA Shield final routed eternal rivals Mohun Bagan 5-0, a record score in a final. Shyam scored some memorable goals for East Bengal in those two years including a brilliant back volley against Bagan in a Kolkata league match. He became India's most sought after player and in the 1977-78 season, Mohun Bagan paid a record fee of Rs. 50,000 for his services. He was the highest paid player in India that year and helped Bagan win a historic treble ‚Äì IFA Shield, Rovers Cup and Durand tournament, in a single season. It was the first time Bagan achieved this feat. In the Durand final, he scored the equalizer against JCT, darting onto a rebound from goalkeeper Surjeet Singh and bulging the net. In the replay, he set up the match winner for Mohammed Akbar. From 1977-1980, he figured in four consecutive Durand finals for Mohun Bagan winning in 1977, 1979 and 1980 and losing 0-3 to East Bengal in the 1978 final. During the same period, Mohun Bagan also won the IFA Shield thrice in a row, 1977‚Äì79 and the Rovers cup in 1977. From 1970-77, he was a regular in the Indian team. However, after the 1978 Srinagar National championships, he was surprisingly omitted from the list of probables for the 1978 Asian Games. The national selectors claimed that he was slowing down and would not be able to cope with the rigours of international football. There was a major hue and cry in the national media at Shyam's unfair omission. Retirement and post football life Reacting to the media criticism, Field Marshal Sam Maneckshaw, boss of the All India Council of Sports (AICS) intervened and invited Shyam to join the training camp being held in Patiala. However he announced his retirement from international football. Being denied the captaincy of the Indian team in the 1978 Asian Games has been Shyam's biggest disappointment in his otherwise glittering career. After his playing career was over he was technical Director at the Williamson Magor Academy in Assam which later closed down and later at the Tata Football Academy. Such is Shyam Thapa's fame that Nepal called him to revamp their football system in the 21st century and he was there in the first decade of the 21st century.

History The family feud between expelled French National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen and Marine Le Pen, his daughter, deepened on 5 September 2015 when he launched the rival right- wing party. Mr. Le Pen, 87, who was expelled from the FN in August 2015, told supporters in the city: 'You will not be orphans. We can act in a similar way to the FN, even if we are not part of it.' Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National remarked 'He does what he wants, he is a free man.' The row with her father erupted in April 2014, when he defended comments he had made in the past about how the Nazi gas chambers of the Second World War were a 'detail' of history. Ms. Le Pen, who succeeded her father as leader in 2011, dismissed his move. Mr. Le Pen was stripped of his FN membership by the party's executive committee in August following a damaging five-month family feud with his daughter over a string of inflammatory comments. He dismissed the hearing as a 'mockery' and an 'ambush' and blamed Ms. Le Pen, who took over from him as leader in 2011, of pulling the strings from afar. 'It's dirty to kill your own daddy, so she didn't kill daddy directly, she did it through her henchman,' Mr. Le Pen told French radio at the time. The elder Le Pen has been a persistent problem for his daughter as she tries to smooth over the overt racism and xenophobia of the party's past. The final straw came in April when he rehashed familiar comments about the gas chambers and said France should get along with Russia to save the 'white world'. Ms. Le Pen then openly split with her father, saying he was committing 'political suicide'. But he vowed to 'reconquer' the party he founded in 1972. He confirmed he would support his granddaughter Marion Mar√©chal-Le Pen for the next regional elections and that he wanted to influence the National Front's ideology with his association. He also praised Marine Le Pen's speech in Marseille on 6 September 2015, describing it as \\"lep√©niste\\".

Eun Maler aus Danzig by Eberhard Lutze; Holzner Verlag, W√ºrzburg 1966 When she was 21, she went to study for three years at Berlin State Academy for Fine and Applied Arts, attending the class of Maximilian Klewer, and whilst there took part in an exhibition with over 1400 objects displayed in a group collection. Only 9 were sold and 3 of these were her canvases. This successful show in Berlin enabled her later to travel to Paris where she took residence in a tiny attic of Latin Quarters near the Place St. Michel and started painting. It was a continuous financial struggle for Suzanne until one friend organised for Madame Zak to visit her small studio. She immediately purchased 6 of her paintings and put them in her gallery, Galerie Zak, at the Place Saint Germain des Pr√®s. There they were so much admired that she arranged for the first exhibition of Suzanne Eisendieck works. That was followed later by few others in the Leicester Galleries London. This was also the end of bitter hardship for young artist and the start of great success. Artistically her work was inspired by the French Impressionists and is in many private collections mostly in America. Majority of her drawings are rapid chalk or pen sketches due to the high demand for new artworks. Suzanne Eisendieck painted in a unique style using oil paint and occasionally pastels. She became best of friends with Dietz Edzard. It was he who originally introduced Madame Zak to her art. They started painting so much alike that some had difficulty in telling their work apart. In 1938 Suzanne Eisendieck and Dietz Edzard (1893 - 1963) got married. They had two children whilst living in Paris, Christine Edzard-Goodwin (1945) married to Richard Goodwin (Sands Films, London) and Ang√©lica Edzard-K√°rolyi (1947) married to Georges K√°rolyi (Joseph K√°rolyi Foundation, Hungary). Suzanne Eisendieck died in Paris in 1998 and was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

The disk has an unusual shape, which may be due to the influence of the dense regions of the interstellar medium. The researchers also suggest that the passage through these areas can affect the atmosphere of planets that form. The disc diameter and morphologically resembles a butterfly shape, so it was appropriate for the informal name. Analysis of the data did not confirm the presence of planets in the system.

The missile was an ambitious project since the target was to ultimately develop it into hypersonic missile. Development of three variants of this cruise missile was authorized on 9 December 1976. The Meteorit-M strategic version would be deployed from Project 667M submarines with 12 launchers per boat. The air-launched Meteorit-A would be launched from Tu-95 bombers. The land-based version was designated Meteorit-N. The missile was also sometimes referred to by the code-name Grom. The first test launch, on 20 May 1980, was unsuccessful, as were the next three attempts. The first successful flight did not come until 16 December 1981. The first launch from a 667M Andromeda submarine took place on 26 December 1983 from the Barents Sea.

The meteor briefly flared up producing a green and orange glow before disappearing without a sound of explosion and leaving a white smoke trail. The meteor was recorded by several dashcams during the morning rush hour in Bangkok, and sightings were also reported in Thai towns of Kanchanaburi and Nakhon Ratchasima. The meteor was visible for about four seconds before fading out. As of September 8, 2015 no strewn field has been found. The impact energy was the largest of 2015 at 3.9 kiloton.Fireball and Bolide Reports (JPL) The last impact this large was on 23 August 2014 over the Southern Ocean. Identification The object was initially believed to be FLOCK 1B-11 satellite which was due to burn in the atmosphere about that time or a crashing aircraft. However, because the object travelled in the direction opposite to the east‚Äìwest axis of artificial satellites, it was identified by the Deputy Director of Thai National Astronomical Research Institute, Saran Poshyachinda, as \\"an asteroid\\" and as a meteor by the president of the Thai Astronomical Society Prapee Viraporn. The object was also identified as a meteor by the Chachoengsao Observatory astronomer Worawit Tanwutthibundit. Tanwutthibundit, who witnessed the event, estimated the object's speed at nearly 50 miles per second before disintegration. A similar explanation was suggested by the former member of Hubble Space Telescope team, Phil Plait, who said that \\"it was almost certainly a good-sized rock burning up in our atmosphere\\". According to Plait, the object may have had a steep angle of entry. Sound from the meteor was reported in three districts of Kanchanaburi Province: Thong Pha Phum, Sai Yok and Si Sawat. Governor of Kanchanaburi Province Wan-chai Osukhonthip ordered police and Sai Yok National Park rangers to search Wang Krachae and Bong Ti subdistricts in Sai Yok District for meteor debris. The National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand gave a press release on 14 September, estimating that the meteor was about 3.5 metres in diameter with a mass of 66 tonnes, entering the atmosphere at 21 km/s and having maximum brightness at 29.3 km altitude. The impact energy was equivalent to 3.5 kilotonnes of TNT; its trajectory was 269.8 degrees, with an impact angle of 45.4 degrees. It also estimates that meteorite remnants may have fallen around the area of Sai Yok National Park.
