It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2011. It is also known as Taroom Aboriginal Reserve and Taroom Aboriginal Mission.  History  The Taroom Aboriginal Settlement, also known as Taroom Aboriginal Reserve, was established as a government-operated reserve on a site on the Dawson River, east of the township of Taroom in 1911. The settlement was established under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897, which enabled direct government control over the lives of Aboriginal people in Queensland, including forced removals to designated reserves. Under the direction of a superintendent, the settlement housed Aboriginal people from different language groups and regions of Queensland, who lived within a highly regulated and tightly controlled institutional environment until its closure in 1927. Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt led the first European exploration of the upper Dawson River district during his expedition north from the Darling Downs to Port Essington in 1844-46. Pastoral settlement in the area commenced soon after, with squatters attracted by Leichhardt's reports of its rich grazing land. By November 1845, Taroom Station had been taken up, and by the time the Leichhardt pastoral district of was proclaimed in 1854, most of the country had been taken up for pastoral purposes. The township of Taroom developed at a crossing point on the Dawson River at the junction of several tracks from Juandah, Gayndah and Roma, and developed slowly as a staging post between Roma and Rockhampton. A post office was established there in 1853, a courtroom gazetted in 1857, and the town was officially surveyed in 1860. The spread of the pastoral frontier and its associated violent disruption of traditional Aboriginal lifestyles and land use inevitably caused conflict between traditional owners and settlers along the Dawson River. Conflict escalated rapidly following a retaliative attack at Hornet Bank homestead in 1857, resulting in the death of eleven European inhabitants of the station. In the following months a vigilante \\"squatter's crusade\\", supported by sections of the colonial press, was waged throughout the Dawson and Burnett districts by small bands of squatters and Native Police. It has been estimated that several hundred Aboriginal people were indiscriminately killed during this period. Sporadic warfare continued in the Dawson River area to 1870, by which time numbers of local Aboriginal people had been significantly reduced.Evans:2007:74-75 By the beginning of the twentieth century, surviving Aboriginal people living in the district were residing in fringe camps around Taroom or on surrounding rural properties.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:6 From the 1870s a small number of sites were reserved for the use of Aboriginal people by the Queensland government. Most of these were never formally managed and were generally short-lived. The first mission settlement set up by a religious organization was the Zion Hill Mission established in present-day Nundah, Brisbane in 1838. These types of settlements increased in number during the 1880s, particularly in north Queensland. The removal of over 300 Aboriginal people from more than 50 localities to the Deebing Creek Mission (near Ipswich) from 1894 heralded the beginning of a more systematic removal process.State Library of Queensland: 2010:1-30Evans: 2007:139 In 1895 self-styled \\"expert\\" Archibald Meston provided the Queensland Government with a plan to address the improvement and protection of the colony's Aboriginal people. Meston contended the reason earlier reserves operated by missionaries and others were unsuccessful all over Australia was poor management and control. Further, the location of such places had not adequately isolated Aborigines in a way that prevented their exposure to the vices and diseases contact with white people occasioned. A follow up report on Queensland missions for the Home Secretary reaffirmed Meston's belief that the government should be taking a direct role in establishing and maintaining reserves and effectively segregating Aboriginal people from white people. Meston ultimately recommended the establishment of three reserves to serve southern, central and northern Queensland; the appointment of a Chief Protector of Aborigines; and stronger government controls, including the power to remove Aboriginal people to these places and keep them there. Meston's proposals, and their influence in shaping subsequent legislation and its administration, marked a significant change both in Queensland and Australia in relation to government control of Aboriginal peoples lives.Blake: 2001:1-3 Meston's recommendations were brought to fruition in the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897, the provisions of which gave the government substantial control over many aspects of the lives of Aboriginal people and extended its authority to establish, and then forcibly remove people to and keep them within reserves. Superintendents were in charge of these places (a title also given to those in charge of missions), and were responsible to the Chief Protector of Aborigines. The realities of \\"living under the Act\\" were to profoundly impact upon the lives of Queensland Aboriginal people. Queensland's legislation influenced other parts of Australia, becoming the model for similar legislation adopted in Western Australia (1905), the Northern Territory (1910) and South Australia (Aborigines Act 1911, to take control of the existing missions), the three places with the highest Aboriginal populations at this time.National Archives of Australia:2011 Settlements at Durundur (near Woodford, re-opened 1900), Whitula in western Queensland (briefly in operation in response to the 1902 drought) and Fraser Island (1897) were beset by a range of problems and did not last, with the latter experiencing a very high death rate among inmates. From 1905 the Barambah Aboriginal Settlement (from 1934 Cherbourg) in the South Burnett, first established in 1901, came under complete government control and operation. It was considered a more successful venture and gave the government confidence to establish more Aboriginal settlements.Donovan: 2002:121,132Blake: 2001:9,17-18 In the post-Barambah phase of direct government operation of settlements on reserves, the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement was the first to be established in Queensland. It was followed in the 1910s by the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement in north Queensland (1914-1918, destroyed by cyclone) and Palm Island in 1918. The site of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement, located east of the town along the Dawson River was surveyed and gazetted as a Reserve \\"for the use of Aboriginal inhabitants of the State\\" in 1909. Previously the reserve area was within the boundaries of Markland Station, a pastoral run that had been established by 1860, parts of which had been abandoned in the early 1900s due to prickly pear infestation. Originally encompassing an area of , the reserve area was increased to in 1912 and further enlarged by another 3486 acres in 1915.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:7-8Moreton Bay Courier: 7 December 1860:3Rechner: 2005:48 In May 1911 Taroom Settlement's first Superintendent George Richard Addison arrived at the reserve with the basic materials for establishing the place. Addison's first action was to \\"persuade natives in camps near Taroom to take up quarters on the reserve\\".QPP:1912:3:1016-1017 In the early months of the reserve the Aboriginal population drawn from the vicinity of Taroom was about 70. The arrival of groups of people removed from Bell and Roma and \\"a few from the north\\" boosted numbers, and by December 1911, 155 people were drawing rations at the settlement. In May 1912 \\"about 300\\" people were reported to be living on the settlement.Brisbane Courier: 9 May 1912:6 Over time, Aboriginal people from areas throughout Queensland (and a number of G/Kamilaroi people originally from northern New South Wales) were forcibly removed or \\"deported\\" to Taroom.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:6-10,98-101Evans:2007:172 Archival government correspondence regarding proposed removals to Taroom reveal the distribution of locations from where Aboriginal people were sent. Such places included towns and pastoral stations in South West and Central Queensland, the Darling Downs and the Wide Bay- Burnett, jails at Brisbane, Roma and St Helena Island and other Aboriginal settlements and missions.Mackett:1998L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:89-97 In 1913, 45 men and 14 women had been removed to Taroom for \\"having given trouble in other districts, loafing about, or for being in a destitute condition\\".QPP:1913:1025 While operating, the settlement housed an average population of about 250-300 Aboriginal people. By segregating Aboriginal people from the rest of the community, the removals process was highly effective in fulfilling the government's objectives of increased control and regulation of the state's Aboriginals, enforced on settlements through a range of administrative and disciplinary measures. While humanitarian concerns were used as a justification for removal by advocates of the reserve system, Aboriginal people were forcibly removed for a wider range of reasons including illness; lack of employability or refusal to work; old age; as punishment; and after a jail sentence had been served.Blake:2001: 36-49 While many groups had already been moved off their traditional land and were residing in fringe camps at settlements and stations, the removals program further severed many Queensland Aboriginals' capacity to maintain connections to country and traditional customary practices. Social and family networks were also profoundly altered, with children taken from their parents, wives from husbands and families split up and sent to different reserves. By 1912, a 400-acre (161.87 ha) paddock had been enclosed, a vegetable garden, storage sheds, stockyards and temporary quarters for the Superintendent and his family had been constructed at Taroom.QPP:1912:1016-1017 In this initial establishment phase, the reserve was \\"laid out in a simple system of streets and a small area of ground allotted to each family\\". Inmates purchased galvanised iron from the settlement store and were building huts with bark and slabs. Throughout the early years of the reserve, Aboriginal people largely lived in humpies, increasing in size over time and assembled with a range of materials including bark, branches, felled timber, flattened kerosene tins and corrugated iron. Internally these dwellings were divided into three sleeping compartments with raised beds for parents, boys, and girls and external fireplaces.L 'Oste-Brown et al:1995:63 Economically, the Queensland government supported the view advocated by Meston that the first duty of reserves was \\"that they be self- supporting institutions\\".Blake:2001:18 The labour of inmates as directed by the Superintendent focussed on grazing and agricultural production. Ringbarking and vegetation clearing, fencing, prickly pear cutting and tending to stock (initially sheep for wool and later beef cattle) were ongoing tasks throughout the life of the reserve. A range of crops were grown with varying degrees of success, with the reserve vulnerable to the extremes of flooding and droughts. Crops included cotton, potatoes, pumpkins, corn and melons, and stock fodder. An orchard of seven acres had been established by 1918 with 500 citrus trees. Between 1918 and 1922 another is thought to have been used for orchard purposes and other fruits were grown. A bore, capped by a windmill and connected to pipelines, tanks and stock troughs was sunk near the orchard for the reserve's water needs in 1916. The water's excessive iron content meant that it could not be used as effectively as hoped. Other infrastructure known to have been constructed included extensive fencing, horse yards, a woolshed in 1913, dams, a butcher's shop, new yards and a dip in 1919, a milling shed for a small sawbench and engine, and a bridge over the Dawson River.L'Oste- Brown et al:1995:20-25QPP:1914:1028QPP:1918:1:1678QPP:1920:2:234QPP:1921:2:562 While farming activity was undertaken on the reserve, Taroom also developed as a labour depot, as had happened at Barambah. The services of suitably aged and able-bodied inmates were made available to property owners seeking cheap labour in the local district and beyond. Males were generally engaged in manual work on pastoral and agricultural properties and females worked as domestic labourers in rural and urban areas. The Chief Protector's Annual Report of 1914 recorded a steady demand for labour and \\"ample employment\\" in a range of farm work and during that year 37 males and 13 females from Taroom had entered work agreements offsite.QPP:1915: 3:1019 By 1916, the government intended to lay out the main settlement area, \\"with regard to proper alignment and model village design\\" and by 1918 a \\"village square\\" planted with shade trees had been established.QPP:1916:1691L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:58 Building and construction work was undertaken incrementally over the life of the reserve in this main settlement area. Many of these structures were rudimentary and inadequate with Annual Reports repeatedly drawing attention to the need for new and improved structures. Better quality timber buildings were constructed for administrative purposes and as staff quarters, with some timber sourced from Barambah's sawmill. The buildings reported to have been constructed between 1912 and 1923 included: a permanent Superintendent's residence (1912), quarters for the Assistant Superintendent and a Superintendent's office (1916‚Äì17); a lockup (by 1913) hospital (described as \\"slab walled\\" in 1919), nurses quarters (1917) two weatherboard cottages used as officers' quarters (1921); and in 1923, isolation quarters and combined office and store accommodation.Chief Protector's Annual Report:1913:32QPP: 1916-17:3:1739Brisbane Courier: 1919: August 16:4QPP:1922:2:475L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:71-72 A distinctive phase of building activity occurred from 1921 following the introduction of mud-brick manufacturing and construction techniques to the reserve. The technique was thought to have been introduced by two former inmates of the Purga mission (near Ipswich). The bricks were composed of a mixture of sand, clay and lucerne hay and were used to form walls. Squared and adzed \\"bush timber\\" was used for framing and corrugated iron was used for roofing.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:74-75 Buildings mentioned in Annual Reports from 1922 to 1924 constructed by this method included a \\"native courthouse\\", dairy, soup kitchen, isolation ward, sewing room, boiler house, old men's dining room, new lock-up, school, \\"an extra dormitory, 60ft x 20ft\\" (), a number of mudbrick cottages (for inmates) and other \\"unidentified buildings\\".QPP:1923:1:1072QPP:1924:1:982 While official visitors were often impressed by a sense of progress and the care provided to inmates at Taroom and other government-run Aboriginal settlements, most experienced life on the reserve in far harsher terms. Within the main settlement area, buildings that directly impacted on the restricted lives of inmates included the Superintendent's office, the lock-up, retail and rations stores, schools, and the boys' and girls' dormitories. The tenor of the day- to-day management of the settlement and control of inmates' activities was created by the strict enforcement of the reserve's rules and regulations directed through the Superintendent's office. A small \\"police force\\" comprising Aboriginal inmates was established on the reserve and the lock-up was used to incarcerate inmates at the Superintendent's discretion.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:38-39 Inmates were not passive recipients of the government control that dominated their lives. Among the acts of resistance by Taroom's inmates were frequent escapes from the settlement and the lock-up and a short-lived strike in 1916, led by former champion middleweight boxer Jerry Jerome. Jerome, who had opposed his removal to the settlement, \\"incited all others to refuse to work unless paid cash for it\\".L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:38-41Tatz:1995:48-49Watson:2010:109 For their basic food supply the inmates of Taroom were dependent on the distribution of rations obtained from the ration or \\"free\\" store. They were also allocated blankets and basic calico clothing. The rations of government Aboriginal settlement-allocated in a sliding scale to working men, non-workers, women, children and dormitory occupants and comprising flour, sugar and meat and supplementary products such as dried peas, rice and treacle-varied little for decades.Blake: 2001:105 The withholding of rations as a punishment is one example of the disciplinarian measures that were enforced at many reserves.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995: 38 At Taroom, rations were also supplemented by garden produce (when available), and through sourcing game and native plants found on the reserve and surrounding properties.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:26-31 Other items could also be purchased through the retail store (an important revenue generator for government settlements), where inmates used their own money to buy additional food and domestic items. By 1913 a soup kitchen had been established to provide meals for older inmates and in 1918 hot meals were also being supplied for school children (; ). A temporary school was under construction by the end of 1912 and by 1914 the school roll numbered 43 students. In the first few years, basic teaching duties were undertaken by the reserve's nurse, as no quarters were available for a qualified teacher. Until the construction of the mud-brick school in 1922, schooling was carried out in a very basic slab building and for a short while in the \\"native courthouse\\". A better quality separate school was built for the children of settlement staff during 1920-21.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:68-69QPP:1915-16:1691 In the years that the Taroom settlement was operating, JW Bleakley was Chief Protector of Aboriginals in Queensland. His ongoing concerns regarding mixed blood and the \\"half caste problem\\" were expressed in his prioritisation of \\"the rescue and care of young women and children\\", which determined a greater role for dormitories on Aboriginal reserves in Queensland.Blake:2001:70 It was within the highly ordered, institutional structure of the dormitory system that young inmates' Aboriginal identities, connections to family and maintenance of many traditional cultural practices were most seriously impacted. Contact with other inmates and movements around other areas of the settlement were restricted and were subject to the Superintendent's approval.Blake:2001:70-84 A concerted effort was made to move children from settlement camps into dormitories. A girls' dormitory was in operation by 1919. Following a visit to the settlement, Anglican Bishop Henry Le Fanu described the girls moving into a \\"special compound\\" after reaching the age of 12.Brisbane Courier: 16 August 1919:4 Former inmates recalled all young girls living in the dormitory at Taroom during the 1920s. It was mud-brick and a low built building, internally white washed with rows of three-tiered wooden bunks. Another mud-brick building was used for the dormitory kitchen. Like other girls dormitories on government Aboriginal reserves, the former inmates recalled the perimeter of the dormitory bounded by a six-foot fence topped with barbed wire. New \\"quarters for boys\\" were reported as completed by 1925.QPP: 1925:1 :1094L'Oste-Brown et al: 1995:68Sutton: 2003:81-84 The spatial division between the administrative and Aboriginal areas of the settlement became more formally defined over time as more Aboriginal people arrived from areas throughout Queensland. Buildings associated with the administration of the reserve remained concentrated within a well defined area of the main settlement and stood in contrast to the larger, less distinctive area just north of the administrative area where inmates lived in camps organised around regional, tribal and kinship affiliations. During the 1920s, the inmates in this area lived in 5 broad groups; Cooktown people (a generic term for north Queensland Aboriginals); \\"Gulalee\\" people mostly from south-west Queensland; people from the Burnett district; western Queensland people; and a mixed camp with scattered groups of individuals or couples without children. While inmates were subjected to the discipline and control associated with life in an institution, some traditional customary practices continued at Taroom.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:58-63 From 1922, a new experimental sub-settlement was established approximately to the east of the main settlement and camp areas, away from the flood prone river flats. Twelve five acre blocks had been allotted to \\"industrious families\\" by late 1923 to establish dwellings (some of which were of mud-brick construction) and to grow cotton, maize and other vegetables. The Tobane and Richards families are two families known to have lived at the sub- settlement during its existence.L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:21-22,65Brisbane Courier:1923: December 4:7 Two cemeteries were established on the settlement. Over the course of its existence, there was a high mortality rate among inmates, attributed to the generally poor living conditions, inadequate health services and Aboriginal susceptibility to European diseases. A total of 268 deaths were recorded between 1911 and 1927. A mix of European and traditional burial customs and rites were performed during funeral ceremonies. The first cemetery was located about east of the main settlement area. The usual burial practice was to cover graves with piles of stones and edge them with stones or bottles. Only two of the graves had formal headstones; portions of which are extant. The second cemetery was located about north-west of the former on a low sand ridge. This cemetery is thought to have been used as a burial site from the late 1910s and contains the remains of people who died during the \\"Spanish\\" influenza epidemic of 1919, some of whom are thought to have been interred together in trench graves. Over 200 people were affected by the epidemic and at least 27 deaths (31 deaths were reported) occurred, including that of the then Superintendent, CA Maxwell.QPP: 1920: 2:231L'Oste-Brown et al:1995:43-50 The Taroom Aboriginal Settlement was closed due to the Dawson Valley Irrigation Scheme, which threatened to inundate the low-lying land along the river. The proposal to move the settlement came in 1922, initially to higher land, but in 1926 land had been secured near Duaringa, west of Rockhampton. This property of 25,000 hectares was named Woorabinda Aboriginal Mission, and clearing and fencing began there in September 1926. All buildings and equipment were moved from Taroom to Woorabinda in a process which took 18 months and was completed by early 1928.L 'Oste-Brown et al:1995:79-84 Aboriginal people from Taroom Aboriginal Mission were marched some to the newly settled location. Gazettal of the Taroom Reserve was rescinded on 31 May 1928. Since this time the property has been used by a number of owners for grazing and cropping purposes. The current name of the property, Bundulla, was in use shortly after the reserve had been removed and does not appear to have any historical link with it. In 2010, little surface evidence remains at Bundulla to indicate the former existence of a government-controlled Aboriginal settlement. In 1992 and 1994 three former inmates of Taroom, Ted Mitchell, Vera Tyson and Gordon Henry, in collaboration with staff from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage, contributed to an oral history project (informed by site visits) that greatly added to the recorded knowledge of life at and the spatial organisation of the settlement. During this process, white stones and pickets were placed around what were thought to be the cemetery perimeters. Related archaeological investigations, including ground penetrating radar surveys of the cemeteries, added further knowledge about the site. Descendants and extended families of people who lived and died at Taroom continue to maintain a special connection to the site. In more recent years, collaborative efforts between the owners, Aboriginal groups and government bodies has resulted in the erection of signs and a memorial stone and plaque listing those who died on the settlement. The current owners of Bundulla, which in 2011 included the site of the former Aboriginal Settlement, have played an important role as custodians of the place. In 2014, a group of about 50 young people descended from the residents of Taroom Aboriginal Settlement walked the route taken by their ancestors from Taroom to Woorabinda. The walk took 8 days and they were greeted on arrival at Woorabinda by Aunty Ivy Booth, the only person from the Taroom settlement still alive.  Description  The site of the former Taroom Aboriginal Settlement is located east- northeast of the township of Taroom, about 6 hours drive northwest of Brisbane. The site is contained within the rural property known as Bundulla and is bounded to the north by a meander of the Dawson River. Archaeological evidence of the former settlement is situated in the northern part of the easternmost segment of Lot 83 on FT625 and comprises six main areas the - Main Settlement Area, Hill Top Cemetery, Lower Cemetery, Settlement Camps, \\"Home\\" Orchard, and Communal Sub-Settlement. = Main Settlement Area = The main settlement area is located immediately to the south and west of the Old Bundulla Homestead and is bounded to the south be a small gully / creek line. A dam has been built to the east of Bundulla Road and across the gully. Bundulla Road passes by the settlement area entering across the gully to the south then heading north and northwest towards the Dawson River. An access track to fields and the Old Bundulla Homestead spurs off Bundulla Road and approximately follows the main street of the settlement. The one lane mentioned in literature can also still be seen in the most recent air photos bordering the old homestead fence line to the south. The area to the east of the access track is fenced and has been previously blade- ploughed. Ground surface visibility in the area is low with average visibility of less than 5% across the settlement area. The current access track through the Main Settlement Area, from Bundulla Road to the site of the Old Bundulla Homestead, and the area immediately adjacent to the Old Bundulla Homestead, have limited potential for evidence relating to the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement. This is due to extensive track realignment and grading and the construction of the homestead building and associated farming infrastructure in this area following the closure of the settlement. No artefacts were located along the current access track and artefacts that are located within the fenced section of the Old Bundulla Homestead complex are unlikely to be related to the settlement period. The current access track through the main settlement area and the Old Bundulla Homestead complex are therefore not of cultural heritage significance. The area around the Main Settlement Area includes a number of fence lines erected after closure of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement. These fence lines are not of cultural heritage significance. Thirty-two (32) find spots were recorded across the Main Settlement Area. A range of ceramics, bottle glass and metal artefacts were recorded. Small scatters of white creamware ceramics dominated the artefact assemblage across the survey area. Notable exceptions included a small number of printed ceramics, include one piece of green cable pattern, another with green lion maker's mark (possibly off the same item), and one with green floral pattern. = Hill Top Cemetery = Memorial to the deceased, 2010 Located about east of the Old Bundulla Homestead, the Hill Top Cemetery is accessible via an access track from the homestead and is situated on a gently inclined slope and covered by thick but low level grasses. The cemetery area is marked by large white-painted rocks placed at each corner and along the northern and southern margins, with its western extent marked by a small line of trees. Within the cemetery area are exposures with patchy ground cover. A memorial stone with two plaques listing the names and dates of those people who died at the Aboriginal Settlement stands near the southwest corner of the cemetery. Oral history evidence collected by L'Oste-Brown et al. (1995) and the results of ground penetrating radar survey suggest up to 22 grave sites, including four trench graves with multiple interments. Only two of these graves were once marked with headstones. Graves were also noted to have been commonly covered with piles of stones and then surrounded by bottles and/or rows of stones. Two easily discernible stone arrangements are located in the lower half of the cemetery. Arrangement 1 measures approximately long x wide and Arrangement 2 measures approximately long x wide and is marked by large rounded stone cobbles. At least two other possible arrangements and one mound feature were also noted though it was not possible to determine whether these are naturally occurring or of cultural origin. Within the cemetery and in the areas immediately west beyond the tree line is a low density artefact scatter including bottle glass fragments of blue, green, dark green and purple colours. A small amount of decorated and undecorated ceramic was also noted. Small timber fence pickets and wire found within the cemetery also suggest that it was once fenced. The remains of a marble headstone and cement headstone base were located under the tree line marking the western edge of the marked cemetery area. = Lower Cemetery = The Lower Cemetery is located about northwest the Hill Top Cemetery on a low sandy ridge, just above the inundation zone of the Dawson River, and on a gentle slope into an ephemeral channel feeding the Dawson River. At the head of this channel is a small dam in the vicinity of the Settlement dam site identified by L'Oste-Brown et al. (1995). The existing dam's date of origin is unclear, and it is thought to have been used as a dump for materials, during the occupation period of Old Bundulla Homestead. The cemetery area is situated adjacent to a vehicle access track running northeast from the Old Bundulla Homestead towards the Dawson River. There were 72 deaths on the settlement while this cemetery was in use between 1918 and 1920. The ground penetrating radar survey by L 'Oste-Brown et al. (1995) identified 24 possible graves including some trench graves probably associated with the 1919 Spanish influenza epidemic which struck the settlement. All graves were recorded to maximum depths of . The cemetery is marked by a sign and its perimeter defined by white-painted rocks and star pickets. The area is heavily grassed affecting ground surface visibility across the cemetery area and beyond. Small exposures are located across the site giving some visibility in small patches with reasonable ground surface visibility on exposures. There are no marked graves. The cemetery area and surrounds features a low to medium density scatter of archaeological artefacts including glass fragments and some low densities of ceramics on the lower slopes between the east edge of the marked cemetery and the ephemeral creek/channel. Bottle glass includes fragments of clear, blue, purple, dark and light green materials. The small number of ceramic shards found at this site was limited to white unprinted wares of a fine nature, probably associated with small vessels such as cups and saucers rather than larger plates or bowls. The scatter of artefacts on the gentle slopes to the east between the marked cemetery area and the ephemeral channel suggest that either materials have been eroding down the slope into the channel or materials disposed of in the dam upstream for the cemetery are the actual source. = Settlement Camps = The area immediately north of the Old Bundulla Homestead, between it and the Dawson River, was once the location of several \\"camps\\" of Aboriginal people living at Bundulla. Five sub-camps have been documented representing the different groups who lived there: \\\\- Gulalee, Burnett and Mixed people - Cooktown - Western people These camps are bordered by two access tracks running from the homestead to the Dawson River. The Settlement Camp area includes a number of fence lines erected after closure of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement. These fence lines are not of cultural heritage significance. In general the camp area has been disturbed by subsequent land use for agricultural and pastoral purposes. (1) Gulalee, Burnett and Mixed peoples' camps Fifty-two (52) find spots were recorded during the survey of these camp areas, with investigations focusing predominately on areas marked as being related to the \\"Mixed peoples\\" camp. Ground surface visibility across the former camp was mixed with several small exposure areas providing good visibility of surface artefacts. Ground cover included grasses up to in height and some prickly pear bushes. Artefacts located in the camp area included a large number of printed and decorated ceramics; undecorated white wares were the most common ceramic type. Decorations included standard blue \\"willow\\" pattern designs. Other ceramic items included a white porcelain tea cup handle, and two dolls - one being the torso/belly section of a small to medium-sized ceramic doll, the other being a long piece, possibly part from a doll house collection. Glass fragments were found at numerous locations across the survey area, with dark green, blue, purple and some clear fragments being the most common. Some brown bottle glass was also located. Several metal artefacts were also recorded, including a tin button, parts of a harmonica and a metal spoon. Other metal artefacts found in this area are yet to be identified in terms of function. (2) Cooktown peoples' camp The location of the \\"Cooktown\\" or north Queensland Aboriginal peoples' camp is located west of an access track to the Dawson River which commences at the northern end of the main settlement area and off the Old Bundulla Homestead access track. The area is covered by extensive shrubland impeding any survey attempt. (3) Western peoples' camp and Goona Gully The Western peoples' camp was located immediately east of the Old Bundulla Homestead and is defined to the west by the access track running north along the old fenceline from the homestead to the Dawson River. Goona Gully, which once was used for \\"ablutions\\" prior to the construction of toilet facilities for camp residents, is located in the northern half of this area. While only a small portion of the total area of the camps has been systematically surveyed for archaeological artefacts (<10%), the number of archaeological artefacts that were found on the surface indicates that a low - medium density surface scatter of artefacts is likely to occur across all the former camp areas. The area features a broader range of artefact types and the artefact assemblage is indicative of a domestic area with evidence of tableware, some storage vessels, a broad range of bottle glass types and uses (beer bottles were common but a condiment bottle was also recorded), personal items of clothing including a tin button, toys such as the two dolls and the parts of a harmonica. The areas of the former camps have high archaeological potential with good evidence of the occupation of the settlement area on the surface and also potentially subsurface. = \\"Home\\" Orchard = The location of the settlement orchard is west of an access track to the Dawson River which commences at the northern end of the main settlement area and off the Old Bundulla Homestead access track. A small fig tree sapling survives from this orchard. The only structural elements to survive in situ from the settlement period are elements of the settlement windmill. The windmill base supports are made of iron and are located west of the fig tree in the orchard area. = Communal Sub-Settlement = The sub-settlement is located approximately east of the main settlement area along a vehicle access track. The area is used for grazing cattle and features a low thick grass cover and scatters of large pebbles and cobbles of local stone. The area contains the remains of at least two \\"huts\\" - one evidenced by the stone alignments to the southwest of a lime tree grove with the other located immediately northeast.  'Hut 1'  Willy Tobane L'Oste-Brown et al. (1995) identified the remains of one structure which was delineated by rows of stones placed next to each other and apparently forming the base of walls. Internal wall placements could also be discerned. Oral history conducted at that time identified this as being the remains of a hut occupied by Willy Tobane and his family. The hut site measured approximately and is delineated by additional stone alignments. Thick grass obscures the stone alignments but the dimensions and shape correspond to that recorded by L'Oste-Brown et al. in 1995. To the southwest of the hut are scatters of tin and other metal artefacts, including a hatchet head and hinge. The area investigated is likely to represent one of the grants of land to those living in the communal sub- settlement area. The area contains a number of archaeological artefacts which provide insight into the lives of those living in this part of the reserve, lives and activities which are otherwise undocumented.  'Hut 2'  Immediately adjacent to the hut site to the northeast is a small grove of lime trees and shrubs. On the other side of this vegetation was a second hut/house pad and suspected hearth/fireplace. The house pad is a small levelled area covered by grasses but identifiable by an extant timber support and scatter of metal artefacts. Artefacts included a door bolt and hinge, metal barrel hoop, horse mouth-bit and U-frame and hook - possibly used to hang cooking pots over an open fire. Other artefacts are found scattered across the general area, with several recordings to the northeast of the hut sites; the lid of a tin matchbox; flattened kerosene cans (probably used as sheeting/roofing for huts); a 'billy can'; hatchet/axe head; other riveted storage containers of unknown purpose; and several barrel hoops.  Heritage listing  The former Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The site of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, as a place associated with the organisation of Queensland Aboriginal reserves established under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897. This legislation enabled direct government control over the lives of Aboriginal people in Queensland, who could be removed by the government to designated reserves and kept within gazetted reserve boundaries. Established in 1911, the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) is significant as an early Aboriginal reserve established and run from the outset by the Queensland government as an Aboriginal Settlement, always an uncommon aspect of the state's cultural heritage; providing a model for other Aboriginal settlements in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The site of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) has potential to contribute new knowledge about Queensland's history, particularly a greater understanding of government-run Aboriginal settlements in Queensland. Extensive surface scatters of archaeological artefacts are evident across the site and there exists potential for subsurface archaeological evidence within and below the plough zone (c. below current ground surface levels) particularly in the vicinity of the five historically documented Aboriginal \\"camps\\" and within the main settlement area. The results of archaeological investigations within the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) may challenge written histories and other historical sources that document the effect of government control on Aboriginal people, groups, communities and cultural practices. Important archaeological research questions will relate to social organisation (including relations between people on the Reserve and culture contact generally), adaptations to life within a regulated and controlled community, the effects on families and the structures of households on the Reserve including subsistence strategies, consumption choices and patterns, and reciprocity and other informal economies. Archaeological artefacts within Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) are illustrative of endangered and rare aspects of Queensland's history, specifically the customs, processes and functions of government-run Aboriginal settlements from the early 20th century. While the place has undergone substantial disturbance by agricultural and pastoral activities since original artefact deposition, analysis of the spatial distribution of archaeological evidence will result in an increased understanding of the actual layout of the reserve. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site, and the archaeological artefacts, of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement (former) are important to Aboriginal people, groups and families across Queensland, particularly those groups removed from their own lands to the reserve, including those considered as traditional owners of the area. As a place operated by the Queensland government as an Aboriginal Settlement from 1911-1927, the place represents a distinctive phase of Queensland's history in a way that no other place can. The archaeological artefacts relate to and may potentially be used to illustrate events which have had a profound effect on Queensland Aboriginal people's lives and that of their communities. The relatives and descendants of those who lived on the settlement retain a strong and special association with the place, especially the two cemetery areas.

The development of the new city is taking place around 30 km from Dakar, close to the Blaise Diagne International Airport, which opened in December 2017. The Diamniadio Lake City is one of its suburbs. The idea behind the development is to ease the population pressure on Dakar. On completion, the new city will be connected to Dakar through a 32 km express highway, which will reduce the travel time from 90 minutes to an average of 30 minutes. After visiting in November 2017, the minister in charge of the project, Cheikh Kant√©, described the site as \\"80% completed\\". The first residential areas had been completed, as had several hotels initially serving the new airport. Manufacturing areas, the Amadou-Mahtar-Mbow University, and the planned railway station, part of the Train Express Regional, are facing delays.  Population  According to the official estimates of 2007, the population of Diamniadio was 12,326. Upon completion of the Diamniadio Lake City, the government is expecting that around 300,000 of the population will move to the new city.

It is a memoir about his life and illness, battling stage IV metastatic lung cancer. It was posthumously published by Random House on January 12, 2016. In his last year of neurosurgical residency at Stanford University, Paul Kalanithi experiences negative changes in his health. Rapid weight loss, and severe back and chest pains begin to raise concern for him and his wife, Lucy Kalanithi. Kalanithi worries that cancer might have caused his symptoms and his decline of health ‚Äì unlikely for people in their thirties. However, when X-ray results in a routine medical check-up return normal, his primary care physician and he attribute the symptoms to aging and work overload. Determined to finish the last months of his residency, he ignores whatever symptoms have not subsided. A few weeks later, the symptoms come back, stronger than before. Around this time, Kalanithi and his wife experience conflict in their relationship when Lucy feels that he is not communicating with her. Visiting friends in New York, Kalanithi is almost certain that he has cancer and says it out loud for the first time to his friend Mike. Returning home, upon landing in San Francisco, Kalanithi receives a call from his doctor telling him that his lungs \\"look blurry.\\" When he arrives home with Lucy, both of them know what is happening. The next day, Kalanithi checks in to the hospital and the room where he examined his patients, delivering good and bad news, becomes his own.  Background  Before writing When Breath Becomes Air, Paul Kalanithi was in residency in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience. In May 2013, Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage-4 non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer. As Kalanithi underwent cancer treatment, he shared his reflections on illness and medicine, authoring essays in The New York Times, The Paris Review, and Stanford Medicine, and participating in interviews for media outlets and public forums. He also began work on an autobiographical book of his experiences as a doctor and a patient facing a terminal illness. Kalanithi died in March 2015 at the age of 37. His memoir was published posthumously 10 months later. The book included a foreword by Abraham Verghese and an epilogue by Kalanithi's widow, Lucy Goddard Kalanithi. = Paul Kalanithi = The author of the book. Paul Kalanithi was born in Bronxville, New York on April 1, 1977. At the age of 10, his family moved to Kingman, Arizona where he spent most of his youth. At the early age of 10, his mother gave him books to read in order to educate his young mind. Kalanithi attended Stanford University where he earned Bachelor and Master of Arts in English literature and Bachelor of Science in human biology. He attended Cambridge for history and philosophy of science and medicine where he obtained his Masters. After Cambridge, Kalanithi attended Yale for medical school where he met his future wife, Lucy Goddard. After graduating Yale, he married his wife and they both began their residencies in California. Kalanithi started his residency back at Stanford while his wife attended University of California, San Francisco. Paul and Lucy have a daughter together.  Synopsis  Following the prospect of a better life, Kalanithi's father moves the family from Bronxville, New York to Kingman, Arizona when Kalanithi is ten. A doctor himself, Kalanithi's father dedicates most of his time to medicine and is notably absent from the house. Believing that to be a doctor, he would have to be away from the family like his father, Kalanithi becomes disenchanted with medicine. Although Kalanithi and his two brothers enjoy the newfound liberty of their desert town, their mother constantly worries for their academic future in a town that the U.S. census has declared ‚Äúthe least educated district in America.‚Äù Unwilling to let anything halt their learning, she acquires college reading lists and instills in her sons a love for literature. The summer before heading to Stanford University for school, Kalanithi reads Satan, His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S., by Jeremy Leven. The book's idea that the mind is the result of the brain doing its work awakes a curiosity in Kalanithi for neuroscience. After completing degrees in English literature and human biology, Kalanithi feels there is still much to learn. He is accepted to a master's program in English literature at Stanford, and one afternoon‚Äîpushed by his desire to understand the meaning of life‚Äî discovers the calling to practice medicine for the first time. Preparing to apply to medical school, Kalanithi uses the time off to study the history and philosophy of science and medicine at Cambridge. He later starts medical school at Yale. During his time at Yale, Kalanithi meets his wife, Lucy, and sees the patient-doctor relationship as an example of life, death, and morality coming together. After two years of classroom learning, Kalanithi experiences his first birth and death in his OB-GYN clinical rotation, when a set of twins could not be carried to term. It is then that Kalanithi understands that intelligence is not enough in the practice of medicine, and that morality is also needed. After medical school, Lucy Kalanithi starts internal medicine residency at UCSF and Paul Kalanithi begins a neurosurgical residency at Stanford. Though he finds it hard at first, Kalanithi grows used to the rigor of neurosurgery and, in his fourth year, joins the neuroscience lab of a professor affectionately called ‚ÄúV.‚Äù In the sixth year of residency, Kalanithi returns to his hospital duties and having reached professional recognition, he feels he has finally found his place in the world. Kalanithi's life takes an unexpected turn when, after weeks of health problems, it is confirmed that he has lung cancer. Images obtained from a CT scan show organ systems compromised by the cancer, causing him and his wife great sadness. Searching for the best experts in the field of oncology, Kalanithi begins treatment with a doctor named Emma Hayward. Because of his status, rather than stepping back and letting Hayward offer her professional opinion, Kalanithi expects to be treated as a consultant, even if it is his own case. Hayward suggests to find the root of his cancer before determining treatment options. In the meantime, Kalanithi's family helps him through his transition from doctor to patient, and together with Lucy, he decides to explore reproductive options before he dies. They visit a sperm bank and make the decision to have a child. Test results arrive and Kalanithi discovers that his cancer is derived from a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This fact gives him a bit of relief because it means that he can be treated with Tarceva, which typically results in less-severe side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. Symptoms subside with the treatment and, in Dr. Hayward's office, Kalanithi feels like himself again. After weeks of using the medication, CT scans show a reduced number of tumors in Kalanithi's lungs and he becomes determined to return to the operating room. Back in the OR, he cannot finish his first surgery because of his health. However, his strength and technique improve over time. With both graduation and a baby due in June, he takes another CT scan after months since the last. He discovers a big tumor in his right lung and without getting scared, he and Lucy research what other options are available. Kalanithi retires from surgery indefinitely and begins chemotherapy. His response to chemotherapy is adverse and his health worsens, forcing him to skip graduation. With the failure of chemotherapy, other treatment options do not provide him much hope. His condition becomes so severe that even Dr. Hayward gives an approximation of how much time he has left ‚Äì something she had strongly refused to do before. On July 4, 2014, their daughter is born and Kalanithi is filled with joy. Eventually, Kalanithi dies in the intensive care unit of his hospital. The epilogue is written by his wife Lucy Kalanthi, after his death. It shows her point of view of the experience with her husband Paul Kalanthi's lung cancer. It is an in-depth personal explanation of her experience.  Reception  When Breath Becomes Air is a New York Times bestseller, spending 68 weeks on the non-fiction bestseller list. Matt McCarthy of USA Today gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said, \\"It's a story so remarkable, so stunning, and so affecting that I had to take dozens of breaks just to compose myself enough to get through it.\\" Nick Romeo of The Boston Globe wrote that it, \\"possesses the gravity and wisdom of an ancient Greek tragedy.\\" Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly stated that the book was \\"so original‚Äîand so devastating. . . .

It was developed by the Israeli cyberarms firm, NSO Group. Discovered in August 2016 after a failed attempt at installing it on an iPhone belonging to a human rights activist, an investigation revealed details about the spyware, its abilities, and the security vulnerabilities it exploited. Pegasus is capable of reading text messages, tracking calls, collecting passwords, mobile phone tracking, accessing the target device's microphone(s) and video camera(s), and gathering information from apps. Apple released version 9.3.5 of its iOS software to fix the vulnerabilities. News of the spyware caused significant media coverage. It was called the \\"most sophisticated\\" smartphone attack ever, and became the first time in iPhone history when a malicious remote jailbreak exploit had been detected. The company that created the spyware, NSO Group, stated that they provide \\"authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime\\". On 23 August 2020, according to intelligence obtained by Haaretz, the NSO Group was accused of selling Pegasus spyware software for hundreds of millions of dollars to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf States, for the purpose of state surveillance against anti-regime activists, journalists and political leaders from rival nations.  Details of spyware  Pegasus is the name of a spyware that can be installed on devices running certain versions of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. Upon clicking on a malicious link, Pegasus secretly enables a jailbreak on the device and can read text messages, track calls, collect passwords, trace the phone location, as well as gather information from apps including (but not limited to) iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Skype. It has been revealed that Pegasus can also target Android devices.  Patch  Apple released iOS version 9.3.5 for its line of iPhone smartphone products in August 2016. Details of the update were fixes for the three critical security vulnerabilities that Pegasus exploited.  Discovery of spyware  The vulnerabilities were found ten days before the iOS 9.3.5 update was released. Arab human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received a text message promising \\"secrets\\" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates\\", along with a link which is a form of social engineering. Mansoor sent the link to Citizen Lab. An investigation ensued with the collaboration of Lookout that revealed that if Mansoor had followed the link, it would have jailbroken his phone on the spot and implanted the spyware into it. Citizen Lab linked the attack to a private Israeli spyware company known as NSO Group, that sells Pegasus to governments for \\"lawful interception\\", but suspicions exist that it is applied for other purposes.Ahmed, Azam, and Perlroth, Nicole, Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Journalists and Their Families, The New York Times, June 19, 2017 NSO Group was owned by an American private equity firm, Francisco Partners, before being bought back by the founders in 2019.Amitai Ziv Israeli Cyberattack Firm NSO Bought Back by Founders at $1b Company Value; Two founders are partnering with European private equity fund Novalpina to purchase the controversial firm from Francisco Partners Feb 14, 2019 Haaretz.com Regarding how widespread the issue was, Lookout explained in a blog post: \\"We believe that this spyware has been in the wild for a significant amount of time based on some of the indicators within the code\\" and pointed out that the code shows signs of a \\"kernel mapping table that has values all the way back to iOS 7\\". The New York Times and The Times of Israel have both reported that it appears the United Arab Emirates was using this spyware as early as 2013. Several outstanding lawsuits claim that NSO Group helped clients operate the software and therefore participated in numerous violations of human rights initiated by its clients. Two months after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi human rights activist, in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, a Canadian resident, filed suit in Israel against NSO Group, accusing the firm of providing the Saudi government with the surveillance software to spy on him and his friends, including Khashoggi. According to the Washington Post and other prominent media sources, Pegasus not only enables the keystroke monitoring of all communications from a phone (texts, emails, web searches) but it also enables phone call and location tracking, while also permitting NSO Group to hijack both the mobile phone's microphone and camera, thus turning it into a constant surveillance device. At 2017 Security Analyst Summit held by Kaspersky Lab, researchers revealed that Pegasus exists not only for iOS, but for Android as well. Scandal in India In late 2019, Facebook initiated a suit against NSO, claiming that WhatsApp had been used to hack a number of activists in India, leading to accusations that the Indian government was involved.  Vulnerabilities  Lookout provided details of the three vulnerabilities: * CVE-2016-4655: Information leak in Kernel ‚Äì A kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the attacker allowing them to calculate the kernel's location in memory. * CVE-2016-4656: Kernel Memory corruption leads to Jailbreak ‚Äì 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to secretly jailbreak the device and install surveillance software - details in reference. * CVE-2016-4657: Memory corruption in the Webkit ‚Äì A vulnerability in the Safari WebKit that allows the attacker to compromise the device when the user clicks on a link.  Reactions  = News = News of the spyware received significant media attention, particularly for being called the \\"most sophisticated\\" smartphone attack ever, and, for being the first time in iPhone history when a remote jailbreak exploit has been detected. = NSO Group comment = Dan Tynant of The Guardian wrote an article that featured comments from NSO Group, where they stated that they provide \\"authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime\\", although the Group told him that they had no knowledge of any incidents. = Bug-bounty program skepticism = In the aftermath of the news, critics asserted that Apple's bug-bounty program, which rewards people for finding flaws in its software, might not have offered sufficient rewards to prevent exploits being sold on the black market, rather than being reported back to Apple. Russell Brandom of The Verge commented that Apple's bug-bounty program, which rewards people who manage to find faults in its software, maxes out at payments of $200,000, \\"just a fraction of the millions that are regularly spent for iOS exploits on the black market\\". He goes on to ask why Apple doesn't \\"spend its way out of security vulnerabilities?\\", but also writes that \\"as soon as [the Pegasus] vulnerabilities were reported, Apple patched them‚Äîbut there are plenty of other bugs left. While spyware companies see an exploit purchase as a one-time payout for years of access, Apple‚Äôs bounty has to be paid out every time a new vulnerability pops up.\\" Brandom also wrote; \\"The same researchers participating in Apple‚Äôs bug bounty could make more money selling the same finds to an exploit broker.\\" He concluded the article by writing; \\"It‚Äôs hard to say how much damage might have been caused if Mansoor had clicked on the spyware link...

The company sold discounted movie tickets online and through mobile devices. The company was partnered with more than 750 theaters in the United States. As of July 2014, Dealflicks had raised $1.7 million in seed funding.  History  The concept for the company began when CEO and co- founder, Sean Wycliffe watched the film The King's Speech in 2010. According to Wycliffe, the theater was mostly empty when he arrived. He then had the idea to launch a company that was similar to a \\"Priceline for movie tickets\\". In April 2012, the company launched their beta platformhttp://www.builtinla.com/blog/how-dealflicks-returning-theater-prices- back-normal with two independent theaters in California. In July 2012, the website was officially launched. Dealflicks was launched by company co- founders Sean Wycliffe, Kevin Hong, and Zachary Cancio. In the initial stages, they struggled to sign theaters; in the first 10 months, they were only able to sign up 100 new theaters. Hong and the sales team decided to travel around the country in a mini-van to sign up theaters. These sales calls were known as \\"Man Van\\" trips and helped the team sign up 45 additional theaters in just 3 months. In March 2016, the company signed on Carmike Cinemas, the fourth largest theater chain in the United States. This agreement allows Dealflicks to be available in more than 750 theaters nationwide. However, in March 2016 AMC announced their intent to purchase Carmike and the acquisition was completed in December that same year. Almost immediately AMC cancelled the agreement with Dealflicks, effectively removing the Carmike theatres from Dealflicks' offering. , the company partnered with 13 of the top 50 theater chains in the U.S., including B&B; Theatres, and Bow Tie Cinemas, among others. On August 14, 2018, the company announced its fate to its customers through e-mail, ending service the same day.

In ear-EEG, the electrodes are exclusively placed in or around the outer ear, resulting in both a much greater invisibility and wearer mobility compared to full scalp electroencephalography (EEG), but also significantly reduced signal amplitude, as well as reduction in the number of brain regions in which activity can be measured. It may broadly be partitioned into two groups: those using electrode positions exclusively within the concha and ear canal, and those also placing electrodes close to the ear, usually hidden behind the ear lobe. Generally speaking, the first type will be the most invisible, but also offer the most challenging (noisy) signal. Ear-EEG is a good candidate for inclusion in a hearable device, however, due to the high complexity of ear-EEG sensors, this has not yet been done.  History  Ear- EEG was first described in \\"A1 US patent US20070112277 A1\\", though other noteworthy mentions are \\"B1 EP patent EP2448477 B1\\" and \\"Auditory evoked responses from Ear-EEG recordings\\". Since then, it has grown to be an endeavor spread across multiple research groups and collaborations, as well as private companies . Notable incarnations of the technology are the cEEGrid (see picture to the right) and the custom 3D-printed ear plugs from NeuroTechnology Lab (see picture above). Attempts at creating in-ear generic earpieces are also known to be under way. 315x315px  Uses in research  It is possible to think of multiple research areas in which an unobtrusive and invisible EEG system would be beneficial. Good examples are in studies of group dynamics or didactics, in which cases it would be very valuable to be able to monitor the effect of various events on individuals, while still letting them experience said events unfettered. And in this context, it is very important to perform detailed comparisons between ear-EEG and regular scalp EEG, as results need to be comparable across platforms. This has been done in multiple papers. In these it has been found that ear-EEG measurements are comparable to scalp EEG in the frequency domain; however, the time domain activity recorded by the two systems are notably different. Several papers have presented models (i.e. ear- EEG forward models) of how the electric field from electrical sources in the brain maps to potentials in the ear. The ear-EEG forward models enable prediction of the potentials in the ear for a specific neural phenomenon, and can be used to improve the understanding of which neural sources that can be measured with ear-EEG Example of a scalp topography (middle) with corresponding ear-topographies (left and right). The topographies show the potential on the scalp and in the ears for a single dipolar brain source and were calculated using an individualized ear-EEG forward model as described by Kappel et al.  Dry-contact electrode ear-EEG  Dry-contact electrode ear- EEG is a method in which no gel is applied between the electrode and the skin. This method generally improves the comfort and user-friendliness for long-term and real-life recordings. Because no gel is applied to the electrodes, the user can potentially mount the ear-EEG device without assistance. 337x337px Dry-contact electrode ear-EEG have been used to perform high-density ear-EEG recordings, which enable mapping of the brain response on a topographic 3D map of the ear (Ear-topographies). When using dry-contact electrodes, the interface between the skin and the electrodes are mainly deÔ¨Åned by the electrochemical properties of the electrode material, the mechanical design of the electrode, the surface properties of the electrode, and how the electrode is retained against the skin. To improve these aspects for ear-EEG, nanostructured electrodes and soft earpieces have been proposed. The electronic instrumentation must also be carefully designed to accommodate dry- contact electrodes.  Real-life monitoring  The state of the human brain is influenced by the surrounding environment, and the response from the brain is influenced by the state of the brain. Thus, restricting brain research to a laboratory represents a fundamental limitation. Real-life monitoring of ear- EEG overcome this limitation, and enable research of evoked responses and spontaneous responses related to everyday life situations. The compact and discreet nature of ear-EEG devices makes it suitable for real-life EEG monitoring. A general problem when recordings EEG is the interference arising from noise and artifacts. In a laboratory environment, artifacts and interference can largely be avoided or controlled, in real-life this is challenging. Physiological artifacts are a category of artifacts with physiological origin, in contrast to artifacts arising from electrical interference. A study of physiological artifacts in ear-EEG found artifacts from jaw muscle contractions to be higher for ear-EEG compared to the scalp EEG, whereas eye-blinking did not influence the ear-EEG.  Sleep monitoring  A promising use case is in long term sleep monitoring, where there is presently a need for a more user friendly (and cheaper) alternative to the gold standard polysomnography. Innovation Fund Denmark recently funded a large project on using ear-EEG for sleep monitoring, in a collaboration between industry and Aarhus University in Denmark , however, development of an ear-EEG based sleep monitor is a global endeavor, with other prominent examples taking place at the University of Colorado , Imperial College London as well as the University of Oxford.  Possible commercial uses  Despite the lack of ear- EEG products on the market, several companies have revealed investments in ear-EEG technology. Foremost of these are the hearing aid producers Oticon and Widex, who are looking into hearing-aid applications, the feasibility of which there appears to be some support for, and a hypoglycemia alarm. Other potential use cases which are known to have been explored are driver drowsiness detection, BCI and biometric identification.

Aug 2016 This galaxy is well- known because of the observations of the velocity dispersion in 2016 that suggested a mass of about one trillion solar masses, about the same as the mass of the Milky Way. This mass was also consistent with about 90 and 70 globular clusters observed around Dragonfly 44 in two different work. Later, spatially resolved kinematics measured a mass of about 160 billion solar mass, six times less than early mass measurements and 1 order of magnitude less than the Milky Way mass. The most recent work found 20 globular clusters around the galaxy which is consistent with the recent mass measurement. The lack of X-ray emission form the galaxy and surrounding also show that the number of globular clusters can not be as many as was claimed before. The galaxy emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way. The galaxy was discovered with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array.  Early study  To determine the amount of dark matter in this galaxy, in 2016, astronomers used the DEIMOS instrument installed on Keck II to measure the velocities of stars for 33.5 hours over a period of six nights so they could determine the galaxy's mass. The scientists then used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 8-m Gemini North telescope to reveal a halo of spherical clusters of stars around the galaxy's core.http://earthsky.org/space/dragonfly-44-dark-matter-galaxy-2016 Followoing this observation, in August 2016, astronomers reported that this galaxy might be made almost entirely of dark matter.

Manufactured by HLL Lifecare, it is part of an award-winning AIDS awareness campaign that was initiated by Tata. The name, \\"Dipper\\", was inspired by the iconic message, \\"Use Dipper at Night\\" (meaning the recommended usage of dim headlights at night) - that are painted at the back of inter- as well as intrastate trucks in India. History It was a NACO idea, created in 2005.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/condom-called- dipper-was-a-naco-idea-that-failed-to-take-off-2979892/ According to studies carried out by the Transport Corporation of India (TCI), out of the two million truck drivers in India who visit sex workers, only about 11 percent of them use protection. It also found that AIDS awareness among the drivers was very low, with about 16 percent of them suffering from some venereal disease. In April 2016, Tata Motors, one of India's largest truck manufacturers, launched a campaign called \\"Use Dipper at Night\\" which was intended to resonate amongst truck drivers who are clueless about unsafe sex and its consequences. In association with creative agency Rediffusion Y&R;, latex condom manufacturer HLL Lifecare, and TCI, Tata launched \\"Khushi Clinics\\" which carried out distribution of condoms in and around prime locations of truck drivers such as Ludhiana (Punjab), Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Vashi (Maharashtra). Production Dipper condoms are manufactured by Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL) Lifecare. For packaging, Rediffusion employed a colourful artwork style used by truck drivers and owners to decorate their trucks, in order to make them appealing to its targeted user base. Called 'truck art' in creative parlance, colourful patterns and pictures that reflected 'highway culture' was used while creating the packets. In April 2016, a total of 45,000 Dipper condoms were sold by the TCI Foundation in a window of 30 days. Birender Dubey, coordinator of the activity in Vashi, said, \\"The response was great. Normally, truckers feel shy about buying condoms. But Dipper appealed to their sensibilities. Everything worked in its favour - the price, the packaging, the quality, and most of all, the message 'Use Dipper At Night.' The stock is sold out and we've been getting request for more from drivers and our other clinics ever since.\\" Honors In June 2016, Rediffusion Y&R; won a Silver Medal Lion for the campaign in the 2016 edition of Media Lions.

This method used the axial inclination of the incisor teeth to study the relationship. This method removes any influence of soft tissues and dental compensation and permits an adjustment to the inclination of the maxillary and mandibular incisors to their normal value in respect to maxillary and mandibular planes. This method uses incisor overjet as the indicator of the relative position of the maxilla to the mandible. Thus the overjet describes the skeletal discrepancy.

Early life  Shipley was born at Copt Hall, Luton, Bedfordshire, the son of a captain of cavalry, Richard Shipley. His mother was born Jane Rudyerd, and was distantly descended from Benjamin Rudyerd and the Maddox baronets of Wormley, Hertfordshire.Burke's Peerage, London 1832, p.169. Military career After entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich at the age of nine he received in 1771 a commission as ensign and practitioner engineer. The following year he went to Menorca and in 1776 was promoted to be lieutenant and sub-engineer. He returned to England in 1778, and was stationed at Gravesend as engineer on the staff under Colonel Debbieg, the commanding Royal Engineer of the Chatham or Thames district. From 1780 to 1783, he served in St Lucia in the Leeward Islands, returning home to be stationed at Dover Castle In 1788, he again went to the West Indies, stationed at Antigua, but was called home in 1792 to be tried by court-martial for disobedience to regulations for employing his own negroes in Antigua on government fortification work. The court sat at the Horse Guards, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be suspended from rank and pay for twelve months, at the same time stating that they fully recognised that Shipley's departure from regulations did not suggest any corrupt or interested motive. In 1793, he was promoted captain and again posted to the West Indies, but was captured by the French corvette Perdrix within a few miles of Barbados. The prisoners were confined in hulks at Guadeloupe and suffered great hardship, but Shipley's wife was set free and eventually managed to secure her husband's freedom. In 1795 Shipley was promoted to major in the army and in 1796 was appointed commanding Royal Engineer of the Windward and Leeward Islands. In 1797 he accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby as commanding Royal Engineer on his expedition to Trinidad, which gained possession of the island from the Spanish, and in the unsuccessful attack on Puerto Rico in the following month. In 1798 he was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers. In 1799, Shipley was sent by Lieutenant-general (afterwards Sir) Thomas Trigge in the Amphitrite to survey the coasts in the neighbourhood of the Surinam river to locate a landing-place for a military force to attack Surinam. Surinam surrendered on 20 August 1799, but was soon retaken. Shipley also took part, during March, in the capture of the islands of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, and of Santa Cruz. On 21 and 22 June 1803 he commanded a detachment of infantry at the capture of St. Lucia. In April 1804 he accompanied an expedition sent under Brigadier-General (afterwards Sir) Charles Green, temporarily commander in chief in the Leeward Islands, against Dutch Guiana. Shipley landed with Lieutenant Arnold of the Royal Engineers and a small party, to reconnoitre the defences of Surinam, which was again captured. In a despatch to Lord Camden, Green admitted his obligations to Shipley, as commanding engineer, 'far beyond my power to express.‚Äô In 1805, Shipley was promoted colonel in the Royal Engineers, and in 1806 brigadier- general to the forces serving in the West Indies. In that year, under orders from the Board of Ordnance, he made a circuit of the coast of Jamaica, and explored the interior by crossing the island in various directions, almost losing his life in a fast-flowing river. In 1807 he accompanied the expedition from Barbados against the Danish West India islands under General Bowyer and Rear-admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. They arrived before St. Thomas on 21 December, when Shipley was sent ashore to demand from the governor, von Scholten, the surrender of St. Thomas and St. John, which capitulated next day. The expedition then sailed for Santa Cruz, and Shipley was again sent on shore to negotiate terms. The governor would only capitulate if some of his officers could be allowed to inspect the British ships and troops, and, having done this, could satisfy his honour that the British force was so strong that resistance would be hopeless. Shipley agreed, the inspection was made, and the island capitulated on 25 December 1807. On 22 March 1808, Shipley was knighted, and in January 1809 took part in the expedition against Martinique under lieutenant-general Sir George Beckwith. He landed on 30 January and commenced operations against Pigeon Island, in which he was admirably supported by Captain (afterwards Sir) George Cockburn of H.M.S. Pomp√©e and his bluejackets. The night after the batteries opened fire the enemy were obliged to capitulate, and Pigeon Island fell to the British, to be followed by Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal, and on 23 February by the whole island of Martinique. Shipley received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his conduct. In February 1810, he commanded the second division of the army in the successful operations against Guadeloupe. Brigadier-general Harcourt, in his despatch, expressed his indebtedness to Shipley during the operations, and especially in the action at Ridge Beaurepaire, St. Louis, in front of Bellair. Shipley was promoted to be major-general and on 27 February 1813 appointed acting Lieutenant-Governor of Grenada. After the return to France from Elba of Napoleon Bonaparte, a naval and military expedition, under Admiral Sir Philip Durham and Lieutenant-general Sir James Leith, was sent to secure the French West India islands on behalf of the King of France, against whom they had revolted, and in June 1815 Martinique and Marie Galante were reoccupied without trouble. Guadeloupe, however, held out for Bonaparte, and did not yield without severe fighting. Shipley commanded the first brigade and the enemy were defeated at all points, after which Guadeloupe surrendered. Both naval and military commanders in their despatches expressed the highest praise of the 'distinguished and indefatigable engineer, Sir Charles Shipley'. Shipley received, by the command of the Prince Regent, a medal for Martinique with a clasp for Guadeloupe, accompanied by a letter from the Duke of York, then commander-in-chief. In July 1815, Shipley declined promotion out of the corps of Royal Engineers, to which he had belonged all his service, and of which he was senior regimental colonel, preferring to wait for his battalion. However his exertions at the attack on Guadeloupe had brought on an illness which caused his death in Grenada on 30 November 1815. He was buried in the church of St. George's, Grenada. Family Shipley had married at Gravesend, in May 1780, Mary, the daughter of James Teale, and a great-granddaughter of Sir Anthony Aucher. Lady Shipley died at Boulogne (where she was assigned a residence by Louis XVIII in consideration of her husband's services in the French West Indies) on 6 August 1820, and was buried in the English burial- ground there; her remains were later removed and reinterred in the cloisters of Canterbury Cathedral.

It was built from 1854 to the 1860s. It is also contains the Taromeo cemetery. The Taromeo Homestead and its cemetery were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Taromeo Station was one of the original pastoral properties in the area and was taken up soon after land in Queensland became available for free settlement in 1842. The district was first divided into three huge runs, Taromeo, Tarong and Nanango, although Taromeo is thought to be the earliest of these by some months. By 1841 would-be squatters were moving into southeast Queensland, settling first on the Darling Downs. The first sale of Brisbane land took place in Sydney in July 1842 and soon after an expedition comprising Andrew Petrie, Walter Wrottesley, W. Joliffe, Henry Stewart Russell, convicts and Aborigines set off to explore the Wide Bay area. Land holdings were quickly taken up, possibly as a result of their reports. In 1846 Captain Samuel Augustus Perry and James Charles Burnett conducted surveys and Burnett alone made a second trip in 1847 looking at river systems mainly to establish a port to serve the area. Historic Taromeo Homestead Although there is no evidence for the date on which Taromeo was first settled, it is known that in late 1842, John Borthwick, from Buaraba Homestead near Ipswich, and William Elliott Oliver visited Taromeo Station on their way north seeking land for establishing pastoral runs. Soon afterwards, Oliver took up Nanango and Borthwick continued northward to the land that was to become Tarong Station. Simon Scott had arrived from Scotland with his brother Walter in 1839. Simon worked initially on a property at Castlereagh and arrived in the Moreton Bay region in 1841 as part of a group delivering sheep to Cressbrook station. After taking up Taromeo he returned to Castlereagh and married Christine Swanson. In March 1847 Scott returned to Taromeo with his family and on 5 July 1847 applied for a squatter's license for an area of 200 square miles. He built a cedar house around 1850, probably replacing more primitive accommodation, and added ancillary buildings. Mrs Scott died on Christmas Day, 1851 and is buried at Taromeo, though the area was not officially proclaimed a cemetery reserve until 1878. The smithy is thought to have been built in 1854 and Robert Williams, who also built the stone house at Moore, constructed a stone store and butcher's shop for Scott in 1856. These were originally shingled and were separate buildings. In 1857 when a survey of the area was carried out, the station was flourishing with a number of buildings constructed and a large area under cultivation. Simon Scott, who had remarried in 1854, was killed close to the house in 1858 when he fell from his horse. His brother then ran the property until his son, also named Walter, came of age. The Scott family appears to have been on relatively good terms with local indigenous people and Walter Scott Junior, later Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Burnett and Mulgrave between 1871 and 1878, is reputed to have spoken their language fluently. In the 1870s, Cobb and Co established a route between Brisbane and Nanango and Taromeo became an overnight stop where horses were rested and passengers accommodated. The station ceased running sheep to raise cattle. The original lease holding of Taromeo was reduced as the government sought to encourage closer settlement in the South Burnett region. Beginning in the 1870s, resumptions occurred over many years, through consolidation in the 1880s, to the early twentieth century when two Land Acts (1897 and 1902) allowed the resumption of much of the lease. In 1889 Walter Scott voluntarily allowed resumption of a large area on which the townships of Blackbutt and Benarkin were established, though most of it was subdivided into 160-acre farms. The Queensland National Bank took over the property in the 1890s, leaving Mrs Scott as the manager after her husband died. She retired to live in Brisbane in 1897, when a relative then managed the property until the outbreak of World War I. The original homestead building was demolished in the 1930s, but work has been carried out to repair the early buildings back to their former glory. Taromeo Station has been in the hands of the current owners for over forty years. A manager is also located on site and is the first point of contact for those who wish to view the buildings and early station records. Please note that Taromeo is a working cattle property and strictly private property, it is integral that an appointment is made with the manager via telephone prior to arrival. The cemetery is accessible and is administered by the local government authority and property owners. The cemetery was destroyed In the 2010-2011 Queensland floods. A $180,000 restoration project was funded by the Queensland and Australian Governments and the work was carried out by Ziegler Monumentals of Toowoomba and was completed by February 2013.  Description  Graves at Taromeo Homestead, 2002 The homestead buildings are situated in open rolling country that features large granite outcrops and boulders. Rocky outcrops and large trees are interspersed between the buildings. On the western side of the entrance drive are two residential timber buildings, possibly from the 1930s, and a butchers shop. This has a pyramidal roof of corrugated iron with a core constructed of vertical boards, open below the roof. A flat modern roof has been erected on the western side. These buildings are separated from the earlier buildings of the complex by a fence. To the northwest is a kitchen garden fenced with timber slabs, which has a small timber structure in one corner. The stone stables and store face each other across the entrance drive and are the dominant buildings in the group. The store is a rectangular building with an east/west axis. It is made of granite blocks and has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. Windows barred by timber strips flank the central door on the southern side. The walls are thick and rendered internally and are lined with narrow shelves. It has a floor of wide boards and a loft area accessed by a ladder. There is a door high in the gable end that was probably used for loading from a cart into the loft area. A door on the northern side of the building has been filled in and there is a slab lean-to section abutting this side of the building. Adjoining the store is a stone butchers shop. It has a lower roof with a small raised section along the centre of the roof ridge for ventilation. The stables have slab walls to plate height and comprise a rectangular core with a gabled roof and a verandah roof to the west, north and east. There is also a lean to extension to the east. The stables have a weatherboard hayloft added across the original gabled section. Openings along the southern side have large doors with forged pins, catches and hinges. To the north of the stables are yards. Behind the store and butchers and separated from them by a large rocky outcrop is a single storey timber residence. Across from this to the north is a slab building with a gabled corrugated iron roof, which was the former blacksmith's shop. No blacksmithing equipment remains inside. In a line beyond this are a modern corrugated iron and weatherboard storage shed and a small bathroom structure comprising an enclosed, gabled roofed section with a drum shower suspended over a slatted timber floor. A corrugated iron partition divides this from an entrance area with a timber bench and washbowl. To the side of this is an open section sheltered by a skillion roof. About to the east of these buildings is a milking shed with a pole frame, open sides and a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The interior is fitted with cow bails. The adjoining yards are enclosed with sawn timber rails wired to posts. To the west of the homestead and across the creek is the family cemetery. A crenellated stone wall of coursed rubble encloses it and it is entered by an iron gate. Within the wall, arranged in two rows, are the graves of members of the Scott family. The memorials date from 1851 to 1962 and include including that of Simon Scott who died in 1858. A number of those buried were born on Taromeo in the 1840s and 50s. Some graves are outlined with granite stones, as is the narrow path down the center. There are unmarked graves of Taromeo staff behind the cemetery enclosure including that of the mason responsible for the stonework.  Heritage listing  Taromeo Homestead complex and cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Taromeo Station was established by Simon Scott in about 1842 and is thought to have been the first run taken up in the Wide Bay/Burnett area. The run demonstrates the development of Queensland, particularly this area from the establishment of pastoral holdings in 1840s to closer settlement from the 1870s. The property illustrates the development of pastoral practices in Queensland, particularly the development of the beef industry in the South Burnett Region. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Taromeo has a number of rare built elements including a stone walled private cemetery, thought to be one of only two stone walled family cemeteries in Australia The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The early date of Taromeo with its many extant features suggest that a potential exists for further historical and archaeological research which may yield information which will contribute to an understanding of early Queensland station life. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The station complex at Taromeo is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early Queensland pastoral station. The arrangement of the early buildings and their relationship to each other provides important evidence of early station life. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Taromeo has aesthetic significance; the site has a picturesque quality resulting from the layering of traditional buildings of various styles, materials and periods of construction set amongst granite outcrops and large trees. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Taromeo has special associations with the South Burnett community as one of their first settled stations and as a place of employment for local residents and their families many of whom remain in the area. The place is associated particularly with the Scott family who are important pioneers in the area.

It was among the first challenges to the Havlagah (lit. restraint) policy not to retaliate against Arab attacks on Jewish civilians. Background overview In 1936, Palestinian Arabs launched a revolt that was to last three years against British colonial rule. At first the revolt consisted of a general strike but later became more violent, attacking British forces and also including terror attacks against Jews. In the preceding year Jewish immigration, blocked in the United States and many European countries had risen to 66,672 over the 4,075 in 1931.John Newsinger, British Counterinsurgency, Springer 2016 p.6. In July 1937, the Peel Commission proposed a partition of Palestine, and recommended a population transfer of 225,000 Arabs out of the designated future Jewish territory and a smaller number of Jews out of the designated future Arab territory.James Gannon, Military Occupations in the Age of Self-determination: The History Neocons Neglected, ABC-CLIO, 2008 pp.32-33. The Zionist Organization was strongly divided on the proposal, but historians consider them to have either \\"accepted\\" or \\"not rejected outright\\" the principle of partition, while rejecting the specific borders suggested by the Peel Commission and empowering the executive to continue negotiating with the British.'20th Zionist Congress, Resolution passed 299 to 160 with 6 absentions,' The Arab Higher Committee rejected the plan outright, as did the Revisonist Zionists. Soon after, a hated district commissioner, Lewis Yelland Andrews, known for his repressive measures was assassinated by militant followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam outside an Anglican church.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine:Une Mission sacr√©e de la civilisation, Fayard 2002 p.373. Restraint vs. militancy The mainstream Zionist approach to the insurgency, set forth by David Ben-Gurion, was to avoid reprisal and rather prioritize the strengthening of defenses in Jewish areas, a policy of Havlagah (lit. Restraint). Notrim and Jewish supernumeraries had however been active after having been recruited by the British army to help repress the Arab revolt.Benny Morris,Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011 pp.145f. A militant form of Zionism, constituting a paramilitary organization calling itself Irgun soon broke ranks with the Haganah over the issue of restraint. It was dominated by activists who had originally identified with Ze'ev Jabotinsky‚Äôs Betar movement, which had been founded in 1923, and eventually evolved into the core of Zionist Revisionism. Jabotinsky himself initially advised a diplomatic approach and held reservations about recourse to measures of retaliation. The Irgun, adopted a policy change from passive defense to active aggression, and considered terrorism against Palestinians a form of deterrence against Arab attacks. The active defense tactic adopted consisted of 4 kinds of assault: (a) assassinations (b) shooting fellahin or urban Arabs (c) ambushes of transport vehicles carrying Arabs and (d) outright terrorist assaults on densely populated Arab areasLeonard Weinberg, Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger, Political Parties and Terrorist Groups, Routledge, 2008 pp.81-82. Some of these practices were not new: on 20 April 1936, 2 Palestinians had been murdered while tending a banana grove, and on 20 April, pedestrians in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were subject to attacks where guns and hand-grenades were used. In March 1937 right-wing Zionists had thrown a bomb into a coffee house frequented by Arabs in Tel Aviv. Throughout the three years of the revolt, the revisionist group mounted some 60 acts of terrorism against Palestinian targets.Colin Shindler, A History of Modern Israel, Cambridge University Press 2013 p.36Colin Shindler, The Rise of the Israeli Right, Cambridge University Press 2015 pp.182-183 Black Sunday, 1937 In July 1937, Jabotinsky met with Robert Bitker, Moshe Rosenberg and Avraham Stern, the future leader of Lehi, in Alexandria and underwrote, despite his personal reservations, the proposal to have recourse to retaliatory action. Jabotinsky posed only one condition to his assent, that he not be kept informed about too many details.Colin Shindler,Triumph of Military Zionism:Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right, I. B. Tauris 2009 pp.195-196. At this stage in the revolt, the Arab uprising had degenerated into, in Colin Shindler‚Äôs words, ‚Äòinternecine Arab violence and nihilist attacks on Jews.‚Äô Demand for retaliation within the Irgun heightened with the killing of rabbi Eliezer Gerstein on 3 September while he was en route to pray at the Western Wall. From 29 October to 11 November, 21 attacks were made against British police and Jews, 5 with bombs, resulting in 11 murders, many of the dead being Jews.Henry Laurens , \\" La Question de Palestine:Une mission sacr√©e de civilisation, \\" Fayard 2002 p.374,p.654 n.74 At this point the Irgun leader David Raziel authorized a programme of active rather than passive defense, consisting of bombing Arab coffee houses, in cities such as Haifa and Rosh Pinah, and attacks around Jerusalem, and on buses travelling between the cities of Tiberias and Safed, in which Black Sunday marked the turning point. Jaa‚Äôcov Eliav, the Irgun‚Äôs master bomb maker, was in charge of the operations generally that led to the November 14 attack,Bruce Hoffman, Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel, 1917-1947, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2015 pp.17-18. David Raziel organized the attacks in Jerusalem. The first attack had taken place on 11 November, when the Irgun murdered 2 Arabs at a Jaffa bus deposit, and wounded a further 5.Ya'a·∏≥ov Eliav, Wanted, Shengold Publishers, 1984 pp.34f. The second occurred early on the morning of 14 November.Patrick Bishop,The Reckoning: Death and Intrigue in the Promised Land-A True Detective Story, HarperCollins, 2014 p.35. Raziel had ordered multiple attacks to be undertaken almost simultaneously in order to hamper a coherent police response. At 7 am. 2 Arab pedestrians were shot on Aza Street in Rehavia, a neighbourhood in Jerusalem, by Joseph Kremin and Shlomo Trachtman. A half an hour later, another two were shot. In both cases, one of the victims survived. Some time later, Zvi Meltser armed an Irgun operative who then attacked an Arab bus, killing 3 passengers and wounding 8.Zev Golan,Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues who Created the State of Israel, Devora Publishing, 2003 p.122. By the end of the operation, 10 Arabs had been killed and many more woundedJ. Bowyer Bell, Terror out of Zion, Transaction Publishers 2nsd ed 2009 p.39 The Irgun commemorated the incidents on 14 November as \\"the Day of the Breaking of the Havlagah\\". They regarded the operation as a commemorative symbol evoking the revolt of Judas Maccabeus against the Seleucids. Raziel himself said that the operation had wiped out the shame of the policy of restraint.Monty Noam Penkower, Twentieth Century Jews: Forging Identity in the Land of Promise and in the Promised Land, Academic Studies Press, p.312. Aftermath The renewal of Arab violence in October 1937 led to changes in tactics by the Zionists. One practice, adopted by the Irgun in particular, introduced an innovation to the armed conflict: the use of massive bombs in crowded areas, indiscriminately killing and maiming dozens of people. The targets were chosen based on accessibility and so that the maximum number of Arabs could be hit.David Hirst, Beware of Small States: Lebanon, Battleground of the Middle East, Nation Books, 2010 p.34. This technique was soon picked up by Arabs: in the following decades, the targeting of public buildings became a tradition in Palestine, and later in Israel. According to David Hirst, this approach resulted in the death of some 140 Palestinians in a three-week period, which is more than the number of Jews killed in the previous year and a half of the uprising. Morris states that the numbers of Arabs killed in these indiscriminate attacks matched the number of Jews killed by Arabs in the 1929 and 1936 uprisings. In July 1938 alone two such Irgun bombs planted in Haifa‚Äôs central market accounted for 74 Arab dead and 129 wounded, leading to a generalized cycle of reprisal between the two groups.Neil Caplan, The Israel- Palestine Conflict: Contested Histories, John Wiley & Sons, 2011 p.88. There are several notable incidents associated the Jewish insurgency fueled by the Irgun attacks in the summer of 1938. *6 July 1938 an Irgun militant in Arab garb planted milk cans loaded with explosives in an Arab market in Haifa killing 21, and wounding 52. *25 July 1938 in the same market, operatives left an explosive-filled container marked ‚Äòsour cucumbers‚Äô which, on explosion, resulted in the death of 39 Arabs and the wounding of a further 46 *26 August 1938, explosives planted in the Jaffa market took a lethal toll of 24 Arabs and 39 wounded. The British initially took no action against the Irgun itself, but rather arrested members of Jabotinsky‚Äôs group on suspicion they were connected to the incident. Jabotinsky distanced himself from the action adopted but later spoke of it as 'a spontaneous outbreak of the outraged feelings of the nation‚Äôs soul.' The British also enlisted 19,000 Jewish policemen to assist them in countering the insurgency, and eventually organized Special Night Squads. The Irgun revolt effected a change in mainstream Jewish policy also. Despite official shock at these incidents, the tactic of a defensive response underwent reexamination, was found to be ineffective, with the result that the Haganah command began to set up field companies to engage in ambushes. Orde Wingate's night squads and Yitzhak Sadeh's mobile military units (plugot ha'Sadeh), established in December of that year, also exercised an influence on the creation of such clandestine forces. Ben-Gurion in turn had one officer secretly establish pe'ulot meyudahot, or special operation squads specializing in retaliatory operations against Arab terrorists, villages thought to harbor them and, at times, against British units themselves. These squads operated at Ben-Gurion's discretion, and lay outside the official Haganah chain of command.

It is not about the sister of Saint Martha, nor about the sinful woman whose sins the Lord forgave ().\\"Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 131 Elsewhere it said of the Roman liturgy of 22 July that \\"it will make mention neither of Mary of Bethany nor of the sinful woman of Luke 7:36‚Äì50, but only of Mary Magdalene, the first person to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection\\".Calendarium Romanum (1969), p. 98 * 1969: Rosamund Essex became the first woman to be licensed as a Reader in the Church of England. 1970s * 1970: * Mate Mahadevi was installed as a jagadguru (spiritual head of the Indian Lingayat community), the first time a woman had been placed in that position.Lingayathism website * The Northern Province of the Moravian Church approved women for ordination in 1970 at the Provincial Synod, but it was not until 1975 that Mary Matz became the first female minister within the Moravian Church. * In 1963 the Second Vatican Council requested a revision of the rite of the consecration of virgins that was found in the Roman Pontifical; the revised Rite was approved by Pope Paul VI and published in 1970.Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship, Decree promulgating the new rite for the consecration of a virgin, 31 May 1970, AAS 62 (1970) p. 650.

Consecrated by the diocesan bishop, these women acquire a particular link with the Church, which they are committed to serve while remaining in the world.

The women's ordinations were not, however, recognised as being valid by the Roman Catholic Church. As a consequence of this violation of canon law and their refusal to repent, the women were excommunicated in 2003. Since then several similar actions have been held by Roman Catholic Womenpriests, a group in favor of women's ordination in Roman Catholicism; this was the first such action. * Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first bhikkhuni (fully ordained Buddhist nun) in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, traveling to Taiwan to be ordained. * A 55-year-old Buddhist nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first female monk to be ordained in Thailand.

Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others. The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning. By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the halakhic tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners. * 2003: * Ayya Sudhamma Bhikkhuni became the first American-born woman to gain bhikkhuni ordination in the Theravada school in Sri Lanka.The Outstanding Women in Buddhism Awards (2006) BhƒÅvanƒÅ Society Forest Monastery (2007) , p. 165. * Sarah Schechter became the first female rabbi in the U.S. Air Force. * Sandra Kochmann, born in Paraguay, became the first female rabbi in Brazil. * Born in Canada and educated in England, Nancy Morris became Scotland's first female rabbi in 2003. * Rabbi Janet Marder was named the first female president of the Reform Movement's Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) on March 26, 2003, making her the first woman to lead a major rabbinical organization and the first woman to lead any major Jewish co-ed religious organization in the United States. * On February 28, 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive full ordination as a Theravada nun.

It towers high above the market town and the River Wiesent and may have been the inspiration for Richard Wagner's grail castle in his opera, Parsifal. The castle is a Bavarian listed building, no. D-4-74-129-10.  History  G√∂√üweinstein Castle in 1928 G√∂√üweinstein Castle seen from the Kreuzberg (Oct 2014) thumb The castle was probably named after its founder, Count Gozwin. He was killed in 1065, after he had invaded the territory of the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. The first record of Goswinesteyn castle is dated to 1076. At that time, Emperor Henry IV had Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt, who had become embroiled in the Saxon Rebellion, incarcerated there, a fact which suggests it was already a strong fortress. From the time of Bishop Otto of Bamberg there is evidence that the castle became part of the Bamberg estate. From 1348 to 1780 it was the seat of a vogtei under the bishops of Bamberg. In 1525, during the Peasants' War it was destroyed and rebuilt. During the Second Margrave War in 1553 the castle was again destroyed and later rebuilt. The castle became a Bavarian possession as a result of secularisation of the Bishopric of Bamberg in 1803. The Bavarian state sold the castle in 1875 to Pauline Rabeneck, a landowning widow from the Manor (Rittergut) of Aspach near Uffenheim. In 1890 Baron Edgar of Sohlern purchased the castle and had it remodelled in the Neogothic style. The castle chapel also has Late Gothic statues.  Today  The castle is still in the hands of the von Sohlen family.Information board on Burgstrasse, retrieved 15 Sep 2016.

It was built in 1889 by John King. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010.  History  The former King's Boarding House, a gabled building of horizontal slab construction with a detached kitchen was built in 1889 by selector John King, on the Maidenwell-Cooyar Rd, Maidenwell. The area encompassing present day Maidenwell, close to the Bunya Mountains and on the Cooyar Range, was first settled in the post-contact era following the establishment of Tarong Homestead by James Borthwick in 1842. It was a vast holding of approximately 250 sq miles (168.35 sq km) comprising four runs: Tarong, Kunioon, Tureen and Neumgna. The creation of large holdings such as Tarong played a key role in the development of Queensland's transport network, with mail routes often following tracks and stock routes connecting pastoral properties. By 1849, pastoralists in the Burnett district were petitioning the Postmaster General to establish mail services to their regions. In 1859, the Postmaster-General advertised for tenders for two mail services to Nanango: one via \\"North Brisbane\\" and another via Drayton. The Drayton route was operating by 1860 and connected the Rosalie, Cooyar and Tarong pastoral stations before terminating at Nanango. The establishment of the railway network throughout Queensland from the mid 1860s realigned the way goods and services were transported between destinations, with routes feeding into the railway assuming greater importance. The Western railway line from Toowoomba reached Jondaryan at the end of 1867, with a mail service between Nanango and Jondaryan established soon after, replacing the Drayton-Nanango service while still using much of the earlier route. By 1877, the Nanango correspondent for the Brisbane Courier named Jondaryan railway station as \\"the chief depot from where goods arrive to this township\\". Under the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876 approximately 35 square miles (56.33 sq km) of the Neumgna run of Tarong was resumed in 1878, to open the area for conditional selection. On 10 April 1883, John King applied to lease Portion 194, a block. King along with his brother James and William McConnell were the first closer settlers in the district. John King was born in Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, England in 1853, later immigrating to Australia with his parents. While the date of his arrival is undetermined, family history records King working on the Main Range railway and later in a brick factory, after his arrival. King married Mary Chalklin in 1875 at Ipswich and by 1879 had taken out a brand registration in the Parish of Greenmount, Warwick, indicating an involvement with agriculture prior to his selection of land in the South Burnett. Following the death of his wife Mary in 1895, King remarried in 1898 to Caroline Rutsch. Both spouses had two children from their first marriages, and five more children were born at Maidenwell. After Portion 194 was surveyed in early 1884, John King objected, as the eastern boundary cut off his property's direct access to the Jondaryan- Nanango road. This issue was resolved by excising from adjoining Portion 193, the former selection of James King, who had forfeited his lease to take up another selection nearby. Consequently, John King's selection was increased to , with a frontage along the road. The conditional selection inspection of 1890 lists among the improvements, a house and outhouses, fencing, ringbarking of and of land under cultivation. A well of depth was also noted, the structure behind the name of \\"Maidenwell\\". Initially used by King for his own property, the name Maidenwell later assumed a wider use for the district and subsequent township in the early twentieth century. The house listed in the 1890 inspection is believed to have been built in 1889, replacing an earlier slab hut that was built some in from the Nanango road. The building, constructed of horizontal hardwood slabs and weatherboards, had a front verandah, was sheltered by a gabled roof clad in shingles and included a detached kitchen to the rear, connected via a walkway. King utilised stone bonded with lime and loam to construct a fireplace and chimney, and an underground water tank adjacent to the walkway. The space underneath the kitchen was used as a cellar, to store home made wine, jam and preserves, from produce grown on the property. A large mound of spent carbide close to the house indicates the use of this material for lighting. The Kings capitalised on their residence's close proximity to the road and its location suggests that a commercial use may have been intended for the building when constructed. By at least 1899, and possibly earlier, the Kings were operating a boarding house, the Pinpinbugie Receiving Office and a store from their residence. The precise date coach services were established between Nanango and Jondaryan is unclear. By 1893 Michael Collins operated the Nanango- Jondaryan mail service twice a week by buggy and a coach run was operating between the townships by 1897. Coach routes were broken up into \\"stages\\" or \\"posts\\", and the amenities offered to travellers at such places, were a critical component of road infrastructure throughout Queensland. While the size and range of services offered at coach stops varied, essentially they were places where horses were changed and where establishments offered food, drink and accommodation. Coach stops were important spaces for travellers to socialise, shelter from inclement conditions and obtain information on the condition of the road ahead. The setting of King's Boarding House, above a water crossing and on level ground highly visible and in close proximity to the road, follows the pattern found at similar coach stops at Bankfoot House, Glass House Mountains and the \\"Stonehouse\\" at Moore. Addressing the road on its east facing gable, the name 'King's Boarding House', can still be faintly made out on the building. Although John King was listed as the Receiving Office Keeper, his wife Caroline is thought to have been responsible for duties attached to the office, with about 120 letters received and despatched each month. In 1906 the office was renamed the Maidenwell Receiving Office. Part of the front verandah of the homestead was enclosed to form the office, with a mail slot inserted into the verandah wall. The King's store operated from the cellar beneath the detached kitchen and serviced the local settler population, which increased as further land was made available for selection in the Parishes of Neumgna and Tureen, from 1903 to 1914. An interesting detail of the former store area is the inscription of \\"Big Druth (sic) 1902\\" together with a date and the initials \\"J.K.\\", which appears to a record of the devastating drought that occurred throughout Australia in the early years of the twentieth century. Branch railway line extensions to Nanango (1911), Cooyar (via Oakey, 1913) and Tarong (1915) ended the role of Jondaryan railway station as the railhead for the district. In 1906 and 1907 King selected Portions 50 and 52, adjoining the north-western boundary of his property, and it was here that the small settlement of Maidenwell came to be established in the 1910s. The services that King had offered for travellers and local settlers at his original selection were eventually transferred to this new location. In 1913 King built the Maidenwell Hotel, opening in early 1914. The Maidenwell Receiving Office remained at King's original premises until 1918, when John Castree, who was operating a store first established by King in 1914, became the mail receiving officer. John King passed away in 1934, with Portion 194 left to his sons Walter and James. Walter King assumed full title in 1939, later building a residence near the boarding house, and was involved in farming and dairying on the property. In 1970 Portion 194 was subdivided into two lots, with the former boarding house and later residence included within the boundary of Lot 1. In 1972, Walter's son Donald became the titleholder of both lots, retaining ownership of Lot 1 until 2000, when it was bought by the present owners. While the roof is now clad in corrugated metal sheeting and some alterations have occurred internally and to the exterior verandah wall, the former King's Boarding House remains relatively intact and is currently used for storage.  Description  The former King's Boarding House is located on an elevated parcel of land overlooking the Maidenwell-Cooyar Road, Maidenwell. It consists of two structures connected by a covered walkway. The structure to the east overlooking the road is the original boarding house while the structure to the west is the original kitchen. The landscape around the coach house is scrubby with the only established plantings being a large Bunya Pine (Araucaria bidwillii) to the north of the kitchen and a palm tree to the north of the boarding house. Located in the southern courtyard of the complex bounded by the kitchen, walkway and boarding house are the remains of a stone lined well. A mound of spent carbide is located at the southern end of the kitchen building. The coach house complex including the boarding house, kitchen and walkway are all equally elevated above the ground. The boarding house consists of a simple rectilinear planned core with an enclosed verandah to the west and semi-enclosed verandah to the east. A gable roof form covers the main core of the building while simple lean-to roofs cover the verandahs. The kitchen structure consists of a central rectilinear planned core covered by a gable roof. A simple lean-to roof covers the semi-enclosed verandah space to the west. No verandah exists to the east of the structure; however, remains of floor framing indicate that such a structure may once have existed on this side of the kitchen. A fire place and associated chimney constructed from stone bonded with lime and loam adjoins the northern end of the kitchen. The walkway between the boarding house and kitchen is covered by a curved roof. All roofs to the coach house complex are clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The coach house complex is established on a floor framing system consisting of hardwood stumps, rough sawn hardwood drop log bearers, pit sawn hardwood joists and floor boards. Exterior walls to both buildings are timber framed with the dominant wall construction for both structures being a system of vertically expressed hardwood posts housed into bed log bearers and extended up to meet a hardwood top plate. Smaller twin sections of timber are fixed to posts to create rebates running the length of the post. Pit sawn timber slabs are stacked horizontally into these rebates to create the wall membrane. Wall construction differs across the coach house complex. In the kitchen building the wall to the semi enclosed southern verandah is constructed from rough sawn vertical timber slabs spanning from the ground to the pitching point of the lean-to roof. In the boarding house the southern end of the east facing verandah has been enclosed with butt jointed pit sawn hardwood boards spanning vertically from floor level to the pitching point of the lean-to verandah roof. The eastern exterior wall to the boarding house is clad with dressed tongue and groove timber boards. At the gable and lean-to roof ends of both the boarding house and kitchen timber framing is extended from wall top plates to the under side of the timber framed roof structures. These wall areas are externally clad with hardwood weatherboards. Remnant painted signage that reads \\"King's Boarding House\\" is just visible on the southern gable end of the boarding house building. Some windows to the coach house complex are now missing, those extant include a combination of double hung timber framed windows to the boarding house and timber framed fixed and casement windows to the kitchen. Windows to the northern, western and eastern elevations of the boarding house are protected from the weather by timber framed awnings sheeted with corrugated iron. Internally both buildings reveal clear evidence of the manner in which they were originally configured despite sections of internal wall and ceiling linings being removed. In the boarding house remnant hardwood partitions indicate that both the central core of the building and the enclosed southern verandah were broken up into a number of rooms. The enclosed section of the northern verandah accommodated the post office. Surviving fabric indicates that the ceiling and internal partitions were lined with timber tongue and groove boards while internal surfaces to external walls remained unlined revealing the timber post and slab style of construction. The kitchen building includes an open plan central core complete with stone fireplace for cooking and a semi-enclosed western verandah and sub-floor cellar. An intact high level partition indicates that the core of the building may once have been divided into two rooms. The verandah is set at ground level and has an earth floor. Similar to the external walls of the verandah, the cellar walls are constructed of vertically stood timber slabs set in between timber stumps and spanning from ground level to meet bearers above. This cellar is accessed via a set of timber framed doors. The timber framed roof structure is exposed in the core of the kitchen building and it is not clear if the ceiling was lined. There is no evidence of internal linings to the external walls of the kitchen building and as with the boarding house the timber post and slab wall construction is expressed internally as it is externally.  Heritage listing  The former King's Boarding House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. King's Boarding House (1889) is important in demonstrating the pattern of development in the South Burnett associated with the beginnings of closer settlement in the region from the 1880s. In addition to being a family residence, by 1899, the place operated as a boarding house for travellers on the Jondaryan-Nanango route, and as a mail receiving office and store for the growing settler community, until the establishment of the Maidenwell township in the 1910s. King's Boarding House is important in illustrating the evolution of transport and communications links in the Wide Bay-Burnett district. Located on a road in use as mail route by the 1850s, the provision of a boarding house for travellers, and a receiving office and store demonstrates the expansion of roadside services along the route in response to the establishment of coach services and increased closer settlement in the district during the 1890s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. King's Boarding House is important as a once common, now uncommon surviving example of a coach stop established on a historically important travel route. Coach stops/changing stations and the services they provided were a critical component of road infrastructure throughout Queensland, prior to the emergence of the motor vehicle in the twentieth century. While some alterations have occurred over time, the place is relatively intact and retains sufficient fabric in its layout and materials to demonstrate its functions as a boarding house, mail receiving office and store. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. King's Boarding House is important for its potential to contribute to our understanding of horizontal timber slab construction, and to assist in the comparative analysis of similar places built in 19th century Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. King's Boarding House is an important surviving example of a coach stop established on a historically important travel route. Its setting, along a flat section of a predominantly hilly road, easily visible to travellers and near a water crossing, is a good example of a favourable site for a coach stop/changing station on a coach route. While some alterations have occurred over time, the place is relatively intact and retains sufficient fabric in its layout and materials to demonstrate its functions as a boarding house, mail receiving office and store. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. King's Boarding House is important for its strong aesthetic appeal. Located in a quiet rural setting, the place has been a prominent roadside landmark on the Maidenwell-Cooyar Rd for well over a century.

It was designed by George Gerald Hutton and built in 1929 by H Taylor. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  The former South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd Factory Murgon, incorporating a range of structures dating from 1908 onwards, was built for South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association, and is an important site associated with the manufacture of dairy products in the region from 1913 to 1995. From the late 1800s, a number of critical factors enabled the expansion of the dairy industry into one of Queensland's principal primary industries by the interwar period. These included: government resumption and repurchase of land from pastoralists for the purpose of agricultural selection; the introduction of mechanical cream separators in the 1880s; Babcock testing to accurately measure cream content in milk; The Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act 1893 which made provision for government loans to construct butter and cheese factories; and the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock's use of a \\"Travelling Dairy\\" to demonstrate techniques and equipment to potential dairy farmers throughout Queensland. This period also saw the introduction of sown pastures such as paspalum and Rhodes grass and the cultivation of fodder, to improve milk yields and to provide adequate feed during the less productive months of winter. Effective transport infrastructure was essential for dairy products to reach their desired markets. The extension of Queensland's rural railway network enabled more efficient transportation of dairy produce, facilitating the establishment of local butter and cheese factories in close proximity to railway lines. The first shipment of butter to Britain occurred in 1895 and from 1903, government subsidisation of a fortnightly shipping service to the United Kingdom improved Queensland's butter exporting capabilities. The arrival of the Kilkivan branch railway to Murgon in 1904 was the impetus for the establishment of the township and a catalyst for the rapid expansion of dairying in the surrounding district, then an emerging but relatively small scale industry in the South Burnett. By the early 1900s, co-operatives, where groups of local producers banded together to establish factories, were becoming the dominant form of ownership of cheese and butter factories, a pattern that defined the Queensland dairy industry for much of the twentieth century. In 1908 Tiaro Dairy Co-operative Company was established, with a butter factory built of timber opening in the township in the same year. A significant number of cream suppliers to the factory were from the South Burnett, from areas such as Goomeri, Kilkivan and Murgon. A cream receiving depot was established in Murgon, where cream was forwarded to Tiaro by rail. By 1912, 84 percent of the Tiaro butter factory's cream supply was sourced from the South Burnett and a correspondingly large number of the co-operative's shareholders were from the region. A meeting of shareholders in August 1912 voted to move the factory's operations to Murgon. Tiaro Butter Factory which was moved to Murgon in 1913 A site was acquired along Macalister Street, close to Murgon railway station in August 1913 and following the relocation of the Tiaro factory to Murgon, operations commenced in September. Mr George Wood was the builder of the factory while Waugh and Josephson were contractors for the machinery. The capacity of the factory increased from 12 tons at Tiaro to 40 tons of butter per week. In early 1914 the co-operative adopted the name of the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Company Limited (SBCDC). During the latter half of the year, a railway siding was completed to the factory at a cost of ¬£608/8/1. Following the establishment of the Murgon butter factory, operations progressively expanded, reflecting the suitability and productivity of the South Burnett district for dairying. This growth is illustrated by the increase in the number of suppliers from 250 in 1913 to 800 by 1929, and in butter production from 252 tons in its first year at Murgon, to 1644 tons in 1928. By 1929, the Wide Bay district, in which the South Burnett was included, was second only to the Moreton district in Queensland milk production.Opening of the South Burnett Cooperative Dairy Association Factory, 9 March 1929 The growth of the South Burnett Co-operative's processing activities necessitated the expansion of the factory in 1929. In order to increase production capacity, the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Company commenced the construction of a new unit of 35 tons capacity to work in conjunction with the existing unit, and a power plant capable of running both components together or independently. The objective behind the dual factory system was to apply the churning capacity of both factories to the manufacture of butter before noon, with the remainder of the day geared towards the handling and treatment of cream deliveries from suppliers. The Murgon butter factory increased the overall production capacity to 64 tons of butter a week, or 128 tons using double shifts. The dual factory system, driven by a common power plant, was claimed at the time to be \\"unique in the history of butter production in the Commonwealth\\". Engine room in the Butter Factory, 1939 Brisbane architect George Hutton, supervised building plans and construction and Mr H. Taylor (also of Brisbane) was the builder. The cost of the remodelling was reported as exceeding ¬£25,000. The largest of the new buildings, built to receive, process and churn cream, was constructed of reinforced concrete with a tubular truss roof, crowned by a lantern roof. The engine/plant room was built to the rear of the larger structure. The new buildings were officially opened on 9 March 1929 by William Forgan Smith, Minister for Agriculture and Stock, with over 1000 invited guests and the township \\"en-fete\\" for the occasion. Cream pasteurising and cooling coils,1939 Churns in the Butter Factory, 1939 The building of the new Murgon factory occurred during a period of modernisation for butter manufacturers. By the end of the 1920s most Queensland butter factories had been remodelled or were new buildings of brick and concrete, replacing earlier timber structures. The emphasis on producing high grade butter saw the need for more churns within factories, as the lower temperatures necessary meant churns were turning longer than previously. In addition to upgrading buildings and equipment, greater attention was paid to ensuring butter was of a high standard, through stricter grading and modern processes of pasteurisation and neutralisation. Increasing numbers of trained staff were also working in factories. The manufacture of butter followed a fairly typical process at factories throughout Queensland. Once cream cans were received and weighed, the cream was tested to determine its grading (choice, 2nd or 3rd), before the cans were emptied into vats and cleaned for return to the supplier. The cream was then pasteurised, cooled and pumped to storage vats, before being sent to the churns. The butter was refrigerated, parcelled into butter boxes and forwarded by rail for export. The interwar period saw the dairy industry expand greatly in Queensland. Between 1927 and 1937 the total number of dairy cattle rose by 50 percent. By the 1930s, dairying was Queensland's most widely spread agricultural industry and the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941, accounting for 20% of primary production. By the late 1930s, around one in eight Queenslanders were living on dairy farms. In 1938 there were five co-operative butter factories in the South Burnett: located at Nanango (Nanango Butter Factory Building), Kingaroy, Murgon, Wondai and Proston. While butter factories enabled the production and export of dairy products, numerous small farms, reliant on family labour to milk herds twice daily for generally modest returns, were the backbone of the industry. With its increased productive capacities, Murgon butter factory, had by 1931, become Queensland's fourth largest butter producer. Production at the factory reached its peak in 1934, when 2873 tons was manufactured. The opening of the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Company's branch factory at Proston in 1934 meant a significant number of suppliers west of Murgon sent their cream to the new factory. During 1938-9, a record year, almost 1/3 of all Queensland's butter was produced in the Wide Bay-Burnett, with Murgon the seventh largest producer in the state. By 1950 the farms of the South Burnett carried 130,000 dairy cows, ten percent of the Queensland total. However, as demand and prices for butter dropped in the 1950s, the decline of dairying accelerated. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from 12.2 kg to 8.3 kg between 1957 and 1972 as margarine increased its market share. The downturn worsened in the 1960s, with a reduction in cream suppliers diminishing output. The transition towards the production of milk rather than cream, requiring larger herds and new equipment, saw many smaller scale farmers leaving the industry. Export opportunities also became restricted, culminating with the end of preferential trade agreements with Britain following its entry into the European Common Market in 1973. The late 1960s saw the beginning of closures of butter factories in the Burnett region. The Proston Butter Factory, a branch of the SBCDA, closed in 1967. The Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Company closed their branch factories at Wondai and Biggenden in February 1969. By 1976 dairy farmers in the South Burnett numbered under 400 and of these, 211 were bulk milk suppliers. The average age of a dairyman was 55 and two dairy producers were leaving the industry per week. The Murgon butter factory's diversification into dairy products other than butter from the 1940s enhanced the longevity of SBCDA operations compared to other factories which became increasingly vulnerable to closure from the 1960s. Cheese making commenced at the factory in late 1942 in response to wartime demand, as occurred at the Kingaroy, Nanango and Wondai butter factories. While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised bottled milk sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed. In 1950 the office was re-established in new brick and concrete premises opposite the factory in Macalister St, with the former office building operating as the co-operative's trading arm from 1951. This was followed in 1952 with the construction of a dairy research laboratory, staffed by members of the Department of Agriculture and Stock, adjacent to the new office. In 1960 a new building was constructed for the production of buttermilk powder, produced from the liquid by-product of butter churning. With the closure of the Nanango and Kingaroy butter factories in 1977, all cream supplies were diverted to Murgon factory, the last remaining dairy factory in the South Burnett. 1978 saw the opening of new milk processing facilities, followed by the manufacture of skim milk from 1979, and later, the production of flavoured milk drinks. In 1983, 2.7 million litres of milk was processed through the Murgon plant, and 813 tonnes of cheese and 250 tonnes of butter were manufactured on-site. During 1989-90 the milk processing component of the operation was sold to Queensland United Foods (QUF), resulting in local milk supplies being sent to Nambour. The SBCDA (later changed to Burnett Valley Ltd) were able to procure milk from QUF, which allowed for Murgon cheese to be continued to be manufactured, albeit in a much reduced capacity. By 1995 butter production had ceased, and a decline in demand for the cheddar cheese forced the closure of the Murgon factory, marking the end of dairy processing at the site. The former Murgon Dairy Factory was purchased in 1998 by Clovely Estate and since this time has been utilised for wine making, an industry that has developed in the South Burnett since the early 1990s.  Description  South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd Factory, Murgon, circa 1935 The former Murgon Butter Factory stands to the corner of Macalister and McLucas Streets in the southern outskirts of Murgon, adjacent to the formation of the Kilkivan/Kingaroy railway line. The site is a complex of buildings and structures tightly assembled with the main entrance from Macalister Street arriving to a rectangular bitumen-paved yard from which the loading dock of the factory worked. The site is notable for the buildings and structures surviving from the various eras of the dairy processing business including the relocated former Tiaro Butter Factory, main building (1929), plant room, boiler shed and stack. = Main building (1929) = Fronting the loading yard to Macalister Street, the main building is a rectangular concrete shed distinguished by decorative stepped parapets which screen a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The north-west elevation is divided into seven bays each housing recessed blind panels to the upper level and openings within the recessed panels to the exterior loading dock. Two dock level bays accommodate nine-light casement windows and the balance have either large timber doors or fixed timber panels. The decorative stepped parapet to this elevation contains the lettering \\"The South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd\\" framed by moulded decorative scrolls to each side. The north-east elevation is divided into three bays, one of which has a large timber door opening onto the dock which extends through the space joining the main building and the earlier Tiaro building. This elevation is distinguished by a glazed semi-circular window within the stepped parapet. The south-west elevation has three blind bays and a blind semi-circular window within the parapet. The south-east elevation is part concrete and part timber framed clad with corrugated metal sheeting and houses a large modern roller door. The roof is framed with steel trusses and the ceiling is lined with a particle board sheeting joined with cover strips. The shed has a concrete floor throughout and a raised concrete dock (parts covered with red tiles) runs around the north-east and north-west sides. A narrow roof vent with fixed glazed windows and timber louvres runs along the ridge. A concrete loading dock sheltered by a metal awning supported by metal posts runs along the north-west side of the buildings to the Macalister Street yard, from the southern corner of the main building (1929) to the northern corner of the earlier former Tiaro butter factory building. Siding railway tracks from the nearby Kilkivan/Kingaroy line run parallel to the dock. = Former Tiaro butter factory structures = Timber framed and clad and sheltered by gable roofs clad with corrugated iron, the two rectangular structures surviving from the former Tiaro butter factory stand to the Macalister Street yard of the complex south-east of the modern besser block shed standing to the north corner. Facing north-west, the northern building is distinguished by a narrow blind roof vent running along the ridge while the southern building has a narrow ridge roof vent with fixed timber louvres. These structures accommodate a number of spaces associated with dairy product processing including cold and salt rooms and are composed of brick and concrete partitions and posts, timber floors, and concrete floors and ceilings. Some rooms have coved ceilings of a particle board sheeting joined with cover strips. Modern cold rooms and laboratory facilities occupy the northern part of the former external dock to Macalister Street. The space between the earlier Tiaro buildings and the main building (1929) is sheltered by a skillion roof and is open to the dock. = Other earlier structures = Other earlier structures associated with butter and milk product processing include a rectangular timber shed to the McLucas Street side and a small timber shed with twin gable roofs standing south of the stack.  Plant Room  A rectangular steel framed and concrete shed sheltered by a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting, the plant room stands to the middle of the site. The south-west wall is concrete with a corrugated iron gable infill; the concrete block north-east wall has a fibrous cement sheet gable infill and the side walls are concrete to half height, the balance clad with corrugated iron. The interior concrete walls are plastered and painted, a dado line separating the upper and lower portions. A concrete floor runs throughout and low concrete upstands accommodate various pieces of machinery. The timber framed roof is unlined and accommodates a narrow ridge vent with fixed glazed windows and timber louvres. Two large 20-light steel framed windows punctuate the north-west wall and a double timber door opens to the south-east. A later cold room extension sheltered by a skillion roof sits off the south-east side. An array of plant including engines, pulleys and belts, pipes, gauges, valves, exhaust fans and equipment associated with the ammonia chilling process is accommodated in the shed.  Boiler shed and stack  Two cylindrical metal boilers with brick fireboxes framed with steel strapping are housed in a rectangular timber framed shed sheltered by a hipped roof and clad with corrugated iron. The fireboxes have metal fronts with a number of hatch openings. Each firebox connects by a brick tunnel to the stack standing to the south-east. A concrete floor runs throughout the shed and there is a short run of trolley rails adjacent to the fireboxes. The south-west elevation is relieved by three large unglazed window openings. The shed accommodates plant and equipment associated with the boilers including ladders, gantries, pipes and valves. The tall brick stack is square in plan, tapers to the top, and is bound by metal strapping. The stack is distinguished by stepped cornices to the plinth and crown.  Modern structures  Three later besser block buildings associated with the dairy processing business - one to the north corner of the site and two south-east of the former Tiaro structures - are not considered to be of heritage significance. The site accommodates a number of recent structures that relate to the present wine making business including tanks and storage and cold rooms which are not of heritage significance.  Heritage listing  South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory (former) in Murgon, a site used for dairy production from 1913 to 1995, is important in demonstrating the growth and evolution of the Queensland's dairy industry during the twentieth century. The factory was one of Queensland's largest butter producers during the dairying boom of the interwar period and throughout its history was one of the Wide Bay-Burnett's largest and most important dairy manufacturing outlets. The remaining fabric of the Tiaro butter factory (1908) shifted to Murgon in 1913, reflects the rapid increase in dairy farming in the South Burnett region in the early 1900s, while the 1929 extension of the factory, illustrates the response to the ongoing expansion of cream production and the adoption of modern manufacturing processes in Queensland butter factories during the interwar period. Adaptations and additions to the factory from the 1940s onwards reflect the shift from concentrating on butter manufacturing to processing cheese and milk products, in response to the changing market requirements of Queensland's dairy industry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd Factory (former) is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics and processes of a dairy factory. The place is situated adjacent to a railway line, formerly served by a siding to enable transportation of its products. The internal arrangement of interconnected buildings incorporate loading areas for receiving dairy supplier's produce, large rooms used at different periods of its history to manufacture butter, milk and cheese products, and cold storage and packing areas. The 1929 engine room and its remaining fittings (ammonia compressor and piping), and other extant elements of the factory's plant (large brick chimney, boilers, sheds) demonstrate the industrial requirements of the complex over time.

He continues his duties as part of the Staffordshire Regimental Association. The same name has been given to a succession of Staffordshire Bull Terriers ‚Äì to date, six. Background Watchman VI. A similar image is taken of each new Watchman. Watchman is gifted by the people of Burton-on-Trent to the Staffordshire Regimental Association, previously the Staffordshire Regiment. Previously, dogs also paraded with the West Midlands Regiment and related reserve regiments. The mascots' family line comes from Cannock, in Staffordshire. The Regiments of Staffordshire have had a Staffordshire Bull Terrier as their mascot since 1882. The Watchman name is a more recent addition to the tradition, started after the Second World War. There have been five Watchman since 1949, the current mascot is LCpl Watchman VI, who took up his duties on 5th March 2019. Watchman has been a popular mascot of the Staffordshire Regiment and has attracted much public interest. The mascot holds the Freedom of many Staffordshire towns (or boroughs) including Tamworth and Newcastle under Lyme boroughs. Each successive mascot carries the name Watchman. When a mascot dies or a handler retires, another Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy is chosen to replace him. When a Watchman passes away, they are buried with full military honours in St Edwards Square in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. Since the Staffordshire Regiment was disbanded and merged into the Mercian Regiment in 2007, he started carrying out his duties as mascot to the Staffordshire Regimental Association and the Staffordshire Regiment Museum. To maintain the link with the Mercian Regiment Watchman would also join the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (STAFFORDS) at public events and parades. Watchman is classified as a regimental pet and was not recognised by the Army or the Mercian Regiment. Since he is an unofficial mascot, his upkeep is paid for by the Staffordshire Regimental Association, not by the government or Mercian Regiment. Watchman attends events featuring the Staffordshire Regimental Association, where he has been invited by the parade organisers, or where he has been granted Freedom of the town or village. However, he also attends many public events, military ceremonies and regimental funerals in his own right. History The tradition of the Regiments of Staffordshire having a Staffordshire Bull Terrier as a mascot started in the 19th century. In 1882 The South Staffordshire Regiment received orders to march with Lord Wolseley to the relief of General Gordon, under siege in Khartoum. The Regiment boarded trains in Cairo with their Staffordshire Bull Terrier, \\"Boxer\\". However, as the train began to move the startled Boxer leaped to the tracks and was last seen by the men lying dead or unconscious. The regiment reached Assiut where they waited several days for orders for the final phase of their march, at which point Boxer staggered into the camp looking very thin and exhausted. He collapsed at the men's feet, having walked over 200 miles through the desert along the rail tracks to get back to his regiment. It was then that the regiment adopted the tradition of a Bull Terrier as a mascot. After the Second World War, the tradition began of giving the mascot the name \\"Watchman\\". =Watchman I= The first Watchman was presented to the 6th Battalion the North Staffordshire Regiment in 1949. They received their new mascot for being the highest recruited infantry battalion in the Territorial Army. Watchman I was all white. Watchman began his duties and accompanied the regiment to the Royal Tournament in Olympia on 25 May 1949. Watchman I showed little interest in the event until the band and drums struck up and began playing. Upon hearing this Watchman I raised his head and began to march to wide public applause. Over the next ten years of service, Watchman I took part in every parade with the battalion. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen during a royal visit to Burton-on-Trent on 28 March 1957. Watchman I died in 1959 and was buried in King Edward Square Burton-on- Trent, the future burial ground of Watchman II, III and IV. =Watchman II= The popular public affection for Watchman I, along with the established tradition, interest and popular feeling of the people of Burton towards him resulted in Watchman II being presented to the Regiment in September 1960. Watchman II was a gift from the town of Burton upon Trent at a civic parade. Watchman II marched at the head of the battalion for the next six years. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the Presentation of New Colours to the 6th North Stafford's and 5th South Stafford's, and a Guidon to the Staffordshire Yeomanry at Molineaux in the early 1960s. Watchman II took part in the Honorary Colonels Parade held at St Martins Camp in 1966, which was to be his last parade. In 1967 the County Territorial Army Regiments were reformed. This meant Watchman II went into retirement until his death in 1974, aged fourteen years old. He was buried alongside Watchman I in St Edwards Square, with a commemorative plaque placed onsite. =Watchman III= Following the death of Watchman II, the regimental family felt that the time honored tradition mascot should continue. After a search to find a dog of the correct pedigree the town of Burton upon Trent again presented the Regiment with a new mascot, Watchman III, in 1988. Watchman III went on to serve until his death 1998. He was buried alongside Watchman I and Watchman II in St Edwards Square, Burton upon Trent. =Watchman IV= Watchman IV was presented to the Staffordshire Regiment in August 1998. He was a gift from the Friends of the Staffordshire Regiment. Watchman IV paraded with the 1st Battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment and the West Midlands Regiment. His handler was Sgt Malcom Bower. Watchman IV appeared at remembrance day parades in London and the Service of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey. At this event he was introduced to HM The Queen. He participated in the Tercentenary Celebration in 2005 and Watchman IV was again was introduced to HM The Queen at the Stafford's 800th anniversary celebrations in 2006. Watchman IV attracted such attention when his handler took him for a walk through the streets of London. A coach full of tourists pulled up and leapt off the vehicle to photograph him. Watchman IV was carried forward when the Battalion joined the Mercian Regiment on 1 September 2007 and became the mascot of the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (STAFFORDS). He retired on 4 October 2009 after 10 years of military service. He was replaced by a young Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Watchman V, in a ceremony at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in Whittington, on 5 October 2010. Watchman IV was buried with full military honours in St Edwards Square in Burton upon Trent on 5 December 2013. He rests along previous Watchman I, II and III.https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/449672/A-hero-s-farewell-for-Stormer- the-special-dog-of-war =Watchman V= Watchman V took over duties on 5 October 2009. He carried out his duties as part of the 3rd Battalion (STAFFORDS) of the Mercian Regiment, until it was withdrawn in 2013. He then took out duties as part of the Staffordshire Regimental Association. Watchman V's handler is Greg Hedges. Due to the widespread use of social media, he has become the biggest profile Watchman to date, amassing nearly 20,000 followers on Facebook. Sgt Watchman V at the Field of Remembrance, Westminster Abbey, Thursday 10 November 2016. He attends regimental events, military parades, remembrance ceremonies and national events such as the Garden of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey. Watchman V has been presented to HRH Prince Harry at the Garden of Remembrance in Westminster Abbey. He has also been introduced several times to HRH Prince Philip at the Garden of Remembrance in Westminster Abbey. He proved to be a very popular mascot and was awarded Freedom of numerous villages and several towns in Staffordshire, most notably Tamworth Borough in 2014 and Newcastle under Lyme Borough in 2016. He also holds the Freedom of Uttoxeter, Heath Hayes and Wilmblebury, and Hednesford. As part of the Regimental Association he also holds freedom of many other places such as Cannock, and Hanley, in Stoke on Trent. The granting of Freedom to Watchman and his handler by several major towns in Staffordshire was part of a campaign by Staffordshire politicians, led by Cllr Robert Pritchard of Tamworth Borough Council, to ensure the Watchman tradition continues, now the 3rd Battalion of the Mercian Regiment (STAFFORDS) had been withdrawn and the Staffordshire Regiment has been disbanded. Such was the pride and affection for Watchman, the Staffordshire civic community wanted to ensure he could continue to parade with the Mercian Regiment in their own towns, as he is not their official mascot. Cllr Robert Pritchard was made an honorary member of the Staffordshire Regiment for his work on this, and other welfare projects, he has done for the regiment, and is entitled to wear the regiments tie, the highest honour a regimental association can bestow on a civilian. In 2016 Watchman was entered into the \\"Westminster Dog of the Year\\" competition by Staffordshire MPs Amanda Milling, Christopher Pincher, Jeremy Lefory, Andrew Griffiths, Gavin Williamson, Michael Fabricant. It was the first time a military mascot has been entered into the competition. The MPs organised a public campaign to help Watchman V win the public vote element of the competition. The final was held in Victoria Tower Gardens on Thursday 8 September. Sgt Watchman V won the public vote in the competition and was crowned the 2016 competitions \\"paw- blic\\" vote winner. In October 2016 Watchman V's handler, Greg Hedges, was shortlisted for the Express & Star \\"Big Thank You\\" awards in the Ambassador of the year category. The winner, chosen by a public vote, was announced in February 2017. Watchman won his category. At the Field of Remembrance ceremony held at Westminster Abbey on 10 November 2016, Watchman was introduced to HRH Prince Harry and HRH Prince Philip. Watchman and his handler also featured in the Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance event, broadcast on BBC1, broadcast on Saturday 12 November. This was on a section covering the experiences of soldiers from the Staffordshire Regiment in the 1st Gulf War. Watchman V currently holds the rank of Colour Sergeant. He was promoted to sergeant as part of the 2015 St Georges Day celebration held in Tamworth Castle Grounds and Colour sergeant on 21 December 2017 at the Kings Head Pub in Lichfield, as part of the Ferozeshah day celebrations. A project has been launched to build a life-size bronze statue as a tribute to the Watchman, their handlers and the Staffordshire Regimental family. There is a range of merchandise made in him image for sale at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum, which include soft toys, keying's, pin badges and mugs. Watchman also has a Facebook page, Twitter and website. The Facebook page is www.facebook.com/watchmanstaffordshire and his Twitter page is www.twitter.com/watchmanmascot and website is www.watchmanv.co.uk. Watchman V formally semi-retired on 5th March due to ill health and most of his role was taken over by Watchman VI. Watchman V lives with his handler and Watchman VI, he is frequently featured on his social media pages with Watchman VI and also attends some events and parades. =Watchman VI= Watchman VI was presented to the regimental association in September 2018. He is a cousin of Watchman V and took over most duties from his predecessor on 5th March 2019. He was promoted to Lance Corporal on 5th March 2020 st Swynnerton Training Camp by the Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire Ian Dudson and consort Jane Dudson. https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/introducing-watchman- vi-new-mascot-2012264  References  Military history of Staffordshire British mascots ","title":"Watchman (mascot)"},{"id":"51425643","text":"Gino Charlvic Pandent Wilson (born ) is a Namibian rugby union player, currently playing with the Namibia national team and the in the South African Currie Cup competition.

The theorem is due to Sergei Adian (1955)S. I. Adian, Algorithmic unsolvability of problems of recognition of certain properties of groups. Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR vol. 103, 1955, pp. 533‚Äì535 and, independently, Michael O. Rabin (1958).Michael O. Rabin, Recursive unsolvability of group theoretic problems, Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 67, 1958, pp. 172‚Äì194 Markov property A Markov property P of finitely presentable groups is one for which: #P is an abstract property, that is, P is preserved under group isomorphism. #There exists a finitely presentable group A_+ with property P. #There exists a finitely presentable group A_- which cannot be embedded as a subgroup in any finitely presentable group with property P. For example, being a finite group is a Markov property: We can take A_+ to be the trivial group and we can take A_- to be the infinite cyclic group \\\\mathbb{Z}. Precise statement of the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem  In modern sources, the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem is usually stated as follows:Roger Lyndon and Paul Schupp, Combinatorial group theory. Reprint of the 1977 edition. Classics in Mathematics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2001. ; Ch. IV, Theorem 4.1, p. 192G. Baumslag. Topics in combinatorial group theory. Lectures in Mathematics ETH Z√ºrich. Birkh√§user Verlag, Basel, 1993. ; Theorem 5, p. 112Joseph Rotman, An Introduction to the Theory of Groups, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 4th edition; ; Theorem 12.32, p. 469 Let P be a Markov property of finitely presentable groups. Then there does not exist an algorithm that, given a finite presentation G=\\\\langle X \\\\mid R\\\\rangle, decides whether or not the group G defined by this presentation has property P. The word 'algorithm' here is used in the sense of recursion theory. More formally, the conclusion of Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem means that set of all finite presentations :\\\\langle x_1, x_2, x_3, \\\\dots \\\\mid R\\\\rangle (where x_1, x_2, x_3, \\\\dots is a fixed countably infinite alphabet, and R is a finite set of relations in these generators and their inverses) defining groups with property P, is not a recursive set. Historical notes The statement of the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem generalizes a similar earlier result for semigroups by Andrey Markov, Jr.,A. Markov, \\"–ù–µ–≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ñ–º–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —Å–≤–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤ –∞—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º\\" [The impossibility of algorithms for the recognition of certain properties of associative systems]. Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR vol. 77, (1951), pp. 953‚Äì956. proved by different methods. It was also in the semigroup context that Markov introduced the above notion that that group theorists came to call the Markov property of finitely presented groups. This Markov, a prominent Soviet logician, is not to be confused with his father, the famous Russian probabilist Andrey Markov after whom Markov chains and Markov processes are named. According to Don Collins, the notion Markov Property, as defined above, was introduced by William Boone in his Mathematical Reviews review of Rabin's 1958 paper containing Rabin's proof of the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem. Idea of the proof In modern sources, the proof of the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem proceeds by a reduction to the Novikov‚ÄìBoone theorem via a clever use of amalgamated products and HNN extensions. Let P be a Markov property and let A_+, A_- be as in the definition of the Markov property above. Let G=\\\\langle X \\\\mid R\\\\rangle be a finitely presented group with undecidable word problem, whose existence is provided by the Novikov‚ÄìBoone theorem. The proof then produces a recursive procedure that, given a word w in the generators X\\\\cup X^{-1} of G, outputs a finitely presented group G_w such that if w=_G 1 then G_w is isomorphic to A_+, and if w e_G 1 then G_w contains A_- as a subgroup. Thus G_w has property P if and only if w=_G 1. Since it is undecidable whether w=_G 1, it follows that it is undecidable whether a finitely presented group has property P. Applications The following properties of finitely presented groups are Markov and therefore are algorithmically undecidable by the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem: #Being the trivial group. #Being a finite group. #Being an abelian group. #Being a finitely generated free group. #Being a finitely generated nilpotent group. #Being a finitely presentable solvable group. #Being a finitely presentable amenable group. #Being a word-hyperbolic group. #Being a torsion-free finitely presentable group. #Being a polycyclic group. #Being a finitely presentable group with a solvable word problem. #Being a finitely presentable residually finite group. #Being a finitely presentable group of finite cohomological dimension. #Being an automatic group. #Being a finitely presentable simple group. (One can take A_+ to be the trivial group and A_- to be a finitely presented group with unsolvable word problem whose existence is provided by the Novikov-Boone theorem. Then Kuznetsov's theorem implies that A_- does not embed into any finitely presentable simple group. Hence being a finitely presentable simple group is a Markov property.) #Being a finitely presentable group of finite asymptotic dimension. #Being a finitely presentable group admitting a uniform embedding into a Hilbert space. Note that the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem also implies that the complement of a Markov property in the class of finitely presentable groups is algorithmically undecidable. For example, the properties of being nontrivial, infinite, nonabelian, etc., for finitely presentable groups are undecidable. However, there do exist examples of interesting undecidable properties such that neither these properties nor their complements are Markov. Thus Collins (1969) Donald J. Collins, On recognizing Hopf groups, Archiv der Mathematik, vol. 20, 1969, pp. 235‚Äì240. proved that the property of being Hopfian is undecidable for finitely presentable groups, while neither being Hopfian nor being non- Hopfian are Markov.

She, with John P Cole, was one of the first to produce a book on quantitative methods in geography.  Early life and education  Born into an educated family, her father was the geologist W.B.R. King. She studied at Cambridge University and earned her bachelor's degree in geography in 1942. She then joined the Women's Royal Naval Service and became a meteorologist and surveyor for the duration of World War II. After her service, she returned to Cambridge and researched sand movement on beaches, earning her doctorate in 1949.  Career and research  King spent her career studying the influence of glaciers on landscape evolution, an offshoot of her doctoral work, which continued throughout her career. She went on expeditions to Skaftafell in Iceland in 1953 and 1954 to study the glaciers there. It was unusual at that time for young women to be allowed to participate in fieldwork in such remote, rudimentary areas of Iceland.Jack D Ives, Skaftafell In Iceland, A Thousand Years of Change, pg. 101 - 143, (Ormsunga, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2007, ) The expeditions resulted in a series of papers in 1955 and 1956. Because of her gender, her participation in fieldwork trips was discouraged. However, she participated in research on Baffin Island in the 1960s and the Austerdalsbreen glacier in Norway, and led fieldwork expeditions of her own throughout the Arctic. She published several books throughout her career, including 1973s Beaches and Coasts, the first book published to offer an overview of coastal geomorphology. In 1959, King began teaching at the University of Nottingham, where she remained for the rest of her career. She became a professor in 1969, after several delays in her promotion due to discrimination. King was one of the earliest women to become a professor of geography in the United Kingdom, and she retired in 1982. Cuchlaine King was honoured with the David Linton Award of the British Society for Geomorphology in 1991.  Legacy  The University of Nottingham has named geography laboratories in King's honour.

Tradition holds that the ktitor was a Patriarch Nichifor, who had come from the Orient and settled in Ia»ôi; however, no document or inscription confirms this. The church was associated with two guilds: pastry makers and bragƒÉ sellers. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site During the 18th century, the spire supports were repaired, and further renovation occurred the following century. Nevertheless, it was in ruins by 1902, when a thorough repair took place. The church was affected by the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, and restored in 1982-1983. In 1992, the church was given over to the local Greek students' association and served by priests who knew Greek; the students carried out repairs three years later. In 2006, with the number of Greek students much reduced, the church was made a chapel of the Metropolitan Cathedral. In 2010, it became a parish church. Short history at the Presentation of Mary parish site The church owns old books and an icon from 1824. A princely school once functioned near the church.

Overview  The film follows students into the classrooms of High Tech High, a public charter school in San Diego, California. The film combines commentary by a variety of people and follows two groups of ninth graders over the course of a year. The director's experiences with his daughter's school shape the opening to the film and inform his approach to the content and pedagogy of High Tech High. The film takes a closer look at the experiences of several individual students enrolled at the school.  Release  Responses to the film were mixed. A columnist from Education Week, David B. Cohen encourages people to see the film but raises concerns about the single narrative presented in the film. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Glenn Heath, Jr. remarked the movie is \\"an engaging look\\" at 21st-century education but acknowledges the uncertainty the model offers. A classroom teacher who attended a screening of the film described the film as a \\"paid informational\\" for a particular approach to curriculum design. Following the film's premiere, Executive Producer Ted Dintersmith took the film on a 50-state tour, screening the film for learning communities across the country. Following his tour, Dintersmith released a new book, What School Could Be: Insights and Inspiration from Teachers Across America. In July 2019, the film was made available on numerous streaming platforms, including free streaming for Amazon Prime members.  Education history  A central theme of the film is based on the need for disruption. This disruption is needed, according to the producers and director of the film, because American education hasn't changed in more than a century. In effect, the film is advocating the misleading \\"factory model\\" theory related to the evolution of American public education. This claim has been refuted by multiple education historians. There are multiple inaccurate statements in the film and the book it is based on. These include: * The film narration at 0:11:23 says prior to Prussia's actions around public education, formal education primarily consisted of \\"smart people, sitting around talking to other smart people.\\" The rise of the common school movement, of which Mann was an advocate, is generally recognized as beginning in the 1830s, before Mann went to Prussia. As an example, Pennsylvania's free school law, An Act to Establish a General System of Education by Common Schools, was passed on April 1, 1834. * At 0:12:23, the voice over says Horace Mann was \\"stunned. Inspired by what he sees [in Prussia], he brings these educational ideas back to the US where it captures the attention of [Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and J.P. Morgan.]\\" At the time of his return from his trip to Prussia in 1843, Ford was not yet born, Carnegie was still living in Scotland and 9 years old, Morgan was 7. While Vanderbilt was 50 years old, he was not explicitly involved in education until the late 1860s when he made a donation to his wife's cousin's husband that would lead to the creation of Vanderbilt University. *The idea at 0:12:05 of teaching \\"math in one room, science in another, language skills in yet another\\" is described as \\"totally new.\\" This is misleading on two accounts. First, Edward Krug's survey of the history of the American High School identifies 1880 to 1920 as the era that gave rise to the shape and structure seen today, not the 1840s. Second, the idea of different professors or teachers specializing in different content areas was already familiar to American educators before any trips to Prussia. As an example, the Buffalo High School Association was founded in 1827. An ad placed in the Buffalo Emporium and General Advertiser in 1828 extracted the Buffalo High School's by-laws, which included, \\"The principle is to appoint employ such Professors, or Assistant Teachers, in the several Departments, as maybe determined necessary for the good reputation and rapid advancement of the School‚Ä¶ Lectures on Chemistry, Mineralogy, Natural History, Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and other Sciences; will be delivered at the High- School, which the scholars in the Senior Department may attend free of expense.\\"  References   External links  * Official Movie Page * IMDB page Documentary films about education in the United States 2015 films Progressive education ","title":"Most Likely to Succeed (film)"},{"id":"51425876","text":"Pseudobutyrivibrio is a Gram-negative, anaerobic and non-spore-forming bacterial genus from the family of Lachnospiraceae.UniProt References  Further reading  Lachnospiraceae Bacteria genera ","title":"Pseudobutyrivibrio"},{"id":"51425901","text":"Harold Chapman (born 1927) is a photographer noted for chronicling the 1950s in Paris.

The events that contribute to replication stress occur during DNA replication, and can result in a stalled replication fork. There are many events that contribute to replication stress, including: * Misincorporation of ribonucleotides * Unusual DNA structures * Conflicts between replication and transcription * Insufficiency of essential replication factors * Common fragile sites * Overexpression or constitutive activation of oncogenes * Chromatin inaccessibility ATM and ATR are proteins that help to alleviate replication stress. Specifically, they are kinases that are recruited and activated by DNA damage. The stalled replication fork can collapse if these regulatory proteins fail to stabilize it. When this occurs, reassembly of the fork is initiated in order to repair the damaged DNA end.  Replication fork  INO80 stabilizes replication forks and counteracts mislocalization of H2A.Z The replication fork consists of a group of proteins that influence the activity of DNA replication. In order for the replication fork to stall, the cell must possess a certain number of stalled forks and arrest length. The replication fork is specifically paused due to the stalling of helicase and polymerase activity, which are linked together. In this situation, the fork protection complex (FPC) is recruited to help maintain this linkage. In addition to stalling and maintaining the fork structure, protein phosphorylation can also create a signal cascade for replication restart. The protein Mrc1, which is part of the FPC, transmits the checkpoint signal by interacting with kinases throughout the cascade. When there is a loss of these kinases (from replication stress), an excess of ssDNA is produced, which is necessary for the restarting of replication. Replication block removal DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) cause replication stress by blocking replication fork progression. This blockage leads to failure of DNA strand separation and a stalled replication fork. Repair of ICLs can be accomplished by sequential incisions, and homologous recombination. In vertebrate cells, replication of an ICL-containing chromatin template triggers recruitment of more than 90 DNA repair and genome maintenance factors. Analysis of the proteins recruited to stalled replication forks revealed a specific set of DNA repair factors involved in the replication stress response. Among these proteins, SLF1 and SLF2 were found to physically link the SMC5/6 DNA repair protein complex to RAD18. The SMC5/6 complex is employed in homologous recombination, and its linkage to RAD18 likely allows recruitment of SMC5/6 to ubiquitination products at sites of DNA damage. =Replication-coupled repair= Mechanisms that process damaged DNA in coordination with the replisome in order to maintain replication fork progression are considered to be examples of replication-coupled repair. In addition to the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, indicated above, multiple DNA repair processes operating in overlapping layers can be recruited to faulty sites depending on the nature and location of the damage. These repair processes include (1) removal of misincoporated bases; (2) removal of misincorporated ribonucleotides; (3) removal of damaged bases (e.g. oxidized or methylated bases) that block the replication polymerase; (4) removal of DNA-protein crosslinks; and (5) removal of double-strand breaks. Such repair pathways can function to protect stalled replication forks from degradation and allow restart of broken forks, but when deficient can cause replication stress.  Causation  Replication stress is induced from various endogenous and exogenous stresses, which are regularly introduced to the genome. These stresses include, but are not limited to, DNA damage, excessive compacting of chromatin (preventing replisome access), over-expression of oncogenes, or difficult-to-replicate genome structures. Replication stress can lead to genome instability, cancer, and ageing. Uncoordinated replication‚Äìtranscription conflicts and unscheduled R-loop accumulation are significant contributors. = Specific events = The events that lead to genome instability occur in the cell cycle prior to mitosis, specifically in the S phase. Disturbance to this phase can generate negative effects, such as inaccurate chromosomal segregation, for the upcoming mitotic phase. The two processes that are responsible for damage to the S phase are oncogenic activation and tumor suppressor inactivation. They have both been shown to speed up the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase, leading to inadequate amounts of DNA replication components. These losses can contribute to the DNA damage response (DDR). Replication stress can be an indicative characteristic for carcinogenesis, which typically lacks DNA repair systems. A physiologically short duration of the G1 phase is also typical of fast replicating progenitors during early embryonic development.  Applications in cancer  Rationale for enhancing replication stress to kill cancer cells Illustration of various approaches to target replication stress for cancer treatment ¬û Normal replication stress occurs at low to mild levels and induces genomic instability, which can lead to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. ¬ûHowever, high levels of replication stress have been shown to kill cancer cells. In one study, researchers sought to determine the effects of inducing high levels of replication stress on cancer cells. ¬ûThe results showed that with further loss of checkpoints, replication stress is increased to a higher level. ¬ûWith this change, the DNA replication of cancer cells may be incomplete or incorrect when entering into the mitotic phase, which can eventually result in cell death through mitotic catastrophe. Another study examined how replication stress affected APOBEC3B activity. ¬ûAPOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3) has been seen to mutate the cancer genome in various cancer types. ¬ûResults from this study show that weakening oncogenic signaling or intensifying DNA replication stress can alter carcinogenic potential, and can be manipulated therapeutically.

It was found along with other Viking objects: a longbow, two spearheads, an axe head and a gaming board. The settlement dates from between the late 9th and early 11th century and the collection of artifacts uncovered appears to fit the profile of a wealthy Irish farmer or of a local ruler. The sword's pommel is coated in a sheet of silver and consists of five distinct sections that slowly rise to a rounded tip in the middle. Below these sections is a band of silver decorated with a recessed pattern of swirls that loop around the pommel. The hilt of the sword is also coated in silver and bears the same swirl pattern as the band on the pommel. There is little doubt but that this was a very high-status object.

It is dedicated to the Three Holy Hierarchs. A new building for the Vasile Lupu Normal School was erected in 1891. This was some 5 km from the city center and its churches, and it was felt that prayer space should exist closer by. Thus, the chapel was built for the students between 1907 and 1911, funded through the state institution Casa Bisericii. The architects also took care of the painting and decoration. The chapel's dedication reflects the fact that the beginning of education in Moldavia was linked to Trei Ierarhi Monastery. The chapel was blessed by Pimen Georgescu, Metropolitan of Moldavia. It was used by the students until 1947 and the establishment of a communist regime. It was then closed down until 1990 when, in the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution, it reopened for services. Since 1995, it serves as a chapel for students from the theological seminary that now occupies the normal school building. At the same time, it is open to normal school students. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The chapel is made of stone and brick, with the two materials alternating on the exterior. The western wall features three painted wooden portraits of the Holy Hierarchs above the entrance, and Saints Peter and Paul on the sides. The dedication plaque is of white marble, dating the construction to 1910. The apses are three-sided on the exterior and semicircular in the interior. The vestibule has a space for the choir, and features portraits of King Carol I and Queen Elisabeth in their role of ktitors. The interior is entirely painted in fresco. The iconostasis is elaborately carved, while the roof is simple. There is no spire, only five large metal crosses on the roof. Repairs were carried out during the 1990s.

In 2001, American Nevada Corporation and Del Webb Corporation formed North Valley Enterprises, which purchased of land in the city and began construction of the community a year later, with the opening held in May 2003. Aliante is located in the city's northwestern area. History Mike Montandon moved to North Las Vegas in 1992, at a time when of land in the city, owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), was labeled for use as a future master-planned community. Montandon became the mayor of North Las Vegas in 1997, and pushed for the land to be sold as one contiguous piece. Approximately were auctioned in May 2001. North Valley Enterprises, a joint-venture affiliate of Del Webb Corporation and American Nevada Corporation, won the auction with a $47.2-million bid, at approximately $25,000 per acre. On August 13, 2002, North Valley Enterprises announced the 1,900-acre Aliante master-planned community. The community was ultimately expected to include 7,500 homes and 20,000 residents. D. R. Horton, KB Home, Pardee Homes and Pulte, four of the top six home builders in the Las Vegas Valley, were scheduled to begin construction on the community's first 1,750 homes in October 2002, with sales starting the following month and a grand opening set for April 2003. Most of Aliante's neighborhoods would be priced between $130,000 and $200,000, while some larger homes, starting at , would sell for $270,000. North Valley Enterprises was required to set aside 22 percent of its property for public and recreation purposes, as part of its development agreement with the North Las Vegas government. The community would include a trail system, a public 18-hole, 6,900-yard golf course, and of park land that would include an amphitheater, soccer fields and tennis and volleyball courts. Montandon said, \\"We had to walk that fine line between how much (land) we leave on the table for the developer and how much do we extract so the community of North Las Vegas benefits 10, 15, 20 years down the road.\\" The community was also to include two elementary schools and a middle school, all of which would be built by the Clark County School District. Property had also been selected for a fire station and a potential library. Aliante was zoned for of commercial property, which included for a hotel and casino to be located at Simmons Street and the Las Vegas Beltway. Montandon was initially against a casino being included in Aliante, but was later convinced that it was a good idea. Prior to Aliante's announcement, North Las Vegas had been considered the Las Vegas Valley's lower-class area, with a reputation for high crime. Groundbreaking took place in August 2002. Aliante celebrated its official grand opening on May 3, 2003. At that time, Kilduff estimated that the community would take approximately five years to be entirely built out, contingent on demand. Aliante's first phase consisted of approximately 1,750 single-family detached homes, ranging from the mid-$100,000s to the upper-$200,000s. By the time of opening, the BLM was planning to auction the remaining over the next several years. Montandon said that Aliante would help retain residents once they become financially successful, saying, \\"One of the problems we have is that people move out of North Las Vegas when they have a little success.\\" Montandon also said that for the first few years, Aliante would likely cost more money than it could generate in taxes: \\"Rooftops are a drain on resources, police, fire and parks. But then come the restaurants and grocery stores.\\" At that time, it was expected that Aliante's casino would not be built for years. Construction began on Aliante's first commercial office building in September 2004, with a scheduled completion date in the second quarter of 2005. At that time, Aliante's first shopping center, anchored by a Smith's grocery store, was set to finish construction by fall 2005. In 2004, Aliante was the sixth top-selling master-planned community in the United States. Among master-planned communities in southern Nevada, Aliante was rated number one for new home closings during the first quarter of 2005, with 355 recorded closings. Aliante later ranked number four on a list of the top five best-selling master-planned communities in 2005, but did not rank on the list for 2006. =Sun City Aliante= Sun City Aliante, an age-restricted 55-plus community by Del Webb, was completed in March 2003, and is located within Aliante. Sun City Aliante was the third best-selling age-restricted community in the Las Vegas Valley during the second quarter of 2003, with 130 closings averaging $181,198.

A member of the Kalbid family, he was active in the wars with the Byzantine Empire in Sicily in the 960s, leading the capture of Taormina and Rometta, which completed the Muslim conquest of Sicily. Some scholars identify him with Abu Muhammad al- Hasan ibn Ali, also known as Ibn Ammar, a leader of the Kutama Berbers and chief minister (wƒÅsi·π≠a) during the first year of the reign of the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (), but this is disputed. Biography Hasan was the son of Ammar ibn Ali al-Kalbi, a member of the Kalbid family, which had come into prominence through Ammar's brother al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi. Along with Ahmad, Ammar fought in the wars with the Byzantine Empire in Sicily and southern Italy, and drowned during an abortive expedition against Otranto in 958. Following the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 960‚Äì961, the Fatimids once more turned their attention to Sicily, where they decided to reduce the remaining Byzantine outposts in the northeast and complete the Muslim conquest of the island. On Christmas Day 962 Hasan and his cousin Ahmad captured Taormina after a siege of seven and a half months, while on 24 August 963 Hasan laid siege to Rometta. The garrison of the latter sent for aid to Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas. The Emperor prepared a major expedition, allegedly 40,000 strong, which arrived in Italy in late 964. Learning of this, Hasan also sought reinforcements, which arrived under the command of his namesake uncle. The Byzantines attempted to relieve Rometta, and on 25 October 964 clashed with Hasan's army. The Byzantines were victorious in the initial engagement, but Hasan managed to rally his men and won a crushing victory. According to al-Maqrizi and Abu'l-Fida, more than 10,000 Byzantines fell, including the Emperor's nephew, Manuel Phokas, and several other commanders. The surviving Byzantines fled in panic, but were badly mauled again when the Arabs caught up with them in a defile (\\"battle of the pit\\", ). The remnants of the Byzantine troops boarded their ships, but the Byzantine fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Straits by Hasan's cousin Ahmad, sealing the fate of Rometta. The city surrendered a few months later, in early 965, after its provisions were exhausted and its inhabitants started fleeing the city. Disputed identity Michael Brett and other scholars identify al-Hasan al- Kalbi with another Ibn Ammar, who in 971 led an army of Kutama Berbers to reinforce the Fatimid troops in Egypt, and who after the death of Caliph al- Aziz Billah () became briefly regent with the title of wƒÅsi·π≠a (\\"intermediary\\"), and led a staunchly pro-Berber regime that antagonized the other factions of the army, until he was overthrown by Barjawan in October 997. Other scholars consider the later Ibn Ammar to have himself been a Kutama Berber leader, under the name of Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Ali.

He taught Classics, English and Comparative Literature at the University of California (Berkeley), Western Reserve, the University at Buffalo and Brown University, as well as at various universities abroad. Early life He spent much of his early childhood in Ohio and in Massachusetts. In the late 1930s, his family moved to Albany and in 1940 settled in Utica, New York. His parents separated when he was fourteen, his mother at first remaining in Utica and later moving to New York City, and his father moving to Boston. A brother, two years his junior, pursued a career in radio. Education While in high school, Albert Cook ran the school's literary magazine, won an Atlantic Monthly student essay prize, and edited an anthology of Utica area poets. Some of his schoolmates, among them Aaron Rosen and Edwin Dolin, remained lifelong friends and collaborators; another, Carol Rubin, eventually became his wife. A gifted linguist from his earliest years, he learned Latin and taught himself Greek in high school; by the time he reached college, he was proficient also in French and German; he later added Hebrew and Russian. At the peak of his career, he spoke four languages and could read ten. In 1943 he enrolled in Harvard College, where John Hawkes and Robert Creeley were among his classmates. His formal studies were chiefly in classics, with Arthur Darby Nock, Werner Jaeger and (above all) John Finley among his teachers. (Finley eventually recommended him for admission to the Harvard Society of Fellows.) He interrupted his undergraduate career in 1943-1944 with a brief stint in the armed services, but was discharged for health reasons after six months. In his senior year, he was awarded the Garrison Prize (Harvard's highest award for a poem by an undergraduate), as well as the Bowdoin Prize in Classical Greek and Latin and the John Osborne Sargent Prize for Latin Translation. He also published various poems under the pen-name of \\"Charles Hamilton Sorley\\". At his Harvard graduation in 1946, he delivered the Latin commencement oration. Rather than proceeding immediately to graduate school, he lived for some months in poverty in the village of Sainte-Rose near Montreal, where he perfected his French and began drafting a series of works, including his first book, The Dark Voyage and the Golden Mean, which was to launch his career. He at this time also experienced a religious awakening which led to his conversion from liberal agnosticism to Anglican Christianity. He returned to Harvard to complete his master's degree, chiefly under the mentorship of the renowned classicist Eric Havelock, and continued as a Harvard Junior Fellow, envisioning an eventual career outside academe as a lone wolf writer of poetry, drama and fiction. A prominent member of a group of young Harvard writers that included L.E. Sissman, Norman Wexler and Richard Wilbur, he founded the little magazine Halcyon (1947-1948), publishing work by himself and his friends alongside contributions from Wallace Stevens, James Merrill, Allen Ginsberg and e.e. cummings. He also began working with Boston's Tributary Theater, which staged his translation of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. In a revised form, this version of the play was several times republished in later years. Elected to the Harvard Society of Fellows, Cook continued to work on a variety of projects, and began publishing work in The Partisan Review. He married Carol S. Rubin on June 19, 1948 and in the following spring took up residence on a Junior Fellow Study Grant in the Saint-Germain neighborhood of Paris. While in France, Cook attended lectures by Merleau-Ponty, Claude L√©vi-Strauss and Jacques Lacan. His three sons were born in the years following his return and in 1951 the family moved to New York City. Still determined to become an independent writer and reluctant to commit to an academic career, Cook supported himself and his family by various odd jobs, from encyclopedia salesman to museum accountant, until fiscal rescue arrived once more in the form of a Fulbright grant to France. Career Financial necessity finally persuaded him to accept the offer of a teaching position in the University of California at Berkeley. Told early on that his contract would not be renewed, he spent the remaining time of his teaching stint in learning Hebrew, before securing another Fulbright Fellowship, this time to Munich. When the Fulbright grant ended a year later, he accepted the offer of an appointment at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. By this time, his works of criticism had gained a substantial reputation; also, his first volume of verse was published by the University of Arizona Press, and several of his plays were performed by experimental theaters in Cleveland and elsewhere. Two years later he was appointed Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford. Meanwhile, in 1963, he assumed the chairmanship of the English Department in the University at Buffalo, a formerly private university which had just then become a flagship research institution of the State University of New York. His mandate was to substantially expand the Buffalo English department (it increased from fifty to almost eighty members in the first five years of his tenure) and to turn it into a cutting-edge, world-class literary institution. He was given free hand to hire and fire, and to bend or break conventional academic rules at his discretion. He used this freedom not only to hire a hugely distinguished faculty (Lionel Abel, C.L. Barber, John Barth, Robert Creeley, Carl Dennis, Irving Feldman, Leslie Fiedler, Ren√© Girard, Mac Hammond, Norman Holland, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Bruce Jackson, John Logan, Ann London Scott, Charles Olson, Bill Sylvester and Dorothy Van Ghent all joined the faculty during his watch), but also to democratize the department by encouraging the breach of conventional barriers among period specialties, or between creative and scholarly, young and old, tenured and untenured, and even teachers and students. His presence was especially strong during the two sensational Buffalo Festivals of the Arts in 1965 and 1967, transpiring during a politically and ideologically explosive decade. He also instituted a vigorous program of illustrious visitorships, usually during the summer sessions, which in the fifteen years of his tenure featured John Berryman, Jorge Luis Borges, Basil Bunting, Anthony Burgess, Kenneth Burke, Noam Chomsky, Leonard Cohen, Robert Duncan, Richard Ellman, William Empson, Henri Foucault, Robert Graves, John Hawkes, Roman Jakobson, Randall Jarrell, Hugh Kenner, Frank Kermode, Doris Lessing, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Howard Nemerov, Frank O‚ÄôHara, John Crowe Ransom, Adrienne Rich, Louis Simpson, Tzvetan Todorov, John Updike, Richard Wilbur, Evgeny Yevtushenko and many others. When a more conservative University administration took over (and the budget began to be squeezed) he continued to give generous support to academically adventurous initiatives that benefited a younger generation of faculty and graduate students destined for distinguished later careers (Robert Hass, John Coetzee, Charles Baxter, Marc Schell, Carol Jacobs, Gerald O'Grady). His reformation of the Buffalo English Department was viewed by many as the single greatest achievement of his career. However, by the late 1970s, increasingly sidelined by an unsympathetic new University administration and hampered by tightening fiscal restraints, he accepted the offer of a distinguished professorship at Brown University, where he taught until his retirement in 1988. As an Emeritus, he kept energetically publishing and guest-lecturing until his sudden death of a heart attack a decade later. The Albert Spaulding Cook Prize at Brown University was established in his honor.

There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Persian, Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, and German. Overview It is estimated that there are 900‚Äì1,200 Greek, 88‚Äì188 German, List of Serbian words of German origin and an uncertain high number of Turkish and Persian loanwords in modern Serbian. History =Proto- Slavic= Ancient Greek words in Proto-Slavic are identified through phonetic features, some related to Greek phonetic history, others possibly Scythian- Sarmatian or Gothic mediations. Ancient Greek, non-mediated words are korablja (ark), koliba (cottage, hut), and supposedly trem (porch); Scythian mediations are luk (onion), haluga (fence), ko≈° (basket), talog (dregs), kurva (whore); supposedly Gothic mediations are crkva (church) and daska (plank). There exists loanwords in Proto-Slavic from non-Indo-European languages. Among Uralic and Turkic lexemes, estimated to have been adopted between the 3rd and 7th century, surviving into modern Serbian are ƒça≈°a (cup), knjiga (book), kovƒçeg (chest), krƒçag (pitcher), sablja (sabre). Adoptions from Avaric in the 6th‚Äì7th centuries are the titles ban and ≈æupan, and klobuk (a type of hat). South Slavic was also influenced by Bulgar since their arrival in the eastern Balkans in the 7th century, e.g. beleg (landmark), beoƒçug (shackle), bubreg (kidney), pa≈°enog (co-brother-in-law), tojaga (bludgeon). =Old Serbian= The South Slavic languages were greatly influenced by Greek beginning in the Early Middle Ages, through translation of Byzantine works, leaving religious, philosophical and psychological terms. Late medieval speech had very few loanwords, rather replacing Greek words with calques for linguistical purity. German linguist Vasmer (1944) recorded 1,000 Greek words in Serbian, most of which were addressed in the Old Serbian form. Today, it is estimated that 900‚Äì1,200 Grecisms (grecizmi) exist in Serbian, more than 400 being in the church-religious section. In the economical section, apart from Greek, many words in Old Serbian were Romance. In mining, the majority of words were Germanic, arriving with Saxons. =Modern history= The Ottoman conquest began a linguistical contact between Turkish and South Slavic; Turkish influence grew stronger after the 15th century. Besides Turkish loanwords, also many Arabic (such as alat, \\"tool\\", sat, \\"time, clock\\") and Persian (ƒçarape, \\"socks\\", ≈°eƒáer, \\"sugar\\") words entered via Turkish, called \\"Orientalisms\\" (orijentalizmi). Also, many Greek words entered via Turkish. Words for hitherto unknown sciences, businesses, industries, technologies and professions were brought by the Ottoman Empire. Christian villagers brought urban vocabulary from their travels to Islamic culture cities. Many Turkish loanwords are no longer considered loanwords. In the 19th and early 20th century Serbian, unlike the Croatian, version of the Serbo-Croat language continuum was much more open to internationalisms (words from Latin and Classical Greek) used in sciences and arts (cf. Serbian istorija vs. Croatian povijest = history and such). =Contemporary situation= English influence is seen in recent times, with the common suffixes -er and -ing., Examples are kasting, ketering, konsalting, listing, d≈æoging, ≈°oping, etc. Foreign loanwords are becoming more frequent in sports terminology. Comparison with other Serbo-Croatian variants The differences between Serbian and Croatian is mainly reflected in loanwords. Bosnian has the most Turkish loanwords of all Serbo-Croatian variants. =Purism= Serbo-Croatian vocabulary is of mixed origin, with words borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, and more recently Russian, Czech and German. Most loanwords have entered Serbian without resistance, while on the other hand in Croatian, linguistic purism was adopted as a policy during Austria-Hungary (against presumed Germanization) and later in Yugoslavia (against presumed Serbian domination). In Croatia, the term \\"Serbisms\\" is used for characteristically Serbian words, unwanted during World War II and the Yugoslav wars, many of which have been replaced by neologisms.

The library is run by a ten member Board of Trustees; each municipality appointing two members. It is a member of the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative. History The idea of a library to serve the residents of the mid-beach communities began at a September 1949 meeting of the Gulf Beach Woman's Club. Under the guidance of the first club president, Mrs. Polly Van Dyke, a committee of six women began to collect books, which finally found a permanent home in 1952, when a one-room building was erected on 140th Avenue in Madeira Beach. The library continued to grow over the next 15 years, and in 1969 a new building was dedicated at the library's present location. In 1988, the library expanded to house its ever- growing collection. A 3,600 square foot space was added to the existing building to create more shelving and reading space, bringing the total square footage of the library to 10,000. In 2008, the library board fired the director of the library. In 2016, the library began work on updating its long range plan.

It is also one of the smallest and most romantic castles. Today it is in private ownership and may not be visited.The castle in Bayern Atlas  History  The hill castle stands at a height of and may have been built around 1486 by Conz of Hirschaid. It was probably originally an allodial estate of the Lords of Hirschaid. Later, feudal sovereignty passed to the Bishopric of Bamberg. In 1525 was destroyed in the Peasants' War. It was immediately rebuilt. In 1607/1608 the Hirschaid family had to sell their barony as they were short of money. On 23 May 1608 Wolf Philipp Gro√ü von Trockau zu T√ºchersfeld was enfeoffed with the castle and lordship. During the Thirty Years' War the castle appears to have been destroyed because in 1636 a modest new structure was built. It was comprehensively renovated between 1707 and 1714. A garden house was probably built at this time, which was converted in 1743 into a castle and village chapel. The Gro√ü von Trockau family, who called themselves from 1658 zu Kohlstein und T√ºchersfeld, had to sell the castle in 1713 to Otto Philipp von Gutenberg. After his death, his niece, Maria Anna Gro√ü von Trockau, inherited the castle and estate. The current structure, a residential building with attached tower, dates mainly to the 18th century. The tower was renovated in 1890. In 1961 the Gro√ü von Trockau family sold the castle, but not its associated chapel. The castle has had several owners since then. Today the castle is protected as listed building no.

The five-volume series was published simultaneously in four languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and English. He has been \\"theologically active\\" on the internet heading-up the team of Koinonia Services, which he founded in April 1993. It is the oldest website on the network to offer on-line a Spanish biblical service and a theological journal. Since 2006 he coordinates the Latino-American Theological Commission of EATWOT, \\"The Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians\\" (also known in Latin America as ASETT) ; this Latin American Theological Commission also is serving during the last two periods as International Theological Commission of EATWOT. He is general editor of \\"VOICES of the Third World\\" ‚Äì the digital theological magazine EATWOT makes available to the general public. With the same publisher ‚Äì Editorial Abyayala, Quito (Ecuador) ‚Äì directs the \\"Axial-Time Collection\\" which publishes \\"avant garde\\" themes e.g. new paradigms: the modern paradigm, the ‚Äúreligious-pluralist vision‚Äù; the baffling perspectives opened by quantum physics, ‚Äúmulti-culturalism‚Äù, process-philosophy, pos- theistic and pos-religious paradigms, the new epistemology, the new paradigm of biblical archaeology, etc. Jos√© Mar√≠a has been the Invited Professor to courses, conferences and symposia in various Latin American universities, such as the Xaveriana in Bogota Colombia, the UNISINOS of S√£o Leopoldo in Brazil, the Catholic University of Belo Horizonte in Brazil, the National University of Costa Rica, ITESO of Guadalajara in Mexico and the system of Jesuit universities in Mexico, the Methodist University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil, and the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico, among others.

For two consecutive terms (1998‚Äì2005) he has been the Secretary General of CICLA, the Latin American International Confederation of the Claretian Congregation, now called MICLA.9 During that time he coordinated the creation and dissemination10 of the Diario B√≠blico in all Latin American countries.  Intellectual theological itinerary  Entering into an adult theological life with the enthusiasm of the Second Vatican Council (1975) and its refurbishing theology, to which had dedicated the early years of his ministry, Jos√© Mar√≠a soon discovered the emerging Latin American \\"Liberation Theology\\" of the 1975's. This enthralled him and led to his being transplanted to Latin America, where he has since lived and been employed. From the privileged vantage point of \\"The Revolutionary Nicaragua\\" he accompanied the avant-gande militant Liberation Theology, the grassroots communities and the Church of the poor, working closely with his friend and claretian companion Pedro Casald√°liga. With the arrival of so-called globalization in the 1990s, and in the third stage of his intellectual journey, Jos√© Mar√≠a also entered the theological field of \\"religious pluralism\\", a new branch of theology in which he has been one of the outstanding Latin Americans authors. Maintaining himself within the theology and the paradigm of liberation, he went on to adopt the well-known \\"Latin American methodology\\" (see > judge > act) that appears in many of his writings. His book \\"Theology of Religious Pluralism\\"‚ÄîA systematic course in popular theology‚Äîhas been hailed by Paul Knitter as the most representative Latin American book on \\"The Theology of Religious Pluralism\\", and has been published in Spanish, Portuguese, English, Italian and German. The book is written not only vis √° vis the academy but also exhibits a strong pedagogical substance making it suitable to be used in the formation of Christian communities. The book advocates a \\"pluralistic re- reading of Christianity.\\" This of course earned for him a doctrinal indictment by two Spanish bishops, and being taken before the Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Spanish Episcopal Conference. The up-shot of it all ultimately led to the imposition on Jos√© Mar√≠a of three years public silence (time now served-out) by the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In recent years, after having participated in the General Congress of the CLAR (Bogot√° 2009), and traversing a fourth stage in his intellectual itinerary, Jos√© Mar√≠a has again broadened his horizon of thought into the expanding world of the \\"sciences of religion\\", paying particular attention to the epistemological changes occurring in the culture: so-called \\"new paradigms\\" being un-covered by the sciences of religion that are currently confronting religions and spirituality, and which many consider to be a \\"new axial time\\" into which we as humanity are shifting. And to this he has devoted his recent years.  Books  * ¬øQu√© queda de la opci√≥n por los pobres?, en: Christus 58 (1993) 6 [667], 7‚Äì19 y en: RELaT 6 * La opci√≥n por los pobres.

History The union was formed in 1874, when the Curtain Lace Trades Society merged with the Levers Lace Trades Society and the Plain Net Trade Society; for many years, the union remained divided into three branches, based on the former societies. It was originally named the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers, and it saw itself as a revival of the Lacemakers' Union, a short-lived society which had affiliated to the National Association for the Protection of Labour in 1831.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B. Smethurst, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.4, pp.350-363 Most of the union's members were in Nottingham and, in the 1890s, it was the largest member of the Nottingham and District Lace Trade Unions Federation. In 1896, the union's general secretary was sacked after he was involved in fraud. He was replaced by William A. Appleton, who ran the union in the style of a guild, with admission fees of up to ¬£15 and benefits including two saloon bars in Nottingham exclusively for members' use, and loans of up to ¬£200 available in order for members to set up their own businesses. Appleton also founded the International Lacemakers' Federation, and affiliated the union to the General Federation of Trade Unions, of which he later became secretary.Alice Prochaska, History of the General Federation of Trade Unions 1899-1980, pp.49-51 Over time, the lace industry became established elsewhere in England, and the union absorbed the Bulwell society, and set up new branches in Beeston, Ilkeston, Southwell and Chard. Membership peaked at 3,361 in 1900, then gradually fell, as the Workers' Union set up rival laceworkers' sections. By 1933, its membership was down to 1,500, but was boosted when the Auxiliary Society of Male Lace Workers and Female Lace Workers' Society merged into it; it adopted a new name as the \\"Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers and Auxiliary Workers\\". In 1963, the union became the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers and Textile Workers, and the membership declined levelled off, leaving it with 1,200 members by the end of the decade. In 1971, it merged into the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers. General Secretaries :1876: G. Marriott, p.97 :1879: S. Varney :1896: William A. Appleton :1907: Charles Wardle :1928: J. T.

It is dedicated to the Annunciation. The original church on the site was made of wood. First mentioned in 1707, it was likely built in the second half of the 17th century. This date derives from the appearance of surviving icons and the fact that the area (known as Muntenimii) was starting to become populated at the time, by craftsmen and Roma. By the later 18th century, documents mentioned the church frequently, highlighting its importance. There is an inscribed cross marking the spot where the altar of this church once stood. It probably lasted around a century and a half, gradually becoming too small for the needs of the area. Eventually, the neighborhood was settled by wealthier people interested in building a larger and prettier church. The present building was constructed by ktitor Ion TƒÉutu, a vornic, and his wife Maria between 1816 and 1818; it was blessed by Metropolitan Veniamin Costache in 1820. The design was inspired by a church in FlƒÉm√¢nzi that TƒÉutu's friend Theodor Bal»ô built in 1813. The old church lasted until the 1821 outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, which had reverberations in Moldavia; Ottoman troops pillaged and destroyed it. History at the Annunciation parish site This is attested by a stone carved in Romanian Cyrillic, located along the northern wall of the present building. According to historian N. A. Bogdan, who wrote at the turn of the 20th century, the foundations were still visible some forty years prior. Another theory holds that the new church was built only after the old one was destroyed, possibly because TƒÉutu was grateful to have avoided execution during the revolutionary upheaval, and because he brought back news that native rather than Phanariote princes would henceforth rule Moldavia. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Distinctive features of the new church include its large and nearly round nave, as well as its small vestibule. There is a noted oil portrait of TƒÉutu in oriental dress with Maria appearing in western style. Another painting, located in the vestibule, commissioned by TƒÉutu's sister and executed in 1829, shows part of 18th-century Ia»ôi in panorama. The roof was redone in the 1850s, and the foyer repaired in 1875. The iconostasis was carved in oak and linden from 1858 to 1860 before being coated in gold and silver leaf. The fresco painting dates to 1859. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the church had several wealthy donors, including Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu (who married in the church), Theodor Pallady and Prince Carol I of Romania. It owned houses, land, money and precious liturgical items. Bishop Meletie Stavropoleos donated five houses for the clergy and staff. From the property income, the parish was able to pay a choir director and soloists. Repairs were carried out from 1975 to 1977, and the walls were repainted from 1978 to 1979. Metropolitan Teoctist ArƒÉpa»ôu blessed the church a second time in 1980. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. Review of General Psychology, 6, 139-152. (see Table 1, p. 142) and Arnold Buss.  Academic career  Zuckerman earned his Ph.D. at New York University in 1954 in clinical psychology. Zuckerman, M. (1954). Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. He then took up a position at Norwich State Hospital in Connecticut where subsequently he was hired at the Institute for Psychiatric Research undertaking personality assessments and where he constructed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (a state-trait self-report measure of anxiety, depression, and hostility).Zuckerman, M., & Lubin, B. (1985). Manual for the Revised Multiple Affect Adjective Check List. San Diego, CA: Educational and Industrial Testing Service. At the Institute, Zuckerman undertook research into anxiety and sensory deprivation (funded by NIMH grants) which ultimately led him to develop his well known Sensation Seeking Scale. Subsequently, in 1969, he accepted an academic position in the Department of Psychology at the University of Delaware, where he spent more than 30 years teaching and undertaking research into sensation seeking and personality. His biochemical, psychophysiological and genetic studies demonstrated that sensation seeking was a major biologically-based trait construct.Zuckerman, M. (2005). The biological basis of personality (2nd edn.). New York: Cambridge. Online Zuckerman, M. (2002). Genetics of sensation seeking. In J. Benjamin, R.P. Epstein, & R.H. Belmaker (Eds.), Molecular Genetics and the Human Personality (pp. 193-210). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing. Also, his research into augmenting/reducing of the cortical evoked potential provided a reliable model of brain functioning in high and low sensation seekers. Zuckerman spent sabbaticals with eminent colleagues Hans Eysenck, Jeffrey Gray, and Robert Plomin, in England, where factor analytic studies showed that a combination of impulsivity and sensation seeking formed a reliable personality dimension. In 1975, Zuckerman commenced a series of presentations at international meetings in Europe. Zuckerman credits Hans Eysenck's work into the biological approach to personality as being inspirational, before spending a year with Hans Eysenck at the Maudsley Hospital in London. He also credits Eysenck for giving him the opportunity to work with David Fulker, and Sybil Eysenck on the genetics of sensation seeking at the Maudsley Institute in London. Zuckerman has written hundreds of highly influential research articles, book chapters, and many prominent books. He also serves on the editorial board of Personality and Individual Differences, which was founded by Hans Eysenck (Editor-in-Chief).  Life  Zuckerman retired in September 2002, aged 74 years and resided in Philadelphia where he wrote journal articles and invited book chapters for international handbooks until shortly before his death.Zuckerman, M.

Sensation seeking  Sensation seeking is described as a personality trait construct that is defined by the search for feelings and experiences that are \\"varied, novel, complex and intense.\\" Zuckerman developed the sensation seeking construct during his tenure at the University of Delaware. His sensation seeking research led him to create a personality instrument called the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) which purports to measure individual differences in terms of their sensory preferences. The Sensation Seeking Scale was designed to measure how much stimulation a person requires and the excitement that is admitted. Zuckerman hypothesized that people who are high sensation seekers require a lot of stimulation to reach their Optimal Level of Arousal. When the stimulation or sensory input is not met, the person finds the experience unpleasant. Zuckerman argues that sensation seeking is one of many \\"core traits\\" that describe human personality, and is independent of other major dimensions of personality (e.g., Extraversion-Introversion, Neuroticism- Stability, and Psychoticism - as measured in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire or EPQ-R).Eysenck, H.J., & Eysenck, S.B.G.

Biography Benjamin Patersen was born in Varberg to a family of customs clerk. Little known of his early years and childhood. He studied Art in G√∂teborg from Simon Fick and soon became a member of local Art Society. In the late 1770s he travelled to Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. From 1774 to 1786 he resided and worked in Riga. In 1787 Patersen came to St Petersburg. According to his ad, given in the ‚ÄòSankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti‚Äô newspaper on the 22 of January, 1787, he stayed in house No. 154 near the Blue Bridge. Patersen got married in 1791 and baptized his daughter in 1795 in the Church of Saint Catherine. He never lost touch with Sweden, it is known that he visited the homeland in 1806. Since 1790 he sent his works to the annual exhibitions at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, in 1798, he was named its member.

Art and Legacy  Though he began as a portraitist, at the age of 38 Patersen concentrated on cityscapes and after move to St Petersburg devoted his art to that city. Around 1800, on a commission by Tsar Paul I, Patersen created a series of works depicting the banks of the Neva, which earned him an appointment as court painter. Most of his cityscapes feature the defined horizon line and bluish of golden tone system, sky and waters of the Neva often play significant roles in the composition. Patersen drew most of the prominent buildings of the late XVIII century Petersburg, including the St. Michael's Castle, the Imperial Academy of Arts, the Tauride Palace, etc. Patersen created over 100 of Petersburg's cityscapes; 33 in oil, the rest watercolours or tinted engravings. Collectively, they represent an irreplaceable historical record of the city as it was at that time. Most of his works are currently held by the Hermitage.

Schmidt, published in 2011. It is a companion to Schmidt's 2007 novel The Wednesday Wars and features one of its supporting characters, Doug Swieteck. Plot summary Douglas \\"Doug\\" Swieteck is a fourteen-year-old boy living somewhere on Long Island in 1968 during the Vietnam War. After Doug's dad is fired for mouthing off to his boss, the Swietecks move to the small town of Marysville, NY, where Doug feels out of place and unwelcome. In Marysville, Doug is fascinated by The Birds of America, a book illustrated by John James Audubon, on display under glass at the local library. Doug starts to learn how to draw, starting with a copy of Audubon's Arctic Tern under the tutelage of Mr. Powell, a librarian. Doug also meets a girl named Lillian \\"Lil\\" Spicer, on whom he eventually has a crush. Lil's father owns a deli, and hires Doug as a delivery boy, which lets him get to know other residents of Marysville. Around Christmas, Doug's oldest brother Lucas returns home from Vietnam with permanent injuries, and Doug helps him adjust. As the novel progresses, Doug faces issues such as his father's abuse, problems at school, and the illness of his friend, with maturity and confidence that he develops through learning to draw and his interactions with the townsfolk. Chapters Each chapter is named for a different plate from The Birds of America.

Critical reception  Writing for The New York Times, author Richard Peck said the novel \\"is crowded with more incident and empowerment than any eighth-grade year or novel can quite contain\\" but praised its emotional weight. Augusta Scattergood, reviewing for the Christian Science Monitor, called the novel \\"often heartbreaking but always funny\\" and the audience \\"will also have discovered something important about the capacity for love and the power of resiliency\\" by the end of the novel. =Awards= Okay for Now was on The New York Times Best Seller list and an Amazon Book of the Year. The book also was a Children's Choice award winner. The novel was named a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature in October 2011.

It was built in 1428 and it was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, but it was modified over subsequent centuries and rededicated to Saint Augustine of Hippo. Most of the church was destroyed in a series of earthquakes in 2016‚Äì17.  History  The church was built by the Augustinians in 1428, and it was originally dedicated to Saint Nicholas. A plaque on the fa√ßade states that the building's architect was Giovanni dell'Amatrice. The church was built near the Porta Carbonara and Amatrice's town walls. The church was rededicated to Saint Augustine of Hippo in the 18th century. In 1580 and again in 1781, the interior and part of the old apse were destroyed by fire, and repair works continued until the 19th century. In 1845, the vault was considered to be unsafe so it was demolished. At this point, the church's interior was whitewashed. The small bell, which weighs , was recast by the foundry Pasquale della Noce in 1821. The largest bell of was retouched by maestro di campane Nicola Marinelli di Gagliano in 1821. The bell tower was restored in 1825 and 1854, since it was in danger of collapsing. Three frescoes, two of which dated back to the 15th century, were discovered within the church in 1894. The rectangular window on the fa√ßade was replaced by a rose window in the early 1930s. The fa√ßade and bell tower were restored later on in the century. The damaged church in 2016, before more parts of it collapsed The church was severely damaged during an earthquake which hit Central Italy on 24 August 2016, when part of the roof and the upper half of the fa√ßade including the rose window collapsed. The remaining parts of the church were further damaged in the January 2017 Central Italy earthquakes, and the bell tower collapsed on 18 January, while the right wall of the church collapsed on 29 January. Only the portal and the left wall of the church remain standing.  Architecture  The church's portal The church's fa√ßade was built out of local sandstone. The lower part of the fa√ßade had a late Gothic‚ÄìRomanesque marble portal with the main entrance. The capitals contained representations of a bear and a caryatid. The lunette was decorated by sculptures of the Madonna and the archangel Gabriel, but these were stolen in the 20th century. The date A.D. MCCCCXXVIII (1428) and the coat of arms of Amatrice could be found on the portal's architrave. The upper part of the fa√ßade, which has been destroyed in the 2016 earthquake, was modified according to Renaissance principles. It originally had a rectangular window, but this was replaced by a rose window in the 1930s. A plaque with the old coat of arms of the church and a Latin inscription commemorating the building's architect was found on the right hand side of the fa√ßade, below the rose window. A pair of large oblong windows could be found on each side of the church. A bell tower and the medieval Porta Carbonara stood to the rear of the church. The church's interior dated back to the 18th century, and it had only a few elements of note. The following frescoes were found on the left side: * l'Annunciazione (the Annunciation) ‚Äì dated 1491, probably the work of Carlo Crivelli but sometimes alternatively attributed to * Madonna in trono con il Bambino (Enthroned Madonna and Child) ‚Äì dated 1497. It was painted on an earlier fresco, parts of which are still visible before the 2016 earthquake. * Madonna del Rosario (Our Lady of the Rosary) ‚Äì dated much later than the previous two frescoes. A set of bas-relief terracotta Stations of the Cross were found on the right hand side of the church.  Convent  An Augustinian convent which dated back to at least the late 13th century originally stood near the church. It was closed in 1809, at the same time when the Archive and the Library were destroyed. It was in a state of disrepair by 1824, and attempts to convert it for public use such as a prison or hospital in 1836 were unsuccessful. The convent was used as a barn and slaughterhouse, before being completely demolished. No remains have survived today.

She was a pioneer in the genetic analysis of bacteriophages and contributed to the early development of molecular biology. Biography After earning her matura in classics at the T√∂chterschule in Z√ºrich, Grete Gujer studied chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. There, she met Eduard Kellenberger, a physics student. The couple married in 1945. In 1946 they moved to Geneva, where Eduard Kellenberger began his doctoral work thesis under the supervision of Jean Weigle, professor of physics at the University of Geneva. Grete Kellenberger contributed to the development of new methods to prepare and analyse biological samples using an electron microscope, a new technique at the time. After Jean Weigle left for the California Institute of Technology in 1948, Grete Kellenberger took on an increasingly important role in the study of lambda phage and its mutations at the University of Geneva. Her collaboration with Jean Weigle, who returned to Geneva every summer, is demonstrated their by regular correspondence archived at Caltech and by numerous publications. It was Grete Kellenberger who gave Werner Arber, who carried out his PhD between 1954 and 1958, the conceptual basis and practices for his future studies in the genetics of bacteriophages. Grete Kellenberger published several articles with Arber between 1957 and 1966. Grete Kellenberger's major scientific contribution was the discovery that recombination is due to a physical exchange of DNA, and not to selective replication. An article on this subject authored by Grete Kellenberger, Maria Ludovica Zichichi, and Jean Weigle was published in the same issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) as the article from Meselson and Weigle on the topic. However, although the data for Grete's article were obtained using a more original approach and were ready months before experiments were concluded in Meselson's laboratory, Grete's article appeared after Meselson's. Maria Ludovica Zichichi worked with Grete Kellenberger from 1960 to 1962, and their collaboration resulted in five publications. In 1965, Grete Kellenberger, her husband Eduard Kellenberger, and members of their research team left for Manhattan, Kansas for a sabbatical year. At Kansas State University, she worked closely with Ulrich Laemmli on phage T4. During this year, Eduard Kellenberger returned to Switzerland without his wife, and they divorced in 1967. Grete Kellenberger-Gujer continued to work in Kansas and later accepted a position as an independent researcher in a lab run by Lucien Caro at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. In 1971, she returned to Geneva and worked in Lucien Caro's lab in the Department of Molecular Biology until her retirement in 1980. From 1971-1975, she worked with Douglas Berg, with whom she shared an interest in genetic analysis of bacteriophages and plasmid lambda dv. She published three articles with Berg.Berg, D., Kellenberger. G, & Caro, L. (1974, January). Regulation of lambda dv plasmid replication. In Experientia (Vol. 30, No. 6, pp. 699-699). Basel, Switzerland: Birkhauser Verlag. She was an atheist and she respected religious believers.  Awards and recognition  In 1979, the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva awarded Grete Kellenberger- Gujer the International Prize Nessim-Habif. An honoris causa doctorate for Grete-Kellenberger was discussed at the University of Geneva, but was never awarded. In 2009, three portraits of Grete Kellenberger-Gujer were created by the Roger Pfund studio and displayed as part of an exhibit commemorating representative individuals from the University of Geneva as part of the university's 450th anniversary.Brigitte Mantilleri, Faces √† faces 06/9.

Bred and owned by Khalid Abdullah he was trained throughout his racing career in England by Barry Hills. As a two-year- old in 1999 he was unbeaten in three races including the Champagne Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes and was the top-rated British-trained juvenile of the season. He began 2000 as the favourite for the 2000 Guineas but after losing his unbeaten record in the Greenham Stakes he was well-beaten in the Newmarket classic. Later in the year he won the Park Stakes and finished third in the Champion Stakes. He failed to reproduce his best form as a four-year-old but did add one more important victory in the Goffs International Stakes. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, Australia, England and Germany but had no success as a sire of major winners. Background Distant Music is a bay horse with a white sock on his right hind leg, bred in Kentucky by Juddmonte Farms, the breeding organisation of his owner Khalid Abdullah. The colt was sent to race in Europe and was trained throughout his career by Barry Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden in the first half of his racing career by Hills' son Michael. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Abdulah's stallion Distant View who won the Sussex Stakes in 1994. Distant View's other foals have included Observatory and Sightseek. Distant Music's dam Musicanti raced in France and the United States, winning one of her twelve races. She was a granddaughter of Sister Shannon, an American broodmare who produced Temperence Hill and was also the female-line ancestor of Vanlandingham and Funny Moon (CCA Oaks). Racing career =1999: two-year- old season= Distant Music began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 28 July in which he started the 8/11 favourite against seven opponents. He started slowly but took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won \\"very easily\\" by four lengths from Eternal Spring with Best of the Bests (later to win the Prix d'Ispahan) in third. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Group Two Champagne Stakes over the same course and distance on 10 September. He was made the 13/8 favourite in a six-runner field with his main rivals appearing to be Ekraar (winner of the Vintage Stakes) and Rossini (Prix Robert Papin). After being restrained by Michael Hills in the early stages he overtook Rossini a furlong and a half from the finish and won in \\"impressive\\" style by two and a half lengths. Barry Hills commented \\"I was very impressed. If anything, he got there a bit too soon, but he has a very good turn of foot... yesterday he had a seedy toe ‚Äì a corn ‚Äì on his near-fore and was slightly lame. It was poulticed and I told my vet the horse would only travel if he thought he was 100 per cent. He didn't travel up here until this morning and it was only at half past six that we took the decision to run him\\". On his final appearance of the season, Distant Music contested Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 16 October. He was made the 4/6 favourite ahead of King's Best, a colt who had won the Acomb Stakes on his previous start. The other three runners were the unbeaten Port Vila, and the Aidan O'Brien-trained pair Brahms (third in the Middle Park Stakes) and Zentsov Street. Distant Music was held up by Hills in the early stages as Zentsov Street set the pace from Brahms before moving up and taking the lead approaching the final furlong. He was pushed out by Hills in the closing stages to defeat Brahms by a length. After the race Barry Hills said \\"He was very impressive when he quickened up at Doncaster on his previous start and he was very impressive at one stage yesterday. He got by them very quickly, but he would have been even better on better ground. I would like to see him in a strongly run race on ground a bit truer than it was at Newmarket. Then we should see a better horse.\\" During the winter of 1999/2000 Distant Music was the ante-post favourite for the 2000 Guineas. =2000: three-year-old season= Distant Music began his second season in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial of the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April. He recovered from a slow start to the lead inside the final furlong but was caught in the last stride and beaten a head by Barathea Guest. Despite his defeat he started 11/2 second favourite for the 2000 Guineas on 6 May but finished eighth of the twenty-seven runners behind King's Best. After a break of four months, Distant Music returned in the Group Three Park Stakes at Doncaster on 7 September. He started the 4/1 third favourite behind the four-year-old Swallow Flight, a Listed race winner who had finished third in the Queen Anne Stakes. The other three runners were Barathea Guest, Valentino (runner-up in the St James's Palace Stakes) and Cape Town (third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas). He was held up by Hills in the early stages before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. He took the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by a neck from Valentino. Khalid Abdullah's racing manager Teddy Beckett commented \\"There has been nothing physically wrong with Distant Music, but he just wasn't right and it was a question of giving him as much time as he needed to come back to form. Barry Hills has done a marvellous job with him\\". On 14 October Distant Music was stepped up in class and distance and started a 20/1 outsider for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. After being held-up towards the rear of the fifteen-runner field he stayed on steadily in the closing stages to finish third behind Kalanisi and Montjeu. For his final appearance of 2000, Distant Music was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 4 November. Ridden by the American jockey Corey Nakatani he was outpaced from the start and finished tenth of the fourteen runners behind War Chant. =2001: four-year-old season= Richard Hughes took over from Michael Hills as Distant Music's regular jockey in 2001. On his seasonal debut he started joint favourite for the Earl of Sefton Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April and finished fourth of the six runners behind the seven- year-old Right Wing. In July the colt was sent to Ireland for the Goffs International Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse and started the 5/4 favourite in a three-runner field. His two opponents were the three- year-old Bonnard (third in the Grand Prix de Paris) and the four-year-old Muakaad (Mooresbridge Stakes). In a change of tactics he led from the start and rallied after being briefly headed by Bonnard two furlongs out. He regained the lead and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from Muakaad, being eased down by Hughes in the final strides. Distant Music failed to win or place in his four remaining races. He finished fifth to Noverre in the Sussex Stakes and fifth again behind Sakhee in the International Stakes at York. In September he attempted to repeat his 2000 victory in the Park Stakes but finished sixth of the eight runners behind Tough Speed. On his final start he was resunited with Michael Hills for the Champion Stakes and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind Nayef. Assessment When the International Classifiaction for the two-year-old on 1999 was released in January 2000, Distant Music was rated the best British-trained colt, five pounds behind the Irish champion Fasliyev and level with Giant's Causeway. Michael Hills described Distant Music as \\"the best two-year-old I've ridden\\". Stud record After his retirement from racing, Distant Music became a breeding stallion at the Morristown Lattin Stud in County Kildare. He also stood at the Yallambee Stud in Victoria, Australia before being transferred to the Hedgeholme Stud in County Durham in 2007. He was subsequently moved to Germany where he was based at the Gestut Helenenhof. He sired numerous minor winners but none of any major significance. The best of his offspring was probably Barongo, who won four races in France.

Identification A. infuscatus is about 10 mm in length and resemble the Arachnospila wasps with which they are often found in appearance and behaviour. The colouring of A. infuscatus is less red than orange and its wing venation also differs from all members of Arachnospila.. Habitat This species prefers moist sandy areas, especially near the coast. Biology Xerolycosa nemoralis, Alopecosa trabalis, Trochosa ruricola and Pardosa monticola spiders are recorded as prey but A. infuscatus is also suspected to feed on other members of the families Lycosidae, Agelenidae and Thomisidae. Adults nectar on Heracleum sphondylium and other members of the Apiaceae. Prey is captured following an active hunt and paralysed within the spider's own burrow or other hiding place, e.g. under a stone while the nest burrow is constructed. The spider is then dragged to the wasp's nest burrow and the wasp begins to construct a cell in which to place the spider. Commencement of cell construction is indicated by the wasp entering and leaving the nesting burrow head first, meaning it can turn around in the burrow. Sometimes the wasp amputates some of the spider's legs before placing into the burrow. The wasp lays its egg on the gaster of the spider. Kleptoparasitic behaviour has been recorded, both intraspecific and from Anoplius concinnus. In the latter case, the A. infuscatus female entered the nest of its congener, destroyed the egg already on the spider and placed one of its own. Interaction with ants can disturb the wasp while it is transporting the prey and this can cause it to hide the prey by placing it higher up in grass. There is also a case of parasitism by the fly of the family Sarcophagidae, probably Sarcophaga socrus, while the spider-wasps Ceropales maculata, Ceropales cribrata and Evagetes argenteodecoratus have been recorded as interspecific kleptoparasites. The flight period in Britain is from June to September and it does not overwinter as an adult.

Greenwich House at 27 Barrow St History Greenwich House was founded on Thanksgiving Day in 1902 by city planner and social worker Mary K. Simkhovitch in a building at 26 Jones Street in Manhattan's West Village. Its original focus was to help New York's growing immigrant population adapt to life in their new home. Early supporters who joined her on opening day included social reformer Jacob Riis, Felix Adler and Carl Shurz. Greenwich Village was a mixed area at the time. Italian immigrants began crowding out the existing Irish population. Many homes along the maze of streets and alleys lacked running water. There was a high infant death rate and poor education. Early programs sought to relieve congestion and improve living conditions, which included founding the Greenwich Village Improvement Society, forerunner to the Greenwich Village Association and first neighborhood association of its kind in the United States, and publishing the Tenant's Rights Manual, the first ever of its kind in the nation. Recognizing a need for recreational and skills training among Village residents, Greenwich House established Greenwich House Music School at 46 Barrow in 1905 followed by the Handicraft School, the precursor to Greenwich House Pottery, in 1909. By 1917 the organization's programs were becoming over crowded in its Jones Street buildings. Thanks to a gift from Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Greenwich House was able to hire architects Delano and Aldrich to design its current federalist building at 27 Barrow Street. The new building, complete with gym, running track, theater and rooftop playground provided Greenwich House the space to establish new programs like a nursery school and children's theater program. Greenwich House soon needed more space. The old Handicraft School building was rebuilt as Greenwich House Pottery in 1928, enabling it to become an international center for ceramics. The Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased two pieces from the Pottery in 1939. In 1942 Greenwich House continued to add more services with the New York City's first after-school program followed closely be a senior center. By the 1980s Greenwich House offered a mix of social service and arts education programs. In the late 1980s Greenwich House played a central role in the AIDS crisis in the West Village neighborhood, one of the city's original gay villages. In 1987 Greenwich House opened the AIDS Mental Health Project followed by the HIV Primary Medical Care Project. Today, the organization continues to host a long term HIV survivors support group. Also in 1987, Greenwich House founded the Children's Safety Project, the only program in the city dedicated to treating young victims of abuse. The Children's Safety Project was founded, in the settlement tradition, after a group of concerned neighbors came together after the killing of local Village child, nine year old Lisa Steinberg. Today Greenwich House provides art education, senior service and behavioral health programs including an after-school, summer arts camp, nursery school, senior centers and senior health clinic, substance abuse clinics and a program for children who have suffered from abuse. Locations and facilities Greenwich House's main facilities are located in Greenwich Village, including its main building at 27 Barrow Street, Pottery at 16 Jones Street and Music School at 46 Barrow Street. Greenwich House also rents space for programs, primarily senior and behavioral health programs, including at a nearby church, Our Lady of Pomepii; at a former convent located on Washington Square Park North. Greenwich House's main building was built between 1916 and 1917 thanks to funds from board members including Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Anna Woershoffer. The Flemish-bond building was designed in the neo- federal style by architects Delano and Aldrich. The building was considered an example of refined American design, complete with mural by Arthur Crisp, intended to inspire immigrants new to the country. The seven story building contains a professional theater, currently the home of Ars Nova and previously home to Soho Rep and the Barrow Street Theatre, a gym with running track, commercial kitchen, medical offices and a rooftop playground among other facilities. A sign of the times, the building was built with a shaft for an elevator, but no actual elevator, as the new technology was too expensive at the time. Greenwich House Pottery is located at 16 Jones Street. The current building was built in 1928, also designed by Delano and Aldrich. The building is notable for containing the only gas kilns in Manhattan which are grandfathered despite no longer being allowed in new construction. It is also the home of the Jane Hartsook Gallery. Greenwich House Music School, located at 46 Barrow Street composes two out of a row of six brick row homes. The homes were originally designed in the Italianate style by Smith Woodruff in 1851. The two Music School homes were combined on the interior and now comprise the 100 seat Renee Weiler Concert Hall as well as sound proof practice rooms. Greenwich House's rented space in the basement of Our Lady of Pompeii Catholic Church also received notoriety. In 2015, after more than thirty years in the space, the pastor of the church attempted to kick the senior center out, hoping to lease the space for more money to movie crews wanting to film in the Village. After months of negotiations, including elected officials and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, weighing in, the Church agreed to a new revised lease allowing the center to remain. Programs =Greenwich House Music School= Founded in 1905, Greenwich House Music School is a true community based arts school located. The School was the result of a growing Italian population with a strong musical tradition at the turn of the 20th Century in the Village. Started as a place for immigrant children Greenwich House Music School now provides music, art and dance education for both children and adults. About 40 faculty members provide group and individual instruction for a variety of instruments including piano, strings, guitar, harp, percussion, woodwinds, brass and Suzuki Violin. In addition to music, early childhood classes are offered in music and art. Dance classes are also available at the school. The Renee Weiler Concert Hall on the school's second floor hosts a variety of performances throughout the year including a special partnership with Caffe Vivaldi, avant garde jazz series Sound it Out and new music series Uncharted. Notable performers who have passed through the concert hall include Meredith Monk, Hilary Hahn, John Cage, David Amram, Tim Berne and Ruth Laredo. Notable faculty members include long time Piano Chair, German Diez (1924-2014), Morton Subotnick, sometimes referred to as the grandfather of Electronic Music, and current faculty Brandee Younger, jazz harpist. Notable alumni include Bobby Lopez, the Tony, Grammy, Emmy and Academy Award-winning composer for the movie Frozen, Avenue Q and Book of Mormon, as well as Erika Nickrenz of the Eroica Trio. Greenwich House Music School was named by CBS New York as one of the best music schools for adults in New York City, and is a member of the National Guild for Community Arts Education. =Greenwich House Pottery= Greenwich House Pottery is a full service clay studio and internationally recognized center for ceramics. The Pottery offers classes and workshops for students of all ages. It also host Master Series lectures as well and two residency programs, including Egyptian painter Ghada Amer. Within Greenwich House Pottery is the Jane Hartsook Gallery.[13] The gallery was named in honor of Jane Hartsook, former Pottery director. =Greenwich House After-School and Summer Arts Camp= When the Children‚Äôs Aid Society moved away from the West Village in 2011, Greenwich House assumed responsibility for its After-School and Summer Arts Camp programs. =Children's Safety Project= In 1987 six-year-old Village girl Lisa Steinberg was found murdered, the victim of physical abuse, with the prime suspects her adoptive parents. Headlines following the trail and conviction of Lisa‚Äôs adoptive father and illegal guardian filled the papers for two years straight. A direct response to the community‚Äôs call to protect its children, Greenwich House launched the Children‚Äôs Safety Project that same year. CSP helps children heal from their trauma of abuse through supportive therapy and by teaching them the life-skills required to become self-reliant and lead productive lives. While originally intended to serve the immediate neighborhood, CSP has expanded over time to serve hundreds of the most vulnerable individuals a year from across the city with individualized therapy. =Barrow Street Nursery School= Barrow Street Nursery School is a pre-school. =Additional programs= Greenwich House also operates four senior centers, a senior health and consultation center providing mental and physical health treatment, a methadone maintenance clinic, chemical dependency program and all-girls non-competitive basketball league.

The facility may be toured by arrangement, but there is no visitors center. Description and history The Salisbury Fish Hatchery is located on both sides of Vermont Route 53, about east of its junction with United States Route 7. The facility takes up more than , although the improved area is relatively modest. Most of the production complex is located on the south side of the highway, with a long and narrow wood-frame structure covering a concrete raceway in which some rearing takes place. The main complex includes a residence and the main hatchery building, which houses a series of troughs in which breeding occurs. The entire complex is fed by a series of freshwater springs and an aquifer, a critical element in the decision to locate the hatchery here. The breeding operating is highly dependent on a continuous supply of fresh water. with The hatchery was established in 1931, and was the first not located near a railroad, previously the method by which the state's other hatcheries delivered their stock to its destinations. Designed by Walker and Walker of Montpelier, the hatchery buildings are more architecturally distinctive than earlier hatcheries, with a number of Craftsman touches. It was established due to a documented decline in the number of fish in the state's waterways, primarily the result of sport fishing. In the 1950s, the facility was expanded by the addition of a feed storage building, and in the 1960s concrete raceways were added. The breeding and rearing facility north of the road houses an unusual light-managed environment to facilitate continuous propagation of fish.

He was a captain in the Duke of York's independent company from 1673 until after 1675 serving in the Portsmouth garrison. He got into debt and in 1677 he recovered his fortune by marrying Anna Maria Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. She was born Lady Anna Maria Brudenell, daughter of Robert, 2nd Earl of Cardigan, was widow of Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury and notorious as mistress of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham. In doing so, he brought an action for jactitation of marriage against Ann Smith, a shopkeeper with whom he had been living for some years. Brydges' wife bought him a post as Groom of the Bedchamber in 1678. He was appointed to the lieutenancy for Staffordshire in 1680 and stood for Parliament at Lichfield in the 1681 general election. Some time before 1685, he bought Avington Park and considerably remodelled the house. He entertained Charles II there while the King's house at Winchester was being built. On the accession of James II in 1685 he lost his post as Groom of the Bedchamber, but remained loyal to the King until the Glorious Revolution.

Achille Mbembe, author of On the Postcolony, was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his article of the same name. Necropolitics is often discussed with biopower, the Foucauldian term for the use of social and political power to control people's lives. Mbembe was clear that necropolitics is more than a right to kill (Foucault's droit de glaive), but also the right to expose other people (including a country's own citizens) to death. His view of necropolitics also included the right to impose social or civil death, the right to enslave others, and other forms of political violence. Necropolitics is a theory of the walking dead, namely a way of analysing how \\"contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of death\\" forces some bodies to remain in different states of being located between life and death. Mbembe uses the examples of slavery, apartheid, the colonisation of Palestine and the figure of the suicide bomber to show how different forms of necropower over the body (statist, racialised, a state of exception, urgency, martyrdom) reduce people to precarious conditions of life. Queer necropolitics Jasbir Puar coined the term queer necropolitics to analyze the post-9/11 queer outrage regarding gay bashing and simultaneous queer complicity with Islamophobia. Many scholars use Puar's queer necropolitics in conjunction with Judith Butler's concept of a grievable life. Queer necropolitics is the subject of an anthology from Routledge.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The trusses are set on stone abutments that have been faced in concrete. with The bridge was built for the town in 1905 by Henry Norton, and was dedicated to Gilbert and Olive Spaulding. It is one of a small number of surviving pin-connected truss bridges in the state; this style of construction was already falling out of fashion when this bridge was built, replaced by field riveting. The bridge underwent a major restoration in 2005.

He first appeared in the series eighteen episode \\"Flash in the Pan\\", broadcast on 4 October 2003. Abs was introduced at a time producer Mervyn Watson had revamped the show's cast. Redmond was offered the role of Abs which he was happy to accept because he was \\"fascinated\\" with the psychology of the character. Abs is characterised as being a \\"charming but eccentric loner\\". He is also portrayed as very \\"gullible\\", which writers took advantage of during his first relationship stories. They paired him with paramedic Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs), but soon added her scheming step-sister Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova) into the story. Ellen realises that Abs is gullible and concocts lies to convince him to marry her so that she can obtain a visa to remain in the UK. He risked prison when he realised the marriage was a sham and ended it. Producers later explored the character's backstory which included a prison sentence for causing a car accident while joy-riding. The accident left his brother Danny paralysed and alcohol-dependent which would lead to his death. They also introduced his childhood friend Stacey Merrick (Andrew Newton-Lee) who is an alcoholic. Writers used the story to make the character more ambitious as he tries to open an alcohol support clinic. In 2008, Redmond decided to leave Casualty. In the build up to his departure his producers killed off Stacey which caused Abs' life to \\"spiral out of control\\". He left during the episode titled \\"There and Back Again\\", which was broadcast on 18 October 2008. Redmond returned for one episode in 2016 to celebrate the show's thirtieth anniversary. The character has also been featured in two special episodes set in Cambodia. Casting In April 2003, it was announced that Redmond had joined the cast of Casualty. Abs was billed as a new nurse who would both charm and aggravate colleagues with his \\"laid-back attitude.\\" Redmond was happy to be offered the role because Casualty was filmed in his home town of Bristol. The actor said he was excited to join the show and revealed his first scenes would air in October 2003. Redmond believed that the character was very different to any role he had played before. He found this a main factor in being attracted to the role, he was also \\"fascinated\\" with the psychology of Abs. The actor had previously worked alongside head of BBC drama Mal Young and he believed this helped him secure the role. A reporter from the Bristol Post said that Casualty producers had wanted to include more actors with West Country accents, such as Redmond, to make the show appear more authentic. He was also introduced at a time producer Mervyn Watson had largely revamped the show's characters. Development =Characterisation= Abs is characterised as a \\"charming but eccentric loner\\" and a \\"sensitive soul\\" On the show's official website, Abs is described as being \\"driven and passionate\\" towards his career and does not \\"suffer fools gladly\\". He is ready to shout at anyone being negative to him and he does not \\"sugar coat\\" the truth. The emergency department know they cannot cope without Abs' skills because he is the only nurse available with his skill set. He has also been called \\"principled, gullible, sensitive, jokey, empathetic\\" and someone \\"who goes his own way and loves probing people and solving their problems.\\" His \\"kind and gullible\\" nature have made him an easy target to con. The character was employed at the hospital as a F grade Mental Health Nurse. Abs was billed as an \\"oddball nurse\\". His role within the wards was welcomed by Redmond who had experiences with psychologists and psychiatrists when growing up. He believed Abs was a \\"fantastic\\" role to take on because it helped to raise awareness of mental health issues and make it less taboo. A Casualty publicist told Nicola Methven from the Daily Mirror that \\"Abs doesn't suffer fools gladly, but he is fixated by idiots and lunatics. His character is an interesting blend of vivacity, charm and genius.\\" =Marriage to Ellen Zitek= The show began developing a relationship between Abs and paramedic Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs). Her sister Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova) was introduced into the series and comes between the two characters. Ellen, who is from the Ukraine, asks Abs to marry her so she can stay in the UK after her visa runs out. Discussing the development, Gibbs told Lucy Lawrence from the Daily Mirror that the storyline would create \\"amazing\\" scenes between Abs, Nina and Ellen. Ellen manages to convince Abs to marry her by concocting a story about her father abusing her. Bouzova told a reporter from Inside Soap that her character thought Abs \\"was a bit of a hunk\\" when they first met. As the pair got to know each other, Ellen realised she could target him. Bouzova explained that \\"she realised he's a walkover, so she takes him for a ride. The fact that he's her stepsister, Nina Farr's boyfriend is even better.\\" She added that Ellen always wants what Nina has and decides to steal Abs. Ellen later reveals that she has debts and loan sharks are after her. Abs is faced with the task of helping her gather the money together. But he faces a dilemma when he considers stealing from a patient and Nina is forced to stop him. Abs is shocked when he discovers that Ellen has lied about her father abusing her. He realises that she tricked him into marrying her just for a visa. Ellen tries to convince Abs that she has genuinely fallen in love with him and wants their marriage to work. Abs refuses to listen believing the marriage to be a sham and throws her out into the street. In episodes airing in February 2005, Abs decides that he wants to end the marriage officially. He threatens to report Ellen to immigration even though he knows it will probably see him end up in prison. A reporter from Inside Soap revealed that not even Nina declaring her love for Abs changes his mind. Abs threats causes a stressed Ellen to make a mistake at work which harms a patient. Despite this, he refuses to rethink his decision. =Cambodia episodes= The show planned two special episodes set in Cambodia to commemorate Casualty's twentieth anniversary. Redmond was amongst one of five cast members who travelled to the country to film the episodes. In the storyline the team go to help Lisa Duffin (Cathy Shipton) on a medical mission. The cast filmed on various locations around the country. Martina Laird (who plays Comfort Jones) told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that they had to work in \\"extreme conditions\\" where facilities were rather sparse. They also had to contend with high temperatures. It was also the rainy season and on one occasion they had to be evacuated after their location became a flood risk. The crew needed to cram in as much filming during daylight hours as possible. This meant 4.30 AM starts, first attending hair and make up and then going to the location shoots with long days on set. =Brother's death= In 2008, producers decided to explore Abs' back story which revealed he had not always been the kind and caring character they had portrayed him as. The story begins when Abs learns that his brother Danny has died. He later attends his funeral where it is revealed that Abs used to be a teenage tearaway. Danny died from complications caused by alcohol abuse. His alcohol abuse stemmed from the fact he was left paralysed after a car crash caused by Abs while joy- riding. Abs was convicted for his crime and sent to prison. This led to his family abandoning him and when he was released he tried to change his life. Redmond told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that \\"Abs and Danny were very close in their teens.\\" The accident caused them to become estranged. He explained that \\"Abs never apologised for causing his brother's injuries, Danny was always the good kid, while Abs got himself into trouble.\\" He added that Abs was to blame and that the accident brought on Danny's drink problem which eventually led to his death. His parents blame Abs for their son's death and refuse to have any contact. Producers then introduced Abs' childhood best friend Stacey Merrick (Andrew Newton-Lee). Abs and Stacey both followed the same lifestyle as teenagers, but Abs is shocked to realise Stacey has not changed. Redmond revealed that \\"Stacey's very funny, the life and soul of the party.\\" He then learns Stacey is an alcoholic which unsettles Abs because \\"he doesn't expect his mate to still be acting like that so many years on. He realises the booze is a huge problem.\\" Stacey gets so drunk that Abs has to take him to hospital. Producers used the story to take Abs in a more ambitious direction as he aspires to open an alcohol support clinic. Redmond explained that Abs knows the effect alcohol-related admissions has on the NHS and he wants to change that. He wants to sort the problem and \\"just feels that he should act.\\" In addition, Abs knows that the clinic could help Stacey and serve as an honour to Danny's memory. =Departure and return= Redmond considered leaving Casualty in 2007, but his friends convinced him to stay longer because audition opportunities for other roles had dwindled. The actor decided to sign an additional one-year contract with the show. On 22 July 2008, Redmond announced his decision to leave the show. It was revealed that his character would make his final appearance during the seventh episode of twenty-third series titled, \\"There and Back Again\\" (which aired on 18 October 2008.) An Inside Soap reporter revealed that Abs \\"spirals out of control\\" in the build up to his departure. Producers killed off his best friend Stacey and he tries to avoid going to his funeral. He manages to conjure up the courage to attend where Stacey's girlfriend Ellie Bridges (Sarah-Jane Potts) is grateful for his support. Ellie convinces Abs continue to proceed with the alcohol support clinic. He discovers that the hospital have withdrawn its funding and he causes trouble on the ward. He is then arrested for being drunk and disorderly. Abs' final episode saw him spending the night in a police cell with cuts and bruises. He then returns to work for his final shift and is forced to treat an escaped prisoner. His work colleagues organise a surprise leaving party for him. He later leaves the show alongside his friend Ellie. Reflecting on his time on Casualty Redmond stated \\"Casualty was great because I really had to stretch myself as an actor. There was no comedy in my part - it was all drama, lots of shouting and medical stuff.\\" In 2016, Redmond agreed to return to the show in a guest appearance. Abs' returned alongside various former characters to celebrate Casualty's thirtieth anniversary episode titled \\"Too Old for This Shift\\", which was broadcast on 27 August 2016. Reception Dawn Collinson from the Liverpool Echo branded Redmond a \\"Casualty heart- throb\\". The story involving Abs, Nina and Ellen was not well received by the Daily Mirror's Polly Hudson. She moaned \\"Casualty The Abs/Ellen/Nina triangle is ludicrous - and now dull, too.\\" Tom Adair of The Scotsman branded opined that Abs marrying Ellen so she could obtain a visa was \\"limp\\" story telling. Jim Shelley from Daily Mirror branded Abs a \\"bizarre character\\" who \\"insists on dressing the like a scarecrow\\" who needed to wash his hair. They also described him as \\"handsome and ostensibly one of the more intelligent nurses in the series - which, admittedly, is not saying much.\\" He then compared him to Benny Hawkins, a character the British soap opera Crossroads, but with the added \\"power of sectioning people.\\" References External links *Character profile at BBC Online Casualty (TV series) characters Television characters introduced in 2003 Fictional nurses Male characters in television ","title":"Abs Denham"},{"id":"51427970","title":"Lucirio Garrido"},{"id":"51427973","text":"Saint George-Lozonschi Church Saint George-Lozonschi Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 2 Clo»ôca Street in Ia»ôi, Romania. It is dedicated to Saint George and Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Origins and description The first church on the site was built in the 16th century; it was made of wood and also named after Saint George. The oldest mention dates to 1615. The date of construction is unknown, but the ktitor was p√¢rcƒÉlab Gheorghe Kataratos, a Greek who lived in Lozna village, hence the nickname Izlozeanul or Lozonschi. The church was also known as the Lady's Church (Biserica Doamnei), the Young Lady's Church (Biserica Domni»õei) or the Young Lady MƒÉrioara's Church (Biserica Domni»õei MƒÉrioara). Hence, historian N. A. Bogdan suggested it may have been founded by Maria of Lozon»õ, one of the ladies of Stephen the Great, or by a descendant or relative of hers. Another historian claims that the Lady's Church was actually located in the princely court, and that a documentary confusion gave rise to an erroneous identification. In 1707, the priests granted a plot of land for a house, itself a gift, to a certain Vasile in exchange for material to build a new roof. Short history at the Saint George-Lozonschi parish site At the end of the 18th century, due to the church's advanced state of degradation, paharnic Iordache Lozonschi, a descendant of the original founder, rebuilt the church in stone. As the Romanian Cyrillic dedication plaque on the south side indicates, the present church was built in 1800. At the same time, the church was also dedicated to Saint Catherine, after the name of Lozonschi's wife. The founder died in 1818, as attested by the white marble gravestone in the nave. A parish church from the beginning, it was attended by members of the bootmakers' guild. During the 19th century, Saint Demetrius-Bal»ô Church was its filial. It did not receive substantial donations and was mainly supported through its own income. Among its properties was the HƒÉsnƒÉ»ôeni estate in the Bessarabia Governorate, the income being transmitted through the Russian consulate. There was a cemetery around the church; the palace of Mihail Sturdza was located to the south, while boyar houses stretched north of the cemetery. Trefoil in form, the church has semicircular apses on the exterior and interior, with a single octagonal spire above the nave. Notably, the western wall and the altar are rounded, probably an Armenian influence that came through Russia. There is a row of circular windows on the upper part of the church. The vestibule has a space for the choir, divided from the nave by a wall nearly a meter thick. The bell tower sits above the choir. There are two hidden spaces above the side apses. The iconostasis, from 1800, is made of massive wood planks that cannot be removed, other than the four large royal icons. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Subsequent developments An alehouse once stood near the church. According to one story, Metropolitan Veniamin Costache (reigned 1803-1842, with interruptions) was riding in a carriage in the area when he spotted a drunken priest, whom he chastised. The priest promised not to drink except for St. George and St. Demetrius. Seen drunk a few days later by Costache, the latter upbraided him for breaking his vow. The priest replied his promise meant he would only drink in the bars around St. George and St. Demetrius churches, not that he would abstain from drinking on all but those two feast days. Using the parish's own income, the church was thoroughly repaired between 1895 and 1898, an event marked by an inscription on a black plaque placed on the interior south wall of the nave. A square foyer that serves as an entrance was added at the time; it is small and classical in design. A Polish painter covered parts of the apse and altar, as well as four triangles on the ceiling, with images of saints and the Four Evangelists. The fresco work was done in neoclassical style but only fragments have survived, in the altar. Among the church's valuables are a wooden communion box from 1806, a silver cross and stand from 1812, a silver candlestick from 1816 and a silver disc from 1825. It also owns a Greek Gospel book from 1793, a Slavonic one from 1803 and ten books from Costache's time, including the Neam»õ Gospel book of 1821. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Ia»ôi File:Biserica Sf.

His knowledge of natural history, surgery, medicine and agriculture made him a free correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences. He was a contributor to the Encyclop√©die.  Biography  His father was Michel-√âtienne Turgot (1690‚Äì1751), pr√©v√¥t des marchands de Paris (\\"Master of the merchants of Paris\\", i.e. Mayor of Paris) and his younger brother the famous Anne Robert Jacques Turgot.

As a knight of Malta, he commanded one of the Order's Mediterranean galleys. In the 1740s, he fought for Maurice de Saxe in Bohemia and Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession. He returned to France in 1764 and was appointed brigadier of the king's armies.

Upon his return, he started to run into problems with the government regarding the education system. The government had started arresting and censoring many of the people who went against government ideas regarding the education system, and this caused Prah to decide to start a campaign to free his colleagues. With the government soon looking to arrest him, Prah left for South Africa, where he had contact with the Pan-African society.

The book received widespread critical acclaim, drawing comparisons to Richard Yates, Joseph Heller, and Frederick Exley. Jernigan was a finalist for the 1992 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction.  Plot summary  Peter Jernigan, the eponymous narrator, is an alcoholic widower in his late 30s who tells the darkly comic story of his attempts to raise his teenage son Danny in the suburbs of New Jersey in the year following the suicide of his wife. When Jernigan begins an affair with Martha, the mother of Danny's girlfriend and a self-styled \\"suburban survivalist\\" who breeds rabbits in her basement, his drinking turns harder and his life begins to spiral completely out of control.  Critical reception  Reviewing the novel for The New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, \\"The minute he starts talking, Peter Jernigan, the narrator of David Gates's astonishing first novel, grabs you by the lapels and compels you to listen to the sad-funny-tragic story of his life. His voice is one of those distinctive, all-American voices: brash, sarcastic, rueful and boyish, all at the same time. He sounds like a Holden Caulfield who has grown up to find himself trapped in a novel by Richard Yates.\\" Douglas Seibold of The Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"It is a compelling ride, and makes for compelling reading. But it is Jernigan's voice, the hectoring, profane, desperate voice with which he tells the story of his fall, that is the motivating force.\\" In reviewing the 2015 UK reissue of Jernigan for The Independent, Doug Johnstone wrote, \\"Re-reading Jernigan, I was struck all over again at how brutal and brilliant it is. The author Stuart Evers, in his insightful and passionate foreword to this new edition, claims that it deserves to be rediscovered in a similar fashion to Stoner or Revolutionary Road. While I agree with that sentiment entirely, Jernigan feels like a more powerful piece of writing than those books, a howl into the abyss, a very modern American rage against the indignities of life and death.\\"  Awards and honors  * 1992 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction (Finalist) References Tragicomedy 1991 American novels 1991 debut novels ","title":"Jernigan (1991 novel)"},{"id":"51428376","title":"2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards"},{"id":"51428446","text":"Johannes Bilberg Johannes Bilberg (17 November 1646 ‚Äì 11 March 1717) was a Swedish theologian, professor and bishop. As a professor he was involved in the controversy over Cartesianism. He was the son of school principal and vicar Jonas Amberni and his wife Ingrid Denckert. At the age of thirteen Bilberg started studying at Uppsala University. After he graduated with Bachelor of Arts, he took employment as a tutor for a young baron named Ulf Bonde on a trip around the continent of Europe when they visited royal courts and universities. When he returned home in 1677 he was named professor of mathematics at Uppsala University.La Motraye, Aubry de; Wiklund Karl Bernhard, Bring Samuel E., Hultenberg Hugo (1988).

(inb.) ^ Svenskt biografiskt lexikon Priests at the Riksdagen were also involved in the debate, which made the government feel compelled to set up a special commission to investigate the matter. A compromise was reached and Bilberg and the Cartesians were given full rights. The conflict and battle continued until Bilberg, with the blessing of the King of Sweden, became dean and vicar in √ñrebro in 1692. In his new home he gathered a number of young disciples who he educated in theology and philosophy. At the command of King Karl XI, Bilberg travelled to Torne√• and Kengis along with Anders Spole to study the midnight sun. The expedition, dedicated to Karl as \\"sun-king\\", observed that the sun could indeed be observed around the clock at high altitudes. Bilberg afterwards published a work in Latin and Swedish under the title of Refractio solis inoccidui, in septemtrionalibus oris (About the refraction of the midnight sun, in the Northlands). In 1683, Bilberg married Margareta Staaf, whose father was a trader in Uppsala. The couple had four children together. All four were knighted by Karl XII in Bender at which time they were entitled to retain their father's last name of Bilberg. In 1701, Bilberg was named bishop of Str√§ngn√§s after Erik Benzelius resigned to become archbishop. He continued as bishop in that congregation until his death in 1717.

It stars Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2018 and was released on June 22, 2018, by Magnolia Pictures and Great Point Media. Plot Samuel Alabaster, an affluent pioneer, intends to propose to and marry the love of his life, Penelope. In town he hires Parson Henry, a drunkard, to officiate it. Together, the two venture across the American frontier with a miniature horse named Butterscotch, a wedding present for Penelope. During the journey, Samuel and Henry run into Rufus Cornell, who attempts to shoot and kill Samuel before running off. Samuel chases after Rufus, only for the latter to fall off a cliff to his apparent death. Samuel confesses to Henry that Penelope had been kidnapped by Rufus and Rufus' brother Anton, and that he seeks to rescue her. Henry agrees to help him for more money. Reaching the Cornell home, Samuel attempts to sneak around the property as Henry watches from afar. Anton exits the house, and Henry panics. He fatally shoots Anton in the head. Samuel rushes up to the corpse and shoots it some more. Penelope exits the house and holds Samuel at gunpoint. Samuel attempts to propose to her but she rejects him and declares that she hates him and loved Anton. In grief, Samuel commits suicide. Penelope takes Henry as her prisoner before blowing up the house. Venturing back toward the town, Penelope and Henry run into Rufus, who survived his fall and was able to track Henry and Penelope. Rufus attempts to take Penelope as his wife, but she rejects him. He then decides to murder her and Henry but is shot and killed with an arrow by Zachariah Running Bear. That night, Henry discusses his desire to learn of the Native culture and asks to join Zachariah on his journey. The next day, Henry and Penelope awaken to discover that Zachariah has left. Penelope frees Henry, who hugs her and apologizes for what has happened. However, before Penelope leaves with Butterscotch, Henry spontaneously proposes to her. She throws a large stone in his face and rides off.

It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.  Definition  Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.Ronald L. Johnstone: Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion, Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff. Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: re- formare, reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for ethical prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror, in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: \\"If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism.\\" The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a \\"final\\" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by Karl Barth in 1947: Ecclesia semper reformanda est, i.e. The church is always to be reformed.Theodor Mahlmann: Ecclesia semper reformanda. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbj√∂rn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388 Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to restore paganism as state religion.Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of Aggiornamento in the Catholic Church. The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is modernism. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.Cf. e.g. title of: J.

The EMC is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes (animals, plants, and fungi), and its initial appearance might reach back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Many aspects of mEMC biology and molecular function remain to be studied.  Composition and structure  The EMC consists of up to 10 subunits (EMC1 - EMC4, MMGT1, EMC6 - EMC10), of which only two (EMC8/9) are homologous proteins. Seven out of ten (EMC1, EMC3, EMC4, MMMGT1, EMC6, EMC7, EMC10) subunts are predicted to contain at least one transmembrane domain (TMD), whereas EMC2, EMC8 and EMC9 do not contain any predicted transmembrane domains are herefore likely to interact with the rest of the EMC on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). EMC proteins are thought to be present in the mature complex in a 1:1 stoichiometry. = Subunit primary structure = The majority of EMC proteins (EMC1/3/4/MMGT1/6/7/10) contain at least one predicted TMD. EMC1, EMC5 and EMC10 contain an N-terminal signal sequence.  EMC1  EMC1, also known as KIAA0090, contains a single TMD (aa 959-979) and Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-like repeats (aa 21-252), which could form a Œ≤-propeller domain. The TMD is part of a domain a larger domain (DUF1620). The functions of the PQQ and DUF1620 domains in EMC1 remain to be determined.  EMC2  EMC2 (TTC35) harbours three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR1/2/3). TPRs have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions and can be found in a large variety of proteins of diverse function. The function of TPRs in EMC2 is unknown.  EMC8 and EMC9  EMC8 and EMC9 show marked sequence identity (44.72%) on the amino acid level. Both proteins are members of the UPF0172 family, a member of which (e.g. TLA1) are involved in regulating the antenna size of chlorophyll-a.  Posttranslational modifications  Several subunits of the mammalian EMC (mEMC) are posttranslationally modified. EMC1 contains three predicted N-glcosylation sites at positions 370, 818, and 913. EMC10 features a predicted N-glycosylation consensus motif at position 182.  Evolutionary conservation  EMC proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. No homologues are reported in prokaryotes. Therefore, the EMC has been suggested to have its evolutionary roots in the last eukaryote common ancestor (LECA).  Function  = Protein folding and degradation at the ER = The EMC was first identified in a genetic screen in yeast for factors involved in protein folding in the ER. Accordingly, deletion of individual EMC subunits correlates with the induction of an ER stress response in various model organisms. However, it is worth noting that in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS cells), deletion of EMC6 does not appear to cause ER stress. When overexpressed, several subunits of the mammalian EMC orthologue (mEMC) have been found to physically interact with ERAD components (UBAC2, DER1, DER2) Genetic screens in yeast have shown EMC subunits to be enriched in alongside ERAD genes. Taken together, these findings imply a role of the mEMC in protein homeostasis.  Chaperone  = Maturation of polytopic membrane proteins = Several lines of evidence implicate the EMC in promoting the maturation of polytopic membrane proteins. The EMC is necessary to correctly and efficiently insert the first transmembrane domain (also called the signal anchor) of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the beta-adrenergic receptor. Determining features of transmembrane domains that favour EMC involvement seem to be moderate hydrophobicity and ambiguous distribution of TMD flanking charges. The substrate spectrum of the EMC appears to extend beyond GPCRs. Unifying properties of putative EMC clients are the presence of unusually hydrophilic transmembrane domains containing charged residues. However, mechanistic detail of how the EMC assists in orienting and inserting such problematic transmembrane domains is lacking. In many cases, evidence implicating the EMC in the biogenesis of a certain protein consists of co-depletion when individual subunts of the EMC are disrupted. A number of putative EMC clients are listed below, but the manner in which the EMC engages them and whether they directly or indirectly depend on the EMC merits further investigation: Loss of EMC function destabilises the enzyme sterol-O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) and, in conjunction with overlooking the biogenesis of squalene synthase (SQS), helps to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. SOAT1 is an obligatory enzyme for cellular cholesterol storage and detoxification. For SQS, an enzyme controlling the committing step in cholesterol biosynthesis, the EMC has been shown to be sufficient for its integration into liposomes in vitro. Depletion of EMC6 and additional EMC proteins reduces the cell surface expression of the nicotinic Acetylcholine receptors in C. elegans. Knockdown of EMC2 has been observed to correlate with decreased CFTRŒîF508 levels. EMC2 contains three tetratricopeptide repeat domains (TRPs). TRPs have been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction and can be found in co-chaperones of Hsp90. Therefore, a role of EMC2 in mediating interactions with cytosolic chaperones is conceivable, but remains to be demonstrated. Loss of EMC subunits in D. melanogaster correlates with strongly reduced cell surface expression of rhodopsin-1 (Rh1), an important polytopic light receptor in the plasma membrane. In yeast, the EMC has been implicated in maturation or trafficking defects of the polytopic model substrate Mrh1p-GFP. = Insertion proteins into the ER = The EMC was shown to be involved in a pathway mediating the membrane integration of tail-anchored proteins containing an unusually hydrophilic or amphiphatic transmembrane domains. This pathway appears to operate in parallel to the conventional Get/Trc40 targeting pathway. = Other suggested functions =  Mitochondrial tethering  In S. cerevisiae, the EMC has been reported by Lahiri and colleagues to constitute a tethering complex between the ER and mitochondria. Close apposition of both organelles is a prerequisite for phosphatidylcholine (PS) biosyntheis in which phosphatidylserine (PS) is imported from the ER into mitochondria, and this was previously proposed as evidence for a membrane tether between these two organelles by Jean Vance. Disruption of the EMC by genetic deletion of multiple of its subunits was shown to reduce ER- mitochondrial tethering and to impair transfer of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the ER.  Autophagosome formation  EMC6 interacts with the small GTPase RAB5A and BECLIN-1, regulators of autophagosome formation. This observation suggestes that the mEMC, and not just EMC6, might be involved in regulating Rab5A and BECLIN-1. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the proposed modulation of autophagosome formation remains to be established.  Involvement in disease  The mEMC has repeatedly been implicated in a range of pathologies including susceptibility of cells to viral infection, cancer, and a congenital syndrome of severe physical and mental disability. None of these pathologies seem to be related by disruption of a single molecular pathway that might be regulated by the mEMC. Consequently, the involvement of the mEMC in these pathologies has only limited use for defining the primary function of this complex. = As a host factor in viral infections = Large- scale genetic screens imply several mEMC subunits in modulating the pathogenicity of flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZV), Dengue fever virus (DFV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). In particular, loss of several mEMC subunits (e.g. EMC2, EMC3) lead to inhibition of WNV-induced cell death. however, WNV was still able to infect and proliferate in cells lacking EMC subunits. The authors made a similar observation of the role of the mEMC in the cell-killing capacity of Saint Louis Encephalitis Virus. The underlying cause for the resistance of EMC2/3-deficient cells to WNV-induced cytotoxicity remains elusive. = Cancer = Dysregulation of individual mEMC subunits correlates with the severity of certain types of cancer. Expression of hHSS1, a secreted splice variant of EMC10 (HSM1), reduces the proliferation and migration of glioma cell lines. Overexpression of EMC6 has been found to reduce cell proliferation of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas its RNAi-mediated depletion has the opposite effect.

It was founded primarily by the Russian immigrant Helena Blavatsky and draws its beliefs predominantly from Blavatsky's writings. Categorized by scholars of religion as both a new religious movement and as part of the occultist stream of Western esotericism, it draws upon both older European philosophies such as Neoplatonism and Asian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. As presented by Blavatsky, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters, who‚Äîalthough found across the world‚Äîare centered in Tibet. These Masters are alleged by Blavatsky to have cultivated great wisdom and supernatural powers, and Theosophists believe that it was they who initiated the modern Theosophical movement through disseminating their teachings via Blavatsky. They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found across the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing world religions. Theosophical groups nevertheless do not refer to their system as a \\"religion\\". Theosophy preaches the existence of a single, divine Absolute. It promotes an emanationist cosmology in which the universe is perceived as outward reflections from this Absolute. Theosophy teaches that the purpose of human life is spiritual emancipation and claims that the human soul undergoes reincarnation upon bodily death according to a process of karma. It promotes values of universal brotherhood and social improvement, although it does not stipulate particular ethical codes. Theosophy was established in New York City in 1875 with the founding of the Theosophical Society by Blavatsky and two Americans, Henry Olcott and William Quan Judge. In the early 1880s, Blavatsky and Olcott relocated to India, where they established the Society's headquarters at Adyar, Tamil Nadu. Blavatsky described her ideas in two books, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine. She was repeatedly accused of fraudulently producing purportedly supernatural phenomena, often in connection with these \\"masters\\". Following Blavatsky's death in 1891, there was a schism in the Society, with Judge leading the Theosophical Society in America to split from the international organization. Under Judge's successor Katherine Tingley, a Theosophical community named Lomaland was established in San Diego. The Adyar-based Society was later taken over by Annie Besant, under whom it grew to its largest extent during the late 1920s, before going into decline. The Theosophical movement still exists, although in much smaller form than in its heyday. Theosophy played a significant role in bringing knowledge of South Asian religions to Western countries, as well as in encouraging cultural pride in various South Asian nations. A variety of prominent artists and writers have also been influenced by Theosophical teachings. Theosophy has an international following, and during the twentieth century had tens of thousands of adherents. Theosophical ideas have also exerted an influence on a wide range of other esoteric movements and philosophies, among them Anthroposophy, the Church Universal and Triumphant, and the New Age. Definition Theosophy's founder, the Russian Helena Blavatsky, insisted that it was not a religion, although she did refer to it as the modern transmission of the \\"once universal religion\\" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. That Theosophy should not be labeled a religion is a claim that has been maintained by Theosophical organizations, who instead regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \\"essential truth\\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. As a result, Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus. Scholars of religion who have studied Theosophy have characterized it as a religion. In his history of the Theosophical movement, Bruce F. Campbell noted that Theosophy promoted \\"a religious world-view\\" using \\"explicitly religious terms\\" and that its central tenets are not unequivocal fact, but rather rely on belief. Olav Hammer and Mikael Rothstein termed it \\"one of the modern world's most important religious traditions\\". Various scholars have pointed to its eclectic nature; Joscelyn Godwin described it as a \\"universally eclectic religious movement\\", while scholar J. Jeffrey Franklin characterized Theosophy as a \\"hybrid religion\\" for its syncretic combination of elements from various other sources. More specifically, Theosophy has been categorized as a new religious movement. Scholars have also classified Theosophy as a form of Western esotericism. Campbell for instance referred to it as \\"an esoteric religious tradition\\", while the historian Joy Dixon called it an \\"esoteric religion\\". More specifically, it is considered a form of occultism. Along with other groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Theosophical Society has been seen as part of an \\"occult revival\\" that took place in Western countries during the late nineteenth century. The historian of religion Wouter Hanegraaff noted that Theosophy helped to establish the \\"essential foundations for much of twentieth-century esotericism\\". Although Theosophy draws upon Indian religious beliefs, the sociologist of religion Christopher Partridge observed that \\"Theosophy is fundamentally Western. That is to say, Theosophy is not Eastern thought in the West, but Western thought with an Eastern flavour.\\" =Etymology= Blavatsky and Olcott, two of the founding members of the Theosophical Society At a meeting of the Miracle Club in New York City on 7 September 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Judge agreed to establish an organisation, with Charles Sotheran suggesting that they call it the Theosophical Society. Prior to adopting the name \\"Theosophical\\", they had debated various potential names, among them the Egyptological Society, the Hermetic Society, and the Rosicrucian Society. The term was not new, but had been previously used in various contexts by the Philaletheians and the Christian mystic Jakob B√∂hme. Etymologically, the term came from the Greek theos (\\"god(s)\\") and sophia (\\"wisdom\\"), thus meaning \\"god- wisdom\\", \\"divine wisdom\\", or \\"wisdom of God\\". The term theosophia appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early church fathers, as a synonym for theology. In her book The Key to Theosophy, Blavatsky claimed that the term \\"Theosophy\\" had been coined by \\"the Alexandrian philosophers\\", especially Ammonius Saccas. Blavatsky's Theosophy is not the only movement to use the term \\"theosophy\\" and this has resulted in scholarly attempts to differentiate the different currents. Godwin drew a division by referring to Blavatskian Theosophy with a capital letter and older, Boehmian theosophy with a lower- case letter. Alternately, the scholar of esotericism Wouter J. Hanegraaff distinguished the Blavatskian movement from its older namesake by terming it \\"modern Theosophy\\". Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers. Causing some confusion, a few Theosophists ‚Äî such as C. C. Massey ‚Äî were also theosophers. In the early years of Blavatsky's movement, some critics referred to it as \\"Neo-Theosophy\\" to differentiate it from the older Christian theosophy movement. The term \\"Neo-Theosophy\\" would later be adopted within the modern Theosophical movement itself, where it was used‚Äîlargely pejoratively‚Äîto describe the teachings promoted by Annie Besant and Charles Webster Leadbeater by those who opposed their innovations. According to the scholar of religion James A. Santucci, discerning what the term \\"Theosophy\\" meant to the early Theosophists is \\"not as obvious as one might think\\". As used by Olcott, the term \\"Theosophy\\" appeared to be applied to an approach that emphasized experimentation as a means of learning about the \\"Unseen Universe\\"; conversely, Blavatsky used the term in reference to gnosis regarding said information. Beliefs and teachings Although the writings of prominent Theosophists lay out a set of teachings, the Theosophical Society itself states that it has no official beliefs with which all members must agree. It therefore has doctrine but does not present this as dogma. The Society stated that the only tenet to which all members should subscribe was a commitment \\"to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color\\". This means that there were members of the Theosophical Society who were skeptical about many, or even all, of the Theosophical doctrines, while remaining sympathetic to its basic aim of universal brotherhood. As noted by Santucci, Theosophy is \\"derived primarily from the writings\\" of Blavatsky, however revisions and innovations have also been produced by subsequent Theosophists like Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater. Blavatsky claimed that these Theosophical doctrines were not her own invention, but had been received from a brotherhood of secretive spiritual adepts whom she referred to as the \\"Masters\\" or \\"Mahatmas\\". =The Masters= Central to Theosophical belief is the idea that a group of spiritual adepts known as the Masters not only exist but were responsible for the production of early Theosophical texts. For most Theosophists, these Masters are deemed to be the real founders of the modern Theosophical movement. In Theosophical literature, these Masters are also referred to as the Mahatmas, Adepts, Masters of Wisdom, Masters of Compassion, and Elder Brothers. They are perceived to be a fraternity of human men who are highly evolved, both in terms of having an advanced moral development and intellectual attainment. They are claimed to have achieved extra-long life spans, and to have gained supernatural powers, including clairvoyance and the ability to instantly project their soul out of their body to any other location. These are powers that they have allegedly attained through many years of training. According to Blavatsky, by the late 19th century their chief residence was in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. She also claimed that these Masters were the source of many of her published writings. The Masters are believed to preserve the world's ancient spiritual knowledge, and to represent a Great White Brotherhood or White Lodge which watches over humanity and guides its evolution. Among those whom the early Theosophists claimed as Masters were Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus, Asian religious figures like Gautama Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi, and modern individuals like Jakob Bohme, Alessandro Cagliostro, and Franz Mesmer. However, the most prominent Masters to appear in Theosophical literature are Koot Hoomi (sometimes spelled Kuthumi) and Morya, with whom Blavatsky claimed to be in contact. According to Theosophical belief, the Masters approach those deemed worthy to embark on an apprenticeship or chelaship. The apprentice would then undergo several years of probation, during which they must live a life of physical purity, remaining chaste, abstinent, and indifferent to physical luxury. Blavatsky encouraged the production of images of the Masters. The most important portraits of the Masters to be produced were created in 1884 by Hermann Schmiechen. According to scholar of religion Massimo Introvigne, Schmiechen's images of Morya and Koot Humi gained \\"semi-canonical status\\" in the Theosophical community, being regarded as sacred objects rather than simply decorative images. Campbell noted that for non-Theosophists, the claims regarding the existence of the Masters are among the weakest made by the movement. Such claims are open to examination and potential refutation, with challenges to the existence of the Masters therefore undermining Theosophical beliefs. The idea of a brotherhood of secret adepts had a long pedigree stretching back several centuries before the foundation of Theosophy; such ideas can be found in the work of the Rosicrucians, and was popularized in the fictional literature of Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The idea of having messages conveyed to a medium through spiritually advanced entities had also been popularized at the time of Theosophy's foundation through the Spiritualist movement. =The ancient wisdom religion= According to Blavatsky's teachings, many of the world's religions have their origins in a universal ancient religion, a \\"secret doctrine\\" that was known to Plato and early Hindu sages and which continues to underpin the center of every religion. She promoted the idea that ancient societies exhibited a unity of science and religion that humanity has since lost, with their achievements and knowledge being far in excess of what modern scholars believe about them. Blavatsky also taught that a secret brotherhood has conserved this ancient wisdom religion throughout the centuries, and that members of this fraternity hold the key to understanding miracles, the afterlife, and psychic phenomena, and that moreover, these adepts themselves have paranormal powers. She stated that this ancient religion would be revived and spread throughout humanity in the future, replacing dominant world religions like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Theosophy tended to emphasize the importance of ancient texts over the popular ritual and custom found within various religious traditions. The Theosophical depiction of Buddhism and Hinduism, however, drew criticism both from practitioners of orthodox Buddhist and Hindu traditions, as well as from Western scholars of these traditions, such as Max M√ºller, who believed that Theosophists like Blavatsky were misrepresenting the Asian traditions. =Theology and cosmology= Theosophy promotes an emanationist cosmology, promoting the belief that the universe is an outward reflection from the Absolute. Theosophy presents the idea that the world as humans perceive it is illusory, or maya, an idea that it draws from Asian religions. Accordingly, Blavatsky taught that a life limited by the perception of this illusory world was ignorant and deluded. According to Theosophical teaching, each solar system is an emanation of a \\"Logos\\" or \\"Solar Deity\\", with planetary spirits each overseeing one of the planets. According to Blavatsky's teaching, every solar system in the universe is the expression of what is termed a \\"Logos\\" or \\"Solar Deity\\". Ranked below this Solar Deity are seven ministers or planetary spirits, with each of these celestial beings being in control of evolution on a particular planet. In The Secret Doctrine, Blavatsky stated that each planet had a sevenfold constitution, known as the \\"Planetary Chains\\"; these consist not only of a physical globe but also of two astral bodies, two mental bodies, and two spiritual bodies, all overlapping in the same space. According to Blavatsky, evolution occurs on descending and ascending arcs, from the first spiritual globe on to the first mental globe, then from the first astral globe to the first physical globe, and then on from there. She claimed that there were different levels of evolution, from mineral on to vegetable, animal, human, and then to superhuman or spiritual. Different levels of evolution occur in a successive order on each planet; thus when mineral evolution ends on the first planet and it proceeds on to vegetable evolution, then mineral evolution begins on the second planet. Theosophy teaches that human evolution is tied in with this planetary and wider cosmic evolution. In The Secret Doctrine, Blavatsky advocated the idea of seven \\"Root Races\\", each of which was divided into seven Sub-Races. In Blavatsky's cosmogony, the first Root Race were created from pure spirit, and lived on a continent known as the \\"Imperishable Sacred Land\\". The second Root Race, known as the Hyperboreans, were also formed from pure spirit, and lived on a land near to the North Pole, which then had a mild climate. The third lived on the continent of Lemuria, which Blavatsky alleged survives today as Australia and Rapa Nui. Blavatsky alleged that during the fourth Round of the Earth, higher beings descended to the planet, with the beginnings of human physical bodies developing, and the sexes separating. At this point, the fourth Root Race appeared, living on the continent of Atlantis; they had physical bodies but also psychic powers and advanced technology. She claimed that some Atlanteans were giants, and built such ancient monuments as Stonehenge in southern England, and that they also mated with \\"she-animals\\", resulting in the creation of gorillas and chimpanzees. The Atlanteans were decadent and abused their power and knowledge, so Atlantis sunk into the sea, although various Atlanteans escaped, and created new societies in Egypt and the Americas. The fifth Root Race to emerge was the Aryans, and was found across the world at the time she was writing. She believed that the fifth Race would come to be replaced by the sixth, which would be heralded by the arrival of Maitreya, a figure from Mahayana Buddhist mythology. She further believed that humanity would eventually develop into the final, seventh Root Race. At this, she stated that humanity will have reached the end of its evolutionary cycle and life will withdraw from the Earth. Lachman suggested that by reading Blavatsky's cosmogonical claims as a literal account of history, \\"we may be doing it a disservice.\\" He instead suggested that it could be read as Blavatsky's attempt to formulate \\"a new myth for the modern age, or as a huge, fantastic science fiction story\\". Maitreya and messianism Blavatsky taught that Lord Maitreya‚Äîa figure she borrowed from Buddhist mythology‚Äîwould come to Earth as a messianic figure. Her ideas on this were expanded upon by Besant and Leadbeater. They claimed that Maitreya had previously incarnated onto the Earth as Krishna, a figure from Hindu mythology. They also claimed that he had entered Jesus of Nazareth at the time of the latter's baptism, and that henceforth Maitreya would be known as \\"the Christ\\". Besant and Leadbeater claimed that Maitreya would again come to Earth by manifesting through an Indian boy named Jiddu Krishnamurti, whom Leadbeater had encountered playing on a beach at Adyar in 1909. The introduction of the Krishmanurti belief into Theosophy has been identified as a millenarian element. =Personal development and reincarnation= Statue of Blavatsky and Olcott at Adyar According to Theosophy, the purpose of human life is the spiritual emancipation of the soul. The human individual is described as an \\"Ego\\" or \\"Monad\\" and believed to have emanated from the Solar Deity, to whom it will also eventually return. The human being is presented as composed of seven parts, while operating on three separate planes of being. As presented by Sinnett and often repeated in Theosophical literature, these seven parts are the Body (Rupa), Vitality (Prana-Jiva), the Astral Body (Linga Sarira), the Animal Soul (Kama-Rupa), the Human Soul (Manas), the Spiritual Soul (Buddhi), and the Spirit (Atma). According to Theosophical teaching, it is the latter three of these components that are immortal, while the other aspects perish following bodily death. Theosophy teaches that the Spiritual Soul and the Spirit do not reside within the human body alongside the other components, but that they are connected to it through the Human Soul. In The Voice of the Silence, Blavatsky taught that within each individual human there is an eternal, divine facet, which she referred to as \\"the Master\\", the \\"uncreate\\", the \\"inner God\\", and the \\"higher self\\". She promoted the idea that uniting with this \\"higher self\\" results in wisdom. In that same book, she compared the progress of the human soul to a transition through three halls; the first was that of ignorance, which is the state of the soul before it understands the need to unite with its higher self. The second is the Hall of Learning, in which the individual becomes aware of other facets of human life but is distracted by an interest in psychic powers. The third is the Hall of Wisdom, in which union with the higher self is made; this is then followed by the Vale of Bliss. At this point the human soul can merge into the One. Reincarnation and karma Throughout her writings, Blavatsky made a variety of statements about rebirth and the afterlife, and there is a discrepancy between her earlier and later teachings on the subject. Between the 1870s and circa 1882, Blavatsky taught a doctrine called \\"metempsychosis\\". In Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky stated that on bodily death, the human soul progresses through more spiritual planes. Two years later, she introduced the idea of reincarnation into Theosophical doctrine, using it to replace her metempsychosis doctrine. In The Secret Doctrine, she stated that the spirit was immortal and would repeatedly incarnate into a new, mortal soul and body on Earth. According to Theosophical teaching, human spirits will always be reborn into human bodies, and not into those of any other life forms. Blavatsky stated that spirits would not be reborn until some time after bodily death, and never during the lifetime of the deceased's relatives. Blavatsky taught that on the death of the body, the astral body survives for a time in a state called kama-loka, which she compared to limbo, before also dying. According to this belief, the human then moves into its mental body in a realm called devachan, which she compared to Heaven or paradise. Blavatsky taught that the soul remained in devachan for 1000 to 1500 years, although the Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater claimed that it was only 200. Theosophy espouses the existence of karma as a system which regulates the cycle of reincarnation, ensuring that an individual's actions in one life affect the circumstances of their next one. This belief therefore seeks to explain why misery and suffering exist in the world, attributing any misfortune that someone suffers as punishment for misdeeds that they perpetrated in a prior life. In Blavatsky's words, karma and reincarnation were \\"inextricably interwoven\\". However, she did not believe that karma had always been the system that governed reincarnation; she believed that it came into being when humans developed egos, and that one day will also no longer be required. Besant and Leadbeater claimed to be able to investigate people's past lives through reading the akashic record, an etheric store of all the knowledge of the universe. They, for instance, claimed to have attained knowledge of their own past lives as monkey-like creatures residing on the moon, where they served as pets to the \\"Moon-man\\" (a prior incarnation of the Master Morya), his wife (Koot Humi), and their child (the Lord Maitreya). When they were attacked by \\"savages\\" and animals \\"resembling furry lizards and crocodiles\\", Besant sacrificed herself to save Morya, and for that act made the karmic evolutionary leap to becoming a human in her next incarnation. =Morality and ethics= The Theosophical seal as door decoration in Budapest, Hungary Theosophy does not express any formal ethical teaching, a situation that generated ambiguity. However, it has expressed and promoted certain values, such as brotherhood and social improvement. During its early years, the Theosophical Society promoted a puritanical attitude toward sexuality, for instance by encouraging chastity even within marriage. By 1911, the Theosophical Society was involved in projects connected to a range of progressive political causes. In England, there were strong links between Theosophy and first-wave feminism. Based on a statistical analysis, Dixon noted that prominent English feminists of the period were several hundred times more likely to join the Theosophical Society than was the average member of the country's population. Theosophical contingents took part in feminist marches of the period; for instance, a Theosophical group operating under the banner of Universal Co-Freemasonry marched as part of the Women's Coronation Procession in 1911. =Ritual= The Theosophical Society did not prescribe any specific rituals for adherents to practice. However, ritualized practices have been established by various Theosophical groups; one such group is the Liberal Catholic Church. Another is the meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophy, which has been characterized as having a \\"quasi-sacred and quasi- liturgical\\" character. Historical development The Theosophical Society was largely the creation of two individuals: Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott. Established Christianity in the United States was experiencing challenges in the second half of the nineteenth century, a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, high rates of immigration, and the growing understanding of evolutionary theory which challenged traditional Christian accounts of history. Various new religious communities were established in different parts of the country, among them the Free Religious Association, New Thought, Christian Science, and Spiritualism. Theosophy would inherit the idea ‚Äî then popular in the United States ‚Äî that emphasized the idea of free will and the inevitability of progress, including on a spiritual level. It was also influenced by a growing knowledge about Asian religions in the United States. Prior to her arrival in the United States, Blavatsky had experience with esoteric currents like Spiritualism. It was through Spiritualism that Blavatsky and Olcott met. In 1884, Olcott established the first Scottish lodge, in Edinburgh. In 1980, Campbell noted that Theosophical books were selling at record levels. In the United States, Judge had been devoting himself to the promotion of Theosophy with little success. =Post- Blavatsky= During her lifetime, Blavatsky had suggested to many different persons that they would be her successor. Three of the most prominent candidates ‚Äî Olcott, Judge, and Besant ‚Äî all met in London shortly after her death to discuss the situation. Judge claimed that he too was in contact with the Masters, and that they had provided him with a message instructing him to co-delegate the Society's Esoteric Section with Besant. Olcott, however, suspected that the notes from the Masters which Judge was producing were forged, exacerbating tensions between them. Besant attempted to act as a bridge between the two men, while Judge informed her that the Masters had revealed to him a plot that Olcott was orchestrating to kill her. In 1893, Besant came down on Olcott's side in the argument and backed the internal proceedings that Olcott raised against Judge. A two-stage enquiry took place, which concluded that because the Society took no official stance on whether the Masters existed or not, Judge could not be considered guilty of forgery and would be allowed to retain his position. The details of this trial were leaked to the journalist F. Edmund Garrett, who used them as the basis of his critical book, Isis Very Much Unveiled. Judge then announced that the Masters had informed him that he should take sole control of the Esoteric Section, deposing Besant; she rejected his claims. Amid calls from Olcott that Judge should stand down, in April 1895 the American section voted to secede from the main Society. Judge remained its leader, but died within a year. Besant with the child Krishnamurti Olcott then sent Besant to the United States to gain support for the Adyar-based Society. In this she was successful, gaining thousands of new members and establishing many new branches. Besant had developed a friendship with the Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater, and together they co-wrote a number of books. Leadbeater was controversial, and concerns were raised when he was found to have instructed two boys in masturbation. The American Section of the Theosophical Society raised internal charges against him, although Besant came to his defense . In a move probably designed to limit negative publicity for the Society, they accepted his resignation rather than expelling him. On Olcott's death in 1907, he had nominated Besant to be his successor, and she was then elected to the position with a large majority in June. In her first years as the head of the Society, Besant oversaw a dramatic growth in its membership, raising it by 50%, to 23,000. She also oversaw an expansion of the Adyar property, from 27 to 253 acres. Besant was involved in various activist causes, promoting women's rights in India through the Women's Indian Association and helping to establish both the Central Hindu College and a Hindu girls' school. Besant also began a campaign for Indian Home Rule, founding a group called the Home Rule League. She established the New India newspaper, and after continuing to promote Indian independence in the paper's pages during the First World War she was interned for several months. This helped to boost her status within the independence movement, and at the age of 70 she was appointed President of the Indian National Congress, a largely honorary position. In December 1908, Leadbeater was readmitted to the Society; this generated a wave of resignations, with the Sydney branch seceding to form the Independent Theosophical Society. Leadbeater traveled to Adyar, where he met a young boy living there, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and pronounced him to be the next incarnation of a figure called the World Teacher. He subsequently took control of the boy's instruction for two years. With Besant, Leadbeater established a group known as the Order of the Star in the East to promote the idea of Krishnamurti as World Teacher. Leadbeater also wanted more ritual within Theosophy, and to achieve this he and J. I. Wedgwood became bishops in the Old Catholic Church. They then split from that to form their own Liberal Catholic Church, which was independent from the Theosophical Society (Adyar) while retaining an affiliation with it. The Church drew most of its membership from the Society and heavily relied upon its resources. However, in 1919 the Church was marred by police investigations into allegations that six of its priests had engaged in acts of pedophilia and Wedgewood ‚Äî who was implicated in the allegations ‚Äî resigned from the organization. The Raja Yoga Academy and the Temple of Peace, c. 1915 In retaliation, a \\"Back to Blavatsky\\" movement emerged within the Society. Its members pejoratively referred to Besant and her followers as practitioners of \\"Neo-Theosophy\\", objecting to the Liberal Catholic Church's allegiance to the Pope, and to the prominence that they were according to Besant and Leadbeater's publications. The main benefactor of the disquiet within the Back to Blavatsky movement was a rival group called the United Lodge of Theosophists. One of the most prominent figures to switch allegiance was B. P. Wadia. The United Lodge of Theosophists had been established in Los Angeles in 1909, when it had split from Judge's Theosophical Society in America, seeking to minimize formal organization. It focused on publishing new editions of Blavatsky and Judge's writings, as well as other books, which were usually released anonymously so as to prevent any personality cults developing within the Theosophical movement. The Adyar Society membership later peaked at 40,000 in the late 1920s. The Order of the Star had 30,000 members at its height. Krishnamurti himself repudiated these claims, insisting that he was not the World Teacher, and then resigned from the Society; the effect on the society was dramatic, as it lost a third of its membership over the coming few years. Besant died in 1933, when the Society was taken over by George Arundale, who led it until 1945; the group's activities were greatly curtailed by World War II. Judge left no clear successor as leader of the Theosophical Society in America, but the position was taken by Katherine Tingley, who claimed that she remained in mediumistic contact with Judge's spirit. Tingley launched an international campaign to promote her Theosophical group, sending delegations to Europe, Egypt, and India. In the latter country they clashed with the Adyar-based Theosophical Society, and were unsuccessful in gaining converts. Her leadership would be challenged by Ernest T. Hargrove in 1898, and when he failed he split to form his own rival group. In 1897, Tingley had established a Theosophical community, Lomaland, at Point Loma in San Diego, California. Various Theosophical writers and artists congregated there, while horticultural development was also emphasized. In 1919, the community helped establish a Theosophical University. Longstanding financial problems coupled with an aging population resulted in the Society selling Lomaland in 1942. Meanwhile, Tingley's death in 1929 had resulted in the Theosophical Society in America being taken over by Gottfried de Purucker, who promoted rapprochement with other Theosophical groups in what came to be known as the Fraternisation movement. Demographics Theosophical Society lodge building in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland Theosophical Hall in Palmerston North, New Zealand During its first century, Theosophy established itself as an international movement. Campbell believed that from its foundation until 1980, Theosophy had gained tens of thousands of adherents. He noted that in that latter year, there were circa 35,000 members of the Adyar-based Theosophical Society (9000 of whom were in India), c.5,500 members of the Theosophical Society in America, c.1500 members of the Theosophical Society International (Pasadena), and about 1200 members of the United Lodge of Theosophy. Membership of the Theosophical Society reached its highest peak in 1928, when it had 45,000 members. The HPB Lodge in Auckland, New Zealand was one of the world's largest, with over 500 members in 1949. Theosophical groups consist largely of individuals as opposed to family groups. Campbell noted that these members were alienated in ways from conventional social roles and practices. As noted by Dixon, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Theosophical Society \\"appealed above all to an elite, educated, middle- and upper-middle-class constituency\\". It was, in her words, \\"a religion for the 'thinking classes'.\\" Campbell stated that Theosophy attracted \\"unconventional, liberal-minded Westerners\\", and according to Dixon they were among those \\"who constituted themselves as the humanitarian conscience of the middle classes, a dissident minority who worked in a variety of parallel organizations to critique the dominant bourgeois values and culture.\\" Campbell also noted that Theosophy appealed to educated Asians, and particularly Indians, because it identified Asia as being central to a universal ancient religion and allowed Asians to retain traditional religious beliefs and practices within a modern framework. Reception and legacy Hammer and Rothstein believed that the formation and early history of the Theosophical Society was one of the \\"pivotal chapters of religious history in the West.\\" The Theosophical Society had significant effects on religion, politics, culture, and society. In the Western world, it was a major force for the introduction of Asian religious ideas. In 1980, Campbell described it as \\"probably the most important non-traditional or occult group in the last century\\", while in 2012 Santucci noted that it had had \\"a profound impact on the contemporary religious landscape\\". A Theosophical bookshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina In approaching Asian religion with respect and treating its religious beliefs seriously, Blavatsky and Olcott influenced South Asian society. In India, it played an important role in the Indian independence movement and in the Buddhist revival. The Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi developed much of his interest in Hindu culture after being given a copy of the Bhagavad Gita by two Theosophists. Alongside her support for Indian home rule, Besant had also supported home rule for Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Campbell suggested that Theosophy could be seen as a \\"grandfather\\" movement to this 20th century growth in Asian spirituality. Given the spread of such ideas in the West, some critics have perceived Theosophy's role as being largely obsolete. =Influence on the arts and culture= Many important figures, in particular within the humanities and the arts, were involved in the Theosophical movement and influenced by its teachings. Prominent scientists who had belonged to the Theosophical Society included the inventor Thomas Edison, the biologist Alfred Russel Wallace, and the chemist William Crookes. The educator Maria Montessori spent the World War II years as a guest at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society based in Adyar, India, along with her son Mario. During that period she opened schools and conducted courses for teachers in India. Theosophy also exerted an influence on the arts. Theosophy was also an influence over a number of early pioneers of abstract art. The Russian abstract expressionist Wassily Kandinsky was very interested in Theosophy and Theosophical ideas about colour. The Dutch abstract artist Piet Mondrian was also influenced by Theosophical symbolism. Theosophical ideas were also an influence on the Irish literary movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, with writers like Charles Johnston, George Russell, John Eglinton, Charles Weeks, and William Butler Yeats having an interest in the movement. The American adventure fiction writer Talbot Mundy included Theosophical themes in many of his works. He had abandoned his previous allegiance to Christian Science to join the Theosophical faction led by Tingley, joining the Society in 1923 and settling at the Point Loma community. =Influence on other religious and esoteric groups= The founders of many later new religious movements had been involved in Theosophy. Many esoteric groups ‚Äî such as Alice Bailey's Arcane School and Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy ‚Äî are \\"directly dependent\\" on Theosophy. Although he had split from Theosophy when renouncing Leadbeater's claim that he was the World Teacher, Krishnamurti continued to exhibit Theosophical influences in his later teachings. In 1923 a former Theosophist, the Anglo-American Alice Bailey, established the Arcane School, which also rested on claims regarding contact with the Ascended Masters. Another former Theosophist, the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, split from the Theosophical Society over the claims about Krishnamurti and then established his own Anthroposophical Society in 1913, which promoted Anthroposophy, a philosophy influenced by Theosophical ideas. Despite his departure from the Theosophists, Rudolf Steiner nevertheless maintained a keen interest in Theosophy for the rest of his life.Paull, John (2018) The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English, Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21‚Äì46. As Theosophy entered the V√∂lkisch movement of late 19th century Austria and Germany, it syncretized to form an eclectic occult movement known as Ariosophy. The most prominent Ariosophist, the Austrian Guido von List, was influenced by Theosophical ideas in creating his own occult system. In the United States during the 1930s, the I AM group was established by Guy Ballard and Edna Ballard; the group adopted the idea of the Ascended Masters from Theosophy. The idea of the Masters‚Äîand a belief in Morya and Kuthumi‚Äîhave also been adopted into the belief system of the Church Universal and Triumphant. The Canadian mystic Manly P. Hall also cited Blavatsky's writings as a key influence on his ideas. Theosophical ideas, including on the evolution of the Earth, influenced the teachings of British conspiracist David Icke. Hammer and Rothstein stated that Theosophy came to heavily influence \\"popular religiosity\\" and by the late twentieth and twenty- first centuries was \\"permeating just about every nook and cranny of contemporary \\"folk\\" religious culture\\" in Western countries. It was a major influence on the New Age milieu of the latter twentieth century. It played an important role in promoting belief in reincarnation among Westerners. =Scholarly research= Theosophy Hall in Manhattan, New York City A considerable amount of literature has been produced on the subject of Theosophy and the Theosophical Society. Most early publications on Theosophy fell into two camps: either apologetic and highly defensive, or highly antagonistic and aggressive towards the movement. As of 2001, the scholar of religion Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted that most of these works treated Theosophical doctrine as if it were a fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of how they have changed over the decades. Many articles on the historical development of the movement have also appeared in the journal Theosophical History. Many early scholars of religion dismissed Theosophy as being not worthy of study; Mircea Eliade for instance described Theosophy as a \\"detestable 'spiritual' hybridism\\". The academic study of the Theosophical current developed at the intersection of two scholarly sub-fields: the study of new religious movements, which emerged in the 1970s, and the study of Western esotericism. A significant proportion of the scholarship on Theosophy constitutes biographies of its leading members and discussions of events in the Society's history. In contrast to the significant amount of research focused on the first two generations of Theosophists, little has been produced on later figures. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers such as Steiner or Bailey. Hammer and Rothstein suggested that the \\"dearth of scholarly literature\\" on Theosophy was because \\"powerful individuals and institutions\\" in Europe and North America regarded the religion as \\"ludicrous\\", thus discouraging scholars from devoting their time to researching it.

Then it was introduced to the planetary public through the Heavy Metal Magazine, where it was published in sequels from 1998 to 2000. It 2016 it was published in France by YIL Editions, and republished in Serbia by Komiko. Story The novel consists of three stories, \\"The Wedgwood Tea Set\\", \\"The Horses of Saint Mark\\" and \\"The Third Argument\\". =\\"The Wedgwood Tea Set\\"= The story is told in the manner of magical realism. The story is told by a poor young man. He tells how he met a beautiful, rich young girl from the capital. The two met at the Faculty of Mathematics. The girl was looking for someone to help her prepare an exam, so the two start studying together. The young man would visit the girl's house early in the morning, the two would study, the breakfast would be served, after which the two would continue studying. As the time passes, the girl realizes the young man is lagging behind her. When the day of the exam comes, the girl passes, while the young man fails to appear to take the exam. Months pass, with the girl wondering where the young man is. The two meet during the winter, agreeing to study together for the following exam. When the exam comes, she passes, discovering he did not even apply to take it. The two meet during spring and, for the third time, decide to study together. After weeks of studying, the girl passes, while the young man, once again, does not appear on the exam. Among his books left at the girl's house she discovers his student card, which reveals to her that they do not even attend the same faculty. Wondering why he would spend months of studying something that has nothing to do with his studies, the girl comes to the conclusion that it must have been because he was in love with her. Searching for him, she finds out from his African friends that he went home, to Greece, to a village near Thessaloniki. The girl goes to Greece and finds his house. After dinner, the young man shows her his white bull. The two make love on the bull's back, while it runs across the fields. In the autumn, the young man proposes to the girl that they study together again and she agrees, deciding not to mention that she is aware that they do not attain the same faculty. The girl does not feel surprised when the young man does not appear on the exam, but does feel surprised when she does not meet him during following months. Sitting in her living room and wondering whether his feelings for her were real, the girl spots the Wedgwood tea set on the table, with a relief of a girl and a bull on the teapot. She then realizes that the young man spent months and months studying with her only so he could have breakfast in her house. She starts wondering if it is possible that the young man actually hated her. The story concludes with the young man's words: \\"My name was Balkans. Her name ‚Äì Europe.\\" =\\"The Horses of Saint Mark\\"= The story of the Trojan War is \\"Slavicized\\", with Slavic names for Hellenic gods and heroes and numerous anachronisms. In 4000 BC, a young girl is taken to the forest by the Danube by two older man. They give her instructions about looking into the future. She sees the events happening in 12th century BC through the eyes of Pari≈æ (Paris). Pari≈æ declares how, in the times when Troy still \\"stood on ships\\", a woman breastfeeding him fell asleep and had a vision of Troy in flames because of a child \\"born on the day the mares were taken to the field to be fertilized by the wind\\". After realizing it is Pari≈æ, the Trojans decide to kill him, but the sailor who is ordered to do it is bribed and Pari≈æ is saved. Years later, Pari≈æ's father Primu≈æ (Priam) is hunting. After failing to hit a deer from his crossbow, he turns to an \\"unfortunate and unworthy\\" way to catch the deer: he prays in order to \\"tie his prey with his prayer\\". He takes the dead deer home, where it is skinned. Primu≈æ and his wife lay in deer's skin and make love. When the child is born, his mother, as a repent for his father's sin, names him Jelen (Slavic word for \\"deer\\"). When he grows up, it becomes clear that he would not be as beautiful and strong as his older brother, Pari≈æ. However, Jelen is clairvoyant and is sent to a monastery to learn how to use his gift. The Judgement of Paris takes place (with three goddesses in this version being three female prophets), and Pari≈æ pronounces Venu≈°a (Aphrodite) the most beautiful after she promises him Jelena (Helen), the wife of the emperor Menelau≈° (king Menelaus). Meanwhile, Jelen is taken to the \\"Emperor City\\" (Constantinople) by his teachers, where he is shown four bronze horses \\"made in the time of Lesandar (Alexander)\\". He is told that every time the horses move an empire falls. Jelen is, similar to the girl from the story's beginning, left on the coast of a lake. After several days, he sees a white unicorn, and manages to see into the future: Pari≈æ's visit to Sparta, taking of Jelena to Troy and the beginning of the Trojan War. After that, Jelen sees how the Crusaders move the Horses of Saint Mark from Constantinople to Rome, and then a number of dramatic historical events from the future. The story then turns to a contemporary newspaper article about one of the bronze horses being removed from their place at the St Mark's Basilica in Venice in order to go under a restoration. Pari≈æ declares that, at the end of his visions, Jelen saw \\"you [the reader], who are staring into this images believing you are out of the game\\". The story returns to the young girl on the coast of Danube, who meets a white unicorn. =\\"The Third Argument\\"= The storyteller tells the story of Hern√°n Cort√©s reaching the Aztec Empire with his troops. Despite having only 400 soldiers, he is convinced in his victory over Aztecs out of three arguments. First, he has 16 horses, which Aztecs believed were evil gods. Second, there was an Aztec legend about a golden-haired god expatriated from the continent, but who will return, coming from the east, in \\"the year of reed\\"; Cort√©s had blonde hair, and the year of the god's return was, according to Aztec calendar, 1519, the year of Cort√©s' coming. The third argument was \\"too complicated to be written or drawn. Thus it remains unknown. The third argument was, however, without any doubt, perfectly clear and known to every one of Cort√©s' soldiers.\\" The Spanish march into Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma II offers them peace. One of Moctezuma's closest counselors is sacrificed to the gods; as the storyteller explains, Aztecs believed that the human sacrifice is more valuable if the sacrificed was someone close to the person who offers the sacrifice. After the rebellion against Moctezuma, Cort√©s has to deal with the rebels and the Tenochtitlan officially falls into the hands of the Spanish. The story turns to the legend of Juan Diego. During one winter, a poor Indian hunter has a vision of a woman (in the legend of Diego, the apparition was of Virgin Mary, but in this version she resembles Aztec goddess). He tells a catholic missionary that the vision told him they should build a temple. The priest asks for a proof, and the Indian returns to the place where he had a vision. Finding nothing, he returns to the priest and, while declaring the woman is gone, fresh roses fall from his robe, which convinces the priest the vision was real. On the place of the vision Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe was built. The storyteller (presumably Paviƒá) describes his visit to Mexico City and the Basilica. Every year a large number of people attend the festivities in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Every time a murder happens; as the storyteller explains, it is quite often that someone kills his friend \\"in the moment of true intimacy\\". One such case included a taxi driver who said to his friend: \\"Wait here, I'm going to fetch a knife. I'm going to kill you\\", after which he stabbed his friend, who waited peacefully, to death. The storyteller declares: \\"One evening, returning alone from a dinner, I was thinking about that event. In the dead of night I was passing through huge and desert park Chapultepec. However, there was no need for fear. In the huge and foreign city around me, among millions of inhabitants of Ciudad de M√©xico, there was no man who loved me. I was completely safe. The Cort√©s' third argument is, evidently, still valid.\\"  Critical reception  The comic album was well received by critics in Serbia. Serbian writer and critic Pavle Zeliƒá in a review wrote: \\"Authors have, in a very precise manner, touched the spirit, the essence of the oneiric, entangled and then disentangled style, which attracted so many readers to Paviƒá' prose.\\" Journalist and critic Jelena Tasiƒá wrote: \\"Done after the recipe of three colors ‚Äì white, red and blue, stories themselves offer interpretation of their own spectrum, which as opposed to phrases of the enlightened, rational European thoughts on 'Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©', differ and come to persisting Balkan categories of future, present and past.\\" Painter, poet and essayist Slobodan ≈†keroviƒá wrote about the comic: \\"Mystical charge is not allowing a reader/watcher to unleash imagination but it takes him to the realm where quiet buzzing of instruments of art overcomes the need for unquestionably solid form of ordered existence.\\"\\"Trilogy The Third Argument\\", Slobodan ≈†keroviƒá, Projekat Rastko He also wrote: \\"'Wedgwood's Tea Set' is a mythological quest for the meaning, told by a rich visual language and strict narrative suspense.

American comic book artist, writer and editor Archie Goodwin described the album as a \\"truly visually brilliant graphic novel\\". Polish critic Artur Dlugosz wrote: \\"A sensual comic 'Wedgwood's Tea Set' of the duo Tuciƒá and Stefanoviƒá, attracts with its colors and execution technique.

It belongs to the gasdermin family which is conserved among all vertebrates and comprises six members, GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, GSDME (DFNA5) and DFNB59 (Pejvakin). Members of the gasdermin family are mainly expressed in epithelial tissues and appear to play a role in regulation of epithelial proliferation and differentiation. GSDMA, GSDMC, GSDMD and DFNA5 have been suggested to act as tumour suppressors.  Structure  Structure of GSDMD C-terminal domain The structure of GSDMD consists of two domains, the 31 kDa N-terminal (GSDMD-N) and 22 kDa C-terminal (GSDMD-C) domains, separated by a linker region. GSDMD-C can be divided into four subdomains and is composed of 10 Œ±-helices and two Œ≤-strands, forming a compact globular fold. The linker helix contacts the two helix-repeats which consist of four-helix bundles. The middle domain comprises an antiparallel Œ≤-strand and a short Œ±-helix. The first flexible loop of GSDMD-C, which is located between GSDMD-N and the linker helix, stretches out and inserts into the GSDMD-N pocket, stabilising the conformation of the full-length protein.  Function  Several current studies have revealed that GSDMD serves as a specific substrate of inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, -5 and -11) and as an effector molecule for the lytic and highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Hence, GSDMD is an essential mediator of host defence against microbial infection and danger signals. The pore-forming activity of the N-terminal cleavage product causes cell swelling and lysis to prevent intracellular pathogens from replicating, and is required for the release of cytoplasmic content such as the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤) into the extracellular space to recruit and activate immune cells to the site of infection. GSDMD has an additional potential role as an antimicrobial by binding to cardiolipin (CL) and form pores on bacterial membranes. Autoinhibition Under normal conditions, the full-length GSDMD is inactive as the linker loop between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains stabilises the overall conformation of the full-length protein and allows GSDMD-C to fold back on and auto-inhibit GSDMD-N from inducing pyroptosis. Upon interdomain cleavage by inflammatory caspases, the auto-inhibition is relieved and GSDMD-N cytotoxicity is triggered. Activation GSDMD can be cleaved and activated by inflammatory caspases through both the canonical and non-canonical pyroptotic pathways. =Canonical inflammasome pathway= Caspase-1, conserved in vertebrates, is involved in the canonical pathway and is activated by canonical inflammasomes such as NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes, which are multi-protein complexes that are formed upon recognition of specific inflammatory ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the cytosol by NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Examples include bacterial type 3 secretion system (T3SS) rod protein and flagellin, which are potent activators of NLRC4 inflammasome, and bacterial toxin nigericin that activates NLRP3 inflammasome. =Non- canonical inflammasome pathway= Caspase-11 in mice and its human homolog caspase-4 and -5 are involved in the non-canonical pathway and are activated by directly binding cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) secreted by gram- negative bacteria. Upon activation of these caspases, GSDMD undergoes proteolytic cleavage at Asp-275, which is sufficient to drive pyroptosis. Mechanism Overview of GSDMD activation and pore-forming mechanism After the proteolytic cleavage, GSDMD-C remains in the cytosol while the N-terminal cleavage product localises to the plasma membrane by anchoring to membrane lipids. GSDMD-N specifically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P] on the inner leaflet of mammalian cell membrane strongly, through charge-charge interactions between the negatively-charged head groups of PI and the positively-charged surface on GSDMD-N exposed after cleavage. Hence, collateral damage to tissues during an infection is minimised as the extracellular outer leaflet lacks PI. Lipid binding allows GSDMD-N to insert into the lipid bilayer and induces high-order oligomerisation within the membrane, forming extensive pores with approximately 16 subunits and an inner diameter of 10-14 nm. The osmotic potential is disrupted by pore formation, leading to cell swelling and lysis, the morphologic hallmarks of pyroptosis. The pores also serve as a protein secretion channel to facilitate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines for rapid innate immune response. GSDMD-N can also undergo cytoplasmic distribution and selectively bind to CL on inner and outer leaflets of intracellular bacterial membranes, or be secreted from pyroptotic cells through the pores into the extracellular milieu to target and kill extracellular bacteria. Clinical significance Pyroptosis, which can now be defined as gasdermin-mediated necrotic cell death, acts as an immune defence against infection. Hence, failure to express or cleave GSDMD can block pyroptosis and disrupt the secretion of IL-1Œ≤, and eventually unable to ablate the replicative niche of intracellular bacteria. Mutation of GSDMD is associated with various genetic diseases and human cancers, including brain, breast, lung, urinary bladder, cervical, skin, oral cavity, pharynx, colon, liver, cecum, stomach, pancreatic, prostate, oesophageal, head and neck, hematologic, thyroid and uterine cancers. Recently, studies have revealed that downregulation of GSDMD promotes gastric cancer proliferation due to the failure to inactivate ERK 1/2, STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are involved in cell survival and tumour progression. However, sepsis and lethal septic shock can result from overactivation of pyroptosis. The critical role of GSDMD in pore formation during pyroptosis provides a new avenue for future drug development for treating inflammatory caspase-associated auto-inflammatory conditions, sepsis and septic shock.  Interactions  GSDMD-N has been shown to interact with: * Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate * Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate * Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate * Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate * Phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate * Phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate * Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate * Phosphatidic acid * Phosphatidylserine * Phosphatidylethanolamine * Cardiolipin  See also  * Pyroptosis * Inflammasome * GSDMA * GSDMB * GSDMC * DFNA5 * Caspases * Caspase-1 * Caspase-4 * Caspase-5 * Caspase-11 * Interleukin-1Œ≤  References   Further reading  * ","title":"GSDMD"},{"id":"51429083","text":"Audrey Cefaly is an American playwright.

Yarris has stated he was the victim of sexual abuse as a child, although his family doubt this allegation. This made him a wild, uncontrollable boy addicted to alcohol, drugs and petty crime in his teens. One day Yarris and a friend stole a car. When they got to a garage, the owner offered them $200 for the car. Yarris and his friend accepted and began stealing cars in order to raise money for their growing drug addiction. On one of these occasions, Yarris was blasting music while driving under the influence when he was stopped by police in his native state of Pennsylvania. The officer and Yarris got into a physical confrontation, and a shot was fired, The policeman managed to handcuff Yarris, put him in the back of his car and call for reinforcement. Yarris was then charged with stealing a car, driving under the influence, the kidnapping of a police officer, attempted murder of a police officer, reckless endangerment, possession of a firearm, robbery and resisting arrest. While in jail, Yarris, facing life in prison, spotted a newspaper article about the murder and rape of Linda Mae Craig. In The Fear of 13, the documentary based on his life, Yarris recalls how \\"something about that newspaper kept calling me.\\" To try and get out of jail time, he claimed that a man named Jimmy, a former drug addict thought to be dead by overdose, was involved in the rape and murder of Linda Mae Craig. When Jimmy turned up alive and with no involvement in Craig's murder, Yarris became the number-one suspect. In 1981, Yarris was charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Craig, a woman he had never met in his life. At the time, Yarris was a 20-year-old drug addict who had been thrown out on the streets by his family. The original charges, including the attempted murder of a police officer, were dismissed when the policeman involved told the jury he had been punched by Yarris, but then failed to corroborate his version through photographic evidence. In a second trial, however, Yarris was found guilty of murdering Craig. In 1982 Yarris, 21 at the time, was sentenced to death and sent to death row. In 2003, DNA evidence proved that he had not committed the crime, and in 2004 he was released. After his release, Yarris moved to the UK where he married his second wife and had a daughter who he is estranged from. His wife subsequently divorced him on the grounds of adultery. He then met his third wife and moved back to the USA where she divorced him. After moving back to the UK, Yarris met his current and fourth wife who appears to still be with him although he has recently admitted to committing further adultery. He sued the Delaware County District Attorney's Office for malicious prosecution and the case eventually settled for $3 million in 2008. Despite receiving this settlement, along with other substantial amounts for 'The Fear of 13', 'Seven Days to Life' amongst other projects, Yarris appears to be financially destitute and often asks his social media followers for financial assistance. Yarris is the subject of the documentary The Fear of 13 released in 2015. He is the author of the autobiography Seven Days to Live My Life (2008),. He has also published books called The Kindness Approach (2017), My Journey Through Her Eyes (2017) and Monsters and Madmen (2018). He has an upcoming film which is the follow-up to The Fear of 13, as revealed on the True Geordie podcast.

Biography =Early life= Born in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, Leander Desmaisi√®res belongs to an ancient family of Hainaut, including several members were Provost Marshals Tournai; one of his ancestors, Jean Desmaisi√®res, Lord of Vassal, was deputy to the States General held in Brussels in 1633. =Military career= Desmaisi√®res studied at the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris from 1812 to 1814. In 1814-1815, he was a lieutenant in the troops of the Count of Artois and subsequently (1815-1824) engineer officer in the army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The revolution of 1830 found him married and settled in Ghent where he was incorporated into the civic guard. His military background, public esteem he enjoyed made him successively elected captain, major, and finally on June 13, 1831, colonel of the second legion of =Political career= The services rendered by Leander Desmaisi√®res came under difficult circumstances, all of which increased greatly its recognition and popularity in Ghent. On November 6, 1832, he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives, a position he would hold until 1847. In this meeting called to practice the principles of constitutional liberty passed by Congress, Leander Desmaisi√®res was, for several consecutive years, in charge of the budget report of the war, including that of 1838. He intervened in the discussion of laws on the establishment of a military school, on the position and advancement of officers and military pensions. He also proposed solutions to various issues related to industry and finance. It is at the top of the twenty-three signatories of the proposal was intended to establish a protective tariff for the cotton industry. In 1837, the member for Ghent was selected for Rapporteur of the commission to investigate defects in the legislation on sugars; the conclusions of the report are adopted after a lively discussion. Around the same time, he took a great part in the discussion of the tariff on cattle, and in that of the general law on transit. MP Ghent was the rapporteur of the central section to the bill that increased the admission of foreign paintings (Act of 1834), which was a simple right balance of one percent from the Dutch fare. His work, embracing all matters relating to the flax industry, and indicating means, practiced subsequently to mitigate the effects of flax crisis we could already foresee the appearance of the introduction of new work mechanical, was passed by the House, despite opposition from ministers. The adoption of the law prepared the conclusion of a trade agreement with France. This measure came to the aid of weavers and spinners of Flanders. We also saw the export of their products in 1833, only reached a value of 8 million Belgian francs, rising in 1838 to twice that value. It was also in 1838 that was established under the chairmanship of Leander Desmaisi√®res, the Association for the Advancement of the flax industry, who rendered great service to the working class during the crises caused by the processing industry. This association were born all these committees, these workshops apprenticeships, manufacturing these schools. In 1839, the member was appointed government commissioner at the Bank of Belgium for the loan of four million Belgian francs. French shareholders wished to request the dissolution and liquidation of the company. Leander Desmaisi√®res much to change the resolution. In return, shareholders spontaneously proposed to the king to his appointment as director of the bank. He was convinced that the major powers of the world made rather generous conditions in the 1839 Tready of London and thus he voted in favor with reservations which were granted in part by the conference, particularly as regards the boundaries of Luxembourg the following gauging barrels fixing entitlement to the Scheldt and the Terneuzen canal.

Before emancipation, he was an active abolitionist, and during the American Civil War he went to New Bern, North Carolina where he preached for the church to the black people and soldiers in the area. He was very successful and became an important religious and political leader in North Carolina, becoming \\"one of the most significant and crucial African American religious and race leaders during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\\".Martin 1999, p 3 By 1887 he had founded over six hundred churches in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and erected about five hundred church buildings.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p 133‚Äì143 He was politically and religiously active as well, supporting education, civil rights, and the ordination of women.  Early life  James Walker Hood was born in Kennett township, Chester County, Pennsylvania on May 30, 1831 to Harriet and Levi Hood and had eleven siblings.Martin 1999, p 24 Hood fought for his right to ride public transport from boyhood. Between 1848 and 1863, he noted that conductors on the Pennsylvania railroads many times tried to remove him from the first class cars, but rarely succeeded. He also actively spoke against slavery. Hood was first licensed to preach around 1852, and in 1855, Hood moved to New York City and in 1856 was licensed to preach in a branch of the Union Church of Africans in the city.Martin 1999, p xvi In 1860 he was ordained deacon in the AME Zion church and sent to the Nova Scotia mission in Halifax. In 1863 he was stationed at Bridgeport, Connecticut, and after six months was appointed missionary by Bishop J. J. Clinton sent to North Carolina to replace another missionary, John Williams, who was not prompt enough in travelling south due to safety issues. Hood arrived in Washington, DC by January 1, 1864, and reached New Bern on January 20.Martin 1999, p 51  Move to North Carolina  Clinton's sending of missionaries to North Carolina was at the general invitation to churches for missionaries to his department by General Butler who was in charge of the area at that point in the US Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Black soldiers stationed at New Bern at that time did not have a chaplain, and Hood often preached to the troops. His position was informal and he never held a commission, but he was called \\"chaplain\\". Hood was present for attacks on New Bern by Confederate troops before the war ended although not under direct fire. In New Bern, Hood preached at the Andrews Chapel and largely succeeded to make his church the primary church of blacks in the area. Hood was active in political and social movements as well. In October 1865 in Raleigh, North Carolina, Hood was elected president at what may have been the first convention of colored people held in the South, part of the Colored Conventions Movement. In 1867 he was a delegate at the Constitutional Convention of North Carolina and played such a major part that some opponents called the resulting constitution, \\"Hood's Constitution\\". The document was amended in 1875 and many of the provisions Hood fought to include were weakened or removed. His influence was heavily felt in the provision of rights for blacks in homestead law and at public school. He was very active in securing support for the constitution as well. In 1868, he was made a commissioner for the states public schools and assistant superintendent of public instruction in North Carolina and held the positions for three years. In 1868, he demanded and obtained cabin passage on Cape Fear River steamships, thereby integrating the steamships on those rivers. The agents of the steamers claimed that they only allowed his action because the area was under military authority. However, Hood stated that his right was from God, and the steamships remained integrated after reconstruction ended. Remembering his earlier struggles riding Pennsylvania rail cars, he endeavored to assert his right to ride in otherwise white rail cars in the south as well. His office in the school board were in Raleigh, while his primary church responsibilities were in Charlotte North Carolina, so he would travel to Charlotte on weekends three Sundays per month to preach. The remaining Sunday he would preach for Methodist and Baptist congregations in Raleigh, as there was not yet an AME Zion church in that city. Before 1870 he received a commission from General Oliver O. Howard as assistant superintendent of schools in the Freedmen's Bureau. In this role by 1870 he had established a department for schooling for the deaf, dumb, and blind in the Bureau. He also worked to create an integrated State University, but was not successful due to the opposition of Democrats in the state legislature after they gained control of that body in 1870. He was a delegate to the 1872 Republican National Convention and temporary chairman of the Republican State convention in 1876.  National and international prominence  He was elected bishop of the General Conference at its session in North Carolina on July 1, 1872 and served until 1916.Martin, 1999, p 4, 88 He was elected a member of the Ecumenical Conference in London in 1881, and was president of that body in 1891 when it met in Washington DC.Anthony B. Pinn, African American Religious Cultures, ABC-CLIO, 2009, p71 He presided over the first day of the centennial gathering of the Methodist Church in 1885 in Baltimore. As a conservative Bishop, he was not without critics, including progressives within the church such as John W. Smith, John J. Smyer, Alexander Walters, and especially Henry McNeal Turner.Martin 1999, p 194, xvi However, he was strongly supported in North Carolina and beyond. He published a volume of sermons with an introduction by Atticus Green Haygood in 1884 entitled The Negro in the Christian Pulpit, which was the first collection of sermons published by an African American.  Other activities and social positions  He established Livingstone College in North Carolina in 1882. He also established and contributed to journals associated with AME Zion church, Star of Zion newspaper and AMEZ Quarterly Review.Hill, Samuel S., Charles H. Lippy, and Charles Reagan Wilson. Encyclopedia of Religion in the South. Mercer University Press, 2005. p386 He was a strong advocate against smoking and drinking, and supported the ordination of women.Martin 1999, p 172 He worked to merge black Methodist churches, supported the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and worked for civil rights. He was a Master Mason, eventually becoming the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, North Carolina Jurisdiction, and later was a founder of the King Solomon Lodge,Bishir, Catherine W.

Similarly to her father, Burchfield had an affinity for flowering plants, trees and landscapes. She painted almost exclusively with watercolors and is known for her depictions of nature throughout the seasons, and landscapes of rural America. She is known by the customary signature \\"M. Burchfield\\" on all her paintings. Including those painted after the change of her surname following her marriage in 1946 to Henry Richter. Her paintings and drawings can be found in the Smithsonian, Ford Motor Company, SUNY Buffalo State, and the Burchfield-Penney Art Center. She has been the subject of exhibitions at the Butler Institute of American Art, the Sisti Gallery in Buffalo, Central Park Gallery in Buffalo and the Buffalo Garret Club. She has also had solo exhibits in cities around American including Detroit, Salem and Youngstown. The largest collection of Burchfield's paintings and studies are in the personal collection of Louise Simon Schoene of West Seneca, New York. Schoene owns the copyright to all of Richter's works and is organizing an exhibit of Burchfield's paintings as part of a three-generational Burchfield exhibition scheduled for April 2017 at the Kenan Center in Lockport, New York. Additionally, Schoene loaned seven of Burchfield's paintings to the producers of the feature-length movie Marshall, a biography of Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice, which was filmed in Buffalo in summer 2016.  Life  = Early years = Born in Buffalo, New York, on June 28, 1924, Burchfield was raised by her parents, Charles, a painter who also worked for a time as a designer at the H.M. Birge wallpaper company, and Bertha (n√©e Kenreich) Burchfield, a homemaker. At 2 years of age, Burchfield with her family moved to the Gardenville area of West Seneca, New York, where she remained for the rest of her life. Burchfield was the second oldest of five children. She and her siblings, Mary Alice, Sarah Ruth (Sally), Catherine and Arthur grew up across the street from the 29-acre Island Park, which in 1999 became the Charles E.

Burchfield Nature & Art Center. Retrieved 15 August 2013. From thereon, he was able to support the family through his artwork. From early childhood, Burchfield loved to draw and paint. She was encouraged by her father and her talent was evident. At age 12, she won a drawing contest earning her $1 and a story in the paper.Gardenville Press, 1936 = Education =  Childhood and adolescent education  Burchfield attended Gardenville High School, which was named for its location in the Gardenville section of West Seneca. The school system promoted Richter one grade and she ended up in the same class as her sister Mary Alice who was a year older. On her 17th birthday in 1941, Burchfield became the salutatorian of her graduating class while Mary Alice was named valedictorian.Gardenville Press,1941  Further education  After graduation, Burchfield attended Albright Art School in Buffalo for one year studying with artists Philip C. Elliott and Florence Julia Bach. With the help of scholarships, she followed in her father's footsteps and studied at the Cleveland Institute of Art. Her mentors at the institute included such artists as William Joseph Eastman, Carl Frederick Gaertner, and Paul Travis. Her aunt, Louise Burchfield, served as the institute's assistant curator of painting at the institute.Buffalo Evening News, August 1951 = Family and personal life =  Family of artists  Along with Richter, her sister Catherine Burchfield Parker (1926-2012) and daughter, Peggy Richter Haug (Born May 11, 1948), also became painters. Parker painted more abstracts but Peggy also liked to paint landscapes and said she loved the Western New York countryside. When Haug was a teenager and young adult, she participated in three-generational exhibits alongside her mother and grandfather.Peggy Haug interview, July 15, 2016  Marriage  On August 3, 1946, Burchfield married Henry (Hank) Richter, a local boy who served for three and a half years in the Army Air Force in the European Theater. The couple was married in her parents' home, with siblings Catherine and Arthur Burchfield serving as maid of honor and best man respectively.Buffalo Evening News, August 1946 The couple lived on Cloverside Drive in West Seneca, just a little more than a mile from her parents' home. She was the only one of the five children to remain in West Seneca through adulthood. Martha and Henry raised three children. Along with daughter Peggy, she had two sons: Tom (born Sept. 20, 1949) and David (born June 9, 1953). She stayed home with the children while he served as the assistant to the highway superintendent for the Town of West Seneca. He also worked as a flight instructor and FAA examiner. In news interviews, Richter talked about her love of cooking, sewing and raising children, but she also spoke to her yearning to create art. In an April 1960 interview with Jean Reeves in the Buffalo Evening News titled \\"Amid Houseful of Distractions, Woman Artist Paints on,\\" Richter said, \\"All my life I wanted to be an artist. But I fought against it. I'd stand in front of Dad's paintings and I'd think Why try? But they inspired me, too. But it was a lost cause, and I decided that all I really wanted to do was paint, so why fight it? Painting isn't something I took up as a means of escape from dishes and diapers. The urge to paint was there before any frustration with housework. A serious artist paints because he has to; it's an inborn drive.\\"Buffalo Evening News, Jean Reaves, April 1960 An article in The Buffalo Evening News (November 30, 1946) reported that when she got married four months previously she had planned to give up painting if it interfered with her housework. \\"She is, however, pleased to discover that she can manage both and in addition to having dinner ready when her husband returns from work she frequently greets him with a new watercolor.\\"Buffalo Evening News, November 30, 1946 Peggy Richter Haug described her childhood like this, \\"We grew up going out to the countryside often. My mom would pile us kids in the car and she would then search for an old or deserted house or barn. We would climb all over and explore while she would paint.\\" She also described her mother as devoted to home and children; she remembers her mother making dinner for the family every evening.  Her studio  Although Burchfield favored en plein air painting, she also had a studio for convenience and unfavorable weather. For many years during her marriage, Richter painted in her bedroom. Eventually, her husband contracted to have an artist studio built for Richter above the garage. = Death = Much of her last few years are known through an interview with Peggy Haug, Burchfield Richter's daughter, taken on July 15, 2016 by Laurie Kaiser a writer from Buffalo. Burchfield was very close to her father and following her father's death in 1967 suffered greatly. \\"she was very emotionally attached to her father... it was difficult for her when he died.\\" Throughout most of her lifetime Richter suffered from depression. She saw psychiatrists for her depression and they prescribed tranquilizers and sleeping pills, which often left her in a fog instead of feeling better. While her depression was a very difficult for her and her family, Haug describes her as someone who embraced the good and the bad. \\"From her, we got the ability to live fully, she grabbed hold of life and was fun-loving. Women in those days didn't have the means to express themselves. They didn't know how. But she did.\\" Burchfield's mental state deteriorated in the mid-1970s after her children had left home. On April 10, 1977, aged 52, she committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates.  Artist style and influences  July Reflections, 1972. Burchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo. Burchfield painted almost exclusively with watercolors, often employing a dry technique (using little water) over a pencil sketch, much as her father did. She was known for painting en plein air ‚Äî on the scene and in the open. Burchfield loved summer and relished painting summer scenes, saying that is \\"when I feel most alive.\\"Buffalo News, August 10, 1959. Story by Jean Reeves She was known for driving around until she found a painting location that appealed to her. In the opening notes to the program for her solo exhibition at the Butler Institute of American Art in October 1966, Charles Burchfield described Burchfield's watercolors as having \\"an unspoiled, innocent freshness about them; lyrical in character, with also a tinge of primitiveness. With experience and increasing knowledge, the primitive note has vanished, but the lyrical quality has remained and grown steadily, to which has been added the drama of light and an awareness of the more sophisticated problems of landscape painting. She has an inborn sense of pattern and composition, strikingly evident in her childhood attempts, which has carried through into her mature work.\\"Butler Institute of American Art Program for October 1966 exhibit In November 1960 the editors of Ford Magazine used eight of Burchfield's paintings to illustrate a four-page story about Gardenville, New York.Alden Advertiser, September 14, 1961 All of Burchfield's instructors insisted that she not be influenced by her father and told her to develop her own style to which she replied, \\"Every young artist is influenced by someone, even my father.\\"Buffalo Evening News, August 10, 1959 Jean Reeves Charles taught her \\"to see\\" nature on trips across the countryside to paint with him and taught her some of his techniques. Consequently, there was a continual comparison between her work and that of her famous father that she could not escape.Buffalo News, Trevor Thomas, April 1960 Art critic and abstract artist Trevor Thomas wrote that Richter \\"commands an almost impeccable cleanliness of rendering and handles the accepted hieroglyphics for trees, leaves, grass, flowers, and old houses with accustomed assurance.\\" He also compared her style to her father's, saying that while Charles had the intuitive ability to evoke a sense of mystery and wonder behind the appearances of ordinary scenes, Burchfield \\"is content to look at what she views and to delineate it with a given vocabulary of colors and an accepted grammar of strokes. She does not probe beneath the surface for the inherent magic or mystery. She can set the scene well but the drama remains offstage.\\" She won awards for her work, including first prize from that Buffalo Society of Artists \\"Statler Show\\" in Buffalo on May 4, 1950, along with many other first prizes and honorable mentions at various local exhibitions. She also taught painting in adult education courses held in West Seneca.Buffalo Courier-Express, \\"Photograph of Peggy Richter, Martha Burchfield Richter, and Mrs. Charles Burchfield\\", c.1968; newsprint.  Exhibits  At age 21, Burchfield had her first one- person show at the Art Institute of Buffalo. An article about the show in the November 30, 1945 Buffalo Evening News compared her to her father as a \\"regionalist.\\" \\"Western New York's meadows, creeks, roads, and small towns are sensitively recorded by her brushes‚Ä¶.If there is a quality, rather than a technique, which she shares with her famous father, it is the spirit of fantasy that animates her skies, mottling the horizons with clouds that seem under pressures of wind to achieve a full, rolling boil.\\"Buffalo Evening News, November 30, 1945 The next year she participated in a group exhibition, \\"Advent of Spring,\\" with the Buffalo Society of Artists, repeating an exhibition with that group in 1948 at the Albright Art Gallery. In 1960, she exhibited in a solo show at the Junior League of Buffalo's clubroom, and in 1961, she had another solo exhibition of 24 watercolors at the Sisti Gallery in Buffalo. Also, in 1961, she had 25 of her works exhibited at the Canisius College Library. She had a solo exhibition of 38 paintings and a few drawings at Central Park Gallery in Buffalo, New York, from 1968 to 1969. In 1967, another solo show at the Sisti Gallery resulted in a near sell-out of her paintings, two of which were purchased by newspaper art critics.Buffalo Courier-Express, April 23, 1967 In spring 1968, the Lakeview Gallery of Art in Hamburg, New York, hosted a three-generational exhibit featuring the work of Charles Burchfield, Martha Burchfield and, Peggy Richter, who was only 19 years old and a volunteer working with Trinity Lutheran Church on the lower east side New York City to help poor black and Puerto Rican families. D.K. Winebrenner, a writer with the Buffalo Courier-Express (February 3, 1968) described Burchfield's work as \\"well-composed, structurally sound and painted with great sympathy for the subject.\\"Buffalo Courier-Express, D.K. Winebrenner, February 3, 1968 In 1973, Burchfield again exhibited with her father and her daughter at the Raydon Gallery in New York City in the show \\"Three Generations of Burchfields,\\" which included 68 combined watercolors.

She made four complete whale-hunting voyages and was wrecked in the Coral Sea in April 1820 during her fifth whaling voyage. Design Echo was the sole vessel of her class. Her designer was John Henslow, and she was identical with his contemporaneous except that Echo was a ship-sloop and Busy was a brig-sloop. Henslow's designs were in competition with a brig-sloop and a ship-sloop designed at the same time by Sir William Rule. Rule's design won as the Admiralty ultimately ordered 106 Cruizer-class brig-sloops. Naval career Commander Graham Hammond commissioned Echo in October 1797 for the North Sea. On 23 March 1798 Echo was scouting ahead of Apollo and the rest of her squadron when Echo discovered a cutter that she immediately chased. The cutter ran ashore a few miles north of Camperdown where her crew abandoned her when boats from the ships of the squadron deployed to attempt to bring her off. Surf, and the lateness of the hour prevented the British from recovering the cutter so they destroyed her. She had been armed with 10 guns and was out of Dunkirk. Commander John Allen replaced Hammond in January 1799 and sailed Echo to the Jamaica station. Captain E.T. Smith of , and senior officer of a squadron patrolling off Havana, instructed Allen on 14 May to proceed to New Providence to re-provision and refill his water casks. After he had completed this, Allen sailed to stretch between the Dry Tortugas and the Colorados in an attempt to rejoin the squadron. Although Allen and Echo remained there until 3 July. On that morning Allen sighted three vessels, the largest of which seemed the most suspicious. Echo gave chase and at 7p.m. the quarry raised French colours and fired a shot. Echo caught up with her at 9p.m., and after a few shots from Echo, and a few broadsides from the French vessel, she struck. She was the letter of marque barque Amazon(e), armed with ten 6-pounder guns and carrying a crew of 60. She was sailing from Jacquemel to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee. When Echo took her prisoners out of Amazon they proved to be quite unwell. Allen and his officers decided to put the prisoners on a Spanish sloop that Echo had taken a few days earlier and they then directed the sloop to the nearest Spanish port. Echos sails needed a complete overhaul, and with the squadron nowhere in sight, Allen escorted Amazon to Port Royal. At some point Commander Robert Philpot (who had been promoted to Commander on 3 January 1799), replaced Allen.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.289‚Äì90.

On 14 October Philpot chased a brig into Lagnadille Bay at the north- west of Puerto Rico. There he saw other vessels also, some of them loaded.

The British found that they could not catch any vessels at anchor, but they were able to capture a Spanish brig laden with cocoa and indigo that she was carrying from \\"Camana\\" to \\"Old Spain\\". The brig was armed with two 4-pounders and had a crew of 20 men. The British made another sweep through the bay on the 16th. This time the brig they had first followed in two days before hailed them. She was armed with twelve 4-pounders and was moored about half a cable's length from the shore, broadside on, and flanked by two field pieces, one 18-pounder, and some smaller carriage guns on the beach. The 30 men on board were all on deck with matches lighted and guns primed. Still, when the 14 men from Echo boarded over the bow the French and Spanish crew fled below deck. The British cut the mooring cables as the guns on the beach opened fire. The fire from shore hulled the brig several times and sank the pinnace, but brig and jolly boat were soon out of range. The only loss to the British was the pinnace with her arms and ammunition; there were no casualties. The brig was an American-built French letter of marque under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Pierre Martin, who was ashore. She had a valuable cargo and was due to sail in two days for Curacoa where she was to be fitted out as a privateer. She appears to have been Alliance, renamed Bonaparte in September 1799; she was probably from Saint-Malo and operated out of Guadeloupe. At some point between 27 October 1799 and 20 February 1800, detained Margaretta, a Danish schooner that had been sailing from Jacquemel to St. Thomas's with coffee and cotton had fallen prey to a Spanish privateer; Echo captured the privateer. Between 20 February and 28 May, Echo shared in only one capture, that of the Swedish brig Betsey. She was carrying coffee and sugar when Volage and Echo detained her. On 1 July 1800 Philpot was made post captain into . John Serrell was made Commander into Echo, replacing Philpot. Serrell was promoted to post captain on 27 January 1803 and appointed to .Marshall (1825), Vol.2, Part 2, p.747. During the period 3 August 1800 and 3 January 1801, Echo recaptured the British ship Bellona. On 14 April Echo captured the Spanish privateer Santa Theresa. Admiral Sir John Duckworth, commander-in-chief of the Jamaica station, promoted Edmund (or Edmond) Boger into Echo on 27 January 1803 to replace Serrell. He also put on board a young volunteer named Samuel Roberts.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.28‚Äì29. On 13 October 1803 Echo and Badger captured the French schooner Fanny. Roberts supposedly used one of Echos boats, and 13 men armed only with side and small arms, to capture five vessels carrying 250 soldiers. Then one day Echo inadvertently left him behind when she sailed from Jamaica. While he was on shore he observed a French privateer capture the West Indiaman Dorothy Foster. Roberts gathered some volunteer sailors and took another merchant vessel in pursuit, recapturing Dorothy Foster. For this feat Boger informally made Roberts an acting lieutenant. Boger then put Roberts in command of a tender armed with one 12-pounder carronade and two 4-pounder guns, and gave him a crew of 21 men. Boger assigned Roberts to watch for Spanish vessels leaving Havana for Europe. Unfortunately for Roberts and his crew, they encountered two Spanish vessels, one of 12 guns and 60 men, and the other of eight guns and 40 men. Roberts fought for half-an-hour until his vessel sank, taking with it his dead and wounded. The Spaniards then took him (and presumably the other survivors) prisoner. Early in 1804 Echo was escorting a convoy of nine merchant vessels through the Gulf of Florida to Jamaica. Boger learned that 2,000 French troops were about to sail from Havana for New Providence, Bahamas. The next morning Echo sighted the enemy transports with the 20-gun corvette Africaine and two 18-gun-brigs as escorts. When the corvette approached Echo and her convoy, Boger ordered his charges to close around the largest and most formidable-appearing vessel, and had her fly a pennant. The French, assuming that vessel to be a frigate, retreated. Even so, Echo was able to cut off and capture a transport with 300 troops on board. A gale on 22 April later hit the French convoy, possibly destroying it. The British believed that Africaine was wrecked with all hands on the Charlestown bar. However, the truth was less tragic and more interesting in that it gave rise to a landmark legal case. The gale had cost Africaine her mizzenmast and 16 men swept overboard, as well as six guns that the crew had thrown overboard to lighten her, but she had reached Charleston bar in the evening of 3 May. It was low tide and although a pilot from Charleston had come aboard, she had to anchor and await high tide so that she could cross. Early on 4 May, the British privateer brig Garland, William Pindar, master, accompanied by a ship, came up and after firing a shot, caused Africaine to strike. Pindar then took Africaine into Charleston as his prize. The French commercial agent in Charleston, Jean Francis Soult, sued to have the vessel freed on the grounds that the capture had taken place within the territorial waters of the United States, a neutral party. In the case Jean Francis Soult v. Corvette L'Africaine, Judge Thomas Bee of the South Carolina District Court consulted maps and heard testimony, the upshot of which was that Garland had seized Africaine more than one league (three nautical miles or 3.452 miles) offshore, and hence outside U.S. territorial waters. The case established that territorial waters were to be measured from the low-tide line from the shore, with shoals completely under water not counting for the determination of shore or coast.Founders online: To James Madison from Louis-Andr√© Pichon, 18 May 1804Founders online: To James Madison from James Simons, 8 May 1804 (Abstract). During early 1804 Echo recaptured the ship Mary Ann. Echo delivered some dispatches for Admiral Dacres aboard and then Boger, per his instructions, proceeded to patrol off Cura√ßao. Echo had just reached Bonnaire on 30 September when she encountered a French lugger. After having endured a two-hour chase by \`Echo, the lugger's crew ran her ashore. Boger deployed his boats and they succeeded in retrieving the lugger, which turned out to be Hasard, a new, fast-sailing vessel from Guadeloupe. She was pierced for 16 guns but had only ten 4-pounder guns mounted. Her crew of 50 men was under the command of Citizen Lambart. She had been cruising for 10 days but had only captured the brig Hawk, from Trinidad. Hawks master and two crew members were on board Hasard so Boger put them in charge of her with orders to sail her to Jamaica. Hasard reached Jamaica on 15 October. On or about 1 May 1805 the schooner Sarah Ann. which was, by agreement, acting as a tender to Echo, captured two Spanish schooners, Santa Rosa and Nostra Senora del Regla. The prize money notice also covered a parcel of Spanish grass rope, and bark landed from Echo. Between 4 and 25 January, Echo captured and sent into Jamaica Eliza Ann (sailing from St Thomas to Santo Domingo), Janet (from Caro Bay), and the American schooner Cornelia (from Curacoa).Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4036. Accessed 28 August 2016. Boger was appointed captain of Brave, which had captured on 6 February 1806 at the Battle of San Domingo. He was her captain when she foundered shortly thereafter on 12 April (without loss of life) while en route to Britain.Marshall (1823), Vol 1, Part 2, pp.594‚Äì5. His promotion to post captain, however, was dated 22 May.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp.155‚Äì6.

Echo shared with Surveillante, Fortun√©e, , and Hercule, in the proceeds of the capture on 5 July 1806 of the Spanish ship La Josepha, laden with quicksilver. Disposal: Echo sailed back to Britain with the convoy from Jamaica but parted from it off Havana. When she was slow to arrive back in England there were fears that the Spanish had captured her.\\"QUEBEC FLEET\\". Caledonian Mercury (Edinburgh, Scotland), 30 August 1806; Issue 13207.

The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" first offered \\"Echo...lying at Deptford\\" for sale on 12 January 1809. The Navy sold her there on 18 May 1809. Whaler Daniel Bennett purchased Echo and she made four complete whaling voyages for him. Echo wrecked on her fifth voyage for Daniel and his brother William. Echo was mentioned in the 1809 Protection List, which exempted her crewmen from impressment when she was outbound. For her first whaling voyage Echo left Britain on 18 September 1809 and returned on 2 October 1811. Her master was Henry Rowe. Lloyd's Register for 1810 gave her destination as the South Seas.Lloyd's Register (1820, Seq. ‚ÑñE45. Echos master for her second whaling voyage was Joseph Whiteus (or J. Whitehouse, or Whiting). She left Britain on 23 November 1811 and returned on 12 August 1813. Echo had a new master for third whaling voyage. There are two names, Graham and Robinson, suggesting that she may have changed masters during the voyage. Echo left Britain on 7 February 1816 and returned there on 10 April 1818 with 150 casks. Echo left Britain on her fourth whaling voyage on 17 May 1818, with Mowatt, master, and destination South Georgia. She was reported there on 3 February 1819. She returned to Britain on 6 May with 280 casks and 250 skins. Fate William Spence sailed Echo on her last, ill-fated voyage. She left Britain on 24 September 1819, bound for New Zealand. She was reported to have been at Bay of Islands in March 1820. She was wrecked on Cato Reef, in the Coral Sea, on 1 April 1820. Her crew were rescued and they arrived at Port Jackson early in July.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5566. They had taken to two boats and set out for Port Jackson.

Berthelot Street in Ia»ôi, Romania. It is dedicated to the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Located in the Copou neighborhood, which in the mid-18th century was sparsely populated and had no place of worship, Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site the church was built in 1760 by hetman Vasile Roset and his wife Safta. It was located on a plot of land granted that year by Prince Ioan Teodor Callimachi. Completed quickly, it was blessed by the prince's brother, Metropolitan Gavriil Callimachi. Initially, Roset placed the church under the protection of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1767, he transferred it to the Metropolis of Proilavia. Within twenty years, the church was in a state of degradation, prompting the high vistiernic Lascarache Roset to try and reclaim the church founded by his parents. Thus, he obtained a decree in 1787 from Prince Alexander Ypsilantis, providing twenty lei per month in customs revenue for church maintenance. Successive princes issued orders maintaining or increasing the allowance: Constantine Ypsilantis (1799), Alexandros Soutzos (1801), Alexander Mourousis (1803), Michael Soutzos (1820). Aside from the princes' and donors' contributions, the church earned revenue by renting out parcels of land in its yard or on its other properties, with the tenants required to pay an annual fee. Deceased parishioners were buried in the churchyard until 1871, when the city hall ordered a halt to church burials, their function supplanted by the new Eternitatea cemetery. Gheorghe Asachi was buried outside the church in 1869; a dozen members of his family share the grave. Short history at the Holy Forty Martyrs parish site A vestibule with a choir space above was added in 1868, as well as a bell tower. The large bell, which weighs some 300 kg, dates to 1892. A foyer was installed in 1924. The church is in the Constantinople Baroque style, with its 24 stone pilasters with neo-Corinthian capitals of stone, as well as the two massive interior columns that separate nave from vestibule. The exterior division into decorative panels as well as certain ornamental details are Neoclassical; these elements appeared in the 1780s and '90s, making it the first church in Ia»ôi to feature a style that would become dominant in early 19th-century Moldavia. The church collection includes valuable icons, rare books, silver items and an archive. The iconostasis, of stuccoed linden coated in gold leaf, is original to 1760. Sculpted in Balkan Baroque, it features four 1814 icons (Christ, Virgin Mary, the Forty Martyrs and Saint Nicolas) painted and signed by Eusta»õie Altini. Cultural figures associated with the parish include Altini, Asachi, Veniamin Costache, Alexandru Hrisoverghi, Spiru Haret and Ion CreangƒÉ, who was deacon there from 1859 to 1863. A memorial to CreangƒÉ was set up on the centennial of his death in 1989, while the yard features marble busts of him and Asachi. In 1890, Asachi was reburied beneath his statue. The nearby headstone marks the grave of Altini and Hrisoverghi. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

These engines differ from the traditional Harley Big Twin engines in that there are four valves per cylinder, totaling eight valves, hence the name. It also marked a return to the single-camshaft configuration as used on previous Harley Big Twin Engines from 1936 to 1999. In addition, the engines all have internal counterbalancers, whereas Twin Cams were counterbalanced only on Softail models, where the engine was rigidly mounted. 107 and 114 and 117 engines All engines have eight valves in two cylinders in the traditional V-twin configuration at 45¬∞, are combination of air-cooled, and oil-cooled, and activate valves with push-rods. The model with a claimed is standard on all models, with the version making a claimed remaining as an option on some softails and all touring and trike models, and the is standard on CVO models with a claimed and rear wheel power of @ 4,870 rpm and @ 3,400 rpm. Differences from the predecessor (Twin Cam) In 2016, the Milwaukee-Eight engines became available on Touring and Trike models of the 2017 model year. The Softail models started using the Milwaukee-Eight the following year. The most significant change from the Twin Cam are the two extra valves per cylinder head which produce 10 percent more torque. The exhaust and intake flow capacity is increased by 50 percent over the Twin Cam models. Although weighing the same as its predecessor, both models of the Milwaukee-Eight increase in acceleration by 10% (0-60 for the 107 vs the 103) and 8% (0-60 for the 114 vs. the 110). Fuel economy is also increased, with percentages varying for engine and model.  Improvements  Harley conducted interviews in seven cities and over 1,000 people were asked to outline what they would like to see in the next line of touring bikes. These interviews resulted in the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. The biggest improvements people wanted to see was in the power, heat and vibration. Harley was able to increase the power while also keeping the range and consumption similar and in some cases making it even better. To deal with the heat issue, Harley reduced the exhaust gas temperature by 100¬∞F (55.6 C), allowing for a more comfortable ride. They were able to make this possible by relocating the hot catalytic converters further from the cockpit, as well as introducing a better water cooling solution. Finally, Harley looked at the vibration issues and decided to reduce the vibrations by 75%, in order to affect a balance between hardcore fans and new Harley owners.  Reception  Cycle World, like many other motorcycle magazines, was given the opportunity to test ride and review the Milwaukee- Eight engine. The reviews have been positive, and report a better ride quality, while still keeping the Harley feel. Cycle World's reviewer reported a noticeable reduction in the heat output from the engine, enabling the reviewer to ride more comfortably. The review concludes that the changes make this engine an improvement over its predecessor.

He was of Quaker background, and became an evangelical low church Anglican. He was opposed to high Calvinism. He was a leading defender of the conventional view of the Trinity during the unitarian controversies of the 1830s and 1840s. Early years Thomas Byrth was born in Plymouth Dock (now Devonport, Plymouth), on 11 September 1793. His father, John Byrth (1757‚Äì1813), was born and raised a Quaker in Kilkenny, County Westmeath, Ireland. In 1786 John Byrth married Mary Hobling, a Wesleyan Methodist from an old Cornish family, in Plymouth Dock. Their first child was baptised in a Wesleyan chapel. John Byrth was listed as being a grocer in Plymouth Dock in 1791. He retained his Quaker beliefs, and was in an 1809 list of Devon Quakers. Thomas Byrth briefly attended the Callington, Cornwall, parish school, then spent eight years in a private school run by two Unitarian ministers. They were well-meaning but incompetent teachers. His then spent a year at a school in Launceston, Cornwall, run by Richard Cope (1776‚Äì1850), a congregational minister. Due to lack of money to pay for further education, Thomas Byrth took an apprenticeship at a chemist and druggist company in Plymouth founded by William Cookworthy (1705‚Äì80), a Quaker and pioneer porcelain manufacturer. Byrth was an apprentice with Cookworthys from 1809 to 1814. Byrth became a close friend of Samuel Rowe (1793‚Äì1853), a bookseller and antiquarian. In 1814 they launched the Plymouth Literary Magazine and undertook an antiquarian tour of Cornwall. They published only six issues of the magazine, the last appearing on 19 November 1814. Also in 1814 they established a boarding school in Plympton, which was also short-lived. Byrth was still connected to the Quakers, but began to gradually adopt evangelical doctrines. He was a moderate evangelical, and was opposed to the high Calvinist teachings of Robert Hawker (1753‚Äì1827) that were in vogue in Plymouth at the time. Byrth was active in the Plymouth Athenaeum, described as \\"the centre of all literary, scientific and artistic life in South Devon.\\" Teacher In 1815 Byrth began to teach private pupils in the home of his mother, now a widow. The school was successful, and at one point had sixty pupils. One of his pupils was Benjamin Wills Newton, an extremely gifted boy from a Quaker background who followed Byrth when he moved to Diptford in the spring of 1823. Newton later said of Byrth, \\"He never did me justice, and I often thought that if I had been under different training how much I might have been the gainer... He was not an agreeable man, he hated mankind and mankind disliked him.\\" However, another pupil wrote, \\"During the seven years in which I had the advantage of his care, he attracted a large number of pupils, and conducted one of the best schools in the west of England; and certainly no one ever fulfilled the duties of his profession with more conscientious zeal and unwearied attention.\\" Anglican cleric In 1818 Byrth matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford. In 1819 he formally applied for membership in the Society of Friends (Quakers) on the grounds of birthright, but was rejected. On 21 October 1819 he was baptised into the Church of England at St. Andrew's Church, Plymouth. He continued to run the school in Plymouth until he was ordained a curate. He was ordained to the curacy of Diptford, near Totnes in Devon, in April 1823, remaining there until 1825. He took some pupils in Diptford. Byrth took Bachelor's and master's degrees in the spring of 1826, and was a tutor at Oxford until 1827. On 5 February 1827 Byrth, then curate at St Clement's Church, Oxford, wrote that Henry Bulteel \\"has created a most powerful sensation here, by preaching ulra-Calvinism, and circulating Dr Hawker's tracts.\\" In 1827 Byrth was presented by Thomas Greenall to the small incumbency of Latchford, in the parish of Grappenhall in Cheshire. On 19 June 1827 Byrth married Mary Kingdom. In 1833 John Hatchard, Vicar of St. Andrew, Plymouth, nominated Berth to the perpetual curacy of St. Paul's, Stonehouse. In 1834 Byrth was collated by John Sumner, Bishop of Chester, to the rectory of Wallasey, Cheshire, now part of Merseyside. He became a Bachelor of Divinity on 17 October 1839 and took his degree of Doctor of Divinity two days later. Byrth engaged in controversy with the Reverend John Hamilton Thom on Unitarianism. In 1848 he edited the sermons of the Rev. Thomas Tattershall, D.D., incumbent of St. Augustine's Church, Liverpool, and prefixed to them a memoir of the author. Byrth belonged to the \\"low church\\" movement in the Anglican church. Byrth's biographer says he \\"was an evangelical in religion and a Whig in politics. His scholarship was thorough, and he was possessed of poetic taste and antiquarian enthusiasm.\\" Byrth died in Wallasey on 28 October 1849. He left a wife and seven children. A public subscription was raised for their benefit, and reached almost ¬£4,000. Of his three sons and four daughters, born between 1828 and 1839, two of the sons also became Anglican priests, and one became a barrister. The west window in the Wallasey Church is filled with stained glass in his memory. A fellow- clergyman, G. R. Moncreiff, published Remains of Thomas Byrth, D.D., F.A.S., Rector of Wallasey, with a memoir of his life in 1851. A sermon on his death, preached by the Rev. John Tobin in St. John's Church, Liscard, on 4 November 1849, was also published in 1851. Selected publications Although known as a profound scholar, Byrth was not a prolific author. He published a memoir on Rev. Dr. Tatershall of Liverpool and a few sermons and pamphlets.

It was the tenth named storm and was the third typhoon of the annual Pacific typhoon season. Damages recorded after the season were recorded about US$3.93 billion. Meteorological history The system that was to become Typhoon Lionrock was first noted as a hybrid disturbance on August 15, while it was located about to the west of Wake Island. At this time the disturbance had a broad and poorly organized low level circulation centre, which had some shallow bands of atmospheric convection wrapping loosely around it. It was located within a marginal environment for further development and was predicted to develop further, in association with a developing upper level low. Over the next day the system moved northwards, while a TUTT Cell created subsidence and high vertical windshear over the system, before it was classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency during August 16. The depression was subsequently classified as subtropical by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center during August 17, as its structure was asymmetric, with deep convection displaced to the north and east of the system's low level circulation centre. Lionrock entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on August 25, 2016, and PAGASA assigned Dindo as the local name for Lionrock. On August 29, Lionrock turned towards the northwest due to a high pressure system located east of Japan, putting it on an unprecedented path towards the northeastern region of the country. Right before weakening into a severe tropical storm at 18:00 JST (09:00 UTC) on August 30, Lionrock made landfall near ≈åfunato, a city in Iwate Prefecture, Japan with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). This makes Lionrock the first tropical cyclone to make landfall over the Pacific coast of the T≈çhoku region of Japan since the Japan Meteorological Agency began record-keeping in 1951. Lionrock's track was unusual due to the fact that the storm approached Japan from the southeast and made landfall along the east coast of the country. Most typhoons that hit Japan approach from the south or the southwest before moving northward across the archipelago. In fact, the only other storm to take a similar track was Typhoon Mac in 1989, which also approached from the southeast and struck Japan's Kant≈ç region along its east coast. Preparations Japan's Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe left a Japan-African development conference in Nairobi, Kenya early due to the threat of flight cancellations caused by the typhoon. Prior to Lionrock making landfall, a total of 100 flights were cancelled at airports in Tohoku and Hokkaido. Efforts were made to protect the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant from further damage, as it had been severely incapacitated following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The amount of water being pumped at the facility was increased in order to minimize the risk of floods, and crane operations were suspended due to the threat of strong winds. In eastern Russia, a storm warning was announced on 28 August by EMERCOM. All emergency services and troops were on high alert. Local authorities were informed on emergency procedures. North Korea's Early Warning and Evacuation system was activated ahead of the storm, causing 44,000 people in flood-prone areas to be evacuated in North Hamgyong Province. Impact =Japan= Infrares satellite loop of Lionrock making landfall in T≈çhoku region on August 30 Upon making landfall on August 30, Lionrock brought very heavy rainfall, including at Mount Nukabira, in Hokkaid≈ç Prefecture, and in Orito in Iwate Prefecture. In addition, a maximum wind gust of was recorded in Ishinomaki, and a wind gust was measured in Onagawa. Lionrock killed a total of 22 people across Japan, including 19 people in the town of Iwaizumi in Iwate Prefecture. Nine people drowned in a nursing home in Iwaizumi after a river burst its banks. In addition, there were at least three fatalities on the northern Japanese island Hokkaid≈ç. Damage due to flooding were standing at JP¬•282 billion (US$2.74 billion). =Russia= On 31 August, the storm hit Primorsky Krai. Heavy rainfall caused floods in several areas with 300 houses flooded in rural areas. Local rivers overflowed, several bridges were destroyed or damaged and several highways were affected by floods. A dam failure along the Pavlovka river caused floods in the Shumny and Antonovka villages. More than 1,000 inhabitants were evacuated and several evacuation camps were established in all affected areas, mostly in schools. The storm also caused power disruptions. 12,000 rescue workers were also deployed in the area. The southern part of the Sakhalin was also affected. Several cars were struck by fallen trees and electricity was shut down in some houses. Heavy rain flooded Makarovsky and caused a landslide which blocked a highway and a railway. Two trains on the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk-Nogliki line were cancelled and one of them, No. 604, was stopped in Poronaysk. In Vakhrushev, one of the cargo trains derailed. Hours later, the incident was fixed and its operations returned to normal. However, one fatality was reported during the incident. In addition, two EMERCOM officers (the chief of the Primorsky Krai department and his driver) died when their KAMAZ truck fell into the Pavlovka River. Lionrock was the worst typhoon to hit the Primorsky Krai region in 40 years, with total damage exceeds ‚ÇΩ7 billion (US$107 million). =China= A total of of agricultural land were impacted in China, including 53,500 hectares (132,200 acres) of crops which were destroyed due to floods. Damages in China are estimated to be CN¬•7.21 billion (US$1.08 billion); most of which was inflicted on the agricultural sector. =North Korea= The extratropical remnants of Lionrock over Northeast China and Russia on August 31 Lionrock interacted with a low pressure area over China to drop heavy rainfall in North Korea, mostly in North Hamgyong Province, considered by the state media Korean Central News Agency to be the \\"heaviest downpour since 1945\\". Over a two-day period, Kyonghung County recorded of rainfall. This caused flooding along the Tumen River and its tributaries, inundating about of farmlands just weeks ahead of the harvest, of which were wrecked. The floods from Lionrock caused \\"a disaster beyond anything experienced by local officials\\", according to a local UNICEF representative, and were described as \\"a very major and complex disaster\\" by Chris Staines, head of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The affected area had poor infrastructure and deforestation on hills, exasperating the floods' impacts. Entire villages were washed away, carrying away families' entire possessions. Three people trapped in floodwaters were rescued by two Chinese rescue boats. Over 35,500 houses were damaged, of which around 25,000 were destroyed, forcing 107,000 people from their homes; many of these people sheltered on higher grounds or in public buildings. Floods from Lionrock damaged another 8,700 non-residential buildings, including schools and public buildings. In Ryanggang Province, the heavy rains caused a five-story building to collapse, killing 34 people. In Hoeryong city, over 104,000 people lost access to clean water during the floods, and nationwide about 600,000 people were affected by water cuts. Musan and Yonsa counties were unreachable and had little communications, resulting in the slow spread of information on the disaster. The floods also washed away six bridges and of roads, with of road bed damaged. The floods related to Lionrock killed at least 525 people in the country. Aftermath After the floods, the North Korean government sent workers to clear roads and restore communications in the hardest hit areas. The government sent a truck from the capital Pyongyang with medical kits and vitamin supplements on September 5, and announced a plan to rebuild 20,000 houses by early October 2016. The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea requested that party members redirected their efforts from a 200-day mass worker program intended to improve the economy, and instead send soldiers to help with flood relief. About 1,000 volunteers from the country's Red Cross chapter helped local workers in search and rescue missions. The agency had relief supplies for about 20,000 people, including tarpaulins, tents, kitchen sets, and water purification tablets. Red Cross workers coordinated with members of the international delegation between September 3-6, resulting in increased resources for health services. The local Red Cross launched an appeal for emergency aid in response to the disaster through the state media Korean Central News Agency. The government, which rarely releases information on disasters in the country, requested for aid from the international community, just days after a nuclear weapons test that led to calls for increased sanctions. The World Food Programme provided emergency food rations for 140,000 people in need of immediate assistance.

The ktitor was the boyar »ö√¢na»ôa (Atanasie) Gosan, whose name gave rise to the church's second dedication. He also willed an annuity of 20 lei for candles and oil. The first parishioners were grape growers. History at the Socola MicƒÉ parish site Significant repairs were carried out in 1838. Its local significance grew when the Socola Monastery church underwent repairs, leaving it the only functioning place of worship in the area. Made of brick on a stone foundation, the church is small in size. It is trefoil in shape, with a foyer, vestibule, nave and altar. There are two symmetrical semicircular apses, each with a narrow arched window. Other windows ensure that light streams into the building. The outside walls are plastered and lack decoration; the roof is simple, in two sections. The interior walls are not painted. There is a hexagonal spire above the foyer, with a window on each face. Throughout, the ceilings are flat, made of varnished beams. The foyer and bell tower above the entrance were rebuilt in 1995. The church underwent restorations, including painting of the whole interior, from 2006 to 2012. The iconostasis features the relics of Saints Charalambos, Pantaleon, Cosmas, with Luke the Evangelist added later. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

It was released on June 7, 2016 for the digital distribution platform Steam and later for GOG. It will be released on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One in the future. The game received mostly positive reviews, that praised the game's visual style, story and action.  Gameplay  Ghost (center) shooting at one of the game's bosses. The player starts as a gynoid known as the Chassis, which is being remote-controlled by a female, humanoid life-form known as Ghost. Ghost has the ability to use the Chassis as her physical body, and engage in combat by shooting enemies and using other weapons and techniques. She can also abandon the Chassis, leaving it defenseless and traveling the world as a virtual \\"ghost\\" to hack into other robots and take them over. This can be used to find secrets or to destroy other robots that would otherwise be dangerous. If the Chassis is destroyed, it is automatically replicated by super-fast 3D printer. In typical Metroidvania fashion, the player is expected to explore the game world and collect various access cards and other items that will unlock the next area of the game. At certain points at the end of a level, the player must fight bosses to proceed. Certain rooms contain alarms that must be triggered, causing a gauntlet of enemies that can be fought repeatedly for more money (in the form of energy). The player can unlock skills through the use of a skill tree. The player gains skill points based on how many access codes they have obtained, rather than by leveling up in the traditional sense by defeating enemies. However, the player can upgrade weapons in a more traditional manner. The game also contains puzzle sections in the form of a laser-dodging minigame, where the player must possess one or more robots to make it past a laser grid that will destroy the robots on contact. An infiltration and rescue mission involving this towards the game's end can be skipped if the player so chooses.  Plot  The game takes place in the future, and revolves around two intelligent but socially awkward cybercriminals, the roboticist Boogan (Jonathan Jones) and the hacker Jacker (Andrew Miller). The two of them desire to infiltrate the space station owned by the Nakamura Corporation, which is the world's largest and wealthiest producer of androids. They believe that Nakamura holds the source code for their highly intelligent androids, or \\"Nakas\\", within the station, since all the androids are controlled from a single server room. They find a contact named Viktor (Steven Kelly) who claims to have a number of freelance spies who work for him, and they hire one named \\"Ghost\\" (Mirisha Lottich) from him to sneak into the station via space elevator. They tell Ghost to do whatever is necessary to capture the artificial intelligence code, believing they can sell it to the highest bidder and become rich. However, as Ghost shuts down various parts of the station, her behavior starts to become unusual. Boogan and Jacker begin to suspect that Ghost is actually a sentient AI that resides on the same server as the Nakas. They also discover that Nakamura is synthesizing organic compounds aboard the station for some reason. To test their theory of Ghost being an AI, they cause a massive power fluctuation, which also causes Ghost to lose her connection. This proves them right, meanwhile, Viktor is angered that Boogan and Jacker are sabotaging his agents and sends a real human agent to destroy Ghost's chassis. Ghost narrowly escapes from Viktor's agent, but Viktor decides to target Jacker instead, kidnapping him and putting him deep underground to blackmail Boogan to stop. Ghost leaves the station and goes with Boogan to rescue Jacker, successfully infiltrating the highly secured underground compound. She then returns to the station and accesses the server room. There, she realizes that all the \\"servers\\" were in fact human brains being fed nutrients by the station. Viktor attempts to kill her by destroying her disembodied brain, but one of the station's scientists saves her by putting her brain onto a robot with a force field. Ghost is then able to fight off waves of defense robots while Jacker defeats Viktor's hired hacker and manages to hide Ghost's brain forever by scrambling the entire database of the brains' serial numbers. At the end of the story, it is revealed that Nakamura purchased a bankrupt cryonics company that had stored thousands of brains, revived them using technology they invented, and erased their memories to profit from using them to control robotic avatars through a brain-computer interface. Viktor was in on the plan and purchased some of the brains to use as powerful agents. All the Nakas are set free and given human rights, recognizing their status as cyborgs, while the CEO of Nakamura (Alex Jenks) is arrested. Ghost decides to join Boogan and Jacker as a permanent member of their team, much to their shock.  Prequel  A retro-styled prequel to the game, entitled Mini Ghost, was released on April 28, 2017 for Windows. It features graphics styled after those of the MSX, and also includes a multiplayer mode.  Reception  Ghost 1.0 was reviewed positively, with an aggregate score of 80/100 on Metacritic for the PC version of the game. Ramon Nafria of Vandal Online rated the game 9/10, calling it \\"one of the best Metroidvanias we've played in the last few years\\". David Jagneaux of Nintendo Life rated the game's Switch version 7/10, praising the gameplay mechanics as \\"subtle and clever\\". He also praised the game's world design as making internal sense and called the game's soundtrack \\"rocking\\". However, he criticized the game's story as \\"forgettable\\" with \\"cheesy\\", \\"cringe-inducing\\" humor.

History  The Zulu Congregational Church is one of the oldest African Ethiopian churches in South Africa, it was founded on the 23rd of March 1896 by Rt Rev Simungu Bafazini Shibe at Denver Zoar Umzumbe, KZN. It was formed as an independent from the previous American Zulu Mission at The Table Mountain Mission Station is situated forty miles northwest of Durban in Pietermaritzburg, was founded by American missionary, Samuel D. Marsh, in 1848. Marsh was forced to abandon the station owing to ill health, and from 1850 it was administered by Jacob Dohne, formerly of the Berlin Missionary Society. In 1860 Dohne left the AZM to rejoin his parent society. From that date until 1896, Table Mountain was without the services of a resident missionary. The Mission was limited by a perennial staff shortage throughout the nineteenth century, making it impossible to spare a missionary for an isolated station. In 1875 African preacher Daniel Njaleki was appointed by the AZM to take charge of Table Mountain station. Njaleki began the construction of a church and by 1877 it had a membership of twenty-four. In 1888 Njaleki left the mission after ill health and the mission applied for a replacement. Simungu Shibe was selected by the congregation and subsequently approved by the Mission. In 1896, G.J. Pugh, the former treasurer of the NCU, became missionary-in-charge of Table Mountain. Upon his arrival Pugh asked for the Shibe's removal. A large portion of the converts came out openly in support of Shibe. At the pastors' conference in June 1897 the pastors cited the self- support circular from America as justification for their demand that the congregation at Table Mountain be allowed to select its own ministers. Conflict erupted as the NCU wrote to the American Board of the Reserves requesting Shibe's removal. The American Board refused to intervene. In February 1898, Shibe travelled to Johannesburg, where along with Fokothi Makhanya of the Johannesburg Church, he was ordained pastor. John Langalibalele Dube helped Rev Shibe to form the ZCC. In 1917 one the best Zulu Congregational Church preacher's Gardner B. Mvuyane of the Johannesburg mission ceded from the Zulu Congregational Church and founded his own Church the African Congregational Church. In 1924 Shibe died After Shibe's death Rt Rev Aaron Mpanza took over as the president of the Church up until his death in 1956 under his leadership the church membership grew from 20 000 to over 50 000 member as it established missions in Natal, Transkei, Gazankulu and Kwa Ndebele, the church also adopted the new uniform which had the blue, white and black colors, hymn book and prayer books (incwadi yombhedesho) then Rt Rev A.P.

It was established by the Communist Party in February 1942, over a year before the republic itself, with the aim of mobilizing women in Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Partisan resistance against the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia. It was one of the organizations which gave rise to the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia, the first congress of which was held in December 1942 in Bosanski Petrovac.  Background  Prior to the Second World War, the Yugoslav society was overwhelmingly rural, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but even so the position of women was strikingly difficult in the interwar Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Yugoslav anthropologist Vera Stein Ehrlich found that domestic violence was a common occurrence in Orthodox villages, as was bride kidnapping and rape. Bosnia and Herzegovina also stood out in Yugoslavia due to the large proportion of Muslim population. The traditional attire of Bosnian Muslim women prevented them from seeking employment in many shops and factories. A vast majority was illiterate and many health problems were specific to them.  Resistance  An AF≈Ω rally in the western Bosnian city of Drvar The Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina was founded in February 1942 in the east of Bosnia proper, where Josip Broz Tito and the rest of the Yugoslav resistance leadership were located at the time. Delegates from all liberated parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina were present, over 500 women altogether, mostly Serb Orthodox and Muslim peasants. 906 women from Foƒça alone were recruited into the organization shortly after Tito's arrival. Inter-ethnic distrust within Bosnia and Herzegovina was initially a great obstacle. The occupying forces targeted Jewish, Romani and Serb population, with the collaboration of the Croat Usta≈°a militia. The AF≈Ω recruited most efficiently among Serbs, and the predominance of the Orthodox Serbs made it hard to attract either Catholic Croats or Muslims, as they perceived the organization as primarily Serb-oriented. Serb women, on the other hand, indiscriminately considered women of the other ethnic groups to be pro-Usta≈°a. It took time and effort to attract a significant number of non-Serb women to the organization. By the spring of 1942, the AF≈Ω organized an exceptional network numbering 2,000 women who set up demonstrations against the policy of the Usta≈°as. As only the Jewish and Orthodox population was targeted by the Usta≈°as, the Muslim women could move freely, which made them invaluable to the resistance movement. The burqa enabled them to carry various illicit material, including guns, without the risk of being searched. It was used for this purpose even by the AF≈Ω activists who did not normally wear it, including Catholic and Orthodox women. Following the Partisans' defeat in the Fourth Enemy Offensive in March 1942, the AF≈Ω assumed complete responsibility for the resistance in the Herzegovinian town of Mostar.  Women's rights and feminism  Rada Vranje≈°eviƒá, member of the AF≈Ω and People's Hero of Yugoslavia, speaking at the first ZAVNOBiH session The leadership of the Communist Party, although sincere in its desire to improve the status of women, envisaged the AF≈Ω as merely a pliable organization through which women would be drawn into the resistance movement. Sexist and patriarchal notions among both men and women within the Party and the Partisans were a lingering problem during the resistance effort. The composition of the organs of state of Bosnia and Herzegovina reflected the Party's readiness or ability to ensure gender equality: only four of 170 delegates at the first session of State Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) in Mrkonjiƒá Grad were women, while the second session was attended by seven female delegates and 100 male delegates, and no woman was elected to the presidency. The AF≈Ω, however, soon developed \\"a life of its own\\". Some sections came to identify as explicitly feminist rather than exclusively antifascist. In the Bosanska Krajina region, activists often undertook tours independently of Communist bodies, established their own treasuries, culture houses and apparatuses, and even formed a \\"women's municipality\\" in a village near Sanski Most. In December 1943, the Central Committee complained that they acted as a state within a state and voiced concern about \\"errors that tend toward feminism\\". It reminded the AF≈Ω activists that \\"women are not some sort of separate part of the people\\" but rather \\"constitute the people\\".  Post- war campaigns  Taking off the niqƒÅb at the second congress of the organization in Sarajevo, 1947 The Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina confronted the issues faced by Muslim women in the late 1940s, organizing literacy classes and health seminars. The organization launched a massive campaign to encourage Bosnian women to vote, which achieved an extraordinary result, with almost 100% of women turning up to vote. Communist efforts to promote gender equality often went hand in hand with the concept of brotherhood and unity of the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose relations were marked by distrust during the \\"fratricidal war\\". This was particularly evident when dealing with Muslim women, who least participated in Bosnia and Herzegovina's public life. Work among them was reported to be \\"very difficult\\" in the area of Grmeƒç mountain because of their tendency to \\"avoid contact with Serb [Orthodox] women\\" and because their husbands prohibited them from joining the organization. At its second congress in the capital city of Sarajevo in 1947, the Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina started advocating the abandonment of the hijab () and niqƒÅb (zar), stating in its resolution that this would lead to a \\"life without inequality and without enslavement of one person by another, a life in which there will be no darkness and backwardness\\". The resolution having been adopted, a delegate from Travnik, ≈†emsa Kadiƒá, demonstratively took off her veil. She was applauded by her fellow delegates and followed by other Muslim women. For the next three years they organized rallies and meetings to encourage Bosnian Muslim women to abandon the veil. The enthusiastic members of the organization enlisted the support of male politicians as well as the approval of the grand mufti Ibrahim Fejiƒá. The Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia and its other branches, dissolved itself in September 1953.

Participation According to Ministry of Justice data, there were 192,655 technical interns in Japan under the terms of the program as of the end of 2015, an increase of about 15% from the previous year. China was the largest source of interns, at 46.2% of the total, followed by Vietnam at 29.9% and the Philippines at 9.2%.

Small businesses in rural locations in Japan employee many of the trainees, who are often hosted by local commerce and industry groups and small-business associations. Approximately 42% of trainees work in the seafood processing industry, and as Mazumi finds, in contrast to some criticisms that trainees take jobs from domestic workers, in the seafood processing industry trainees are mostly found in regions which suffer from a shortage of a stable (non-seasonal) workforce. In these areas, \\"the larger the employment size of the seafood processing industry in the local labor market, and the higher the productivity of the industry, the higher the share of migrants in the local labor force.\\" Criticism The program has come under increasing scrutiny for alleged labour rights violations, occupational health and safety issues and lax administrative oversight.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1937. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  Completed by late 1937, this single-storeyed timber building replaced a court house erected in 1912. The court house was designed in the office of the Department of Public Works; Andrew Baxter Leven was Chief Architect at the time. The pastoral stations of Taromeo, Nanango and Tarong in the South Burnett district of Queensland, were taken up by selectors during the 1840s. In 1847, a prospector named Jacob Goode set up his camp near a waterhole on Nanango station, and reputedly established an inn. Goode proceeded to build stockyards and open a general store, and a post office was opened at the small settlement in about 1850. Gold was discovered in the Nanango district during the 1860s, and although the gold mining activity never lived up to the high expectations of the miners, it succeeded in attracting people to the area. A school was established in 1866, and it is noted that the first sale of town lots took place in October 1870. Records indicate that the area was opened up for closer settlement from the mid 1870s, and by the mid 1880s, the residential and business areas of the town was established. By the late 1880s, directories described the main features of the area as sheep and cattle grazing; mining reefs and splendid timber. Tenders were called in 1862 for additions to the court house and lock-up at Nanango, and it is possible that it had been built during the late 1850s. Additions to the court house for a Lands Office were completed in 1889. By the early 1910s, there was antagonism between the towns of Kingaroy and Nanango as they vied for supremacy in the district. Nanango provided the headquarters of the official staff of Government Departments such as Justice and Lands which controlled extensive districts, and the town was given a boost in 1912, when the District Court of Nanango was established to serve the Petty Sessions Districts of Nanango, Weinholt and Kilkivan. With the anticipated expansion of official work to be carried out, plans were prepared and a new court house erected at Nanango in 1912. By 1936, a new court house was again required, and plans were prepared. Tenders were called for and in December 1936, approval was given to construct the new court house for . The new building was completed in August 1937, and included offices for the Dairy Inspector, Stock Inspector, Clerk of Petty Sessions and Land Ranger. The site of the building was east of the former building, fronting Henry Street. The former court house was sold for removal. Additions to the court house were undertaken during the mid 1960s, and included the provision of a tea room, storage facility and toilets.  Description  Court house, 1994 Nanango Court House is a symmetrically-planned timber building with a corrugated-iron roof and a wide verandah on three sides. The roof is low-pitched, with prominent gables and wide overhanging eaves. The verandah roofs are supported by grouped timber posts. The projecting entrance is distinguished by a small gable on paired timber posts. Behind it is a half-gabled roof. The main ridge of the roof is surmounted by a large ventilator, with a flagpole, which forms the dominant decorative element of the building.  Heritage listing  Nanango Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Erected in 1937, the Nanango Court House survives as an important illustration of the pattern of Nanango's development as an official centre for the South Burnett district of Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Nanango Court House is a good example of a timber court house in a provincial centre. It reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland, designed by the Department of Public Works during the early-mid 20th century.

It is one of the state's only examples of a deck truss bridge. It was constructed in 1927 with parts manufactured by the Minneapolis Steel & Machinery Company. The bridge formerly carried US 169 and MN 101, and served as the principal river crossing for Shakopee. The Holmes Street Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 2005. It was rehabilitated in 2011 to carry a trail for pedestrians, cross-country skiers, and snowmobiles. Description The Holmes Street Bridge is long and wide. The bridge has four spans over the river and two approach spans over land on either end. The load-bearing structure consists of three parallel Warren trusses, an unusual configuration as two parallel trusses were the norm. Neoclassical elements appear on the bridge piers, abutments, and parapet railings. The bridge's trusses History The bridge was built to carry Minnesota State Highway 5, locally known within Shakopee as Holmes Street. The route was later redesignated U.S. Route 169/State Highway 101. In 2009 a new bridge was built a block to the east to carry the highways. A study from 1985 had identified only 10 deck truss bridges built in Minnesota before 1946. The Holmes Street Bridge is the only road bridge of that number still standing. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 for its state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for its rare design type and its fabrication by an important Minnesota bridge manufacturer.

He represented Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Junior career Mehari was originally from Addis Ababa and represented Ethiopia in junior athletics. He placed fifth in the junior race at the 1996 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. =Asylum= After competing in Sydney at the 1996 World Junior Championships in Athletics, Mehari was one of four Ethiopians to seek political asylum in Australia, saying they faced ethnic discrimination back home and the threat of death or imprisonment. He ended up moving to Canberra and joined the Australian Institute of Sport, under the coaching of Dick Telford. In order to improve his limited English he enrolled in a language course at Dickson College. Any money he made in competition he sent back to his family, who remained in Ethiopia. Australian running career Mehari twice won the Australian Cross Country Championships, which were held over 12 km, in 1997 and 1998. Pending citizenship, he was likely to have qualified to represent Australia at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, but instead made the decision to join a group of Kenyan athletes that were competing in Europe. He was said to have been impatient with his rate of improvement and expressed a wish to train with better athletes in order to fulfil his potential. His personal best for the 5000 metres came in a race in 1998, with a time of 13:20.85. He is the course record holder for the City-Bay race in Adelaide, with a time of 33:42, set in 1998. In May 1999 he became an Australian citizen and needed an advance on his AIS scholarship money in order to buy a new passport. Due to IAAF rules he had to stand out of competition for three months, so wasn't able to represent his adopted country until August, which was just in time for the 1999 World Championships. He finished 23rd in the final of the 5000 metres. He was the 5000 metres national champion in 1999. =Olympics= At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mehari was eighth in his heat, timed at 13:24.56, fast enough to qualify as the only Australian in the final. He ran the final in 13:42.03 and finished 12th out of the 15 competitors. Death Mehari committed suicide at Mount Ainslie on 10 May 2007. Donations were sought to enable his body to be flown back home to his family. His memorial service was held in Queanbeyan on 19 May.

Theodore Church Ss. Theodore Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 14 Sf√¢ntul Teodor Street in Ia»ôi, Romania. It is dedicated to Saints Theodore of Amasea and Theodore Stratelates. The first church on the site was made of wood. Historians initially believed it was built by Prince Eustratie Dabija (reigned 1661-1665) and his wife Dafina. However, in 1902, Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu deciphered the Romanian Cyrillic inscriptions on two icons, finding that while the church was constructed under Dabija, the ktitors were vornic Solomon B√¢rlƒÉdeanul and his wife Maria. A document of 1669 attests the church's existence. It burned in 1735 and 1760. The present stone church is thought to date to 1761 and was financed by the nun Sofia, the daughter of a jitnicer and a widow. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Around 1783, after Sofia's death, the church was in need of repairs, while the cojoc-makers' guild was looking for a place to worship. Thus, the church came into their hands, and the new occupants rebuilt the spire roofs and exterior siding, adding a new style of ornament later copied by numerous churches in the area. They added numerous religious books to its collection, candelabras brought from Russia and a clock installed in the main spire. The guilders also donated a collection of books printed at R√¢mnic in 1779-1780. Nicolae Pintilie, History at the Ss. Theodore parish site The iconostasis is unique in Moldavia. Carved in rosewood, it has icons dating to Dabija's reign: those depicting Christ, the Virgin Mary, Ss. Theodore and Saint Nicholas were probably painted by Grigore Zugravul in 1665, and come from the old wooden church. The cojocari probably added a row of icons during their heyday; researchers have noted a difference in style consonant with two different time periods. The guilders were associated with the church for roughly a century. Due to industrial advances, their guild system broke down around 1920. The church was hit by a bomb in 1944, during World War II, and repaired in 1952. The repainting process degraded the appearance of the interior. The church combines Baroque, Turkish, Moldavian and Wallachian influences, typical of the final quarter of the 18th century. It resembles several Ia»ôi churches of the period, while the window decorations are visibly influenced by Golia Monastery. It is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

The artist was forgotten until his rediscovery in 1959.Jan de Momper at the Netherlands Institute for Art History With his highly expressionist landscapes executed with a very free brush the artist occupies a unique position in the artistic panorama of Baroque Rome. Life A pier Few details about the life of Jan de Momper are known with certainty. According to Italian sources he was born in Antwerp. This would indicate that he may have been a member of the extensive family de Momper, which specialised in landscape painting. The de Momper family was a prominent family of landscape painters and printmakers, originally from Bruges, which had settled in Antwerp in the 16th century.Irene Haberland and Louise S. Milne. \\"Momper, de.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 27 August 2016 Some art historian have suggested that he was the Joannes de Momper who was born on 16 August 1614 as the son of the painter Jan de Momper (II) and Elizabeth van Hoeswinckel. Jan de Momper (II) was a brother of the prominent landscape painter Joos de Momper. He is identified by some art historians with the Joannes de Momper who was registered as an embroiderer in 1635 at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a 'wijnmeester', i.e. the son of a member.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, Antwerp, 1864, p. 70 Jan likely left Antwerp in the late 1630s when the family de Momper's large studio collapsed after the death of Joos de Momper, the leading artist in the family. In the year 1657 the artist was recorded in Rome in connection with a commission to produce 9 landscapes for the prominent Roman Doria Pamphilj family. Some of his works are still present in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome where the family's large art collection is currently housed.Jan de Momper at the Prado Museum In 1661 he was a well-established painter in Rome, as evidenced by a very important order from another distinguished art loving family in Rome, the Chigi family. He had very likely already been working in Rome well before the first records of his presence in the city. Fishermen on the coast Jan de Momper is believed to have joined the Bentvueghels, an organization of mainly Flemish and Dutch painters active in Rome. It was the custom of the Bentvueghels to adopt a nickname, the so-called bent name, at the time a member was admitted. The bent name of Jan de Momper was 'Eervrucht' ('Fruit of Honour').Jan de Momper at Hadrianus Jan de Momper was linked with the prominent Flemish battle painter Vincent Adriaenssen who was active in Rome. Jan's wife Agnes Vincentii, who died in Rome on 19 April 1684, was Adriaenssen's daughter. Adriaenssen was also his early mentor in Rome. In 1684 Jan de Momper was recorded as working on the palace of the Chigi family in Ariccia. There is no further sign of life of Jan de Momper after the report on the death of his wife in 1684. Work Grape harvest Jan de Momper's name as a painter was virtually lost until the art historian Roberto Longhi brought together a series of landscapes characterized by a strong personality and a remarkable freedom of brush under the notname \\"Mons√π X\\". From an inscription on the back of one of those canvases, owned by the Chigi family, Longhi was able to identify the anonymous master as Jan de Momper. Jan de Momper is known for his landscapes depicting coastal and river landscapes populated with contemporary figures and hunting scenes. The landscapes of Jan de Momper are characterized by their singular extravagance. The works are very personal and executed with a great freedom of the brush and with strong contrasts. His compositions reveal a preference for the unfinished. His style demonstrates he was familiar with the landscapes of Rembrandt as will as the late works of Salvator Rosa. The freedom of his brushwork explains why some of his works have in the past been attributed to Goya or a follower of Goya and Alessandro Magnasco. Some of his views also call to mind Claude Lorrain's landscapes. The expressionistic talent of Jan de Momper made him a unique case in the artistic panorama of Baroque Rome.Jan de Momper at Wannenes Group Coastal landscape with tower Three of his landscapes are preserved in the Prado, to which they were transferred from the royal collection. The works were inventoried as de Momper but without indicating his first name, which had led to an attribution of the works to the more famous Joos de Momper.Mat√≠as D√≠az Padr√≥n, Dos lienzos de Jan de Momper en colecciones madrile√±a, in: Bolet√≠n del Seminario de Arte y Arquitectura, vol LII (1986), p. 477 Another landscape attributed to the artist is the Grape Harvest in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.

It is dedicated to All Saints' Day. Wooden church The first church on the site was built of oak beams in 1704 by the great ban Savin Zmucila, and had its own graveyard. His title is the source of the nickname. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site It was blessed by Metropolitan Misail the same year, and it was dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God. As opposed to other churches in the city that belonged to foreign churches and held liturgies in Old Church Slavonic or Greek, services at Banu were in Romanian by Romanian priests from the beginning, partly in sign of protest. From early on, the church had valuable books and objects, some from Moldavia and others from abroad. These included a 1643 Cazania (book of sermons), a 1681 Molitvelnic (prayer book) and a 1683 Liturghier (liturgy book), all from Ia»ôi; as well as a 1699 Gospel Book in Greek and Latin from Bucharest. By 1799, the city's development had made the church too small for its needs, and it was in disrepair. Stone church Together with the parishioners, Metropolitan Iacob Stamati contributed a large sum of money for a new church; he also supplied the liturgical objects. An architect was hired from Transylvania, building a structure in the classic Russian style. This appears to be the oldest church in Ia»ôi that mentions the architect's name on the inscription: Herr Leopold. The carved linden iconostasis is the work of Eusta»õie Altini, who also painted it in 1802. Early the following year, he began painting the church interior, but the work remained incomplete upon Stamati's death that March. In his will, the metropolitan specified that the church would not be subject to foreign control. The foyer of the present church is where the altar of the previous church was, and its dedication was changed to All Saints' Day. The church is in trefoil plan, with side apses on the interior and a semicircular altar apse. There is a bell tower above the narthex; its Baroque style is common to the region. The original structure has not been modified, only repaired. The church was closed from 1821 to 1822, early during the Greek War of Independence, which reverberated in Moldavia. During its early years, it was known as the Beggars' Church, after the guild that worshiped there. Repairs were carried out in 1828‚Äì1829 and in 1840. At some point after 1859, the exterior was coated in sheet metal. The foyer was repaired in 1882‚Äì1883, as mentioned in an inscription. Additionally, a tall wooden baldachin was installed near the altar, so that the area was never subsequently painted. Located to the east, the graveyard functioned until the late 19th century; the National College was built on the site. Urgent repairs were carried out in 1904 and again in 1927, when the church was in serious deterioration. The baldachin was removed in 1937, and the exterior was plastered in 1942. In the early 20th century, the church owned a brewery and a set of valuables donated by Costache Conachi. A fresh restoration took place in 1948, when Corneliu Baba ordered the painting erased, as it was blackened, peeling and of low artistic value. (A medallion in the vestibule was preserved.) The 1940 Vrancea earthquake had widened an existing crack in the south wall, and the repair filled this with brick. Further repairs took place in 1958, 1966 and 1976. During a plaster repair on the altar in 1968, a mural icon of Madonna and Child was discovered; this was possibly done by Altini in 1803. The 1977 Vrancea earthquake reopened the crack, which was subsequently patched up again. However, after 1981, the crack again widened, and new cracks appeared on the north face around the bell tower. After earthquakes in 1986 and 1990, these cracks also became larger. Further repairs began in 1990, in order to consolidate the structure.

He was the founder of Grid Systems Corporation, maker of the Grid Compass, one of the first commercially successful laptop computers. He also co-founded GeoVector, an early augmented reality company. Biography Ellenby was born in Corbridge, in Northumberland, England. His father Conrad Ellenby was a nematologist. He studied geography and economics at University College London, and first encountered mainframe computers for the first time in the early 1960s, when he spent a year at the London School of Economics. He worked for the British firm Ferranti, where he worked on minicomputers. Ellenby moved to California in the 1970s, where he worked for Xerox, and became involved in the management of the development of the Alto and Alto II desktop computers. In 1978, Ellenby and Tim Mott proposed an idea to commercialise the Alto computer, but this idea was later abandoned due to financial constraints. Ellenby said that they \\"had to sandbag the Alto because with it we couldn't make their numbers and therefore wouldn't get any bonuses\\". In 1979, he cofounded Grid Systems Corporation with colleagues from Xerox PARC; the business started with $13 million of funding from Wall Street venture capitalists. In 1982, Grid built the Grid Compass, which was one of the first laptop computers to feature the now-popular clamshell design, and was used on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. In 1988, Grid was sold to the Tandy Corporation. The design for The Compass computer was allegedly based on the shape of Ellenby's briefcase.

The plot follows two unlicensed Swedish private investigators trying to make a living in Los Angeles. It premiered on September 2, 2016 via Swedish online streaming service Viaplay as its first original production. In the United States, the series premiered on the Pop television network on August 9, 2017, as well as being distributed worldwide by American company Lionsgate TV. In October 2016, the series was renewed for a second season which premiered on December 25, 2017 in Northern Europe and premiered in 2018 in the United States. Premise A former stuntman, Ingmar Andersson (Peter Stormare), works as a private investigator in Los Angeles. His life crosses paths with struggling DJ Axel Kruse (Johan Glans). After giving up his DJ career, he decides to join Ingmar and becomes a partner of his detective firm \\"Swedish Dick\\" (now \\"Swedish Dicks\\"). Together, they solve various cases, as well as compete with Ingmar's long-time rival and owner of the best investigating company in Los Angeles, Jane McKinney (Traci Lords). Axel is also trying to discover Ingmar's past and the circumstances of his retirement from stunt performing. Production Peter Stormare came up with the concept for Swedish Dicks in 2014. He began writing the script for what was intended to become a one-hour drama. When he showed the script to Peter Settman, he suggested that it would be better as a series. Stormare was inspired by his real-life friends, one ex- military and the other an ex-stuntman, who really did become private investigators. =Casting= The series was first announced in November 2015 with Peter Stormare and Johan Glans as confirmed cast. In March 2016, it was announced that Keanu Reeves and Traci Lords had joined the show. Stormare confirmed he wrote the part of Jane McKinney with Lords in mind: \\"I had never met her, but whenever I saw her in a photo or anything, I just felt a connection to that face. And then she had written a book that is fantastic, about her survival, and how that girl survived is a miracle. So it was like a voice within me when I was writing, saying, 'You have to get Traci Lords, Traci Lords, Traci Lords.' Like she was channeling me.\\" Lords described Jane as \\"the kind of a woman who likes to play with men and use her femininity. At the same time, she believes that she definitely has the biggest dick in the room.\\" Cast * Peter Stormare as Ingmar Andersson * Johan Glans as Axel Kruse, Axel Magnus Enstr√∂m * Vivian Bang as Sun * Felisha Cooper as Sarah Andersson * Keanu Reeves as Tex Johnson * Traci Lords as Jane McKinney Episodes = Season 1 (2016) = = Season 2 (2017) = Broadcast The first two episodes of Swedish Dicks premiered on September 2, 2016 via Swedish online streaming service Viaplay. Later that month, it was announced that the series had been picked up by American network Lionsgate TV to be distributed worldwide, and premiered in the United States on the Pop television network on August 9, 2017. In October 2016, the series was renewed for a second season. It aired in December 2017 in Northern Europe and January 2018 in the United States. Reception Swedish Dicks received mixed reviews from critics. Karolina Fjellborg of Aftonbladet wrote: \\"Initially, I felt a concern that this series would be more silly than funny, but soon I realized that it is actually both - and it works.\\" P√•l Nisja Wilhelmsen of SIDE3 found the first episode \\"shockingly weak\\" but pointed out that \\"the two leading roles have a good chemistry, and the script gives them room for friendly banter\\". He added that the series is \\"entertaining enough, but is probably no classic.\\" Roger Wilson of Sveriges Radio wrote that Swedish Dicks is \\"one of those strange Swedish productions, where you think you do not need any act or joke if you just set it the United States and add guest appearances by Traci Lords and Keanu Reeves. It gets a little better when Traci Lords is in order, she can at least understand that she is part of a slapstick series.\\" Steve Greene of IndieWire wrote: \\"Yet, ‚ÄúSwedish Dicks‚Äù still has one ray of hope in the form of Keanu Reeves. Though he only appears for the briefest of moments, his presence and giddy deliveries of southern twang pep talks are at that ideal intersection between heightened genre riffing and a dash of needed pathos. As the spectral memory of Ingmar‚Äôs deceased stuntman partner Tex, Reeves is the kind of anchoring force that the rest of the scenes without him are in search of.\\" References External links 2016 American television series debuts 2018 American television series endings 2010s American comedy television series 2010s American crime television series Swedish comedy television series Swedish crime television series Television series by Lionsgate Television Television shows filmed in Los Angeles Television shows set in Los Angeles ","title":"Swedish Dicks"},{"id":"51431334","text":"Robert E.

It is dedicated to Parascheva of the Balkans. Located right by the Central University Library, it stands on the site of an earlier wooden church from 1730, dedicated to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. The site of the old altar table is marked by a cross to the right of the current altar, on the exterior. Archaeological evidence, including ruins, bones and coins, points to the presence of a still earlier church, from the reign of Vasile Lupu (1634-1653). History at the Saint Parascheva parish site The present church was built between 1852 and 1858 through the efforts of the priest Constantin Pavelescu and the administrator Dumitru Burduja. Although historian N. A. Bogdan suggested Costache Conachi was the founder, this hypothesis was later rejected, as he died in 1849. Today, Pavelescu's is one of two graves in the churchyard. Part of the beggars' guild attended the parish, the remainder going to the Banu Church. The church used to be a filial of Saint Nicholas the Poor, which no longer exists. The church is made of brick on a stone foundation and covered in a tin roof. The nave is rectangular, the altar arched. The bell tower sits atop the foyer; it is prism-shaped, with a square base, and has four curtained windows. An arch separates the vestibule from the nave, and both have half- sphere ceilings. Another arch, above the iconostasis, separates the nave from the altar. The church is sometimes called Prepodobna (Slavonic for \\"most holy\\"), Sf√¢nta Vineri or Vinerea Mare (another name for Parascheva). Renovations were carried out in 1932. After a bomb fell on the stairs in June 1944, during World War II, further repairs were done in 1945-1946. The church was painted between 1957 and 1962, with many interruptions. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The frescoes depict Biblical scenes and saints' faces. The domes were reinforced after the 1977 Vrancea earthquake affected the building, and work was done on the spire in 1993. The icons in the iconostasis are original, from 1858, and are in the Renaissance style of Eusta»õie Altini. The icon of Parascheva is decorated with silver, while the one of Saint Nicholas has a gilt metal frame. Valuable items in the church's collection include two Gospel Books printed at Neam»õ Monastery in 1821 and coated in silver; a silvered wooden cross with a pedestal kept on the altar table; two decorated silver communion boxes and an ornamented silver chalice. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Moner lived a humble life of solitude at his convent in Girona and later lived a period in France in a cave before being summoned back to Girona where he later died. His beatification received formal ratification from Pope Innocent XIII on 13 August 1721 after the latter confirmed the late friar's local 'cultus' - or popular devotion. Life Dalmazio Moner was born in 1291 in Spain - under Aragonese monarchical rule - to Catalan nobles. He studied in both his hometown of Girona and in Montpellier. He became a professed member of the Order of Preachers in Girona at the age of fifteen in 1306 and was later ordained to the priesthood at some point. Moner never wore a habit that was not in tatters and he picked up items of clothing from his fellow friars that were worn out and wore them as both a humble act of poorness and a penitential act. The friar never consumed fish or eggs and he instead lived on a diet of unseasoned vegetables and hard bread though he added a few ashes to such meals during each Lent. He also slept on bare earth and he often visited a local church to reflect and take an occasional nap in which he rested his head on the altar step. On one occasion a novice tempted to leave the order received a visit from Moner who convinced him otherwise and saw the novice remain in the order and on another occasion refused to help a mother heal her child of a serious sight disease after he said the disease would save him from serious sin and that God would decide the right time for the child to be healed. Moner did not speak to women much though when he did he turned his back to them and spoke over his shoulder. He refused all administrative offices offered to him. He was also commissioned to found a convent in Castell√≥n de Ampurias and after its construction returned to Girona in 1331. Sometime in the last four decades of his life he relocated to southern France and lived in Marseille in the cave that was said to be the place where Mary Magdalene once lived in and he ventured there as part of a pilgrimage. He left the cave just to attend choir sessions and to attend Mass. In 1334 he began his life of solitude in the cave and then in 1337 he returned to Girona after being summoned where he spent the remainder of his life in his convent. He died on 24 September 1341 and his remains were interred in Girona. Beatification Moner's beatification received official approval from Pope Innocent XIII on 13 August 1721 after the pontiff ratified a decree that confirmed the late friar's local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular and enduring veneration to him.

Intersex people were historically termed hermaphrodites, \\"congenital eunuchs\\",Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc Thu·∫ßn (1998), Vi·ªát s·ª≠ giai tho·∫°i (History of Vietnam's tales), vol. 8, Vietnam Education Publishing House, p. 55 or even congenitally \\"frigid\\". Such terms have fallen out of favor, now considered to be misleading and stigmatizing. Intersex people have been treated in different ways by different cultures. Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre- modern cultures and legal systems, and numerous historical accounts exist. Ancient history =Sumer= A Sumerian creation myth from more than 4,000 years ago has Ninmah, a mother goddess, fashioning humanity out of clay. She boasts that she will determine the fate ‚Äì good or bad ‚Äì for all she fashions: = Ancient Judaism = In traditional Jewish culture, intersex individuals were either androgynos or tumtum and took on different gender roles, sometimes conforming to men's, sometimes to women's. = Ancient Islam = By the eighth century CE, records of Islamic legal rulings discuss individuals known in Arabic as khuntha. This term, which has been translated as \\"hermaphrodite,\\" was used to apply to individuals with a range of intersex conditions, including mixed gonadal disgenesis, male hypospadias, partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, gonadal aplasia, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In Islamic law, inheritance was determined based on sex, so it was sometimes necessary to attempt to determine the biological sex of sexually ambiguous heirs. The first recorded case of this sort has been attributed to the seventh-century Rashidun caliph named 'Ali, who attempted to settle an inheritance case between five brothers in which one brother had both a male and female urinary opening. 'Ali advised the brothers that sex could be determined by site of urination in a practice called hukm al-mabal; if urine exited the male opening, the individual was male, and if it exited the female opening, the individual was female. If it exited both openings simultaneously, as it did in this case, the heir would be given half of a male inheritance and half of a female inheritance. Later, in the thirteenth century CE, Shafi'i law expert Abu Zakariya al-Nawawi ruled that an individual whose sex could not be determined by hukm al-mabal, such as those with urination from both openings or those with no identifiable sex organs, was assigned the intermediary sex category khuntha mushkil. Both Hanafi and Hanbali lawmakers also recognized that puberty could clarify a new dominant sex in intersex individuals who were labeled khuntha, male, or female in childhood. If a khuntha or male developed female secondary sex characteristics, performed vaginal sex, lactacted, menstruated, or conceived, this person's legal sex could change to female. Conversely, if a khuntha or female developed male secondary sex characteristics, performed penetrative sex with a woman, or had an erection, their legal sex could change to male. This understanding of the effect of puberty on intersex conditions appears in Islamic law as early as the eleventh century CE, notably by Ibn Qudama. In the sixteenth century CE, Ibrahim al-Halabi, a member of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence in Islam, directed slave owners to use special gender-neutral language when freeing intersex slaves. He recognized that language manumitting \\"males\\" or \\"females\\" would not directly apply to them. =Ancient South Asia= The Tirumantiram Tirumular recorded the relationship between intersex people and Shiva. Ardhanarishvara, an androgynous composite form of male deity Shiva and female deity Parvati, originated in Kushan culture as far back as the first century CE. A statue depicting Ardhanarishvara is included in India's Meenkashi Temple; this statue clearly shows both male and female bodily elements. Due to the presence of intersex traits, Ardhanarishvara is associated with the hijra, a third sex category that has been accepted in South Asia for centuries. After interviewing and studying the hijra for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India as follows: \\"There is a widespread belief in India that hijras are born hermaphrodites [intersex] and are taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the hijras I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens.\\"Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. xx. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999 According to Gilbert Herdt, the hijra differentiate between \\"born\\" and \\"made\\" individuals, or those who have physical intersex traits by birth and those who become hijra through penectomy, respectively. According to Indian tradition, the hijra perform a traditional song and dance as part of a family's celebration of the birth of a male child; during the performance, they also inspect the newborn's genitals to verify its sex. Herdt states that it is widely accepted that if the child is intersex, the hijra have a right to claim it as part of their community. However, Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. The hijra are mentioned in some versions of the Ramayana, a Hindu epic poem from around 300 BCE, in a myth about the hero Rama instructing his devotees to return to the city Ayodhya rather than follow him across the city's adjacent river into banishment. Since he gives this instruction specifically to \\"all you men and women,\\" his hijra followers, being neither, remain on the banks of the river for fourteen years until Rama returns from exile. In the Tantric sect of Hinduism, there is a belief that all individuals possess both male and female components. This belief can be seen explicitly in the Tantric concept of a Supreme Being with both male and female sex organs, which constitutes \\"one complete sex\\" and the ideal physical form. =Ancient Greece= According to Leah DeVun, a \\"traditional Hippocratic/Galenic model of sexual difference ‚Äì popularized by the late antique physician Galen and the ascendant theory for much of the Middle Ages ‚Äì viewed sex as a spectrum that encompassed masculine men, feminine women, and many shades in between, including hermaphrodites, a perfect balance of male and female\\". DeVun contrasts this with an Artistotelian view of intersex, which argued that \\"hermaphrodites were not an intermediate sex but a case of doubled or superfluous genitals\\", and this later influenced Aquinas. In the mythological tradition, Hermaphroditus was a beautiful youth who was the son of Hermes (Roman Mercury) and Aphrodite (Venus).Ovid, Metamorphoses 4.287‚Äì88. Ovid wrote the most influential narrativeTaylor, The Moral Mirror of Roman Art, p. 77; Clarke, Looking at Lovemaking, p. 49. of how Hermaphroditus became androgynous, emphasizing that although the handsome youth was on the cusp of sexual adulthood, he rejected love as Narcissus had, and likewise at the site of a reflective pool.Taylor, The Moral Mirror of Roman Art, p. 78ff. There the water nymph Salmacis saw and desired him. He spurned her, and she pretended to withdraw until, thinking himself alone, he undressed to bathe in her waters. She then flung herself upon him, and prayed that they might never be parted. The gods granted this request, and thereafter the body of Hermaphroditus contained both male and female. As a result, men who drank from the waters of the spring Salmacis supposedly \\"grew soft with the vice of impudicitia\\".Paulus ex Festo 439L; Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" p. 549. The myth of Hylas, the young companion of Hercules who was abducted by water nymphs, shares with Hermaphroditus and Narcissus the theme of the dangers that face the beautiful adolescent male as he transitions to adult masculinity, with varying outcomes for each.Taylor, The Moral Mirror of Roman Art, p. 216, note 46. =Ancient Rome= Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD) Pliny notes that \\"there are even those who are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time androgyni\\" (andr-, \\"man,\\" and gyn-, \\"woman\\", from the Greek).Pliny, Natural History 7.34: gignuntur et utriusque sexus quos hermaphroditos vocamus, olim androgynos vocatos; Veronique Dasen, \\"Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity,\\" Oxford Journal of Archaeology 16.1 (1997), p. 61. However, the era also saw a historical account of a congenital eunuch. The Sicilian historian Diodorus (latter 1st- century BC) wrote of \\"hermaphroditus\\" in the first century BCE: Isidore of Seville (c. 560‚Äì636) described a hermaphrodite fancifully as those who \\"have the right breast of a man and the left of a woman, and after coitus in turn can both sire and bear children.\\"Isidore of Seville, Eytmologiae 11.3. 11. Under Roman law, as many others, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.Lynn E. Roller, \\"The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest,\\" Gender & History 9.3 (1997), p. 558. Will Roscoe writes that the hermaphrodite represented a \\"violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female.\\"Will Roscoe, \\"Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion,\\" History of Religions 35, no. 3 (Feb., 1996): 195-230. In traditional Roman religion, a hermaphroditic birth was a kind of prodigium, an occurrence that signalled a disturbance of the pax deorum, Rome's treaty with the gods.Veit Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles: Controlling the Res Publica,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 295. But Pliny observed that while hermaphrodites were once considered portents, in his day they had become objects of delight (deliciae) who were trafficked in an exclusive slave market.Plutarch, Moralia 520c; Dasen, \\"Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity,\\" p. 61. According to historian John Clarke, depictions of Hermaphroditus were very popular among the Romans: In c.400, Augustine wrote in The Literal Meaning of Genesis that humans were created in two sexes, despite \\"as happens in some births, in the case of what we call androgynes\\". Historical accounts of intersex people include the sophist and philosopher Favorinus, described as a eunuch (Œµ·ΩêŒΩŒø·ø¶œáŒøœÇ) by birth.Philostratus, VS 489 Mason and others thus describe Favorinus as having an intersex trait.Mason, H.J., Favorinus‚Äô Disorder: Reifenstein's Syndrome in Antiquity?, in Janus 66 (1978) 1‚Äì13.Horstmanshoff (2000) 103 n. 39Eugenio Amato (intr., ed., comm.) and Yvette Julien (trans.), Favorinos d'Arles, Oeuvres I. Introduction g√©n√©rale - T√©moignages - Discours aux Corinthiens - Sur la Fortune, Paris: Les Belles Lettres (2005). A broad sense of the term \\"eunuch\\" is reflected in the compendium of ancient Roman laws collected by Justinian I in the 6th century known as the Digest or Pandects. Those texts distinguish between the general category of eunuchs (spadones, denoting \\"one who has no generative power, an impotent person, whether by nature or by castration\\", D 50.16.128) and the more specific subset of castrati (castrated males, physically incapable of procreation). Eunuchs (spadones) sold in the slave markets were deemed by the jurist Ulpian to be \\"not defective or diseased, but healthy\\", because they were anatomically able to procreate just like monorchids (D 21.1.6.2). On the other hand, as Julius Paulus pointed out, \\"if someone is a eunuch in such a way that he is missing a necessary part of his body\\" (D 21.1.7), then he would be deemed diseased. In these Roman legal texts, spadones (eunuchs) are eligible to marry women (D 23.3.39.1), institute posthumous heirs (D 28.2.6), and adopt children (Institutions of Justinian 1.11.9), unless they are castrati. Middle Ages An illustration from a 13th-century manuscript of the Decretum Gratiani In Abnormal (Les anormaux), Michel Foucault suggested it is likely that, \\"from the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century ... hermaphrodites were considered to be monsters and were executed, burnt at the stake and their ashes thrown to the winds.\\" However, Christof Rolker disputes this, arguing that \\"Contrary to what has been claimed, there is no evidence for hermaphrodites being persecuted in the Middle Ages, and the learned laws did certainly not provide any basis for such persecution\\". Canon Law sources provide evidence of alternative perspectives, based upon prevailing visual indications and the performance of gendered roles. The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that \\"Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails\\" (\\"Hermafroditus an ad testamentum adhiberi possit, qualitas sexus incalescentis ostendit.\\").Decretum Gratiani, C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3 In the late twelfth century, the canon lawyer Huguccio stated that, \\"If someone has a beard, and always wishes to act like a man (excercere virilia) and not like a female, and always wishes to keep company with men and not with women, it is a sign that the male sex prevails in him and then he is able to be a witness, where a woman is not allowed\\". Concerning the ordination of 'hermaphrodites', Huguccio concluded: \\"If therefore the person is drawn to the feminine more than the male, the person does not receive the order. If the reverse, the person is able to receive but ought not to be ordained on account of deformity and monstrosity.\\" Henry de Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (\\"On the Laws and Customs of England\\"), c. 1235,Henry de Bracton. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 17 March 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online classifies mankind as \\"male, female, or hermaphrodite\\", and \\"A hermaphrodite is classed with male or female according to the predominance of the sexual organs.\\" The thirteenth-century canon lawyer Henry of Segusio argued that a \\"perfect hermaphrodite\\" where no sex prevailed should choose their legal gender under oath.Henrici de Segusio, Cardinalis Hostiensis, Summa aurea, Venice 1574 here at col. 612. Early modern period The 17th-century English jurist and judge Edward Coke (Lord Coke), wrote in his Institutes of the Lawes of England on laws of succession stating, \\"Every heire is either a male, a female, or an hermaphrodite, that is both male and female. And an hermaphrodite (which is also called Androgynus) shall be heire, either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile.\\"E Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a. (1st Am. Ed. 1812). The Institutes are widely held to be a foundation of common law. A few historical accounts of intersex people exist due primarily to the discovery of relevant legal records, including those of Thomas(ine) Hall (17th-century United States), Eleno de C√©spedes, a 16th-century intersex person in Spain , and Fernanda Fern√°ndez (18th-century Spain). In 2019 the Smithsonian Channel aired a documentary \\"American's Hidden Stories: The General was Female?\\" with evidence that Casimir Pulaski, the important American Revolutionary War hero, may have been intersex. In a court case, heard at the Castellania in 1774 during the Order of St. John in Malta, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, later described in the British Medical Journal as a pseudo-hermaphrodite, petitioned for a change in sex classification from female. Two clinicians were appointed by the court to perform an examination. They found that \\"the male sex is the dominant one\\". The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster himself who took the final decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. Maria Dorothea Derrier/Karl D√ºrrge was a German intersex person who made their living for 30 years as a human research subject. Born in Potsdam in 1780, and designated as female at birth, they assumed a male identity around 1807. Traveling intersex persons, like Derrier and Katharina/Karl Hohmann, who allowed themselves to be examined by physicians were instrumental in the development of codified standards for sexing. Mid modern period Bronze statue of alt=A golden-coloured statue of a man in a gown on a seat with a sword on his knees. In front there is a polished wooden table with goldleaf and a blue and white porcelain vase with yellow flowers. Behind him is a wooden altar with lights and incense holders. The altar has the same design as the table. The wall is cream-coloured. During the Victorian era, medical authors introduced the terms \\"true hermaphrodite\\" for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, verified under a microscope, \\"male pseudo-hermaphrodite\\" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and \\"female pseudo- hermaphrodite\\" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Historical accounts including those of Vietnamese general L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát (18th/19th-century) who helped to unify Vietnam; Gottlieb G√∂ttlich, a 19th-century German travelling medical case; and Levi Suydam, an intersex person in 19th-century USA whose capacity to vote in male-only elections was questioned. The memoirs of 19th-century intersex Frenchwoman Herculine Barbin were published by Michel Foucault in 1980. Her birthday is marked in Intersex Day of Remembrance on 8 November. Contemporary period The Phall-O-Meter satirizes clinical assessments of appropriate clitoris and penis length at birth. The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in the 1917 paper Intersexuality and the endocrine aspect of sex.Hirschfeld, M. (1923) 'Die Intersexuelle Konstitution.' Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 23, 3‚Äì27. The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' came from British specialist Cawadias in the 1940s.Cawadias, A. P. (1943) Hermaphoditus the Human Intersex, London, Heinemann Medical Books Ltd. This suggestion was taken up by specialists in the UK during the 1960s.Armstrong, C. N. (1964) \\"Intersexuality in Man\\", IN ARMSTRONG, C. N. & MARSHALL, A. J. (Eds.) Intersexuality in Vertebrates Including Man, London, New York, Academic Press Ltd.Dewhurst, S. J. & Gordon, R. R. (1969) The Intersexual Disorders, London, Bailli√®re Tindall & Cassell. Historical accounts from the early twentieth century include that of Australian Florrie Cox, whose marriage was annulled due to \\"malformation frigidity\\". Since the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a \\"social emergency\\" once they were born. The parents of the intersex babies were not content about the situation. Psychologists, sexologists, and researchers frequently still believe that it is better for a baby's genitalia to be changed when they were younger than when they were a mature adult. These scientists believe that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion. This was called the 'Optimal Gender Policy', and it was initially developed in the 1950s by John Money. Money and others controversially believed that children were more likely to develop a gender identity that matched sex of rearing than might be determined by chromosomes, gonads, or hormones. The primary goal of assignment was to choose the sex that would lead to the least inconsistency between external anatomy and assigned psyche (gender identity). Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. Numerous civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary \\"normalizing\\" interventions. The first public demonstration by intersex people took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside the venue in Boston where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. The group demonstrated against \\"normalizing\\" treatments, and carried a sign saying \\"Hermaphrodites With Attitude\\". The event is now commemorated by Intersex Awareness Day. In 2011, Christiane V√∂lling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people.

His name is also written Yu Geun-Hyeong or Yu Kun-hyong or Yoo Geun-hyung.  Biography  He produced porcelain celadon from 1911 to 1945, and devoted his life to researching celadon across the country and resurrecting Goryeo celadon (Ï≤≠ÏûêÏû• ; Á£ÅÂå† ; Cheongjajang). The name of his kiln was Haegang (Ìï¥Í∞ï ; Êµ∑Ââõ), which was located in Gyeonggi Province outside Seoul. Yu had very high standards for his work. Every piece that was taken out of the kiln after firing was completed was carefully inspected from all sides. Any pieces that showed a flaw and did not fit the high standards were then smashed to the ground on the spot. This was to ensure the consistent high quality of new Goryeo wares that would then enter the market coming from his kiln, and this method was not something unusual amongst traditional Korean and Japanese ceramists adhering to the old schools. He established the Haegang Ceramics Museum in Shindun-myeon, Icheon in 1960. His work and efforts were recognised and he was nominated by the government as a Living National Treasure as holder of Intangible Cultural Property No.13 of Gyeonggi Province. At a very late age, together with his oldest son and successor Yu Kwang-Ryeol, or Yoo Kwang-yul (Ïú†Í¥ëÎ†¨ ; Êü≥ÂÖâÁÉà), he founded the Haegang Pottery Art Gallery in 1990.

Although remaining winless, thrashed 43-0 and 37-8 in the first two games, the tight 12-3 result in the third match gave Queensland its first-ever rugby league stars, with Mick Bolewski, Bill Hardcastle, Bill Heidke and Jack Fihelly all being selected for the first-ever Kangaroo tour to England. Game 1 Still some months away from having their own competition, Queensland traveled to Sydney to play rugby league football against New South Wales for the first time.

A Hennessy (c) With the likes of the great Dally Messenger, Billy Cann, Jersey O'Malley and skipper Arthur Hennessy in their ranks the Blues represented the cream of the newly established NSWRFL, whilst Queensland had done well to assemble a team as they had not yet established a club competition. It was no surprise, then, that NSW proved far superior in this inaugural meeting, with South Sydney winger Tommy Anderson posting four tries as the Blues raced to a 43-0 win. Game 2 New South Wales selected a completely new team for the second match. This is regarded as an exhibition match and is not included in official interstate rugby league totals.Middleton D. 2011 Official Rugby League Annual (Newlife Media) Queensland: 1. M Bolewski, 2.

She married Francis James Wilding in 1932 and migrated to Australia the following year. She changed her first name to Joyce and ran a boarding house in the family home in West End, Brisbane to supplement the family income. Activism In 1953, Ian Shevill, the Anglican bishop of North Queensland, appealed for someone in Brisbane to provide accommodation for a young Aboriginal man from Yarrabah Mission, Tennyson Kynuna. He had secured an apprenticeship in Brisbane, but could not secure accommodation due to his race. After taking him in, Wilding was requested by the Queensland Department of Native Affairs to take in two Aboriginal trainee teachers, Phil Stewart and Mick Miller. The remaining 20 white guests in Wilding‚Äôs boarding house then moved out, in protest at being required to live with Aboriginal people.Darling, Elaine They Spoke Out Pretty Good (Melb, 1998) Startled by the response of her white guests, Wilding then opened her home to homeless Aboriginal people and the boarding house was soon overcrowded. She received death threats and frequent abuse. In 1961, Wilding helped to form the One People of Australia League (OPAL), an organisation dedicated to promoting co-operation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, with a view to assimilation of Aboriginal people into white Australian culture.http://indigenousrights.net.au/organisations/pagination/one_people_of_australia_league This goal put the organisation at odds with other Aboriginal rights groups, but it resulted in OPAL securing a great deal of government funding, enabling it to provide housing, education and welfare assistance to disadvantaged Aboriginal people in Queensland. Neville Bonner was president of OPAL from 1968 to 1975. Wilding continued to provide housing for homeless Aboriginal people in her own home. Over time, thousands of Aboriginal people who had newly arrived in Brisbane found shelter there, including Jackie Huggins, who went on to become a prominent Aboriginal rights activist. In 1970, OPAL opened the Joyce Wilding Home in Eight Mile Plains, Brisbane, which was a refuge for Aboriginal widows, deserted mothers and children. Wilding became matron of the home the same year. The institution still provides short-term accommodation for Aboriginal women and their children, and is now known as the Opal Joyce Wilding Hostel.http://newfarmneighbourhood.org/wp- content/uploads/2010/11/Family-Accom-Oct-2009.doc Community work In 1957, Wilding was a founding member of the St Veronica Welfare Committee, an organisation founded in West End, Brisbane initially to raise money for refugees. She travelled to India and Bangladesh to provide humanitarian aid and founded a relief society to send blankets, clothing and medical equipment to Dr R.R. Doshi‚Äôs tuberculosis clinic at Anand, Gujarat. Awards Wilding was appointed MBE in the 1964 Queen‚Äôs Birthday Honours List for her work as matron of the OPAL Hostel named in her honour.London Gazette (Supplement No.43343), 5 June 1964, p.4961 In 1966, Wilding was made the Quota Club of Brisbane's 'Woman of the Year'. She was presented with a humanitarian award by the Rosicrucian Order, Grand Lodge of San Jos√©, California, in 1977.

The facility has a maximum capacity of 1940, at medium security.  History  Great Plains opened in 1991 as the state's first private prison, a 500-bed facility financed by the town of Hinton floating a bond issue. The first client was the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In 2000 the facility held Oklahoma prisoners; the state levied a substantial fine against Cornell Companies (the predecessor of GEO Group) for failing to performing contractual obligations related to medical care. Oklahoma kept inmates at Great Plains until April 2007 when it ended the relationship‚Äîreportedly because of costs, but also after a January incident where two convicts cut the fence, escaped and went on a brief kidnapping and auto-theft crime spree before their recapture. Shortly afterward Arizona reached a deal to house about 2000 inmates at Great Plains. The facility was expanded in 2008 to accommodate that higher number. Arizona ended that arrangement prematurely in August 2010. From 2010 through early 2014 the facility was empty. Federal officials again contracted to house \\"non-U.S. citizen criminal aliens who are deemed to be 'low-security' risks\\" with less than a year left to serve. In August 2016 the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that it was phasing out its use of all private prisons as contracts expire, indicating that the facility will close once more. In February 2017 U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, rescinded the 2016 order by the Obama administration assuring Great Plains Correctional will continue as a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility operated by GEO Group.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice- department-will-again-use-private- prisons/2017/02/23/da395d02-fa0e-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html References Prisons in Oklahoma Buildings and structures in Caddo County, Oklahoma GEO Group 1991 establishments in Oklahoma ","title":"Great Plains Correctional Institution"},{"id":"51431729","text":"Maraniss is a surname.

The name is believed by many to be based on the Sanskrit word for \\"snake\\", as well as possibly Naga, a World of Warcraft race. There have been eleven iterations in the Naga series, not counting the redesigned versions, with release dates spanning from 2009 to 2020. The mice are, in order of release: the Naga, Naga Epic, Naga 2012, Naga Hex, Naga 2014, Naga Epic Chroma, Naga Chroma, Naga Hex v2, Naga Trinity, the 2020 release of the Naga Left-Handed Edition, and Naga Pro. All except the Naga Epic, Naga Epic Chroma and Naga Pro are wired and connected through a USB port. The Naga Hex and the Naga Hex v2 are the only iterations to have less than twelve buttons, with six and seven respectively. The Naga Trinity and Naga Pro have an interchangable amount of side buttons, though both have a maximum of twelve. The colors of the mice vary. Most of the Nagas, except the Naga Epic, Naga Hex, and Naga Hex v2, which received mixed reviews, were met with positive reviews from critics. The primary reason for the Naga Epic's mixed reviews was because of its price, although reviewers liked its wireless capabilities. The main criticism of both the Naga Hex and Naga Hex v2 was the arrangement of the buttons. History The name Razer Naga is believed to be based on both the Sanskrit word for \\"snake\\" and possibly Naga, a World of Warcraft race. The first Razer Naga was announced at Gamescom 2009 and released in August 2009. The first version of the Naga had a total of seventeen buttons, with twelve being on the left side of the mouse, and a switch on the underside of the mouse that maps them to the keyboard's top number buttons or its numeric keypad. The original Naga had a maximum sensitivity of 5,600 DPI. DPI stands for \\"dots per inch\\", and is a unit for measuring the sensitivity of a mouse, with a higher DPI equaling a higher sensitivity. Downloadable software by Razer called AddOns allowed the user to map what each key did. The Naga Epic, which was released in November 2010, was the first installment in the Naga series to have wireless functionality. It was also released with an interchangeable side panel and the ability to change the color of the lights from a pool of sixteen million colors. A redesigned version of the original Naga, called the Naga Molten, was released in early 2011. In the second quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with interchangeable side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface. The Naga 2014 was released in July 2013 and featured \\"more pronounced, redesigned individual buttons, allowing for easier recognition and more precise button presses.\\" It had a total of nineteen programmable buttons, twelve of which are side-on. It was the first iteration in the Naga series to have a maximum sensitivity of 8,200 DPI, and is the only Naga which has both left-handed and right-handed versions, though the left-handed edition was eventually discontinued for insufficient demand. The only other iteration which has a maximum sensitivity of 8,200 DPI is the Naga Epic Chroma, released in November 2014. The Naga Epic Chroma is wireless and also featured nineteen programmable buttons of which twelve are on the side. The Naga Trinity without a side panel. This allows the user to choose how many buttons they want. The first mouse in the Naga series to possess a maximum sensitivity of 16,000 DPI and a \\"5G optical laser sensor\\" was the Naga Chroma. Released in November 2015, Razer said it \\"brings the world's most advanced mouse sensor to the world of MMO gaming\\" and now \\"the Razer 5G laser sensor is capable of tracking up to true 16,000 DPI down to 1 DPI increments\\". Released in June 2016, the first Naga with seven buttons on the side was the Razer Naga Hex v2. The Naga Hex v2 also featured a 5G laser sensor and a maximum sensitivity of 16,000 DPI. All of the mice have a polling rate of 1000 Hz. The polling rate of a mouse is how many often it notifies the computer of its location each second, with each Hz equaling one register. In November 2017, Razer introduced the Naga Trinity. This mouse has interchangeable side panels, meaning the user could choose how many buttons they wanted. With this addition, Razer intended it to replace both the Naga Hex v2 and the Naga Chroma. A left-handed version of the Naga Trinity was planned, but after an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign, raising only US$80,000 of the desired $1.3 million, the model was cancelled. In 2019, Razer announced that they would be re-releasing the discontinued left-handed Naga with improved specifications. Similar to the failed left-handed release of the Naga Trinity, Razer asked for those interested to pre-register due to the costly nature of releasing an unpopular product. Released in August 2020, the Naga Left-Handed Edition was the first mouse in the series to have a maximum DPI of 20,000, accomplished through the implementation of the \\"Razer Focus+ Optical Sensor\\". In September, the Naga Pro was released, also with a maximum DPI of 20,000. The Naga Pro, like the Naga Trinity, has a replaceable side panel.

The original Razer Naga had a positive reception, although many pointed out the obvious targeting towards MMO gamers. Nicholas Deleon on the tech site TechCrunch said the Naga is a good and comfortable mouse. He noted that it is not any better than using a keyboard, and how the usefulness of the mouse would depend on how much the user is willing to practice and learn how to use it. Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica called it a \\"niche product\\", stating the buttons were unappealing to people who did not play MMO games. The redesigned version of the Naga, called the Naga Epic Molten, received positive reviews for its design. Critics had mixed feelings about the Naga Epic, with many believing the price was too high. Rich Brown of CNet said the mouse does not warrant the high price tag and awarded it an overall rating of 7.3/10. The reviewers at PC Magazine thought the Epic was expensive, but commended the mouse's attractiveness and wireless feature. Mathew McCurley of Engadget commended the long-lasting battery and the wireless capability of the mouse and stated that \\"if you're interested in trying something new, give it a shot.\\" He said that it takes time to get used to the design and feel. Reviewers thought the Naga 2012 was a good mouse overall. Russell Holly of the technology site Geek.com said he would recommend it to anyone and David Daw of PC World said it would be difficult to find a better gaming mouse for the same price. Daw believed that having seventeen buttons may have been overkill, but continued by saying that \\"a little bit of overkill is okay.\\" The Naga Hex received mixed reviews, with the most prevalent dislike being its surface. Sean Buckley of Engadget disliked the Naga Hex because of its plastic surface and how the arrangement of the buttons on the side resulted in them feeling cramped. Brian Westover of PC Magazine said the hexagonal layout of the buttons made them easier to understand and use, but felt the placement of them was sub-par. Westover said that after using the mouse for long periods of time, the surface becomes \\"slick\\". The redesigned League of Legends version of the Hex was praised by Westover. The Naga 2014 received positive reviews, with many reviewers enjoying the comfort and the feel of the buttons. Nate Ralph of PC World said the Naga 2014 has a more comfortable design compared to the previous versions. Hayden Dingman, also of PC World said the nineteen buttons may be over the top for most people, but for those who need it, it's the best option. Matt Smith of Digital Trends said the mouse was comfortable and the buttons felt robust. He noted that the button arrangement may \\"take some time to get used to\\". Rob Keyes of GameRant said that when compared to the previous iterations, the Naga 2014 has better buttons and is more user-friendly. He recommended the mouse to people who liked the previous iterations and to people who wish to have better control in MMOs. Marshall Honorof said the mouse is guaranteed to appeal to MMO fans, but isn't very useful for other genres. Both the Naga Epic Chroma and the Naga Chroma were praised by reviewers. Marshall Honorof liked the quality and design of both mice. Honorof commended the wireless capabilities of the Naga Epic Chroma, along with the lighting and comfort. As with the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 received mixed reviews, with the major criticism being its button arrangement. Amanda Yeo of the website Gizmodo said that if the reader liked the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 is a definite upgrade. She noted that newer users might be thrown off by the button configuration. Marshall Honorof's biggest criticism of the mouse was that \\"most people won't need one\\", though he continued to say that for those who do, it would work exactly as expected. He said that at first, the button arrangement threw him off. Michael Crider of Digital Trends said that once the user gets used to the button layout, the actions are \\"quick and responsive.\\" Matthew Buzzi of PC Magazine also believed that the user would like it if they play MOBAs, but if not, another mouse might be a better option. He also asserted that the Naga Hex v2 is reliable and well made. Kane Fulton from Techradar listed the Naga Hex v2 as one of the ten best gaming mice.

He became the first priest to enter the Franciscans and served as one of the disciples of Francis of Assisi himself - the priest was at his deathbed and attended his canonization. The friar preached across Italian cities such as Rome and Padua as well as in France and he became noted for miracles performed during his lifetime. His beatification received formal ratification from Pope Clement XII in 1738 after the pontiff confirmed that there existed a spontaneous local 'cultus' - otherwise known as enduring veneration - to the late friar. He has been the patron of Spello - his hometown - since 1360. Life Andrea Caccioli was born in the Umbria province - in the peasant town dubbed Spello - on 30 November 1194 to nobles and was named in honor of Andrew the Apostle. He was baptized in December 1194. He commenced his studies for the priesthood in his adolescence and received his ordination as a priest from the Bishop of Spoleto Nicola Porta in 1216. In 1217 he became a pastor for Spello in the local parish of San Severino. He met Francis of Assisi in 1219 at Spoleto at the convent of Santa Maria di Vallegloria and in 1223 decided to join Francis's Order of Friars Minor. He became part of the Order of Friars Minor in 1223 after the death of his parents and sister and he received the habit from Francis himself before commencing a period of the novitiate from 1223 until 1224. The priest was at the deathbed of Francis on 3 October 1226. He met Pope Gregory IX in Assisi at the time of the canonization of Francis of Assisi on 16 July 1228 alongside Brother Moricus and he persuaded the pope with success to consecrate the high altar of the church of San Lorenzo in the town. He oversaw the transfer of Francis' remains on 25 July 1230. The priest attended the Provincial Chapter for the order in Soria in Spain in 1233 where it is believed he saved the town from drought and bought rain to the region after turning to God for His intercession. In 1235 he began to preach in various Italian cities as well as in the Kingdom of France; he visited cities such as Verona and Como. From 1239 until 1243 he was assigned to Reggio Emilia where it was said that he bought a dead man back to life. In 1244 the followers of the ex-Minister General Brother Elias imprisoned him due to his insistence of the literal observance of the Testament of Saint Francis though he was later released after John of Parma became Minister General in 1247. Clare of Assisi dispatched him alongside Pacifica de Guelfuccio d'Assisi in 1248 to reform the nuns of the Poor Clares at the convent of Santa Maria di Vallegloria in Spoleto. It was there that - in a recorded miracle - he found a fresh water spring for the nuns. He later retired to Eremo dei Carcere outside of Assisi where it was also claimed he saw Jesus Christ in a vision. In 1250 he received the profession of Cecilia di Gualtieri Cacciaguerra da Spoleto in the convent of Santa Maria di Vallegloria. He arranged for the church of Sant'Andrea to come under the jurisdiction of the Franciscans in 1253 and he became its first guardian. He died on 3 June 1254. =Exhumation and inspection= His remains were unearthed in Sant'Andrea in 1594 after the friars stationed there requested to their Provincial Minister to recover the relics of the late friar that the former believed were interred close to the church's pulpit. The supposed site was marked with a statue believed to be the late friar and so the other friars called for Ascensidonio Spacca to make a sketch of the statue before it was hammered in order to get to the burial site. The excavation bore fruit for an ancient coffin was unearthed in which an entire skeleton was found in it. The Bishop of Spoleto Paolo Sanvitale ordered the official recognition of the remains on 3 June 1597. In 1603 a silver box was commissioned for the skull of the late priest. Another review of his remains was initiated in 1623 under Bishop Lorenzo Castrucci. Beatification Bishop Lorenzo Castrucci initiated the beatification cause under Pope Urban VIII in 1625 and tasked Francesco Bongrazio da Gualdo Tadino with the collection of all available documentation. Those documents were submitted to the Congregation of Rites in 1627 though the cause closed without a conclusion beneficial to the cause in 1630. His beatification received formal ratification from Pope Clement XII on 25 July 1738 after the latter issued a decree that confirmed there existed a spontaneous and enduring local 'cultus' - or popular devotion and longstanding veneration - to the late friar. In 1360 he had been named as a patron for Spello.

Background  In 1996, Darren Schlappich started the band Chigliac Feedhorn in Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania, with local bluegrass musician Van Wagner as a duo that played original acoustic bluegrass at area open mic nights. They released the record, Dunawetter, of which seven songs were written by Schlappich. Wagner went to college and the band became an acoustic trio made up of Schlappich, Mike Lavdanski on banjo, and Will Dennis on acoustic bass. The trio eventually became an electric six-piece band that performed original songs written by Schlappich. Some of the band members came from Kutztown University while others are from the local community. Guitarist John Kilgore, formerly from the Kutztown bluegrass jam band, the Saucony Creek Ramblers, joined, as did drummer Toby Martin. Dennis left the band and Josh Sceurman joined, playing electric bass.  Frog Holler  The core band evolved into its present-day Frog Holler lineup of bandleader Schlappich on vocals and left-handed guitar, Lavdanski on banjo and vocal harmonies, Daniel Bower on drums, Kilgore on guitar, Cory Heller on keyboard, and Sceurman on bass, and often incorporate mandolin and steel guitar in their music. Because many members of the band are of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry, they are sometimes affectionately referred to as Pennsylvania Dutch rock. Frog Holler self-released its debut album, Couldn't Get Along. The record is dedicated to \\"The three Jays,\\" possibly Jay Farrar, Jay Bennett, and J Mascis. The band followed their debut with three releases on the local label. Record Cellar. As they built up a following regionally, the band began touring extensively, playing gigs from Boston to the Carolinas. Frog Holler released three records through the small independent label from Philadelphia, Record Cellar, run by Neil Drucker. Improved visibility and the release of their positively reviewed fourth record, Railings, led to the band touring the industrial midwest as well as the Netherlands. Frog Holler has been mostly regionally focused, while maintaining annual residencies at the now defunct New York City Rodeo Bar as well as an upstate New York music festival. Many of their songs reflect the small rural community of their origins, with the song \\"Pennsylvania\\" off their third record, Idiots, an ode to tension between modern life and the more conservative, set-in-its-way, German-American lifestyle of past generations. Idiots charted 34 on Americana radio charts and was well-reviewed. Throughout Frog Holler's music there are local references to landmarks and evocative descriptions of rural life. Their fourth record, Railings, was recorded at Edan Cohen's Soundgun Studios in Philadelphia. In 2016, seven years after their prior record, Frog Holler celebrated their 20-year anniversary as a band, releasing their seventh full-length record called Souvenir. The record was recorded between March 2015 and February 2016 with Bruce Siekmann, engineer and owner of Amoeba Studio in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania.  Critical response  Rachel Maddow saw Frog Holler open for Marah and became an avid fan, which led to her inviting Schlappich to perform on her Air America Radio show. Writer Meredith Ochs cites Frog Holler's live performances and high level of musicianship, as does Fred Mills, describing them as a \\"killer live band.\\" Andy Turner in No Depression calls Schlappich a \\"real-deal storyteller.\\" Peter Bothum from the York Daily Record says the music comes from a rare place of honesty. Doug Wallen from Philadelphia Weekly liked their genuine, \\"down-home sweetness of their loose, melodic strain of alt-country.\\" Geoffrey Himes, writing in The Washington Post, described Frog Holler as a secret treasure.  Ataloft  In 2012, Schlappich, Lavdanski, and Bruce Siekmann formed the pop-rock band Ataloft as a side project. The band released a self-titled album called Ataloft in 2014.  Dem Hills  In May 2017, Schlappich released Maybe Life Is Sweet in a new band collaboration project with Bruce Siekmann (Ameoba Audio) on guitar, Schlappich and Mike Lavdanski on vocals, Josh Kanusky on drums, Nick Franclik on bass and Cory Heller on keyboards. Siekmann and Schlappich wrote the songs and the band includes members of Frog Holler, Ataloft, and the David Bromberg Band.

Tan Son Nhut Air Base was one of the major air bases used for offensive air operations within South Vietnam and for the support of United States Army and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) ground operations. The attack by Vietcong (VC) sappers supported by mortar fire was repulsed by the United States Air Force (USAF) base security forces by 04:00 on 4 December, however VC stragglers continued to be engaged in and around the base until 5 December.  Prelude  After receiving intelligence that over 5000 American troops and tons of weapon would land at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in order to prepare for Operation Cedar Falls, elements of the Vietcong Special Forces Unit F100 led by L√™ Minh Xu√¢n left its camp at B√¨nh Ch√°nh, suburb of Saigon. The VC special forces also had support from others VC troops outside the base for logistic and preventing reinforcement of ARVN and the USAF base security forces.  Battle  The VC force led by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn K·ªãp (ƒê·ªìng ƒêen) penetrated the base perimeter fence at approximately 01:00 on 4 December. The penetration was detected by a USAF sentry dog team at guardpost Alpha K-19 north of the 07/25 runway and he raised the alarm. A USAF security patrol was deployed to guardpost and the VC began their attack shortly after this. An 8‚Äì9 man group of VC was engaged by guardpost 15 near Taxiway W-7. Another group of VC crossed the 07/25 runway and attempted to attack the aircraft parking area but were stopped by machine gun fire from bunker Delta 11 which killed 13 VC. Another group of VC entered the C-47 and helicopter parking area. The VC fired and threw hand grenades into the aircraft parking area before withdrawing at 01:40. A power unit next to an aircraft revetment exploded after being hit by a grenade and the resulting fire damaged an RF-101C aircraft. VC mortar fire from outside the base was detected by counter-mortar radar and the mortar site was targeted by ARVN 105mm artillery, Vietnam Air Force A-1s and helicopters from the US Army 120th Assault Helicopter Battalion. Elements of the ARVN 53rd Regional Force Battalion were ambushed as they approached the mortar site, suffering 2 killed but they overran the mortar position by 02:15 suffering a further 1 killed. As some VC withdrew at approximately 01:40, the USAF security police moved to block their escape. At 02:10 the retreating VC engaged the USAF line in a firefight that lasted until 02:35. 2 USAF security police were killed in this engagement and 2 wounded, while 3 VC were killed. At 02:30 a VC satchel charge exploded in the old bomb dump area in the north-central area of the base, detonating a store of US Navy 5 inch shells. At 03:05 a USAF guard at post Alpha K-20 reported that the VC were attacking his position. At 03:50 a sentry dog unit at Alpha K-21 pursued retreating VC and at 04:15 Alpha K-20 was secured but the USAF security policemen at that post had been killed. At 04:00 the base security forces were put on hold and at 04:45 a full search of the based was conducted. At 06:25 as the sun rose, VC were spotted on the road outside the base perimeter near the penetration point and were engaged by USAF security police, the VC returned fire and 2 VC were killed, 1 USAF wounded and 2 VC captured. A further 2 VC were captured near the west of runway 07/25. At 08:10 US forces mounted a search and destroy operation on the west perimeter of the air base until 09:20. The air base resumed normal flight operations at 08:49. At 20:21 Alpha Post K-34 detected VC and a quick reaction team was despatched to the scene. At 21:00 a search operation commenced and at 21:45 2 VC were killed in the area, a further 2 VC were killed later. At 22:45 to the south of the position another VC was located and killed. At 00:29 on 5 December a sentry dog team from A-34 detected VC and was soon engaged by 3 VC, the dog handler was shot and wounded, a quick reaction team arrived and the VC were killed with grenades. It was later determined that the VC were part of the original attack force who had been attempting to escape through the original entry point. At 11:53 on 5 December, a VC was observed in the old bomb dump area and he was engaged and killed. Aftermath The Viet Cong claim that they withdrew having destroyed 260 airplanes, a depot of bombs and shells, 13 military vehicles and having killed or wounded over 600 US and ARVN soldiers. The US suffered 3 USAF personnel killed and 15 wounded while the ARVN suffered 3 killed and 4 wounded. The US/ARVN killed 28 Viet Cong and captured 4. 17 aircraft suffered minor to moderate damage, 3 aircraft suffered major damage and 3 USAF vehicles were destroyed. The US considered the engagement as a victory as they had repulsed the attack with minimal losses.

Of obscure origin, Barjawan became the tutor of heir-apparent al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who became caliph in 996 with the death of al-Aziz Billah. On al-Hakim's coronation, power was seized by the Kutama Berbers, who tried to monopolize government and clashed with their rivals, the Turkish slave-soldiers. Allied with disaffected Berber leaders, Barjawan was able to seize the reins of government for himself in 997. His tenure was marked by a successful balancing act between the Berbers and the Turks, as well as the rise of men of diverse backgrounds, promoted under his patronage. Militarily, Barjawan was successful in restoring order to the Fatimids' restive Levantine and Libyan provinces, and set the stage for an enduring truce with the Byzantine Empire. The concentration of power in his hands and his overbearing attitude alienated al-Hakim, however, who ordered him assassinated and thereafter assumed the governance of the caliphate himself. Biography =Origin and rise to power= Barjawan's origin is obscure: in his biographical dictionary, Ibn Khallikan records him as a Black African, whereas the historians Ibn al-Qalanisi and al-Maqrizi assert that he was white (abya·∏ç al-lawn), with al-Maqrizi further specifying that he was either a Sicilian (Siqillƒ´) or a Slav (Saqlabƒ´), as both versions appear in the manuscripts of his work. A eunuch, he was brought up as a slave in the court of Caliph al- Aziz Billah (r. 975‚Äì996), under whom he became court intendant. Already before the death of al-Aziz, Barjawan was appointed tutor of the Caliph's son and heir Mansur, the future al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, whence he is also mentioned with the title of ustƒÅdh, \\"master\\", often borne by eunuch preceptors of princes. In 996, Bajarwan accompanied his charge to Bilbays, where al-Aziz, in the midst of preparing an expedition against the Byzantine Empire, had fallen ill and was approaching death. According to the chroniclers, upon al-Aziz's death, Bajarwan rushed to find his pupil. Finding him playing in a tree, he placed a jewelled turban on his head, and kissed the ground before him while saluting him as \\"Commander of the Faithful\\". After al-Aziz died, the Kutama Berbers, who had traditionally provided the mainstay of the Fatimid armies but had begun to be eclipsed by other groups‚Äîchiefly the Turkish and Daylamite mercenaries from the Islamic East or MashƒÅriqa (\\"Easterners\\")‚Äîused the opportunity presented by the accession of the underage al-Hakim to demand they be given control of the government. Al-Aziz's Christian vizier Isa ibn Nasturus was dismissed (and executed shortly after) and replaced by the veteran commander al-Hasan ibn Ammar, with the title of wƒÅsi·π≠a (\\"intermediary\\") rather than full vizier (wazƒ´r). Ibn Ammar immediately began staffing the government with Berbers, who engaged in a virtual pillaging of the state coffers. The Berbers' attempts to exclude the other interest groups from power‚Äînot only the Turks and the other ethnic contingents of the army, but also the civilian bureaucracy, whose salary was cut‚Äîalienated not only the MashƒÅriqa, but alarmed Barjawan, who furthermore nurtured ambitions of his own. Barjawan contacted the Fatimid governor of Damascus, the Turk Manjutakin, and invited him to march onto Egypt and depose Ibn Ammar. Manjutakin accepted, but was defeated by Ibn Ammar's troops under Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Falah at Ascalon and taken prisoner. Barjawan however soon found a new ally, in the person of the Kutama leader Jaysh ibn al-Samsama, governor of Tripoli, whom Ibn Falah dismissed and replaced with his own brother. Jaysh and Barjawan gathered a following of other dissatisfied Berber leaders, and launched an uprising in Cairo. Ibn Ammar was forced to flee, and Barjawan replaced him as wƒÅsi·π≠a on 4 October 997. =Government of Egypt and death= Portrait of Caliph al-Hakim During his ascendancy, Barjawan tried to balance the two factions and restore the equilibrium that had existed under al-Aziz. Thus he reversed the blatant partisanship of Ibn Ammar and fulfilled the demands of the MashƒÅriqa for positions and patronage, while taking care to placate the Kutama as well. In this vein, he pardoned Ibn Ammar and restored him his monthly salary of 500 gold dinars, and appointed Jaysh ibn al-Samsama to the governorship of Damascus. Nevertheless, his rise to power marked the definitive decline of Kutama power in the Fatimid state. At the same time, Barjawan chose fellow palace eunuchs to fill many of the highest positions in the capital and the provinces, and created a considerable network of patronage by promoting people from various origins to office. As his chief administrator, he selected a Christian, Fahd ibn Ibrahim. At the time of Barjawan's rise to power, the Levantine provinces were in a state of unrest. Tyre had risen in revolt under the sailor Allaqa, the Bedouin chieftain Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah tried to capture Ramlah, and there was an ongoing conflict with the Byzantine Empire over control of the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo in northern Syria. Led by Jaysh ibn al-Samsama, the Fatimids were successful in suppressing the rebellion at Tyre in June 998, although the inhabitants had called upon the Byzantine fleet for help, and subduing Mufarrij and his Bedouin. Jaysh then marched to the relief of Apamea, which was being besieged by the Byzantine doux of Antioch, Damian Dalassenos. In the ensuing battle, the Fatimids secured a major victory, and Dalassenos fell. Dalassenos' defeat forced Emperor Basil II to personally lead a campaign to Syria the following year, pillaging the region of Homs, Beirut, and Tripoli, although he failed to capture the latter. Both empires were not interested in pursuing warfare in the region further, however, and through the mediation of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, a truce was concluded in 1001 that confirmed the status quo and ushered a long period of peaceful, if not always untroubled, relations between the two major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. Bajarwan was also successful in quelling unrest in Barqa and restoring Fatimid control over Tripoli (in modern Libya). Barjawan installed eunuch governors over both cities, but the capture of Tripoli proved short-lived and had unintended consequences, as the Fatimid troops confronted the Sanhaja Berbers over its control. This strained relations with the Zirids, who had been entrusted with the Fatimids' old heartland of Ifriqiya and the Maghreb when the caliphs moved to Egypt, and contributed to the Zirids' gradual drift away from the Fatimid allegiance. Barjawan made the mistake of continuing to think of al-Hakim as his pupil, treating him in a high-handed manner and even daring to restrict his riding and the gifts he distributed. The troubled relationship was not helped when al-Hakim, as al-Nuwayri reports, learned that Barjawan referred to him as \\"the lizard\\". As a result, al-Hakim developed a fierce hatred of his over-powerful minister, encouraged by another court eunuch, Abu'l-Fadl Raydan al-Saqlabi, who pointed out the danger of Barjawan becoming a second Kafur, the slave who had become the de facto ruler of Ikhshidid Egypt after the death of the dynasty's founder, Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid. Thus on the night of 16/17 Rabi' II 390 AH (25 March 1000 in the Gregorian calendar), Raydan stabbed Barjawan in the belly with a knife at al-Hakim's orders. The murder provoked unease among the elites and the populace alike, who feared that the equilibrium established by Barjawan would be upset. Al-Hakim however was able to quiet their fears and consolidate his authority by appearing before the armed crowds above the gates of the palace, justifying his action as being well within his rights as caliph and denouncing Barjawan as plotting against him, while appealing to the people to assist him in his youth and inexperience. Al-Hakim now assumed the reins of government himself, although he took care to ensure continuity by keeping on Fahd ibn Ibrahim as head of the bureaucracy. Nevertheless, throughout his reign, the Caliph sought to limit the power of his viziers, and changed them frequently; he furthermore did not hesitate to launch purges of the high officialdom, to which several important officials fell victim. As Farhad Daftary writes, Barjawan was merely the first in a \\"long list of wazƒ´rs, wƒÅsi·π≠as, commanders and other dignitaries\\" who lost their lives at al-Hakim's orders. Barjawan was known as \\"a man of taste and a lover of the pleasures of this world\\" (B. Lewis)‚Äîon his death, according to Ibn Khallikan, his wardrobe \\"contained one thousand Dabiq trousers, one thousand silk tikkas [waistbands], and an immense quantity of clothes, furniture, musical instruments, books and curiosities\\". He was a patron of musicians and poets, who frequented his home. A street in Cairo was named after him and still bore it in the 13th century.

It is found in both dry and humid habitats, and up to an altitude of 2000m. Description Females are 5 mm to 7 mm in length, males 4 mm to 6 mm. The female has a dark brown abdomen with white spots along the flank and an obvious light brown cardiac mark, the carapace is dark brown with a white median band with two narrow white stripes on either side. The legs and palps are brown with darker spots and the legs have dark spines. The males are almost identical to the females but are darker and lack the darker spots on the legs but do have dark femora and coxae. P. monticola is similar to Pardosa agrestis and Pardosa palustris. left Distribution Widespread in western and central Europe largely west of 25¬∞ east. In Britain extends northwards to central Scotland. Its presence has been confirmed in all the countries of Europe east to Finland and Estonia but its presence is unconfirmed in Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus and is unrecorded in Greece. Biology Pardosa monticola is normally found in open short vegetation in grasslands, meadows, open heaths and dunes, especially where the land is not subject to any form of improvement. P. monticola can be numerous in areas of chalk grassland and on stabilised dunes. In some parts of Britain, e.g. Wiltshire, it is usually found exclusively in the short sward of chalk downland. Adults are active mainly from early to mid-summer, females later than males. A study on the Frisian island of Schiermonnikoog found that in sympatry with Pardosa nigriceps and Pardosa pullata P. monticola preferred the arid, less vegetated parts of the study area and was found more often in the ground layer than its cogeners.
