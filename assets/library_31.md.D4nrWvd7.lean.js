Goblins are non-human monsters that low-level player characters often face in combat. Influences Goblins in Dungeons & Dragons are influenced by the goblins in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. In turn, D&D;'s goblins influenced later portrayals in games and fiction, such as the tabletop wargame Warhammer Fantasy Battle. They have also been compared to German kobolds. Unlike the goblins in Tolkien's works, the goblins of D&D; are a separate race from orcs; instead, they are a part of the related species collectively referred to as goblinoids, which includes hobgoblins, bugbears, and others.

They vary in height from about 3 to 3 ¬Ω feet (91 ‚Äì 106 cm) and weigh 40 to 45 pounds (21 ‚Äì 24 kg). They walk upright even though their arms nearly reach their knees. Their eyes vary from red to yellow and are usually dull and glazed. Described as \\"hideously ugly\\", they have a broad nose that sits on a flat face with pointed ears and a wide mouth. Their mouth contains small, but sharp fangs. Their skin pigment ranges from a deep red through nearly any shade of orange to yellow. Members of the same tribe tend to have the same skin color. =Society= Goblins usually live in tribes which are ruled by the strongest goblin in the group. These tribes vary in size from gangs of 4‚Äì9 to tribes of up to 400. Most larger tribes have wolves or dire wolves as mounts, or ally themselves with worgs, which also carry them into battle. Goblin tribes usually settle near civilized areas to raid for food, livestock, tools, weapons, and supplies. It is common for the leaders of goblin clans to be non-goblin (either other goblinoids or a different species entirely); such leaders are exploiting the goblins as disposable soldiers to further their purpose. Maglubiyet, chief deity of goblins in most campaign settings In most campaign settings, Maglubiyet, the god of war and rulership, is the chief deity of goblins. Other gods worshipped by the goblins include Khurgorbaeyag, the god of slavery, oppression, and morale, and Bargrivyek, the god of co- operation and territory. Deities of other goblin races include Meriadar (deity of patience, tolerance, meditation, and arts and crafts) and Stalker (deity of hate, death, and cold), as well as the hobgoblin god Nomog-Geaya (deity of War and Authority), the bugbear gods Hruggek (deity of violence and combat), Grankhul (deity of hunting, senses, and surprise), and Skiggaret (deity of fear), as well as Kikanuti the goddess of the desert goblins, known as bhukas. Goblin Sub-races Sub-races of goblin in Dungeons & Dragons include the snow goblin, the aquatic goblin, and the jungle goblin, each adapted to a particular environment. =Nilbog= Nilbogs are, according to the game description, a type of naturally-born but magical goblins that are healed by receiving damage and are damaged by healing spells. Furthermore, they project a paradox area effect in whose radius every intended action is twisted so that the exact opposite is carried out (i.e.: instead of hitting a nilbog with a weapon, one might end up attacking a companion; or instead of plundering a treasure hoard, an adventuring party under the influence of \\"nilbogism\\" might actually end up adding their own wealth to it). The name of this sub-species is \\"goblin\\" spelled backward, a reference to this reversal of effects. Other publishers Goblins feature prominently in material for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game from Paizo Publishing, which is based on the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 rules. The goblins in Pathfinder, as detailed in Paizo's books Classic Monsters Revisited (2008)Baur, Wolfgang, Jason Bulmahn, Joshua J. Frost, James Jacobs, Nicolas Logue, Mike McArtor, James L. Sutter, Greg A. Vaughan, Jeremy Walker. Classic Monsters Revisited (Paizo, 2008) and Goblins of Golarion (2011),James Jacobs, Hal Maclean, Richard Pett. Pathfinder Player Companion: Goblins of Golarion (Paizo, 2011) have a distinct characterization from their Dungeons & Dragons counterparts; reviewers have described them as \\"walking bundles of chaos and crazy\\". Pathfinder's goblins are also central to Paizo's Free RPG Day modules We Be Goblins! (2011), We Be Goblins Too! (2013) and We Be Goblins Free! (2015), which feature goblins as player characters, as well as the licensed Dynamite Entertainment comic Pathfinder: Goblins! In other media Goblins are the protagonists in the Dungeons & Dragons- influenced webcomic Goblins. Goblins also feature prominently in another Dungeons & Dragons-influenced work, The Order of the Stick; a major antagonist, Redcloak, is a goblin cleric serving a deity known as the \\"Dark One\\". A \\"Goblin Lair\\" is used as one of the sample encounters in the book Dungeon Master 4th Edition for Dummies. Reception Screen Rant compiled a list of the game's \\"10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked\\" in 2018, calling this one of the weakest, saying \\"Goblins are purposely designed to be weak and ineffective in combat so that they can fulfill their role as the tutorial battle of Dungeons & Dragons.\\" References Dungeons & Dragons creatures from folklore and mythology Dungeons & Dragons humanoids Dungeons & Dragons monsters Fictional goblins ","title":"Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)"},{"id":"4288877","text":"Oblivion is a steel roller coaster located at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England. The prototype Dive Coaster model from Bolliger & Mabillard opened to the public on 14 March 1998 and was marketed as the \\"World's first vertical drop roller coaster\\". With a maximum speed of , it is the third fastest roller coaster in the UK, behind Stealth at Thorpe Park and the Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach.  History  Throughout 1997, the park's 'Fantasy World' area was closed and all its former rides removed, except the Black Hole. Details about Oblivion were not revealed until March 1998. The \\"SW4\\" codename stood for \\"Secret Weapon 4\\", after Nemesis' codename, \\"SW3\\". Oblivion's opening was accompanied by a large promotional campaign, including appearances on Blue Peter, news channels and cereal boxes. Prior to its opening, memorabilia including its own brand of deodorant was available to purchase. The total cost to construct the ride was estimated at ¬£12 million. The park area containing Oblivion was redesigned as 'X Sector'. The only surviving ride from the former area was the Black Hole roller coaster, which was externally redesigned to suit the new theme. Alton Towers moved two existing rides from other areas of the park to open with X-Sector, Energizer and Enterprise. Both rides were repainted to fit to the new theme. Oblivion's vertical drop is actually slightly less than 90 degrees, at 87.5 degrees. This is due to the trains lacking sprung wheel assemblies which would mean the transition from vertical to horizontal would be uncomfortable. For a brief period in April 2011, the ride was sponsored by Fanta. However, much of the Fanta branding was removed after only a few months \\"following numerous complaints about the obtrusive nature of the brand\\". On 8 May 2012, a reportedly suicidal 20-year-old man climbed over tall safety fencing and managed to access the underground ride area. He reportedly entered via the tunnel exit portal and walked underground, emerging on a ledge around the entrance portal. Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed. He was arrested for a public order offence and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.  Ride experience  The queue line spirals upwards around a mound and passes through abstract buildings at various levels. Through the buildings, an unnamed man stood in darkness (played by actor Renny Krupinski) (who is sometimes referred to as the Lord of Darkness) briefs riders from overhead television screens. In the heavily stylised videos, the sinister figure explains at length the supposed physical and psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although adapted from scientific fact, his monologues are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dry humour. The third queueline video features an alter-ego character (who appears glowing white) arguing with his counterpart as to whether Oblivion is truly safe for riders. The queue then splits and crosses caged bridges into the station building. Here riders are batched into rows and board the ride cars. Technical graphics are displayed on overhead screens, which change to play a final monologue upon dispatch. A picture of Oblivion's drop taken from the guest observation area. The cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight with a tiered seating arrangement. The roller coaster has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees. The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45-degree angle to build tension, then levels out and travels a turn towards the drop. The turn uses a horizontal chain mechanism not used on any other B&M; dive coaster. The car reaches the drop and pauses facing over the edge (held by a holding chain) for a maximum of five seconds, while a vocal sound effect is played over speakers whispering, \\"Don't look down\\". The car is then released and free-falls into the tunnel. Upon exiting the other side, a high-banked turn takes rides around into the brake run. In 2004, the \\"Don't look down\\" vocal was removed due to new sound restrictions on the park. In 2015, following a major crash on The Smiler, the third queueline video with the two characters debating the ride's safety was removed.

Integrated Engineering is a program created to meet the demand for engineers skilled in various disciplines, combining aspects from traditional engineering studies and liberal arts. The demand arises from the current state of industry, where both the products manufactured and the plants which make the products are progressing towards greater diversity and sophistication. Recent studies had shown concern in both Canada and in the United States that engineering graduates were not well- prepared for many of today's multi-disciplinary and project-based workplaces. Several committees have been formed to study this and have published some material. One Canadian study was done by the Canadian Academy of Engineering and two of its main conclusions were: * Engineering faculties should ensure that breadth of learning, beyond the technical aspects of the specialist engineering discipline, is a major thrust in engineering education. * The engineering curriculum should emphasize problem-solving, design, and the development of the learning skills of their students. Integrated Engineers acquire background in core disciplines such as: materials, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and systems involving chemical, electro-mechanical, and biological components. Academia and Accreditation =Institutions= Currently, the following academic institutions are known to offer Integrated Engineering programs: Canada *University of British Columbia *University of Western Ontario UK *University of Bath *University of Cardiff *University of Liverpool *University of Nottingham *Anglia Ruskin University *University Centre Peterborough United States *Lehigh University *Southern Utah University *Minnesota State University, Mankato Germany * Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Estonia *Tallinn University of Technology Korea *Chung-Ang University Trinidad and Tobago *University of Trinidad and Tobago =Canada= Integrated Engineering originated at the University of Western Ontario in Ontario, Canada and in 2000 the Applied Science Faculty of the University of British Columbia also began a degree program for Integrated Engineering. In Canada, the program has been fully accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board and engineers are able to obtain a Professional Engineer (P.Eng) Certificate. =United Kingdom= In 1988, the Engineering Council UK, identified the need for routes to qualification for Chartered (Professional) Engineers that: > meet the identified needs of industry, increase access to engineering > education by more students, provide a balanced curriculum combining the > subjects that engineers use most often and directed towards the needs of the > majority of engineers. This is the fundamental definition for Integrated Engineering. The qualities looked for by industry when recruiting graduates were identified as: > flexibility and broad education, ability to understand non engineering > functions, ability to solve problems, knowledge of the principles of > engineering and ability to apply them in practical situations, information > skills, experience of project work, especially cross linked projects, > ability to work as a member of a team, presentation and communication > skills. Engineering Council UK, 1988, An Integrated Engineering Degree Programme. Engineering Council UK, 1988, Admissions to Universities - Action to increase the supply of engineers.'' Following open competition for additional funding provided by the UK Department for Technology and Industry, and industrial supporters including British Petroleum, six universities were selected from thirty three applicants. Four \\"Pilot Programmes\\" were launched at Cardiff University, Nottingham Trent University, Portsmouth University and Sheffield Hallam University. In 1989, The Nottingham Trent University (UK) admitted students to first of the Engineering Council's new Integrated Engineering Degree Programme courses. The course was accredited, at the CEng and European Engineer level, by the Institutions of Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers and Manufacturing Engineers. Generic engineering programmes are common. Integrated Engineering is distinct through emphasizing the development of personal competencies, especially the ability of students to work within groups. It is design led, and integration of all the subjects of study is a defining characteristic, achieved partly through the medium of project based learning. Following the successful experience at The Nottingham Trent University, Integrated Engineering programmes were established in 1993, at selected universities in Bulgaria and Hungary, with the aid of European Union funding granted under the Tempus Programme. In University of Liverpool, the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and can lead to Chartered Engineer status. In Anglia Ruskin University, the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the Institution of Engineering and Technology, and can lead to Incorporated Engineer status. =United States= In the U.S. there are several Integrated engineering education programs. Southern Utah University requires its students to pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE) before they graduate; and received ABET accreditation in 2004 that extended retroactively through October 2003. The graduates are also able to obtain a Professional Engineer (P.E.) license. Minnesota State University, Mankato has developed a collaborative Integrated engineering program to provide engineering education at MNSCU Community Colleges in the Northern Higher Education District in former Iron Range communities. This partnership allows students to stay near home, while earning a bachelor of science in integrated engineering while focusing on local engineering needs of manufacturers and businesses. As part of the program students are also required to sit for the FE examination prior to graduation and are eligible to sit for the P.E. exam license as the program is also ABET accredited. =Germany= In Germany the [(Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW))] introduced a flexible M.Eng. program in 2015, to fit to the industrial demand for generally educated engineers for Integrated Industry, known as Industry 4.0 in Germany. The graduated school program \\"Integrated Engineering\\" is administered at the Center for Advances Studies in Heilbronn and requires at least two years professional experience as an engineer for admission. =Korea= In Korea the Department of Integrative Engineering at Chung-Ang University aims to develop human resources that will contribute to building a knowledge infrastructure by effectively responding to rapid educational and social changes. The department will focus on developing fundamental and application technologies by realizing future-oriented converging technologies and, through a global network, on strengthening convergence-related competitiveness at the university and national level. To accomplish the goals, based on imaginative education using an innovative system, the department will develop ‚Äúintegrative engineering‚Äù people who are equipped with initiative research abilities. =Trinidad and Tobago= The Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.c) and Master of Engineering (M.Eng) programs in Utilities Engineering was validated in December 2008 at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. These programs are geared towards the Electrical and Mechanical engineering disciplines that exist within the broad area of Integrated Engineering. Prior to the introduction of the programs most of the engineers in the utilities sector were specialized in one branch of engineering mainly Electrical or Mechanical. The sector required an engineer who was multi-skilled and versed in both disciplines. The Utilities Engineer therefore performs a wide range of maintenance and operational duties in the following industries: > Process Industry, Electric Utilities (generation, distribution and efficient > utilization), Transportation Industry, Processing and Manufacturing > Industry, Water and sanitation industry, Mining and Smelting Industry, > Renewable and Green Energy Industry.

The player controls a ghost who guides a floating bubble by blowing on it. Gameplay The objective is to guide a bubble throughout a number of halls in a haunted house. If the bubble hits any walls or obstacles, then it will pop and the player loses a life. Obstacles include lit candles, electricity and fans. These can be all controlled by the ghost, who can wander around the level freely and blow at things - such as the bubble to add speed, the candle to put out the flame, or switches to turn them on or off. The ghost is controlled using the mouse. A press on the left button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the left. A press on the right button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the right. A press on a keyboard key (Shift) makes the ghost blow. The game is made of 35 halls (levels). Each time the player makes the bubble exit a hall, he wins 1000 points + left bonus. Action on animation may add 5000 points to the player. The bonus is re-initialized at every new hall. A new bubble is added to the player account each time the bubble exits towards the top of the hall. Ports The original Bubble Ghost was created by Christophe Andr√©ani (design, programming) on an Atari ST computer. The game has been adapted for other computers throughout the world. Some years later, ERE Informatique was bought by Infogrames. Infogrames published a new version of Bubble Ghost with updated graphics, Bubble + (Bubble Plus).

Titles Kasper Doenhoff was a Polish noble (szlachcic) of the Denhoff coat-of-arms; he was born a member of the Denhoff family, a Polish noble family of Prussian origin (the German family name is D√∂nhoff). He became titularly 'Governor of Dorpat' (1627‚Äì34) (although already in 1625 the town had capitulated to Sweden and was never reobtained by the Poles); from 1633, Count of the Holy Roman Empire (along with Ernst and Gerhard D√∂nhoff); Governor of Sieradz (1634‚Äì45); Court Marshal of the Queen (from 1639); and starosta of Wielu≈Ñ, Lauenburg (Lƒôbork), Radomsko, Boles≈Çawiec, Sokal, Ma≈Çoszyce, Sobowidze and Klonowo. In the Holy Roman Empire, he was a noble (Reichsf√ºrst); count (from 1635); prince (from 1637); and court marshal. Life A member of the Westphalian, Prussian and Baltic- German von D√∂nhoff family that also included Ernst Magnus D√∂nhoff and Marion D√∂nhoff, Kasper became a military commander (rotmistrz of reiters), a favorite of King Sigismund III Vasa (after his conversion to Catholicism) and one of the most prominent members of the \\"court faction\\" that advocated strengthening the Polish monarch's power. As a courtier of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, Doenhoff was sent with a diplomatic mission to propose the marriage of Archduchess Cecilia Renata of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, to W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV. The mission was successful, and Kasper also received noble titles from the Holy Roman Emperor. Builder Kaspar Doenhoff was the first member of his family to enter the magnate ruling elite of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, thereby laying the foundations for his family's fortune. He was influential and wealthy, enabling him to fund several interesting construction projects, mostly in Sieradz Province. He ordered the rebuilding of a medieval castle at Boles≈Çawiec (of which he was starosta), on the Prosna River, into a new residence, complete with Italian garden. Around 1630 he sponsored a Renaissance-Baroque castle in Kruszyna ‚Äî the last residential complex in Poland planned around a Renaissance-style internal yard, but already with a Baroque-style grand front yard and garden. Kruszyna was Doenhoff's main residence; but it was inconveniently located far from the new Commonwealth capital, Warsaw. Hence in 1636 Doenhoff bought and rebuilt another estate, in Ujazd, where he replaced the old castle with a Baroque palace. Toward the end of his life, he ordered the construction of a family necropolis, centered around a domed chapel, in the Jasna G√≥ra sanctuary at Czƒôstochowa. It was finished by his descendants. Despite his ownership of several castles, Doenhoff often resided in a wooden manor (dworek szlachecki) near the royal residence at Warsaw. Family Doenhoff was the son of Gerhard D√∂nhoff :pl:Gerard Denhoff (ojciec) (?-1598) and Margaretha von Zweiffeln.Genealogisches Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften, Teil 2, 1: Estland, G√∂rlitz, 1930, p. 41 He was the brother of Ernst Magnus D√∂nhoff (Governor of Parnawa), Hermann D√∂nhoff and Gerhard D√∂nhoff :pl:Gerard Denhoff (syn) (1590-1648, Governor of Pomorze). In 1620 he married Anna Aleksandra Koniecpolska. They had four children: Aleksander Doenhoff, Stanislaw Doenhoff (?‚Äì1653), Zygmunt Doenhoff, and Anna Doenhoff (who married Bogus≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski).

However, students at that time, were required to pay in order to attend the school and after completing their 10th grade, had to follow their studies and adapt themselves to a completely Anglophone school. In 1959, √âcole secondaire Sacr√©-Coeur was founded, organized solely by these nuns and soon after, Eastdale Secondary School began offering French courses to its students. In 1964 √âcole secondaire Sacr√©-Coeur was officially built on Tanguay Street leading to its being bought and adopted by the Conseil Scolaire du Niagara-Sud in 1968 ‚Äì √âcole secondaire Conf√©d√©ration was officially founded. At this point, the school housed more than 500 students and 37 professors serving Welland, Niagara Falls, Port Colborne and St. Catharines. Respective of its heritage, the school adopted a new motto; \\"Double h√©ritage, double effort\\". In 1971 √âcole secondaire Conf√©d√©ration's statistics grew exponentially, now serving nearly 900 students with 50 professors, leading to the construction of the south wing where a variety of workshops and classes are added. Finally, in 1999 Conf√©d√©ration accommodated grade 7 and 8 students residing in the area ‚Äì this program proved very successful. Today, Conf√©d√©ration remains a unique French public secondary school offering a reputation and ambiance based on morals, culture, academics and athletics. The school prides itself on offering \\"une education sans comparaison\\" or \\"unparalleled education\\". Academics The school offers 129 different courses from grades 7 to 12. In addition to academic courses, the school boasts a variety of specialized classes such as Business and Marketing, Hospitality and Tourism, as well as AutoCad. √âcole secondaire Conf√©d√©ration also offers two Specialist High Skills Majors in Hospitality/Tourism and Construction. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, √âcole secondaire Confederation qualified itself for the University of Ottawa Place √† la Jeunesse provincial Marketing and Entrepreneurship competition.

It is distinguished from the so-called static logic by exploiting temporary storage of information in stray and gate capacitances. It was popular in the 1970s and has seen a recent resurgence in the design of high speed digital electronics, particularly computer CPUs. Dynamic logic circuits are usually faster than static counterparts, and require less surface area, but are more difficult to design. Dynamic logic has a higher toggle rate than static logic but the capacitive loads being toggled are smaller so the overall power consumption of dynamic logic may be higher or lower depending on various tradeoffs. When referring to a particular logic family, the dynamic adjective usually suffices to distinguish the design methodology, e.g. dynamic CMOS or dynamic SOI design. Dynamic logic is distinguished from so-called static logic in that dynamics logic uses a clock signal in its implementation of combinational logic circuits. The usual use of a clock signal is to synchronize transitions in sequential logic circuits. For most implementations of combinational logic, a clock signal is not even needed. The static/dynamic terminology used to refer to combinatorial circuits should not be confused with how the same adjectives are used to distinguish memory devices, e.g. static RAM from dynamic RAM.  Terminology  In the context of logic design, the term dynamic logic is more commonly used as compared to clocked logic, as it makes clear the distinction between this type of design and static logic. To additionally confuse the matter, clocked logic is sometimes used as a synonym for sequential logic. This usage is nonstandard and should be avoided.  Static versus dynamic logic  The largest difference between static and dynamic logic is that in dynamic logic, a clock signal is used to evaluate combinational logic. However, to truly comprehend the importance of this distinction, the reader will need some background on static logic. In most types of logic design, termed static logic, there is at all times some mechanism to drive the output either high or low. In many of the popular logic styles, such as TTL and traditional CMOS, this principle can be rephrased as a statement that there is always a low-impedance DC path between the output and either the supply voltage or the ground. As a sidenote, there is of course an exception in this definition in the case of high impedance outputs, such as a tri-state buffer; however, even in these cases, the circuit is intended to be used within a larger system where some mechanism will drive the output, and they do not qualify as distinct from static logic. In contrast, in dynamic logic, there is not always a mechanism driving the output high or low. In the most common version of this concept, the output is driven high or low during distinct parts of the clock cycle. During the time intervals when the output is not being actively driven, stray capacitance causes it to maintain a level within some tolerance range of the driven level. Dynamic logic requires a minimum clock rate fast enough that the output state of each dynamic gate is used or refreshed before the charge in the output capacitance leaks out enough to cause the digital state of the output to change, during the part of the clock cycle that the output is not being actively driven. Static logic has no minimum clock rate‚Äîthe clock can be paused indefinitely. While it may seem that doing nothing for long periods of time is not particularly useful, it leads to three advantages: * being able to pause a system at any time makes debugging and testing much easier, enabling techniques such as single stepping. * being able to run a system at extremely low clock rates allows low-power electronics to run longer on a given battery. * a fully-static system can instantly resume exactly where it left off; a person doesn't have to wait for the system to boot up or resume. Richard Murray. \\"PocketBook II hardware\\". Being able to pause a system at any time for any duration can also be used to synchronize the CPU to an asynchronous event. (While there are other mechanisms to do this, such as interrupts, polling loops, processor idling input pins [like RDY on the 6502], or processor bus cycle extension mechanisms such as WAIT inputs, using hardware to gate the clock to a static-core CPU is simpler, is more temporally precise, uses no program code memory, and uses almost no power in the CPU while it is waiting. In a basic design, to start waiting, the CPU would write to a register to set a binary latch bit which would be ANDed or ORed with the processor clock, stopping the processor. A signal from a peripheral device would reset this latch, resuming CPU operation. [The hardware logic must gate the latch control inputs as necessary to ensure that a latch output transition does not cause the clock signal level to instantaneously change and cause a clock pulse, either high or low, that is shorter than normal.]) In particular, although many popular CPUs use dynamic logic, only static cores--CPUs designed with fully static technology--are usable in space satellites owing to their higher radiation hardness.AMSAT-DL: \\"No RISC, No Fun!\\" by Peter G√ºlzow Dynamic logic, when properly designed, can be over twice as fast as static logic. It uses only the faster N transistors, which improve transistor sizing optimizations. Static logic is slower because it has twice the capacitive loading, higher thresholds, and uses slow P transistors for logic. Dynamic logic can be harder to work with, but it may be the only choice when increased processing speed is needed. Most electronics running at over 2 GHz these days require the use of dynamic logic, although some manufacturers such as Intel have designed chips using completely static logic to reduce power consumption.http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3448&p;=9 Note that reducing power use not only extends the running time with limited power sources such as batteries or solar arrays (as in spacecraft), but it also reduces the thermal design requirements, reducing the size of needed heatsinks, fans, etc., which in turn reduces system weight and cost. In general, dynamic logic greatly increases the number of transistors that are switching at any given time, which increases power consumption over static CMOS. There are several powersaving techniques that can be implemented in a dynamic logic based system. In addition, each rail can convey an arbitrary number of bits, and there are no power-wasting glitches. Power-saving clock gating and asynchronous techniques are much more natural in dynamic logic.  Static logic example  As an example, consider the static logic implementation of a CMOS NAND gate: 150px This circuit implements the logic function :Out = overline{AB} If A and B are both high, the output will be pulled low. Whereas if either A or B are low, the output will be pulled high. At all times, the output is pulled either low or high.  Dynamic logic example  Consider now a dynamic logic implementation of the same logic function: 200px The dynamic logic circuit requires two phases. The first phase, when Clock is low, is called the setup phase or the precharge phase and the second phase, when Clock is high, is called the evaluation phase. In the setup phase, the output is driven high unconditionally (no matter the values of the inputs A and B). The capacitor, which represents the load capacitance of this gate, becomes charged. Because the transistor at the bottom is turned off, it is impossible for the output to be driven low during this phase. During the evaluation phase, Clock is high. If A and B are also high, the output will be pulled low. Otherwise, the output stays high (due to the load capacitance). Dynamic logic has a few potential problems that static logic does not. For example, if the clock speed is too slow, the output will decay too quickly to be of use. Also, the output is only valid for part of each clock cycle, so the device connected to it must sample it synchronously during the time that it is valid. Also, when both A and B are high, so that the output is low, the circuit will pump one capacitor-load of charge from Vdd to ground for each clock cycle, by first charging and then discharging the capacitor in each clock cycle. This makes the circuit (with its output connected to a high impedance) less efficient than the static version (which theoretically should not allow any current to flow except through the output), and when the A and B inputs are constant and both high, the dynamic NAND gate uses power in proportion to the clock rate, as long as it functions correctly. The power dissipation can be minimized by keeping the load capacitance low, but this in turn reduces the maximum cycle time, requiring a higher minimum clock frequency; the higher frequency then increases power consumption by the relation just mentioned. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the idle power consumption (when both inputs are high) below a certain limit which derives from an equilibrium between clock speed and load capacitance. A popular implementation is domino logic.

In 2005, The Wire compared the band's importance to that of AMM and SME, and noted their lack of musical training.Keenan, D. \\"The Long Road Home\\" in The Wire issue 259 (September 2005), p.38 The line-up of the group has never been fixed. New members are always invited to join the band. History Some of the early A Band members had previously recorded material in the 1980s as Well Crucial, a group scattered across the UK and, in some cases, collaborating by post.The Wire 300: David Keenan locates the roots of the UK's current DIY underground in the anarchic activities of The A Band (page 1) A core of members was based in Kettering, Northamptonshire around Neil Campbell, Stewart Keith and Stream Angel, with other contributions by Richard Youngs. However, by 1990 these members had moved to Nottingham and the focus shifted there, with Well Crucial effectively ceasing to be. The A Band itself was founded at the behest of saxophonist Vince Earimal, who required a backing band, and the unit quickly became an ever-changing, freeform improvisation unit, able to play without Earimal, who, despite eventually never performing with the band, is credited with their formation. Youngs joined upon moving to Nottingham and he recalled in The Wire that Jim Plaistow and Campbell were the only constantly present members. They could number up to 18 on any given occasion. The original collective came to a halt around 1994. The group never performed under the name A Band or any obvious permutation thereof (they are occasionally listed as The A-Band). Instead, the group used a different name for each performance, all of which began with the letter \\"a\\". These included Anusol, Arachnid, Arse-over-tit, Awkward, Anaglypta, Artex, AC/DC, Ack Ack, Anglegrinder and Advent,The Wire 300: David Keenan locates the roots of the UK's current DIY underground in the anarchic activities of The A Band (page 2) the latter in commemoration of the then-recently released Richard Youngs LP - in fact, it was at this show that Youngs' spoken word record 171 Used Train Tickets (released 2003) was recorded. However, the releases were almost always credited to \\"A Band\\" and these included several cassette releases, an LP on Siltbreeze and a 7\\" single. Some archive recordings later saw daylight; a CD of recordings from 1991 was issued in 1997 and live activity, also from 1991, was given a vinyl release in 2003, the material being edited by Youngs with artwork from Campbell and Plaistow. Much of the interest in the band that followed the initial releases came more from the United States than Great Britain, but this was insufficient to keep the band going, and the various members pursued music in smaller groups, or solo. =Reformation= In April 2007 the A Band remorphed,The Wire 300: David Keenan locates the roots of the UK's current DIY underground in the anarchic activities of The A Band (page 3) and performed at the 4th Festival Of Improvised Music at the Pyramid in Warrington, which took place on 16 June.

The next performance, as \\"American Evil\\" (an anagram of \\"Vince Earimal\\"), was on 19 August in Shoreditch, London. On this occasion Stewart Keith and Gardyloo SPeW were joined by new A Banders John Aziz, Martin Bizarro, Zoe Darling, Philip Julian, Simon Murphy, Phil Todd (of Ashtray Navigations) and Karl Waugh. Since this they have performed over 150 times across the UK, and recruited more than 80 new members, including Richard Forrester, Richard Spencer, Richard Attridge, and two Richard Thomases. In April 2011, Gardyloo SPeW convened an A Band performance for the first time in Sydney, Australia. The lineup consisted of Gardyloo SPeW on sax, vocals and theremin with a cast of local musicians from the city's experimental hub The Bird's Robe Collective.

The film was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot Leocadia (\\"Leo\\") Mac√≠as (Marisa Paredes) writes popular romance novels under a pen name, Amanda Gris. Unlike her romantic (\\"pink\\") novels, her love life is troubled. She has a difficult relationship with her husband Paco (Imanol Arias), a military officer stationed in Brussels and later in Bosnia, who is physically and emotionally distant. The film starts with Leo writing about the feeling of having lost her lover, a feeling that she compares to the pain of a tight pair of boots that she cannot take off. Almodovar took for this first part of the film strong plot elements from Dorothy Parker's short story, The Lovely Leave Leo begins to change the direction of her writing, wanting to focus more on darker themes such as pain and loss, and can no longer write her romantic Amanda Gris novels. However, her publishers demand sentimental happy endings, at least until her contract is up. She begins to re-evaluate her life through her relationship with her publishers, her husband, her best friend Betty (Carme El√≠as), her \\"crab-faced\\" sister Rosa (Rossy de Palma) and her bickering elderly mother (Chus Lampreave). Only her maid (played by flamenco dancer Manuela Vargas) appears steadfast. She also meets √Ångel (Juan Echanove), a prominent newspaper editor who quickly falls for Leo and her writing. After signing a contract with the newspaper, El Pa√≠s, Leo tells √Ångel that she cannot write romances anymore, and that she has written a dark (\\"black\\") novel about a young mother whose daughter kills her husband because he tried to rape her. After that, the corpse of the dead man is hidden in a refrigerator. Although Leo throws this story out, she later learns that someone is turning it into a movie. (In fact, Almod√≥var himself created a movie based on this same plot, Volver, released eleven years later in 2006.) After the inevitable disintegration of her marriage and then learning that her best friend was her husband's lover, Leo takes and survives an overdose, then goes with her mother to the village of Almagro to rest and recover. There she receives a call from her publishers, who are apparently delighted by the two manuscripts they have received from her ‚Äî romances Leo never wrote or submitted. She returns to Madrid and learns that √Ångel is her ghostwriter. More surprises unfold when she attends a brilliant dance performance featuring her maid, Manuela Vargas, and Joaqu√≠n Cort√©s, who plays the maid's son, Antonio. Antonio soon confesses that he is the one who took her manuscript now being made into a movie. A final surprise for Leo: after a false start, she finds love with the smitten √Ångel, and the film ends with the tenuous promise of a \\"new year\\".

In a coup of life imitating art, a decade later it formed the basis of Almod√≥var's own 2006 film Volver. Another sub-plot scene from The Flower of My Secret, the student doctors being taught how to persuade a grieving mother to allow her son's organs to be used in transplant, was used as the starting point of Almod√≥var's 1999 film All About My Mother. Leo tells √Ångel that she earned money reading and writing letters for her illiterate neighbors as a child, a detail from Almod√≥var's own life that appears in Pain and Glory (the title of which bears a striking resemblance to Leo's El Pa√≠s column, titled \\"Dolor y Vida.\\")https://www.2filmcritics.com/post/pain-and-glory Awards * 1996 -- 7 Goya Award nominations * Marisa Paredes won Best Actress at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the ACE Awards and the Sant Jordi Awards See also * List of submissions to the 68th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Spanish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film References External links  * Interview with Pedro Almod√≥var about The Flower of My Secret * LA Times article on The Flower of My secret 1995 films Films directed by Pedro Almod√≥var Films set in Madrid Films shot in Madrid Spanish drama films Spanish films French-language films Spanish-language films 1995 drama films Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha in fiction Films scored by Alberto Iglesias Films produced by Agust√≠n Almod√≥var ","title":"The Flower of My Secret"},{"id":"4289068","text":"Poynton railway station serves the town of Poynton in Cheshire, England.

History Poynton station was built to replace an earlier station called Poynton (Midway) that opened in a different location on 24 November 1845 and remained open until this new station was fully operational on 1 August 1887. The station has, in the past, been subjected to regular vandalism. The station's toilets and bike shed are no longer open to the public. The station is painted in First North Western colours, the colours of a previous train operator which were very similar to and were adopted by another previous train operator Northern Rail. The station's footbridge, both roofs and Manchester- bound platform waiting room were refurbished in spring 2011. At the same time, new lighting and CCTV were installed. Two card-only ticket machines have been installed more recently, which issue promise to pay vouchers for passengers wishing to pay by cash.

Some early morning/late night services originate/terminate at Macclesfield. Additional services operate at peak commuter times and after 10pm. There are six services in each direction on Sundays. From May 2018, Monday to Saturday train services were set to be increased to operate every half-hour in each direction to Manchester Piccadilly and Macclesfield, with 1 northbound service per hour continuing to Blackpool North and one southbound service continuing to Stoke-on-Trent. Sunday services had been scheduled to operate hourly to Blackpool North and Stoke-on-Trent. Due to delays in the Bolton corridor electrification and timetabling complications, these changes did not take effect. Minor improvements were made in December 2018, with additional minor enhancements and an hourly Sunday service proposed for December 2019, subject to union negotiations with ASLEF, to bring Sundays inside the working week.

It is also known by its lyrical name in ).  Impresa di Fiume  d'Annunzio on a 1920 Fiume postage stamp. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918), Italy made a pact with the Allies, the Treaty of London (1915), in which it was promised all of the Austrian Littoral, but not the city of Fiume. After the war, at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, this delineation of territory was confirmed, with Fiume (or Rijeka) remaining outside of Italian borders and amalgamated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). As a nationalist, Gabriele d'Annunzio was angered by what he considered to be the surrender of an Italian city. On 12 September 1919, he led a force that was about 2,600-strong and drawn mostly from former or serving members of the Granatieri di Sardegna brigade of the Royal Italian Army, as well as Italian nationalists and irredentists. Many members of Annunzio's force were reputedly veterans of the Battles of the Isonzo. They were successful in seizing control of the city, and forced the withdrawal of the Allied (US, British and French) occupying forces. The march from Ronchi dei Legionari to Fiume, by Annunzio's so-called \\"legionaries\\", became known as the Impresa di Fiume (\\"Fiume endeavor\\", or \\"Fiume enterprise\\"). Gabriele d'Annunzio (centre; with the stick) and some \\"legionaries\\" ‚Äì in this case former members of the Arditi (shock troops) corps of the Italian Army, at Fiume in 1919. To the right of d'Annunzio, facing him, is Lieutenant Arturo Avolio (commander of a famed World War I Arditi platoon). On the same day, d'Annunzio announced that he had annexed the territory to the Kingdom of Italy. He was enthusiastically welcomed by the ethnic Italian portion of the population of Fiume.Images of Fiume welcoming d'Annunzio This was opposed by the Italian government, which attempted to pressure d'Annunzio to withdraw. The government initiated a blockade of Fiume and demanded that the plotters surrender. During his time in Fiume in September 1919, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti praised the leaders of the impresa as \\"advance guard deserters\\" (disertori in avanti).  Modus vivendi  On December 8, the Italian government proposed a modus vivendi recognizing Fiume's desire for annexation and promising they would \\"only consider acceptable a solution consonant with that which Fiume declared to desire.\\" On December 11 and 12, d'Annunzio met with General Pietro Badoglio to try and obtain more concessions. Badoglio refused, and d'Annunzio said he would submit the modus vivendi to the Italian National Council of Fiume. The National Council accepted the proposal on December 15. After the National Council's decision, d'Annunzio addressed a crowd of five thousand people and incited them to reject the modus vivendi, promising to put the issue to a plebiscite. The plebiscite was held on December 18, and despite violence and irregularities the results were overwhelmingly in favour of the modus vivendi. D'Annunzio nullified the results, blaming the violence at the polls, and announced he would make the final decision himself. He ultimately rejected the modus vivendi. According to Michael Ledeen, d'Annunzio made this decision because he distrusted the Italian government and doubted their ability to deliver on their promises.  Regency  Ensign of Carnaro On 8 September 1920, d'Annunzio proclaimed the city to be under the Italian Regency of Carnaro with a constitution foreshadowing some of the later Italian Fascist system, with himself as dictator, with the title of Comandante. The name Carnaro was taken from the Golfo del Carnaro (Kvarner Gulf), where the city is located. It was temporarily expanded by d'Annunzio in order to include the island of Veglia.  Constitution  The Charter of Carnaro (Carta del Carnaro in Italian) was a constitution that combined anarchist, proto-fascist, and democratic republican ideas. D'Annunzio is often seen as a precursor of the ideals and techniques of Italian fascism. His own explicit political ideals emerged in Fiume when he coauthored the charter with syndicalist Alceste De Ambris. De Ambris provided the legal and political framework, to which d'Annunzio added his skills as a poet. The charter designates music a \\"religious and social institution.\\" = Corporations = The constitution established a corporatist state, with nine corporations to represent the different sectors of the economy, where membership was mandatory, plus a symbolic tenth corporation devised by d'Annunzio, to represent the \\"superior individuals\\" (e.g. poets, \\"heroes\\" and \\"supermen\\"). The other nine were as follows: *Industrial and Agricultural Workers *Seafarers *Employers *Industrial and Agricultural Technicians *Private Bureaucrats and Administrators *Teachers and Students *Lawyers and Doctors *Civil Servants *Co-operative Workers = Executive = The executive power would be vested in seven ministers (rettori): *Foreign Affairs *Treasury *Education *Police and Justice *Defense *Public Economy *Labor = Legislature = The legislative power was vested in a bicameral legislature. Joint sessions of both councils (Arengo del Carnaro) would be responsible for treaties with foreign powers, amendments to the constitution, and appointment of a dictator in times of emergency. *Council of the Best (Consiglio degli Ottimi): Elected by universal suffrage for a 3-year term, with 1 councilor per 1000 population, this council was responsible for legislation concerning civil and criminal justice, police, armed forces, education, intellectual life and relations between the central government and communes. *Council of Corporations (Consiglio dei Provvisori): Consisting of 60 members chosen by nine corporations for a 2-year term, this council was responsible for laws regulating business and commerce, labor relations, public services, transportation and merchant shipping, tariffs and trade, public works, medical and legal professions. = Judiciary = Judicial power was vested in the courts: *Supreme Court (Corte della Ragione, literally \\"Court of Reason\\") *Communal Courts (Buoni Uomini, literally \\"Good Men\\") *Labour Court (Giudici del Lavoro, \\"Labour-law Judges\\") *Civil Court (Giudici Togati, \\"Robe-wearing Judges\\") *Criminal Court (Giudici del Maleficio, where \\"Maleficio\\" is a literary form for \\"wrongdoing\\", but it can also mean \\"curse\\") = Impact = Benito Mussolini was influenced by the Fascist portions of the constitution, and by d'Annunzio's style of leadership as a whole. D'Annunzio has been described as the John the Baptist of Italian Fascism, as virtually the entire ritual of Fascism was invented by D'Annunzio during his occupation of Fiume and his leadership of the Italian Regency of Carnaro. These included the balcony address, the Roman salute, the cries of \\"Eia, eia, eia! Alala!\\" taken from the Achilles' cry in the Iliad, the dramatic and rhetorical dialogue with the crowd, and the use of religious symbols in new secular settings. It also included his method of government in Fiume: the economics of the corporate state; stage tricks; large emotive nationalistic public rituals; and blackshirted followers, the Arditi, with their disciplined, bestial responses and strongarm repression of dissent.The United States and Italy, H. Stuart Hughes, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1953, pp. 76 and 81‚Äì82. He was even said to have originated the practice of forcibly dosing opponents with large amounts of castor oil, a very effective laxative, to humiliate, disable or kill them, a practice which became a common tool of Mussolini's blackshirts.Cecil Adams, Did Mussolini use castor oil as an instrument of torture?, The Straight Dope, 22 April 1994. Accessed 6 November 2006.Richard Doody, , The World at War.Cali Ruchala, , Degenerate magazine, Diacritica (2002).  Demise  The approval of the Treaty of Rapallo on 12 November 1920 turned Fiume into an independent state, the Free State of Fiume. D'Annunzio ignored the Treaty of Rapallo and declared war on Italy itself. On 24 December 1920 the Italian army and a bombardment by the Royal Italian Navy forced the Fiuman legionnaires to evacuate and surrender the city. The Free State of Fiume would officially last until 1924, when Fiume was formally annexed to the Kingdom of Italy under the terms of the Treaty of Rome. The administrative division was called the Province of Carnaro.

Johnson also co-wrote some songs with band members Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, today a multi-Grammy award winning songwriting and producing team. Johnson completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Minnesota, Morris in 1978, and continued to perform with Flyte Tyme for a brief time. Shortly after she left Flyte Tyme, the band evolved into The Time, a side project of Prince. =Lipps Inc.= Johnson was the lead singer of the popular Minneapolis-based band Lipps Inc., best known for its 1980 song \\"Funkytown\\". The song hit No. 1 in 28 countries, sold more than 35 million copies worldwide, and earned a place in the \\"One-Hit Wonders\\" section of the Rock & Roll Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. Other singles include \\"Designer Music\\" and \\"Rock It\\", but the group never matched the success of \\"Funkytown\\", which continues to influence popular culture. The group received several awards, among them three Billboard Music Awards and \\"Soul Record of the Year\\" by the AMOA association. Johnson left the band after the group's third album Designer Music was released. =Late 1980s to present= Johnson has continued her musical career and remains active as a member of the three- time Grammy Award-winning gospel group Sounds of Blackness, as a musician on albums by Maceo Parker and Prince, on labels such as Motown, and on projects of Grammy-winning producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. She also has worked as a jingle singer on commercials for products from 3M, Volkswagen, Nissan, Target, FedEx, Ford and McDonald's. She has also sung for U.S. presidents. Johnson was the host of the first episode of the FunkyTown TV series, produced by the Minneapolis-based production company, Megabien Entertainment. =Solo career= In addition to working with others, Johnson continues her career as a solo artist. Her debut album, All That I Am, was released on December 15, 2013 on the Megabien Music label.

St. Paul's is linked with the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier in Dyersville, Iowa - with whom it shares a pastor. History Initially, the settlers of Worthington were English, but they were soon followed by German and Irish families. At first most of the residents of Worthington traveled to St. Francis Church in Dyersville, while some went to Saint Martin's Church in Cascade, Iowa because services there were conducted in Latin (as it was everywhere before Second Vatican Council) with homilies in English. =Founding of Worthington Parish= In 1862 Rev.

By 1868 the population of Worthington had grown large enough that Kortenkamp had decided the time had come for a new parish to be established in Worthington. Construction of a brick building was soon begun and the new parish was dedicated to Saint Paul. The cornerstone of this first building had the inscription, \\"Romisch Catholische, St. Paulus Kirche, Gebaut 1 Nov. 1868.\\" The new church took about four years to complete. At first the new parish did not have a resident pastor. Fr. Kortenkamp would come to Worthington once a month to say Mass. At times he would bring some members of the Dyersville Choir with him so that a High Mass could be held in Worthington. =1875-1952= In 1875 St. Paul's received its first resident pastor, John S. Baumann. He began building a new parish school, and also established societies for parishioners. By 1878 the population had grown to the extent that it was necessary to build an extension onto the church. He also built a new rectory, which would serve the pastors until the current rectory was built in 1921. Fr. Baumann left when he was appointed a professor at Columbia College (known today as Loras College). Baumann was followed by George W. Heer. The present church structure began construction in 1883, during Heer's tenure, and dedicated December 3, 1889. This new 54x110-foot building had a spire that stretched into the air. A statue of St. Paul was placed over the entryway; this statue was a gift from Fr. Baumann. The cost of erecting this building was about $12,000, with the inside unfinished. Heer also had a new 60x60-foot school with nine classrooms built near the church. Heer was followed by James Zigrang in December 1889. During Zigrang's tenure as priest, the interior of the church was frescoed and new Stations of the Cross were placed in the church. After Zigrang returned from the Holy Land in 1907, he provided the church with a new pipe organ, which continues to serve this church today. He would serve until his death in 1913, having given the last 24 years of his life to St. Paul's parish. Fr. Zigrang was buried in the parish cemetery. J.H. Schilmoeller was assigned as pastor of St. Paul's in August 1913. He would be another long-term priest of the parish, who served 39 years at St. Paul's. During his tenure the church was enlarged. He also directed the construction of a Sisters' Home in 1914. This particular convent was the first one in Iowa in which every nun had her own private room. This 54x44-foot building had 29 rooms. =Postwar years= In 1956, because of its great size and beauty, Pope Pius XII proclaimed St. Francis Xavier Church a Basilica (among only nine other Basilicas in the USA at that time, and still the only Basilica in a rural area). School There was previously a parish school, St. Paul's School. It started circa 1874. In 2015 it had 26 students, and closed that year. By 2016 the Worthington city council was considering whether to buy the building so it could be converted into a factory.

It is a mature karstic area on the Upper Floridan Aquifer. It is one of the most extensive underwater cave systems in the world and connects to Wakulla Springs. This hydrological system is extremely vulnerable to pollution because of the very high permeability of the carbonate aquifer. Extensive mapping and exploration of these caves has been done by the Woodville Karst Plain Project to understand the complex dynamics of the area and to understand the proper ecological approach to keeping this system clean. The Leon Sinks are full of life, including the freshwater eel and rare crustaceans, including the Woodville Karst Plain crayfish and the swimming Florida cave isopod Remasellus parvus, that only exist in the Woodville Karst Plain.  Wakulla-Leon Sinks cave system  Wakulla cave consists of a dendritic network of conduits of which have been surveyed and mapped. The conduits are characterized as long tubes with diameter and depth being consistent ( depth); however, joining tubes can be divided by larger chambers of varying geometries. The largest conduit trends south from the spring/cave entrance for over . Four secondary conduits, including Leon Sinks, intersect the main conduit. Most of these secondary conduits have been fully explored. On Dec 15, 2007, the connection between the Wakulla cave system and Leon Sinks cave system was made by members of the Woodville Karst Plain Project to create the Wakulla-Leon Sinks Cave System.

Background Hervey was the son of Lord Augustus Henry Charles Hervey (1837‚Äì1875), the younger brother of the 3rd Marquess of Bristol. He was born in Dresden, Germany, where his father was stationed. He was educated at Tonbridge School and Eastman's Royal Naval Academy before joining HMS Britannia as a cadet in January 1877. He was a midshipman by the age of 15. Naval and political career In August 1901 he was appointed to command the cruiser , which was commissioned to serve in the Channel Squadron the following September. He was promoted to captain on 31 December 1901 and served in this rank for a decade, commanding the battleship Renown for two months in late 1907. He was placed on the Retired List at the rank of rear admiral in May, 1911.DreadnoughtProject.org page on the man. Hervey was elected at the general election in January 1906 as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury St Edmunds, but automatically resigned in August the following year when he succeeded his uncle in the peerages.

In 1907 the family moved from the lodge into Ickworth House, the family seat, which like most pre-War English country houses, maintained a large retinue. Feudal traditions still held sway, and the estate's tenants did not dare complain of poor housing, according to a memoir by the village schoolmistress.

Known as \\"Tonker\\" Taylor for his forthright approach to batting and his evident enjoyment of the game, Taylor was a high-class wicketkeeper who was thought of in his early playing days as a potential successor to Godfrey Evans as England's keeper. He was named as Young Cricketer of the Year in 1956 by the Cricket Writers' Club, his first full season, though he had made his first-class debut seven years earlier. He toured South Africa with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side in 1956-57 as understudy to Evans, but did not feature in any of the Test matches as Evans had one of his most brilliant Test series. In the event, his left-handed batting did not develop as much as had been hoped, and the Test call never came. But Taylor still had a long and distinguished career in county cricket. From 1961 to 1972, he played in 301 consecutive County Championship matches for Essex, and he captained the county from 1967 to 1973, when he retired. Under his captaincy, Essex assembled the nucleus of the young team that was to bring the county its first-ever trophies in the years after Taylor retired. In all cricket, Taylor made 1,294 dismissals, which puts him seventh on the all- time list of wicketkeepers. He also made more than 19,000 runs in a total of 572 first-class matches. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1972. He was a Test selector for England from 1973. He took part in the first cricket tour of Bangladesh when MCC visited in 1976-77. He also played football with Bexleyheath and Welling and Deal Town in the Kent League and Southern League. He died in 2017.

In inorganic chemistry, the trispyrazolylborate ligand, abbreviated Tp‚àí, is an anionic tridentate and tripodal ligand. Trispyrazolylborate refers specifically to the anion [HB(C3N2H3)3]‚àí, but the term trispyrazolylborate refers to derivatives substituted at on the pyrazolyl rings. This family of compounds are sometimes called scorpionate ligands.Trofimenko, S., \\"Scorpionates: genesis, milestones, prognosis\\", Polyhedron, 2004, 23, 197-203. Trofimenko, S., \\"Recent advances in poly(pyrazolyl)borate (scorpionate) chemistry\\", Chem. Rev., 1993, 93, 943-80. Tp ligands Two of several resonance structures for trispyrazolylborate. As suggested by the resonance structures, the nitrogen centers that are not bonded to boron are basic. These centers bind to three adjacent sites of a metal such that the simple adducts have C3v symmetry. The facial bonding mode is reminiscent of cyclopentadienyl ligands, although the ligand field stabilization energy of Tp‚àí is weaker as indicated by the fact that Fe(Tp)2 is a spin-crossover complex whereas ferrocene is low-spin. The Tp ligands are usually prepared from the reaction of pyrazole with potassium borohydride:S. Trofimenko ‚ÄùPoly(1-Pyrazolyl)Borates, Their Transition-Metal Complexes, and Pyrazaboles‚Äù Inorganic Syntheses, 1970, Volume 12, p 99-109. :KBH4 + 3 C3H3N2H ‚Üí K[HB(C3N2H3)3] + 3H2 Intermediates include the monopyrazolylborate ([H3B(C3N2H3)]‚àí) and the bispyrazolylborate ([H2B(C3N2H3)2]‚àí). KTp (m.p. 188-189 ¬∞C) is a colourless solid that soluble in polar solvents. =Substituted tris(pyrazolylborate)s= Condensation of 3-substituted pyrazoles with borohydride affords the corresponding substituted Tp derivatives. The substituent forces boron to the less hindered nitrogen center. Thus 3-phenylpyrazole gives HB(C3N2H2Ph)3]‚àí, abbreviated [TpPh]‚àí, wherein the phenyl substituents project away from the metal. Analogously 3-isopropylpyrazole gives HB(C3N2H2iPr)3]-, abbreviated [TpiPr]‚àí. 3,5-Dimethylpyrazole gives the hexamethylated ligand [HB(C3N2HMe2)3]‚àí, sometimes called Tp*‚àí. Because pyrazoles are readily prepared from 1,3-diketones, a large number of substituted Tp complexes are possible. Derivatives are known with perfluorinated, chiral, and functional substituents. Examples Structure of the piano stool complex TpBn,MeMo(CO)2NO. Structure of the anionic piano stool complex [TpMeMo(CO)3]‚àí together with the counterion [NEt4]+. Illustrative of the synthetic routes to TpR‚àí complexes, MnBr(CO)5 and KTp react as follows: :MnBr(CO)5 + KTp ‚Üí TpMn(CO)3 + KBr + 2 CO Electronically related compounds are known, such as CpMn(CO)3 and [(9-ane-S3)Mn(CO)3]+. The labile acetonitrile complex Mo(CO)3(MeCN)3 reacts with KTp to give the anion [MoTp(CO)3]‚àí, which can be crystallised as its tetraethylammonium salt (see figure): :Mo(CO)3(CH3CN)3 + KTp ‚Üí K[TpMo(CO)3] + 3 CH3CN Protonation, allylation, and nitrosylation of this salt gives the corresponding neutral hydride, allyl, and nitrosyl (see figure) derivatives. The inductive effect of substituents on the pyrazolyl groups is illustrated by the values of ŒΩCO for TpCF3CuCO (2201 cm‚àí1) vs TpMeCuCO (2137 cm‚àí1).S. Imai, K. Fujisawa, T. Kobayashi, N. Shirasawa, H. Fujii, T. Yoshimura, N. Kitajima, and Y. Moro-oka, Inorganic Chemistry, 1998, volume 37, page 3066. Although of no practical value, trispyrazolylborate compounds have been applied to a variety of themes. In bioinorganic chemistry, some of the first crystallizable copper dioxygen complexes were obtained using this ligand platform, including examples of the Cu2(Œº-Œ∑2,Œ∑2-O2) bonding mode. Models for hemerythrin, an enzyme with a diiron active site, and xanthine oxidase, a molybdoenzyme, have been examined. In such model complexes, the Tp‚àí simulates the coordination environment provided by three imidazole ligands in proteins. In organometallic chemistry, Tp*Rh(CO)2 and related complexes participate in C-H activation reactions. Derivatives of Grignard reagents can be generated, such as TpiBuMgCH3.

Geography Kleinmariazell is located north of Altenmarkt in a side valley of the Triesting in the direction of Klausen-Leopoldsdorf. The cloister lies on an old pilgrim's trail, the Via Sacra from Vienna to Mariazell. The community, as well as the cloister, is described and referred to as Mariazell in Austria (as opposed to Mariazell in Styria), Klein-Mariazell Monastery, or Klein-Mariazell Abbey. Aside from a few houses on the street and an inn, it is made up exclusively of the historic cloister buildings. History History of Kleinmariazell: *1134 or 1136- The church and cloister were founded by Heinrich and Rapoto of Schwarzburg-N√∂stach as well as the Babenberg Margrave Leopold III the Holy of Austria as Cella Sancte Marie, a Benedictine cloister. *1782- The cloister is dissolved in the course of the Josphine Reforms and falls into decay. *1825- The cloister and its lands are put up for auction. Many owners follow, and the cloister is turned into a palace. The former monastery church becomes the local parish church. *1998- After a general renovation by the Archdiocese of Vienna with public and private support, the church is returned its original purpose. *2005- Near the church complex an apartment annex is built to hold, among others, 8 priests. The current group of buildings follows the modern ideas of restoration and monument protection. As a result, Kleinmariazell is no longer merely a religious center, but also an architectural artwork.

Gameplay Screenshot In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through). Using the joystick the player is able to move the fishing line left, right, up, and down in the water. When a fish is hooked, the line slowly comes up to the surface of the water. Pressing the fire button on the joystick reels in the fish faster. However, if both fishermen have hooked fish, only one person can reel it in (the one who first hooked the fish). The shark that roams the water will try to eat hooked fish before they surface. The objective for both fishermen is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. There are six rows of fish; the top two rows have 2 lb. fish, the middle two rows have 4 lb. fish and the two bottom rows have 6 lb. fish. The more valuable fish sit at the bottom, but they are harder to bring in as they run a higher risk of being eaten by the shark. The game's two variants are simply single- player and multi-player. In both games the objective is to reach 99 lb. of fish first. Reception InVideo magazine's \\"Arcade Alley\\" column, Fishing Derby was characterized as \\"imaginative, colorful, and fun\\" providing children with \\"better animation than Saturday morning TV and provid[ing] adults with a subtle game of skill\\".

Tax incentives can have both positive and negative impacts on an economy. Among the positive benefits, if implemented and designed properly, tax incentives can attract investment to a country. Other benefits of tax incentives include increased employment, higher number of capital transfers, research and technology development, and also improvement to less developed areas. Though it is difficult to estimate the effects of tax incentives, they can, if done properly, raise the overall economic welfare through increasing economic growth and government tax revenue (after the expiration of the tax holiday/incentive period). However, tax incentive can cause negative effects on a government's financial condition, among other negative effects, if they are not properly designed and implemented. There are four typical costs to tax incentives: * resource allocation costs * compliance costs * revenue costs * corruption costs. Resource allocation refers to lost government tax revenue resulting from the tax incentive. The second cost refers to the situation when the tax incentives lead to too much investment in a certain area of the economy and too little investment in other areas of the economy. Revenue cost is associated with enforcing the tax incentive and monitoring who is receiving the incentive and ensuring they are properly deserving of the incentive. Therefore, the higher and the more complex the tax incentive, the higher the compliance costs because of the larger number of people and firms attempting to secure the tax incentive. The final cost is similar to the third in that it relates to people abusing the tax incentive. Corruption occurs when there are no clear guidelines or minimal guidelines for qualification. According to a 2020 study of tax incentives in the United States, \\"states spent between 5 USD and 216 USD per capita on incentives for firms.\\" There is some evidence that this leads to direct employment gains but there is not strong evidence that the incentives increase economic growth. Disambiguation Many \\"tax incentives\\" simply remove part of, or all the burden of the tax from whatever market transaction is taking place. That is because almost all taxes impose what economists call an excess burden or a deadweight loss. Deadweight loss is the difference between the amount of economic productivity that would occur without the tax and that which occurs with the tax. For example, if savings are taxed, people save less than they otherwise would. If non-essential goods are taxed, people buy less. If wages are taxed, people work less. Finally, if activities like entertainment and travel are taxed, consumption is reduced. Sometimes, the goal is to reduce such market activity, as in the case of taxing cigarettes. However, reducing activity is most often not a goal because greater market activity is considered to be desirable. When a tax incentive is spoken of, it usually means removing all or some tax and thus reduce its burden. Pseudo-incentives Regardless of the fact that an incentive spurs economic activity, many use the term to refer to any relative change in taxation that changes economic behavior. Such pseudo-incentives include tax holidays, tax deductions, or tax abatement. Such \\"tax incentives\\" are targeted at both individuals and corporations. =Individual incentives= Individual tax incentives are a prominent form of incentive and include deductions, exemptions, and credits. Specific examples include the mortgage interest deduction, individual retirement account, and hybrid tax credit. Another form of an individual tax incentive is the income tax incentive. Though mostly used in transitioning and developing countries, usually correlating with insufficient domestic capita, the income tax incentive is meant to help the economic welfare of direct investors and corresponds with investing in production activities and finally, many times is meant to attract foreign investors. These incentives are introduced for various reasons. Firstly, they are seen to counterbalance investment disincentives stemming from the normal tax system. Others use the incentives to equalize disadvantages to investing such as complicated laws and insufficient infrastructure. =Corporate tax incentives= Corporate tax incentives can be raised at federal, state, and local government levels. For example, in the United States, the federal tax code provides a wide range of incentives for corporations, totaling $109 billion in 2011, according to a Tax Foundation Study. The Tax Foundation categorizes US federal tax incentives into four main categories, listed below: * Tax exclusions for local bonds valued at $12.4 billion. * Preferences aimed at advancing social policy, valued at $9 billion. * Preferences that directly benefit specific industries, valued at $17.4 billion. * Preferences broadly available to most corporate taxpayers, valued at $68.7 billion. Corporate tax incentives provided by state and local governments are also included in the US tax code but are very often directed at individual companies involved in a corporate site selection project. Site selection consultants negotiate these incentives, which are typically specific to the corporate project the state is recruiting, rather than applicable to a broader industry. Examples include the following: * Corporate income tax credit * Property tax abatement * Sales tax exemption * Payroll tax refund =List of largest US tax incentive deals= *Washington: Boeing, $8.7 billion until 2040, partly for the 777X *New York: Alcoa, $5.6 billion *Washington: Boeing, $3.2 billion *Oregon: Nike, $2 billion *New Mexico: Intel, $2 billion *Louisiana: Cheniere Energy, $1.7 billion *Pennsylvania: Royal Dutch Shell, $1.65 billion over 25 years for the Pennsylvania Shell ethylene cracker plant *Missouri: Cerner Corp., $1.64 billion *Michigan: Chrysler, $1.3 billion *Nevada: Tesla Gigafactory 1, $1.25 billion over 20 years *Mississippi: Nissan Canton, $1.25 billion =Historical preservation tax incentive= Not all tax incentives are structured for individuals or corporations, as some tax incentives are meant to help the welfare of the society. For example, the historical preservation tax incentive. The US federal government pushes, in many situations, to preserve historical buildings. One way the government does so is through tax incentives for the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The tax incentives to preserve the historic buildings can generate jobs, increase private investment in the city, create housing for low-income individuals in the historic buildings, and enhance property values. Currently, according to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, there are two major incentives in this category. The first incentive is a tax credit of 20% for rehabilitation of historic structures. A historic structure is defined as a building listed in the National Register of Historic Places or a building in a registered historic district, acknowledged by the National Park Service. The second incentive is a tax credit of 10% for rehabilitation of structures built before 1936 but are considered non-residential and non- historical. Impact According to a 2020 study, tax competition \\"primarily reduces taxes for mobile firms and is unlikely to substantially affect the efficiency of business location.\\" A 2020 NBER paper found some evidence that state and local business tax incentives in the United States led to employment gains but no evidence that the incentives increased broader economic growth at the state and local level.

It covers both efforts undertaken by photograph conservators, librarians, archivists, and museum curators who manage photograph collections at a variety of cultural heritage institutions, as well as steps taken to preserve collections of personal and family photographs. It is an umbrella term that includes both preventative preservation activities such as environmental control and conservation techniques that involve treating individual items. Both preservation and conservation require an in-depth understanding of how photographs are made, and the causes and prevention of deterioration. Conservator-restorers use this knowledge to treat photographic materials, stabilizing them from further deterioration, and sometimes restoring them for aesthetic purposes. While conservation can improve the appearance of a photograph, image quality is not the primary purpose of conservation. Conservators will try to improve the visual appearance of a photograph as much as possible, while also ensuring its long-term survival and adhering the profession's ethical standards. Photograph conservators also play a role in the field of connoisseurship. Their understanding of the physical object and its structure makes them uniquely suited to a technical examination of the photograph, which can reveal clues about how, when, and where it was made. Photograph preservation is distinguished from digital or optical restoration, which is concerned with creating and editing a digital copy of the original image rather than treating the original photographic material. Photograph preservation does not normally include moving image materials, which by their nature require a very different approach. Film preservation concerns itself with these materials. Overview of Photographs and Photographic Processes Physical photographs usually consist of three components: the final image material (e.g. silver, platinum, dyes, or pigments), the transparent binder layer (e.g. albumen, collodion, or gelatin) in which the final image material is suspended, and the primary support (e.g. paper, glass, metal, or plastic). These components affect the susceptibility of photos to damage and the preservation and conservation methods required.American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), Caring for Your Treasures, accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation-us.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/photographs.pdf. Photograph preservation and conservation are also concerned with the negatives from which photographic prints are made. There are two basic types of negatives: glass plate and film-based. =Significant Developments in Photographic ProcessesUnless otherwise noted, material in this section comes from the following sources: Joanna Norman, \\"Photographic Collections Management,\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences 39, no. 4 (2002): 365-69; Bruce Warren, Photography (Minneapolis/St. Paul: West Pub.

He coated pewter plates with bitumen (an asphaltic varnish that hardens with exposure to light) and put them in a Camera Obscura. After exposure to sunlight for a long time, the parts that were exposed to light became hard and the parts that were not could be washed off with lavender oil. 1837: Daguerreotype The daguerreotype process (named after Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre) produces a unique image, as there is no negative created. After coating a copper plate with light-sensitive silver iodide, the plate is exposed to an image for over 20 minutes and then treated with fumes from heated mercury. The longer the exposure to light, the more mercury fumes are adsorbed by the silver iodide. After the plate is washed with salt water, the image appears, reversed. This was the earliest photographic process to gain popularity in America.Debbie Hess Norris, \\"The Proper Storage and Display of a Photographic Collection,\\" The Book and Paper Annual 2 (1983), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v02/bp02-08.html. It was used until around 1860.Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, Types of Photographs, Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/02TypesOfPhotos.php . 1839: Salt print This was the dominant form of paper print until Albumen prints were introduced in 1850. Salt prints were made using both paper and glass negatives. 1841: Calotype William Henry Fox Talbot invented the negative-positive system of photography commonly used today. He first developed the Talbotype, which used silver chloride to sensitize paper. After improving the process by using silver iodide, he renamed it Calotype. The process could produce many positive images, but they were not as sharp because they were printed on fibrous paper rather than glass. 1842: Cyanotype (Ferro-plusiate, Blue process) This process forms blue-colored images through a reaction to iron salts. John Herschel studied it in order to reproduce his complicated math formulas and memos. Other processes that fall into this category include Kallitype, Vandyketype, and Platinum printing. 1850: Albumen print This process, introduced by Louis D√©sir√© Blanquart-Evrard, was the most common kind of print in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Beautiful sepia gradation images were created by using albumen and silver chloride. The surfaces of prints made with this process were glossy because of the egg whites which were layered heavily to prevent the originally thin prints from curling, cracking, or tearing easily. This type of print was especially common for studio portraits and landscape or stereoviews.Norris, \\"Proper Storage and Display.\\" 1851: Wet collodion process and Ambrotype Frederick Scott Archer developed the wet collodion processes, which used a thick glass plate unevenly hand-coated with a collodion-based, light-sensitive emulsion. Collodion, which means ‚Äòglue‚Äô in Greek, is nitrocellulose dissolved in ether and ethanol. The Ambrotype, an adaptation of the wet collodion process, was developed by Archer and Peter W. Fry. It involved placing a dark background behind the glass so that the negative image would look positive, and was popular in America until around 1870.Albright and Fischer, Types of Photographs. 1855: Gum printing Orange colored dichromate has photosensitivity when it is mixed with colloids such as gum arabic, albumen, or gelatin. Using that feature, Alphonse Poitevin invented the gum printing process. It gained in popularity after 1898, and again in 1960s and 1970s because of its unique look. 1858: Tintype (also called Ferrotype and Melainotype) In this photographic process the emulsion was painted directly onto a japanned (varnish finish) iron plate. it was much cheaper and sturdier than the Ambrotype and Daguerreotype. 1861: RGB Additive Color Model Applied physician James Clerk Maxwell made the first color photo by mixing red, green, and blue light. 1871: Gelatin dry plate Richard L. Maddox discovered that gelatin could be a carrier for silver salts. By 1879, the gelatin dry plate had replaced the collodion wet plate. It was a revolutionary innovation in photography since it needed less light exposure, was usable when dry, meaning photographers no longer needed to pack and carry dangerous liquids, and could be standardized because it could be factory produced. 1873: Platinum Printing (Platinotype) William Willis patented platinum printing in Britain. The process rapidly spread and became a dominant method in Europe and America by 1894 since it had a visibly different color tone compared to albumen and gelatin silver prints. Late 1880s: Gelatin silver print This has been the major photograph printing process since the late 1880s up to the present.Norris, ‚ÄúProper Storage and Display.‚Äù Prints consist of paper coated with an emulsion of silver halide in gelatin. The surface is generally smooth; under magnification, the print appears to sparkle.Diane DeCesare Ross, \\"An Overview of the Care of Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives,\\" Mississippi Libraries 65, no. 2 (Summer 2001): 42. 1889: Kallitype Dr. W. W. J. Nicol invented and revined the Kallitype. Vandyketype, or Single Kalliitype, is the simplest type of Kalltype and creates beautiful brown images. 1889: Film Negatives Cellulose nitrate film was developed by Eastman Kodak in 1889 and refined in 1903. It is made of silver gelatin on a cellulose nitrate base. The negatives are flammable and therefore can be dangerous. Nitrate sheet film was used widely though the 1930s, while nitrate roll film was used through the 1950s. The nitrate base was replaced with cellulose acetate in 1923. By 1937, Cellulose diacetate was used as the base, and beginning in 1947 Cellulose triacetate was used.Paul Messier, \\"Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives\\" (Rocky Mountain Conservation Center, 1993), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/messier/negrmcc.html. Polyester film was introduced around 1960.International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet, (1992, revised and updated 2002), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photolea.html. 1935: Color Photographs Kodak introduced color film and transparencies in 1935. The first process was called Kodachrome.Henry Wilhelm, \\"Monitoring the Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints,\\" Journal of the American Institute for Conservation 21, no. 1 (1981), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation- us.org/jaic/articles/jaic21-01-003.html. Ektachrome, introduced in the late 1940s, became equally popular. There are now a variety of color processes that use different materials; most consist of dyes (cyan, magenta, and yellow, each of which have different absorption peaks) suspended in a gelatin layer.Mary Fahey, The Care and Preservation of Photographic Prints (Dearborn, MI: The Henry Ford), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/prints.aspx . =Photograph Stability= Photograph stability refers to the ability of prints and film to remain visibly unchanged over periods of time. Different photographic processes yield varying degrees of stability. In addition, different materials may have dark-storage stability which differs from their stability in light. An extreme case with slides was stability under the intense light of projection. For example, when stored in darkness, Kodachrome's long-term stability under suitable conditions is superior to other types of color film. Images on Kodachrome slides over fifty years old retain accurate color and density. Kodachrome film stored in darkness is largely responsible for excellent color footage of World War II, for example. It has been calculated that the yellow dye in Kodachrome, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years. This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers. However, Kodachrome's color stability under bright light, especially during projection, is inferior to substantive slide films. Kodachrome's fade time under projection is about one hour, compared to Fujichrome's two and a half hours. Thus, old Kodachrome slides should be exposed to light only when copying to another medium. Silver halide Black-and-white negatives and prints made by the silver halide process are stable so long as the photographic substrate is stable. Some papers may yellow with age, or the gelatin matrix may yellow and crack with age. If not developed properly, small amounts of silver halide remaining in the gelatin will darken when exposed to light. In some prints, the black silver oxide is reduced to metallic silver with time, and the image takes on a metallic sheen as the dark areas reflect light instead of absorbing it. Silver can also react with sulfur in the air and form silver sulfide. A correctly processed and stored silver print or negative probably has the greatest stability of any photographic medium, as attested by the wealth of surviving historical black- and-white photographs. Chromogenic Chromogenic dye color processes include Type \\"R\\" and process RA-4 (also known as \\"type C prints\\"), process C-41 color negatives. and process E-6 color reversal (Ektachrome) film. Chromogenic processes yield organic dyes that are less stable than silver, and can also leave unreacted dye couplers behind during developing. Both factors may lead to color changes over time. The three dyes, cyan, magenta, and yellow, which make up the print may fade at different rates, causing a color shift in the print. Modern chromogenic papers such as Kodak Endura have achieved excellent stability, however, and are rated for 100 years in home display. Dye destruction Dye destruction prints are the most archival color prints, at least among the wet chemical processes, and arguably among all processes. The most well-known kind of dye destruction print is the Cibachrome, now known as Ilfochrome. Ink jet Some ink jet prints are now considered to have excellent stability, while others are not. Ink jet prints using dye-pigment mixtures are now common in photography, and often claim stability on par with chromogenic prints. However, these claims are based on accelerated aging studies rather than historical experience, because the technology is still relatively young. Types and Causes of Deterioration There are two main types of deterioration found in photographic materials. Chemical deterioration occurs when the chemicals in the photograph or negative undergo reactions (either through contact with outside catalysts, or because the chemicals are inherently unstable) that damage the material. Physical or structural deterioration occurs when chemical reactions are not involved, and include abrasion and tearing. Both types of deterioration are caused by three main factors: environmental storage conditions, inappropriate storage enclosures and repair attempts, and human use and handling. Chemical damage can also be caused by improper chemical processing.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet. Different types of photographic materials are particularly susceptible to different types and causes of deterioration. =Environmental Factors= * Temperature and Humidity interact with one another and cause chemical and physical deterioration. High temperature and relative humidity, along with pollution, can cause fading and discoloration of silver images and color dyes. Higher temperatures cause faster deterioration: the rate of deterioration is approximately doubled with every temperature increase of 10 ¬∞C. Fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity are particularly damaging, as they also speed up chemical deterioration and can cause structural damage such as cracked emulsions and warped support layers.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet; Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, Care of Photographs, Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, . :*Too- high relative humidity can cause fading, discoloration and silver mirroring,Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs. and can cause binders to soften and become sticky, making photographs susceptible to physical damage.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet It can also cause photographs to adhere to frames and other enclosures.AIC, Caring for Your Treasures. :*Too-low relative humidity can cause physical damage including desiccation, embrittlement, and curling.Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs. * Pollution can include oxidant and aciding/sulfiding gases that cause chemical deterioration, as well as dust and particulates that can cause abrasion.\\"Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs; IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet; Ross, \\"Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives,\\" 40. Sources of indoor pollution that affect photographs include paint fumes, plywood, cardboard, and cleaning supplies.Michele Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library Department of Preservation and Conservation, 2001): 3, accessed August 12, 2001, http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/brochure/Family%20Photos%20Text%2001.pdf. * Exposure to light causes embrittlement, fading, and yellowing. The damage is cumulative and usually irreversible. UV light (including from sunlight and fluorescent light) and visible light in the blue part of the spectrum are especially harmful to photographs, but all forms of light, including incandescent and tungsten, are damaging.Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs; IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet. * Mold growth is fostered by high temperatures and humidityAlbright and Fischer, Care of Photographs. as well as dust particles.Ross, \\"Silver- Based Photographic Prints and Negatives,\\" 40.

Storing items too loosely, too tightly, or in enclosures that do not provide adequate physical protection can all cause physical damage such as curling and breakage.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet. Human handling and use, including by researchers and staff, can also cause both chemical and physical deterioration. Oils, dirt, lotions, and perspiration transmitted through fingerprints can destroy emulsion and cause bleaching, staining, and silver mirroring.Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs; James L. Bagget, ‚ÄúHandle With Care: Photos,‚Äù The Alabama Librarian 54, no. 1 (2004): 5; Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs, 2. Physical damage caused by human handling includes abrasion, scratches, tears, breakage, and cracks.Albright and Fischer, Care of Photographs; Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs, 2. Improper chemical processing, including use of exhausted fixer, insufficient length of fixing, and residual fixer left behind by inadequate washing can cause fading and discoloration. Heat, humidity, and light can accelerate such damage. Adherence to ISO standards at the time of processing can help avoid this type of deterioration.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet. =Examples of Threats to Specific Photographic Materials= Glass plate negatives and ambrotypes are prone to breakage.AIC, Caring for Your Treasures. Deterioration of film negatives, regardless of type, is humidity and temperature dependent. Nitrate film will first fade, then become brittle and sticky. It will then soften, adhere to paper enclosures, and produce an odor. Finally, it will disintegrate into a brown, acrid powder.Messier, \\"Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives\\". Because of its flammability, it must be handled with particular care. Cellulose aetate, diacetate, and triacetate film produce acetic acid, which smells like vinegar. The deterioration process is therefore known as \\"vinegar syndrome.\\" The negatives become very brittle and, in diacetate and triacetate film, the base shrinks, causing grooves (‚Äúchanneling‚Äù).Messier, \\"Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives\\". In addition to fading, silver-based images are prone to silver mirroring, which presents as a bluish metallic sheen on the surface of the photograph or negative and is caused by oxidation, which causes the silver to migrate to the surface of the emulsion.National Library of Australia, Care and handling guidelines for digitization of Library materials, accessed August 17, 2011, http://www.nla.gov.au/digital/care_handling.html. Color photographs are an inherently unstable medium, and are more susceptible to light and fading than black and white photographic processes. They are composed of various dyes, all of which eventually fade, albeit at different rates (causing discoloration along with fading).Norman, \\"Photographic Collections Management.\\" Many color photographic processes are also susceptible to fading even in the dark (known as \\"dark-fading\\").Wilhelm, \\"Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints.\\" There is little that can be done to restore faded images, and even under ideal conditions, most color photographs will not survive undamaged for more than 50 years.Norman, \\"Photographic Collections Management.\\" Preservation Strategies =Temperature and Relative Humidity Control= Maintenance of a proper environment such as control of temperature and relative humidity (RH; a measure of how saturated the air is with moisture)IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet. is extremely important to the preservation of photographic materials.

Temperature is the controlling factor in the stability of contemporary color photographs. For color photographs, storage at low temperatures (40 ¬∞F or below) is recommended.Library of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections‚Äô‚Äô, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photo.html. Relative humidity should be maintained between 30-50% without cycling more than +/- 5% a day.IFLA ,Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet‚Äô‚Äô. The lower part of that range is best for ‚Äúlong term stability of several photographic processes‚Äù.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Not only do relative humidity levels above 60% cause deterioration, but also low and fluctuating humidity may also damage them.Library of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections‚Äô‚Äô Climate control equipment can be used to control temperatures and humidity. Air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and humidifiers can be helpful, but it‚Äôs important to make sure they help instead of hurt (for example, air conditioning raises humidity).Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. =Cold Storage= Cold storage is recommended for especially vulnerable materials.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Original prints, negatives, and transparencies (not glass plates, daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, or other images on glass or metal) should be placed in packaging (archival folders in board boxes in double freezer weight Ziplock bags) in cold storage, and temperatures should be maintained at 1.7-4.4‚ÄùC (35-40 ¬∞F).National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines,‚Äù Conserve-O-Gram 14, no. 4 (June 1997), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/conserveogram/14-04.pdf. According to the guideline of National Archives facilities, clear plastic bags such as Zip-locks or flush-cut bags with twist-ties (polyethylene or polypropylene plastic bags) and cotton gloves are needed.Sarah S. Wagner, ‚Äò‚ÄôCold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs‚Äô‚Äô (1991), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/cold-storage- photos.html. Removing items from cold storage requires letting them acclimate to room conditions.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Photographs must be allowed to warm up slowly in a cool, dry place, such as an office or processing area.Wagner, ‚Äò‚ÄôCold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Original items should be retrieved from the storage only in an emergency and no more than once a year.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù Without cold storage, temperature-sensitive materials will deteriorate in a matter of a few decades; with cold storage they can remain unchanged for many centuries.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet‚Äô‚Äô. =Light Control= Photographs should not be hung near light. Hanging photographs on a wall can cause damage from the exposure to direct sunlight, or to fluorescent lights. Displays of photographs should be changed periodically because most photographs will deteriorate in light over time.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. UV-absorbing sleeves can be used to filter out damaging rays from fluorescent tubes and UV- absorbing sheets can be placed over windows or in frames. Low UV-emitting bulbs are available.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Light levels should be kept at 50- 100 Lux (5-10 footcandles) for most photographs when in use for research as well as exhibit.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù Exposure of color slides to the light in the projector should be kept to a minimumLibrary of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections‚Äô‚Äô and photographs should be stored in dark storage.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù The best way to preserve a photograph is to display a facsimile.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet‚Äô‚Äô. =Pollution Control= Controlling air quality is difficult. Ideally, air entering a storage or exhibition area should be filtered and purified. Gaseous pollution should be removed with chemical filters or wet scrubbers. Exterior windows should be kept when possible. Interior sources of harmful gases should be minimized. Metal cabinets are preferable to wooden cabinets, which can produce harmful peroxides.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Air can be filtered to keep out gaseous pollutants and particulates such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and ozoneNational Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.IFLA, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet‚Äô‚Äô. =Handling Control= Handling and use policies should be established and staff should be trained in policies and policy enforcement and telling users the policies when they arrive. Policies for processing, handling for loaned or exhibited items, and disaster prevention and recovery should also be created and followed.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù Work spaces should be clean and uncluttered.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù Clean gloves or clean, dry hands should be used whenever photographs are handled.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Foods, drink, dirt, cleaning chemicals, and photocopy machines should be kept away from photo storage, exhibit, or work spaces.National Park Service, ‚ÄúCaring for Photographs: General Guidelines.‚Äù For precious materials, users should be provided with duplicates, not originals. =Storage Systems Control= Proper storage materials are essential for the long-term stability of photographs and negatives. Enclosures keep away dirt and pollutants. All enclosures used to house photographs and those should meet the specifications provided in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Most photographs can be safely kept in paper enclosures; some can also be safely stored in some types of plastic enclosures.Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare and conservation of photographic materials‚Äô‚Äô (2006), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservationregister.com/carephotographs.asp . Paper enclosures protect objects from light, but may result in increased handling for viewing.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Paper enclosures must be acid-free, lignin-free, and are available in both buffered (alkaline, pH 8.5) and unbuffered (neutral, pH 7) stock. Storage materials must pass the ANSI Photographic Activity Test (PAT) which is noted in suppliers‚Äô catalogs.Library of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections‚Äô‚Äô Paper enclosures also protects the photographs from the accumulation of moisture and detrimental gasesAlbright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. and are relatively inexpensive.Library of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections.‚Äô‚Äô Plastic enclosures include uncoated polyester film, uncoated cellulose triacetate, polyethylene, and polypropylene.Library of Congress, ‚Äò‚ÄôCaring for Your Photographic Collections‚Äô‚Äô Plastic enclosures are transparent. Photographs can be viewed without removal from the enclosure, thus it can reduce handling. However, plastic enclosures can trap moisture and cause ferrotyping (sticking, with a resultant glossy area).Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Plastic is not suitable for prints with surface damage, glass or metal-based photographs, nor for film-based negatives and transparencies from the 1950s, unless the latter are in cold storage.Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare and conservation of photographic materials.‚Äô‚Äô It should not to be used to store older safety film negatives as this may hasten their deterioration.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. Horizontal storage is preferable for many photographic prints and oversize photographs. It provides overall support to the images and prevents mechanical damage such as bending. Vertical storage is often more efficient and may make access to a collection easier. Materials of similar size should be stored together. Boxes and files should not be overcrowded.Albright and Fischer, ‚Äò‚ÄôCare of Photographs‚Äô‚Äô. =Reproduction and Digitization= Unlike the born-digital photographs that are widely produced and consumed these days, historical photographs such as old slides, films, and printed photos are not easy to preserve. An important component of long-term photograph preservation is making reproductions (by photocopying, photographing, or scanning and digitizing) of photographs for use in exhibitions and by researchers, which reduces the damage caused by non- controlled environments and handling.AIC, Caring for Your Treasures Digitizing photographs also allows access by a much wider public, especially where the images have intrinsic historic value. Digital scans, however, are not replacements for the original, as digital file formats may become obsolete. Originals should always be preserved, even if they have been digitized. Born- digital photographs also require preservation, using digital preservation techniques.Bagget, ‚ÄúHandle With Care: Photos,‚Äù 5. Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access (SEPIA) lists ten principles for digitization of historical photograph.SEPIA (Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access), Preservation issues in digitizing historical photographs (200 ), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.ica.org/?lid=5668&bid;=744. Summarized, they are: # Photographs are an essential part of our cultural heritage, which contain our past, documentary and artistic value and the history of photographic processes; # Digitizing photographs that deteriorate quickly is urgent matter to facilitate access for a large audience; # Since digitization is not an end itself but a tool, selection of photographs to digitize should be based on an understanding of the nature and potential use of the collection; # It's essential to define the aims, priorities, technical requirements, procedures and future use for investments; # The creation of a digital image is a sophisticated activity which requires photographic expertise with ethical judgment; # Digital images need regular maintenance in order to keep pace with changing technologies; # A good digitization project requires teamwork, combining expertise on imaging, collection management, IT, conservation, descriptive methods and preservation strategies; # The input of specialists in every project is essential to integrate preservation measures in the work-flow, handle fragile materials and avoid damage to the originals; # Preservation specialists need to manage of digital assets in line with the overall preservation policy of the organization; and # Museums, archives and libraries actively involve to develop international standards for the preservation of digital collections in the long-term view. Examples Original Tay Bridge from the north Fallen Tay Bridge from the north An example of digitization as part of a photograph preservation strategy is the photographic collection of the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. These photographs have been digitized and disseminated more widely. Only the positive prints survive, owing to the widespread practice of recycling the original glass negatives to reclaim the silver content. Even when carefully preserved and kept in the dark, damage can occur through intermittent exposure to light, as shown by damage to the image of the intact bridge (at left). An example of a larger digitization project is the Cased Photographs Project, which provides access to digital images and detailed descriptions of daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, and related photographs in the collections of the Bancroft Library and the California State Library. Conservation Treatments Photograph conservation involves the physical treatment of individual photographs. As defined by the American Institute for Conservation, treatment is ‚Äúthe deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration.‚Äù Stabilization treatments aim to maintain photographs in their current condition, minimizing further deterioration, while restoration treatments aim to return photographs to their original state.American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), Definitions of Conservation Terminology, accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation- us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid;=620 Conservation treatments range from very simple tear repairs or flattening to more complex treatments such as stain removal. Treatments vary widely depending on the type of photograph and its intended use. Therefore, conservators must by knowledgeable regarding both of these issues. Guides for the preservation of personal and family photograph collections, such as Cornell University's Preserving Your Family Photographs and the AIC‚Äôs Caring for Your Treasures, recommend that people contact a trained conservator if they have rapidly deteriorating negatives or photographs with active mold growth, staining from pressure sensitive tape, severe tears, adhesion to enclosures, and other types of damage requiring conservation treatment.Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs, 7-8. Professional Organizations There are a number of international organizations concerned with conservation of photographs along with other subjects, including the International Council on Archives (ICA), the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), and the International Council of Museums - Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC). The Photographic Records Working Group is a specialty group within the ICOM-CC. In the United States, the national membership organization of conservation professionals is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic works(AIC) to which the Photographic Materials Group (PMG) belongs. The Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC) and the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA) also play an important role in the field of conservation. The Image Permanence Institute (IPI) at Rochester Institute of Technology is one of the leaders in preservation research of images in particular. =Codes and Standards= Photograph conservators and preservation managers are guided in their work by codes of ethics and technical standards. The International Council on Archives publishes a Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. Additionally, members of other professions (such as archivists and librarians) who deal with preservation of photographs do so in accordance with their professional organization‚Äôs codes of ethics. For example, the Society of American Archivists Code of Ethics states that \\"Archivists protect all documentary materials for which they are responsible and guard them against defacement, physical damage, deterioration, and theft.\\"SAA, Code of Ethics for Archivists (2005), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www2.archivists.org/code-of-ethics The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) both publish technical standards that govern the materials and procedures used in photograph preservation and conservation. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions has published a list of ANSI standards pertaining to the care and handling of photographs.International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Standards, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photostn.html. Education and Training Photograph conservators can be found in museums, archives, and libraries, as well as in private practice. Conservators often have earned their master's degrees in art conservation, though many have also been trained through apprenticeship. They often have backgrounds in art history, chemistry, or photography. Among numerous programs concerned with conservation of photographs around the world are: *University of Amsterdam *University of Melbourne in Australia *The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts *Canadian Conservation Institute *The National School of Conservation, Restoration and Museology in Mexico (ENCRyM) *Royal Institute for the Study and Conservation of Belgium's Artistic Heritage *Institut national du patrimoine *Universit√© Paris 1 *Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin (HTW) *Fachhochschule K√∂ln *Staatlichen Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Stuttgart *Swiss Conservation- Restoration Campus *Hochschule der K√ºnste Bern *Fratelli Alinari *Studio Art Centers International, Florence (SACI) *Royal College of Art/Victoria and Albert Museum *The International master Program in Conservation of Antique Photographs and Paper Heritage held at the EICAP Faculty of Applied arts- Helwan University In addition, Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) works internationally to advance conservation practice in the visual arts. The United States, in particular, has many training or degree programs for photograph conservators offered by graduate schools and organizations such as: *Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA) *Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC) *George Eastman House *Buffalo State College *Institute of Fine Arts, New York University *University of Delaware *Campbell Center for Historic Preservation Studies *Northern States Conservation Center *Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education.

She is a fine example of the peak of development of the armed schooner. Neufchatel operated in mainly European waters, damaging British shipping during the War of 1812. Noted for her speed, at one time she outran seventeen men-of-war. In 1813, operating in the English channel, she took nine British prizes in quick succession. She also delivered a crushing defeat to the boats of a British frigate that tried to capture her. The British finally captured her in December 1814; she was broken up in 1815.  Construction  A Hermaphrodite Brig design Her design is believed to be due to Christian Bergh. She had a hermaphrodite rig, i.e., she combined the rigs of a schooner and a brigantine. \\"She carried four sails on the foremast, one square sail on the main, and a large fore-and-aft sail with gaff abaft the fore, with large staysails over and three jibs. Her spanker boom projected far beyond the stern.\\"( Prince of Neuchatel) After her capture her design caught the Navy Board's interest and on 10 April 1815 it ordered Woolwich Dock to build a copy. However, with the end of the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars, the copy was never built.  Career  On 11 October 1814, under Captain John Ordronaux, she engaged in one of the most violent privateer clashes of the war. Becalmed on the south side of Nantucket, she became vulnerable. Captain Henry Hope of thereupon sent 111 men in five boats to cut out the privateersman defended by 40 Americans. After 20 minutes of savage fighting, the British surrendered. British casualties amounted to 28 killed, 37 wounded, and 28 taken prisoner. The Americans reported 7 killed and 24 wounded.

On 28 December 1814, in the Atlantic, the three British frigates, , , and sighted her and began to pursue. Under the strain of the large sail area her masts sprung (many Baltimore clippers experienced problems due to their extremely large rigs). Not being able to outrun the British frigates, Prince de Neufchatel surrendered. John Ordronaux was apparently not her captain at the time; her commander was Nicholas Millin.

HMS Leander - Captain's Log Fate The British took Prince de Neufchatel back to England. There she was damaged beyond repair on the back of the sill of a dock gate as she was being undocked.

They are examples of scorpionate ligands. Various ligands in this family are known, differing in what substituents are on the imidazoles. The most common is TmMe, which has a methyl group on the nitrogen. It is easily prepared by the reaction of molten methimazole (1-methylimidazole-2-thione) with sodium borohydride, giving the sodium salt of the ligand. Salts of the TmMe anion are known also for lithium and potassium. Other alkyl- and aryl-group variations are likewise named TmR according to those groups.Mark D.

TmMe has three \\"soft\\" sulfur donor atoms, whereas Tp‚àí has three nitrogen donor atoms. The thioamide sulfur is highly basic, as found for other thioureas.

He moved to the UK in the 1990s and began working at Conran Group's restaurants. After first appearing on television on ITV's This Morning, he started presenting a revamped MasterChef on BBC One in 2005. He is a restaurateur; former owner of the Luxe and a second restaurant, Smiths of Smithfield. He has also written a number of cookbooks.  Early life  Torode was born the youngest of three boys in Melbourne, Victoria, but between the ages of four (when his mother died) and ten he lived in Maitland, New South Wales, with his brother Andrew, and his grandmother who taught him to cook. He then lived in Edithvale, Melbourne, with his father and his brothers, though his father was frequently away from home because of work. His early cooking career started at Le Coq Au Vin restaurant in Aspendale and his later apprenticeship was at several establishments in Beaumauris, both in Melbourne. He has said that the food in his childhood was fairly normal, and roast chicken remains one of his favourite dishes because of the connection to his childhood, although his favourite meal at that time was crumbed lamb cutlets. He has also said that one of the first books he enjoyed at school was To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.  Career  He began his cooking career at the age of 16, after leaving school to attend catering college. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1991. A year later he began working at Le Pont de la Tour and Quaglino's as a sous chef for the Conran Group under Terence Conran. While working at Quaglino's, Torode first met Gregg Wallace, whose company supplied the vegetables for the restaurant. He cooked on ITV's This Morning in 1996, and continued in that role until 2000. In 1998, his cookbook The Mezzo Cookbook won the James Beard Foundation Award for \\"Best Food Photography\\". He opened his former restaurant in Smithfield, London in 2000, called Smiths of Smithfields. After a year, he opened a second restaurant, called Cafeteria, near Notting Hill Gate, this has since closed, making way for larger projects. Torode has presented a show for the Good Food channel in the UK alongside former Celebrity MasterChef contestant Hardeep Singh Kohli, called New British Kitchen. The show aimed to feature the impact of imported cuisines in Britain. Other television work has included an appearance on the BBC's The Magicians, which saw Torode and Wallace participate in a stunt by magicians Barry and Stuart which hung the pair off the side of the Tate Modern in London. He presented the 2014 series John Torode's Australia; the 10 episodes retrace the flavours of John Torode's childhood and the people that inspired his passion for food as he travels the country to go back in time. It has been hosted on BBC Good Food and has so far had three reruns. John Torode's Australia was also recorded as having the largest viewing figures on BBC Good Food in 2014. In 2015, he presented John Torode's Argentina as part of the BBC Two series A Cook Abroad, looking specifically at the country's production, cooking and consumption of beef. The episode explored the history and culture behind Argentina's great beef production and included Torode joining a group of gauchos on a working livestock ranch, before ending at a restaurant in Mendoza where cooking beef is regarded as being an art form. Torode was featured on BBC News as one of the people behind the project 'Come..Eat Together!' The project encourages the elderly to get together in the community and enjoy food together, encouraging a better social existence and an air of security in their lives. Torode's 2016 show, John Torode's Malaysian Adventure, aired on the Good Food channel throughout the early part of 2016. The 10-part series, filmed throughout Malaysia and the UK, and was commissioned as a result of the success of John Torode's Australia. In the programme, Torode explores the vibrant and varied cuisine of Malaysia, and travels throughout the country from the capital Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi Island off the northern coast. He cooks with local chefs, meets celebrity restaurateurs, visits night markets and explores the impact of history and culture on the evolution of Malaysian food. The Korean Food Tour (2017, Good Food Channel) sees Torode travel around South Korea, to the mountains, the cities, the countryside and the coast and work his way through some of the nation's top 100 dishes then creating his own version of Korean classics with a modern twist. Torode's recent food tours led to his 2017/2018 culinary adventure John Torode's Asia. This recently premiered on the Good Food channel, achieving the highest viewing figures for the channel since March 2013. Commissioned by Good Food's Luke Hale and UKTV's Sally Quick, the series is funded in partnership with a number of organisations including the Hong Kong Tourism Board. In each location, Torode looks for the most inspiring cooks, discovering the distinctive flavours of their country's cuisine. Cooking on location with local chefs, each episode sees several dishes created, popular and typical of their region. This includes eating in an underwater restaurant, discovering a street food market on the banks of the Yangtze River and making traditional dumplings with a Beijing family, ultimately inspiring the viewer to bring the cuisine of Asia into cooking. In 2018, John Torode's Middle East (10 x 30 minutes) produced by Blink Films, featured the chef as he travelled across the region to find delicious eats. In March 2019, Torode, along with actress and food writer Lisa Faulkner, was given his own weekend cooking show. They host John And Lisa's Weekend Kitchen on Sunday mornings on ITV. = MasterChef = In 2005, the BBC television show MasterChef was relaunched with an updated format and with Torode and Wallace as presenters replacing Gary Rhodes. Torode was chosen instead of food critic AA Gill. By 2011, the show had been sold to 25 countries. Torode has said in interviews that he enjoys that the show is unscripted and that the cameras are just there to capture the genuine interactions between the judges and the contestants. The show subsequently spawned a spin-off, also hosted by Torode and Wallace, called Celebrity MasterChef. In October 2009, Torode opened a restaurant near New Spitalfields Market in London, called the Luxe. He sold his shares and moved on from the two restaurants, but under his leadership, turnover at the Luxe and Smiths of Smithfield reached ¬£9.2 million. He has also co-presented Junior MasterChef, initially along with Nadia Sawalha, the former winner of Celebrity MasterChef, and more recently alongside Donal Skehan. = Guest appearances = Torode has been a guest several times on BBC One's The One Show, Alan Carr: Chatty Man and The Graham Norton Show, and on ITV's Loose Women and This Morning. On 23 July 2014 (as a keen cyclist) Torode was a guest on ITV4's The Cycle Show.  Personal life  Torode has four children. He was married to Jessica, in 2000, the mother of his son and daughter but was divorced in 2014 after separating in 2011. He also has two other children from previous relationships. Torode has been in a relationship with actress and Celebrity Masterchef winner Lisa Faulkner since 2015. The couple married on 24 October 2019 at Aynhoe Park, Oxfordshire.  Criticism During a 2018 series of MasterChef, Torode received significant criticism from Malaysian, Indonesian and Singaporean people when Malaysian contestant Zaleha Kadir Olpin was eliminated. Gregg Wallace had commented that her contesting rendang dish served with nasi lemak \\"wasn't crispy enough\\". \\"I like the rendang flavour, there's a coconut sweetness. However, the chicken skin isn't crispy. It can't be eaten and all the sauce is on the skin so I can't eat it,\\" quoted co-judge Gregg Wallace during his judging of the dish, with Torode commenting that the dish was a 'mistake' and 'not really flavoursome'. Many responded to say that rendang, which is a spicy stew normally made with chicken or beef of tender texture, doesn't consist of crispy outer skin. Subsequently, viewers took to Facebook and Twitter to comment about the rendang's actual texture and how the judges were at fault for eliminating the contestant, including former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who posted a picture of the dish on Instagram with the attached caption, \\"Who eats ‚Äòcrispy‚Äô chicken rendang?\\" Torode responded to the criticism through Twitter by writing: \\"Love this!! Brilliant how excited you are all getting\\", which resulted in further backlash.  Published works    Torode, John (2019) Sydney To Seoul. London: Headline Publishing Group.

History The college was founded by Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick. In 1898 she had founded Warwick Hostel in Reading to offer training to 'surplus women in the lighter branches of agriculture'. Warwick Hostel expanded and moved to Studley Castle in Warwickshire in 1903, becoming Studley Horticultural & Agricultural College for Women. An early student was Adela Pankhurst, and an early warden (1908-1914, 1918-1922) was Dr Lillias Hamilton. Studley College students in 1910 Students included Taki Handa, a student and instructor at Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Japan, who studied at Studley from 1906 to 1907 and designed a garden at Cowden Estate in Muckhart, Scotland. The College students undertook hard practical work in its greenhouses and vegetable gardens. In 1920 Helen Ekins completed a part-time degree in Horticulture at Birmingham University. Hamilton lauded her as the \\"most highly qualified... in horticulture in England\\". Hamilton had to retire due to ill health four years later and Ekins became her the new warden. The college offered a Diploma in Horticulture from 1924 and this was a three year course. In 1934 the college offered a degree course of the University of London leading to a BSc in horticulture. Ekins was to serve as warden until 1946, when Mrs. K.G.Woolacott, became the new warden. The plant collector, Clara Winsome Muirhead studied horticulture at Studley between 1933 and 1935. The College remained an all-women college throughout its existence, closing in 1969. The assets were used to found the Studley College Trust, a charitable trust that awards grants to students of agriculture and horticulture. The Museum of English Rural Life holds a collection of horticultural trophies and medals, and archival material relating to Studley College. Studley Castle has since become a conference centre and wedding venue.

It was formerly in question as to which it belonged, when they were distinct kingdoms. The name either signifies litigious or disputable ground, or it comes from the Old English word 'battable' (land suitable for fattening livestock). History The Debatable Lands extended from the Solway Firth near Carlisle to Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway, the largest population centre being Canonbie. The lands included the baronies of Kirkandrews, Bryntallone and Morton. They were around long from north to south and wide. The boundaries were marked by the rivers Liddel and Esk in the east and the River Sark in the west. A legal system indigenous to the area prevented settlement of it, and served to resolve disputes, but this broke down in the Middle Ages, in part because of interference by the English and Scottish crowns. For over three hundred years the area was effectively controlled by local clans, such as the Armstrongs, who successfully resisted any attempt by the Scottish or English governments to impose their authority. In his history of the Border Reivers (The Steel Bonnets, 1971), George MacDonald Fraser says that the Armstrongs alone could put 3,000 men in the field. They launched frequent raids on farms and settlements outside the Debatable Lands, the profits enabling them to become major landowners. Other clans in the area were the Elwands, Ellwoods, or Eliotts who extended into Teviotdale; the Nixons who were more numerous in Cumberland; the Crossars in Upper Liddesdale, with their chief stronghold in Riccarton/Riccarton Mill (Rickerton, forms of Richardtown), Northern/Upper Liddesdale (listed in valleys of Liddesdale as locus/locality of Croyser 1376) of Hudhouse also located nearby on Liddel (it is a mistake to suppose they settled in Debatable lands on the lower Liddel though at Riccarton, and Hudhouse they were on the upper end of the Liddel Water);The History of Liddesdale, Eskdale, Ewesdale, Wauchopedale and the ..., Volume 1 By Robert Bruce Armstrong pg 181-2 and the Grahams, who owned five towers in the Debatable Land. The Irvings, Carruthers, Olivers, Bells, Dicksons, and Littles were also present in varying numbers. In 1530, King James V of Scotland took action against the lawless clans of the Debatable Lands and imprisoned the Lords Bothwell, Maxwell and Home, Walter Scott of Buccleuch, and other border lairds for their lack of action. James took various other steps, but significantly he broke the strength of the Armstrongs by hanging Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie and thirty-one others at Caerlanrig Chapel, under questionable circumstances. In 1552, Commissioners from Scotland and England met and divided the Debatable Lands between England and Scotland, with a line, known as the Scots' Dike, drawn from Esk to Sark, abolishing the Debatable Lands' de facto independence from either crown. Since then, the Anglo-Scottish border has remained essentially unchanged. The 1552 division of the Debatable Lands, the Scots' Dike and the several changes to the status of Berwick-upon-Tweed between the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries until it finally became English in 1482, remains the only significant alterations to the border agreed in the 1237 Treaty of York, making that treaty one of, if not the oldest, border treaties still in effect today. In 1590 James VI of Scotland declared that the Debateable lands and the lands of Canonbie were annexed to the crown, and he set new leases various landowners.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 799-800.

It was founded in 1973 as the Municipal Bond Insurance Association. It is headquartered in Purchase, New York, and as of January 1, 2015 had approximately 180 employees. MBIA is the largest bond insurer. History , MBIA website, accessed 2010 4 15 Functions of the company MBIA is a monoline insurer primarily of municipal bonds and on asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. Financial insurance or Financial Guarantees are a form of credit enhancement. It also provides a fixed-income asset management service with about forty billion dollars under management. History A consortium of insurance companies (Aetna, Fireman's Fund, Travelers, Cigna, and Continental) formed the Municipal Bond Insurance Association in 1973 to diversify their holdings in municipal bonds. The company went public in 1987. In 2002, Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager, began research which concentrated on challenging MBIA's AAA rating, despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities. He was charged copying fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company, in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena. Ackman has called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and their municipal bond insurance side, despite statements from the insurance companies that this would not be a viable option. He argued that the billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs was going to be a problem. He also argued that it was not proper for MBIA, which was legally restricted from trading in CDS, to instead do it through a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an \\"orphaned subsidiary\\". Ackman bought CDS against MBIA corporate debt as a way to bet that it would crash. When MBIA did, in fact, crash as the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 climaxed, he sold the swaps for a large profit. Ackman reportedly attempted to warn regulators, rating agencies and investors about the bond insurers' high risk business models. The story of Ackman's battle with MBIA was turned into a book called Confidence Game (Wiley, 2010) by Bloomberg News reporter Christine Richard.Confidence Game by Christine S Richard, Bloomberg News, 2010 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009 according to the 13D filed with the SEC.http://www.marketfolly.com/2009/01/bill-ackmans- pershing-square-files-13d.html Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Files 13D on Borders, Covers MBIA Short In January 2017, MBIA UK was acquired by Assured Guaranty Ltd together with its subsidiary Assured Guaranty Corp.  Credit rating history  * April 4, 2008. Fitch Ratings cut MBIA's Insurance Corp rating to AA from AAA with a negative outlook. Fitch issued the new, lower rating even though MBIA had asked the ratings company, the month before, to stop assessing its credit worthiness. * June 4, 2008. Moody's Investors Service announced that it would review MBIA's rating for possible downgrade for the second time in the year. Four months before this announcement, on February 2008, Moody's had affirmed the AAA rating after MBIA raised $2.6 bn in capital and announced that would stop insuring structured finance securities for six months. * June 6, 2008.

History The station was opened in 1909 with the construction of the line from Wilmslow to Manchester London Road (now Piccadilly). It won numerous best-kept station garden awards in the 1940s and 1950s under stationmasters Mott, Hilton and Jackson. The garden is long abandoned but there were plans to uncover and restore some of it in spring 2011. A petition was created to seek a resumption of a morning commuter service to Manchester and daytime services to serve HMP Styal and National Trust Styal and local residents. The station is on Station Road 110 m from the edge of the National Trust Quarry Bank Mill/Styal Estate and 600 m from Styal Women's Prison and Young Offenders Institute. Services Styal enjoyed a half-hourly service in each direction until the mid-1990s. The construction of the airport rail link in 1993 saw services reduced with only 8 trains per day in each direction on Monday to Saturday. On Sundays there was a two hourly service in each direction. This was gradually reduced down to a skeletal Monday - Saturday service and no Sunday service. Improvements started to reappear from December 2008 following the West Coast upgrade programme. Since May 2018, a major timetable revamp has seen the station gain an hourly service 7 days a week in both directions. Northbound trains run to Piccadilly and then via and to Liverpool Lime Street, whilst southbound they either terminate at Wilmslow (evenings and Sundays) or continue to .

Released through Sanctuary Records, it is their only studio album to include both lead slide guitar player Derek Trucks and bass player Oteil Burbridge and marks the full-time return of guitar player Warren Haynes to the band. It was also their only studio album not to include original guitarist Dickey Betts. The CD was recorded live in the studio in New Jersey in December 2001 with lead vocal and minor overdubs recorded in early 2002. It was the first Allman recording co- produced by bandmember Haynes and Michael Barbiero. The album also marked the band's exit from Sony/Epic Records and was released jointly by Sanctuary Records and the band's Peach Records. The album was met with critical acclaim but very limited radio airplay. Wall Street Journal, Allmusic, and Rolling Stone magazine each gave the record positive reviews. The track \\"Instrumental Illness\\" garnered two Grammy Award nominations in 2003 and 2004, both in the Best Rock Instrumental category. Much of the record was written by the writing team of Gregg Allman and Warren Haynes. The band's history was not ignored: The structure of concert favorite \\"Desdemona\\" recalls that of \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\", while \\"High Cost of Low Living\\" features the guitarists quoting from other Allmans classics such as \\"Blue Sky\\", \\"Dreams\\", and \\"Mountain Jam\\".

During the 6 February 1934 crisis, the Francistes joined the other right-wing parties in the protests and riots in front of the Palais Bourbon provoked by the Stavisky Affair and accused of being intended as a coup d'√©tat. In 1936, the new Popular Front government banned his movement and all other other right-wing \\"leagues\\", fascist or otherwise, and Bucard was briefly imprisoned. His attempt to recreate the movement as a party (Parti franciste) in 1938 had little success, and it was outlawed as well. World War II After the Fall of France during World War II and the start of Nazi Germany's occupation of France and of Vichy France, Bucard's Parti was again active (from 1941), now as a collaborationist force. Bucard called upon his Francists to give whatever support they could to the Germans, including military intelligence and information on the Resistance.R√©quisitoire de M. le Procureur de la R√©publique Vassart in Quatre proc√®s de trahison devant la cour de justice de Paris(Paris: Les √©ditions de Paris, 1947), p. 53. His role in the period was, however, limited, as he was usually absent since he suffered from old wounds. He was still a co-founder of the L√©gion des volontaires fran√ßais contre le bolchevisme. After the Normandy landings, he argued that Francists should join the French Waffen SS or French/foreign units in the National Socialist Motor Corps or the Kriegsmarine.R√©quisitoire de M. le Procureur de la R√©publique Vassart in Quatre proc√®s de trahison devant la cour de justice de Paris (Paris: Les √©ditions de Paris, 1947), at 46. Death In 1946, after the German defeat, Bucard was sentenced to death for treason, and executed by firing squad a month later. At his trial, the prosecutor, Vassart, accused the Francists of routinely infiltrating French resistance groups to betray them to the Germans, of numerous crimes, including the murder of opponents and violently resisting French police even before the Liberation, and Bucard was blamed for the deaths of Soviet and French combatants because of his wholehearted support for the German occupier and his recruitment activities on behalf of the LVF, the Milice and the French Waffen SS.R√©quisitoire de M. le Procureur de la R√©publique Vassart in Quatre proc√®s de trahison devant la cour de justice de Paris (Paris: Les √©ditions de Paris, 1947) References 1895 births 1946 deaths People from Val-d'Oise French military personnel of World War I Executed politicians French fascists People affiliated with Action Fran√ßaise Executed French people Executed French collaborators with Nazi Germany People executed by France by firing squad French anti-communists Executed people from √éle-de- France ","title":"Marcel Bucard"},{"id":"4289431","text":"Using of ekkyklema. An ekkykl√™ma (; ; \\"roll-out machine\\") was a wheeled platform rolled out through a sk√™n√™ in ancient Greek theatre. It was used to bring interior scenes out into the sight of the audience.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30), Csapo and Slater (1994, 61, 270-273, 428), Davidson (2005, 201), Goldhill (2007, 9), Ley (2007, xiv-xv), and Rehm (1992, 37). Some ancient sources suggest that it may have been revolved or turned.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30) and Csapo and Slater (1994, 270-273). It is mainly used in tragedies for revealing dead bodies, such as Hippolytus' dying body in the final scene of Euripides' play of the same name, or the corpse of Eurydice draped over the household altar in Sophocles' Antigone.Rehm (1992, 67). Other uses include the revelation in Sophocles' Ajax of Ajax surrounded by the sheep he killed whilst under the delusion that they were Greeks.Rehm (1992, 69). The ekkykl√™ma is also used in comedy to parody the tragic effect. An example of this is in Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae when Agathon, portrayed as an effeminate, is wheeled onstage on an ekkykl√™ma to enhance the comic absurdity of the scene.

The name came to describe a loose network of autonomous collectives which shared common values and, in many cases, suppliers. Rosen, Laurel; McGrane, Sally. The Revolution Will Not Be Catered: How Bay Area food collectives of the \`60s set the stage for today's sophisticated tastes. San Francisco Chronicle. 8 March 2000. Many participants were seeking an alternative to supermarkets and became involved to obtain direct control of the quality and type of food they were sourcing, with a strong focus on wholefoods and organic produce. The adoption of the name 'food conspiracy' has been described by a participant as a \\"response to the Nixon-Agnew rhetoric of the time (which) had us all as communist conspirators against the state, the war and public morality.\\" Many leaflets circulated encouraging participation and a short how-to guide was published, 'The Great Food Buying Conspiracy', which offered a route map to sourcing fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese and organic dry goods. For fresh produce, monies would be pooled at a weekly order meeting and volunteers would then make an early morning visit to the wholesale vegetable market in Oakland or San Francisco to buy boxes and crates of organically grown fruits and vegetables. These would be returned to a central location, often a members' home, and made ready for collection later in the morning. In this way, members could achieve savings of up to 50%. Berkeley People's Office The Great Food Buying Conspiracy Mother Earth News. July 1970. A key feature of each Food Conspiracy group was staying small, a situation maintained by groups splitting when reaching a certain size rather than keep on growing. Thus, the initial Berkeley conspiracy, established in 1969, had become eight distinct groups within less than a year and, by 1974, there were 60 conspiracies in the city with around 2,000 members. The scale of the groups tended to help ensure a high level of direct involvement in the practical roles required for its operation. Indeed, The Food Conspiracy Cookbook (1974) argues that \\"Conspiracies only work if all who benefit take an active part in its working and decisions.\\" In addition to investigating potential suppliers, key operating tasks would include compiling a listing of available goods, collating member orders, receiving and recording payments, picking up produce from growers, hosting deliveries from wholesalers, checking-in deliveries and weighing and assembling individual orders ready for collection by members. A group would collectively decide whether or not to apply a modest fee or add-on to build a small surplus to use for shared benefit. Over time, some food conspiracies went on to formalise as food cooperatives, bulk and natural foods distributors or developed as larger buying groups with a paid organiser. However, the conspiracy model - then and now - seeks to provide food to members by accomplishing all needed tasks collectively, without paid staff or a store front presence. The trading name \\"Food Conspiracy\\" is used by a long- established wholefood co-op in Tucson, Arizona which originated in 1971 with local political activists who formed a buying club to address difficulties in finding natural and organic food. The following year, it opened a storefront and since 1974 has operated from its present home at 412 N. Fourth Avenue. Originally run as a workers' collective, it later developed toward a consumer cooperative model. Today it provides a full-service food market, open to the public and with approximately 1,800 member-owners.Ziniu Chen \\"Food Conspiracy Co-op: innovating for 40 years\\" Arizona Daily Star, 18th February 2011.

The village has a church, a grocery, a grade school, offices and elder care facilities. History The area around Roverud had little significance apart from the medieval Berger kirke which was constructed at the place with the same name (today Vestre Berger). In 1651 the church was relocated further north to Brandval. The road between Kongsvinger and Elverum went along the west side of the Glomma opposite Roverud until it reached Brandval, but that changed when a bridge was built at Kongsvinger in 1855, after which traffic also went up the east side of the river. Roverud became a central point for moving timber out of the Finnskogen region, The road from Svullrya over the mountains to Lunders√¶ter was constructed in the period 1866-1870, and shortly thereafter that road from Lunders√¶ter to √òyermoen on the Swedish border was completed. The arrival of the railroad breathed life into Roverud. The Roverud station on the Sol√∏rbanen was operational from 1893, and became one of the most important stations for handling of timber from the Finnskogen area. In 1936 Johannes Een came from Voss to Roverud. He established his firm, Br√∏drene Een A/S, there which produced his own patented lathwork shutters (forskalingslemmer). These shutters were a great success and were shipped throughout the country. Br√∏drene Een A/S then became one of the countries first producers of ready-made buildings.

A \\"cup of coffee\\" is a North American sports idiom for a short time spent by a minor league player at the major league level. The idea behind the term is that the player was only in the big leagues long enough to have a cup of coffee before being returned to the minors. The term originated in baseball and is extensively used in ice hockey, both of whose professional leagues (MLB and the NHL) utilize extensive farm systems; it is rarely used in basketball or American football since neither the NBA nor NFL have implemented a true farm system. One example of how this term is used in a sentence was during the 1996 film The Fan, in which Robert De Niro's character, a middle-aged former pitcher, says, \\"I was in the bigs for a cup of coffee myself until my arm went south.\\" Notable baseball cups of coffee One well-known variant of the cup of coffee is the September call-up, in which major-league clubs call up additional players to the big leagues from the minors on September 1. Before the 2020 season, active major-league rosters expanded from 25 players to 40; from 2020 forward, rosters will expand only from 26 to 28. This is by definition a cup of coffee, because September is the last month of the baseball season. Notable players who made their debuts in September include Baseball Hall of Fame players Mike Piazza (21 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers in its 1992 season),Mike Piazza Statistics Baseball- Reference.com and Ryne Sandberg (13 games with the 1981 Philadelphia Phillies).Ryne Sandberg Statistics Baseball-Reference.com Francisco Rodr√≠guez made his big-league debut by pitching 5 innings in September for the Anaheim Angels. Included on the Angels' postseason roster as a replacement for an injured player, he won five playoff games for Anaheim and helped them to a victory in the 2002 World Series, all before he won a regular-season game in the majors. Another famous baseball player who made his debut with a cup of coffee was Shoeless Joe Jackson, who played five games in 1908, five more in 1909, and twenty games in 1910 before finally making the bigs for good in 1911.Joe Jackson Statistics Baseball-Reference.com Players listed by Bill James as having had particularly impressive September call-up performances, and who had long careers, were Stan Musial, who hit .426 in 47 at bats in 1941; Fred Lynn, who hit .419 in 43 at bats in 1974; and J. D. Drew, who hit .417 with 5 home runs, a .972 slugging percentage, and a 1.436 on-base plus slugging percentage in 36 at bats for the 1998 St. Louis Cardinals. For many players, a cup of coffee is all they ever get in the major leagues. Notable cups of coffee include: *Walter Alston. Alston struck out in his only career at-bat for the 1936 St. Louis Cardinals. He later managed the Dodgers for 23 years in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, winning seven pennants and four World Series championships.

Gaedel, who was three feet, seven inches tall, was put on the roster of the 1951 St. Louis Browns by maverick owner Bill Veeck and sent into a game as a pinch-hitter on August 19. His uniform number was 1/8. The promotional stunt ended when pitcher Bob Cain, throwing at the smallest strike zone of all time, walked Gaedel on four pitches.

Graham was an outfielder who played two innings of one game on defense for the New York Giants in the 1905 season, neither making a putout nor getting a chance to bat. He would leave baseball and enjoy a long career as a doctor in Chisholm, Minnesota. His story was made famous when author W.P. Kinsella included it in his novel Shoeless Joe, which was then adapted into the hit movie Field of Dreams. (Graham's story is reported incorrectly in the movie and in other sources. Contrary to the film's assertion that Graham only played one half-inning, the Society for American Baseball Research discovered that he actually played two innings. Also, there was at least one base hit to the outfield while Graham was in the game, so he might have gotten the chance to field a ball in play.)Moonlight Graham Statistics Baseball-Reference.comField of Dreams Movie Site ‚Äì Shoeless Joe Jackson SABR : SABR-Zine  The Real Moonlight Graham *Adam Greenberg.

In 1884, the Union Association began operation, and is listed in many sources as a third major league. However, the league faced multiple problems, including an uneven distribution of talent (the league champion St. Louis Maroons went 94‚Äì19) and poor attendance in a country that suddenly was oversaturated with baseball teams. As the season wore on, teams began to fold, and the league scrounged around for replacements. The last of these replacements were the minor-league Saints (Apostles), an entire team that got a cup of coffee when they were invited into the Union Association. They played exactly nine games, all on the road, at the end of the season. The Saints went 2‚Äì6‚Äì1. Three other UA teams played 25 games or less, with the Saints playing the fewest.

Yount hurt his elbow while warming up and was removed from the game before ever throwing a pitch. He never made it back to the big leagues.

In ice hockey Players who play only a few games in the National Hockey League and spend the rest of their careers in the American Hockey League or other professional leagues are common in professional hockey. Goaltender Tyler Weiman's cup-of-coffee with the 2007‚Äì08 Colorado Avalanche included 16 minutes of playing time. A special case unique to the NHL is that of the emergency backup goaltender. NHL rules dictate that a team carry at least two goaltenders in every game; however, there are sometimes circumstances (such as a short-notice trade or a mid-game injury) when a team only has one goaltender on the roster and does not have time to call up another from the AHL. In such a case, any goaltender 22 years of age or older can be signed as a free agent to a short-term contract to fill the second goaltender position until a more permanent solution can be found. Since the other goaltender is certain to play the game in question and is not likely to be injured during game play, the backup goaltender is likely never to set foot on the ice during game play. Thus, players with little to no experience can sometimes have a short cup of coffee in the NHL (video technician Ryan Vinz is one such example; he was pulled out of the stands to fill the position for one game for the Buffalo Sabres in 2014 despite not playing goalie since high school). This position is typically held by an older, retired goaltender (Dwayne Roloson, Art≈´rs Irbe and Bob Essensa, for instance, served in those positions for games in the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season).Hoppe, Bill (November 19, 2014).

Betazole hydrochloride is known as gastramine and histalog. It has been used as a gastric stimulant to test for maximal production of gastric secretion activity. The test can be used in diagnosis of diseases such as Zollinger- Ellison syndrome where there is excess acid production, in this case driven by over production of gastrin. The volume of acid secretion is measured following administration of betazole, diagnosis being secretion greater than 60% of the maximal acid secretion following betazole stimulation. This procedure can lead to complications and should be avoided in subjects with coronary artery disease. It is also used in diagnosis of gastritis in association with a test for secretin activity. Betazole is used as a stimulant in preference to histamine because of its specificity for the H2 receptor and its advantage of not generating the undesirable side effects that histamine would induce. It therefore does not require concomitant use of antihistaminic compounds to block the actions of histamine at other histamine receptor types. It is used to test the effectiveness of H2 receptor blocking drugs such as nizatidine.

It originated in the late eighteenth century in the area of Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, as a result of cross-breeding when Norfolk Horn ewes were put to improved Southdown rams. It is a polled, black-faced breed, and is raised primarily for its meat. It has been exported to many countries, and is among the most numerous breeds of sheep worldwide.  History  Suffolks at a U.S. fair: Suffolks from show lines look markedly different from traditional production-type animals The Suffolk originated in the area surrounding Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk in the late eighteenth century, as a result of cross-breeding when Norfolk Horn ewes were put to improved Southdown rams. They were at first known as Blackfaces or Southdown-Norfolks; the first use of the name \\"Suffolk\\" for these sheep dates to 1797. In 1810 it was recognised as distinct breed, but was not known by the present name until 1859. A breed society, the English Suffolk Society, was formed in 1886; a flock-book published in the following year recorded some 15,000 ewes. By the end of the nineteenth century the Suffolk had displaced the Oxford Down as the principal terminal sire used on cross-bred ewes in Scotland. By the 1980s breed numbers in the United Kingdom had risen to some 500,000 head, but later fell. The Suffolk has been exported to many countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Kenya, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, and the United States, and has become one of the most numerous sheep breeds in the world. It was introduced to the USA in 1888 by one G.B. Streeter of Chazy, New York. A large and long-legged sub-type has developed there; it is fast-growing, but the carcase is of lower quality.  Characteristics  The Suffolks are a common breed of domestic sheep. They are polled, and have black open faces along with black legs and white-woolled bodies. Suffolks are considered a large breed of sheep, their size and colouring originates from their Southdown heritage. Their large frame and muscular bodies make them an ideal breed for meat production, however; they are also good for wool production as well. They are hardy sheep, a trait originating from their Norfolk Horn heritage. Suffolk rams are commonly used as a terminal sire on cross-bred ewes due to their ability to produce off-spring with excellent growth and carcass traits. Spider lamb syndrome is most common in the Suffolk breed.Congenital and Inherited Anomalies of the Musculoskeletal System in Sheep: Spider lamb syndrome, at the Merck Veterinary Manual; published December 2013; retrieved 28 December 2013 References External links *English website about Suffolk Sheep *English website about Suffolk Sheep Sheep breeds Sheep breeds originating in England ","title":"Suffolk sheep"},{"id":"4289544","text":"St. John's Chapel may refer to: ;in England * St John's Chapel, London * St John's Chapel, Bedford Row - another London church * St John's Chapel, County Durham - a village in County Durham * St John's College Chapel, Cambridge ;in Singapore *St. John's Chapel, Singapore - a church located within St. Margaret's Secondary School in Farrer Road ;in the United States *St. John's Chapel (New York City), a demolished nineteenth-century Episcopal church *St. John Chapel (Columbus, Georgia), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia *St. John's Chapel of St. Michael's Parish, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland *Episcopal Church of the Advent / St. John's Chapel, an Episcopal church in Cape May, New Jersey See also *St. John the Baptist Church (disambiguation) *St. John's Cathedral (disambiguation) *St. John's Church (disambiguation) *St. John's Episcopal Church (disambiguation) *St. John the Evangelist Church (disambiguation) ","title":"St. John's Chapel"},{"id":"4289554","text":"European Top 20 was a disk magazine and scene chart for the Commodore Amiga published by the demo scene group Equinox.Freax: the brief history of the demoscene, Volym 1, page 109 The first issue was published in July 1992 and the last (number 7) in July 1993.Exotica Disk mags Po√ºet  References   External links  *Download all European Top 20 issues Commodore International Defunct computer magazines Disk magazines Magazines established in 1992 Magazines disestablished in 1993 ","title":"European Top 20"},{"id":"4289560","text":"Bishop Amat Memorial High School is a co-ed Catholic high school serving the San Gabriel Valley in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and was founded in 1957.

The diocese was created in 1991. The current Archbishop and Metropolitan is Gennadios Zervos.  History  Saint George of the Greeks\\" in Venice Archbishop Gennadios Zervos After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, many areas of Italy, remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) until the Longobard and Norman conquest in the 11th century. In 1054, the Great Schism divided the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox churches. The Orthodox bishops were replaced by Roman Catholic bishops, and many Orthodox churches, monasteries, convents, and priories were suppressed or destroyed. By 1200 this division had essentially been realized in Italy by the gradual appointment by the Longobard and Norman kings of Roman Catholic bishops. The Italo-Byzantine Monastery of St Mary of Grottaferrata, 20 kilometers south of Rome, was founded by Saint Nilus the Younger in 1004, fifty years before the division between the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Church, and remains to this day an enclave of Byzantine tradition under the Roman jurisdiction. The coming of Albanian and Greek Orthodox refugees to Southern Italy due to Ottoman conquests in the latter portion of the 1500s contributed to a brief revival of Orthodoxy and Greek culture. Soon the new arrivals were assimilated to the Catholic Church, preserving the Byzantine Rite and some of their autonomy within the Eastern-rite Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. After the fall of Constantinople, many Greeks sought refuge in Italy and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople appointed a series of Metropolitans, who resided in Venice from 1537 to 1797. But it was not until 1539 that the Greek community of Venice was authorised to begin building the church of San Giorgio dei Greci which still stands in the centre of the city on the canal known as the . The church was completed in 1573 and is the oldest of the churches of the Greek diaspora in western Europe. In 1557, Venice's Greek community had nominated Pachomios, bishop of Zante and Cephalonia, to act in their church as bishop, which he apparently did for one year only. In 1577 a Greek Orthodox archbishop resided in Venice who was recognized him as the religious head of the Greek Orthodox community in Venice, though with the non-Venetian title of Archbishop of Philadelphia. From the Napoleonic era until 1922 the Orthodox communities in Italy remained disorganized and dependent upon visiting priests and bishops. Since 1991 the Greek Orthodox are under the authority of the Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy by an act of the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople (Ecumenical Patriarchate). The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople re-organized the Orthodox churches in Italy: initially under the Exarchate of the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain (1922‚Äì1963), then under the Archbishop of Austria and Exarch of Hungary (1963‚Äì1991), and finally under the newly created Archdiocese of Italy and Exarchate of Southern Europe in 1991, with its Metropolitan See in Venice.

In total, he made 112 appearances for Arsenal, scoring 27 goals, despite manager Billy Wright's policy of usually employing only one winger on the pitch.

It lies between the busy thoroughfares of Jan Smuts Avenue and Oxford Road, and is bordered to one side by the Johannesburg Zoo. History The suburb was first surveyed on land called Sachsenwald, now known as Saxonwold, in 1908. The name of the suburb is derived from the Sachsenwald plantation. Forest Town is well known as the scene of a high profile police raid, the Forest Town raid, on a gay party in 1966, which triggered a moral panic and led to the Apartheid government passing the Immorality Amendment Bill of 1967. The Bill criminalised all sexual activity between men, as well as extending the legislation to include lesbians. Following South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994, all discriminatory legislation was repealed. In 2005, the Forest Town home of Jacob Zuma, at that time deputy president of South Africa, was raided by the Scorpions in order to obtain documents for his corruption trial. Jacob Zuma, now a former president of South Africa, is currently under investigation for fraud, money laundering, racketeering, and a host of other criminal charges.

The Three Pashas were largely responsible for the Empire's entry into World War I in 1914 and also largely responsible for the death of over one million Armenians in the Armenian genocide. All three met violent deaths after the war - Talaat and Djemal were assassinated, while Enver died leading the Basmachi Revolt near Dushanbe, present-day Tajikistan. However, after their deaths, Talaat and Enver's remains have been reburied at the Monument of Liberty in Istanbul and many of Turkey's streets have been renamed in their honour. Legacy The front page of the Ottoman newspaper ƒ∞kdam on 4 November 1918 after the Three Pashas fled the country following World War I. Showing left to right Djemal Pasha; Talaat Pasha; Enver Pasha. Western scholars hold that after the 1913 Ottoman coup d'√©tat, these three men became the de facto rulers of the Ottoman Empire until its dissolution following World War I.Emin, 310; Kayali, 195 They were members of the Committee of Union and Progress,Derogy, 332; Kayali, 195 a progressive organization that they eventually came to control and transform into a primarily Pan-Turkist political party,Allen, 614. The Three Pashas were the principal players in the Ottoman‚ÄìGerman Alliance and the Ottoman Empire's entry into World War I on the side of the Central Powers. One of the three, Ahmed Djemal, was opposed to an alliance with Germany, and French and Russian diplomacy attempted to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war; but Germany was agitating for a commitment. Finally, on 29 October, the point of no return was reached when Admiral Wilhelm Souchon took , , and a squadron of Ottoman warships into the Black Sea (see pursuit of Goeben and Breslau) and raided the Russian ports of Odessa, Sevastopol, and Theodosia. It was claimed that Ahmed Djemal agreed in early October 1914 to authorize Admiral Souchon to launch a pre-emptive strike. Ismail Enver had only once taken the control of any military activity (Battle of Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü), and left the Third Army in ruins. The First Suez Offensive and Arab Revolt are Ahmed Djemal's most significant failures. =Involvement in Armenian Genocide= As de facto rulers, the Three Pashas have been considered the masterminds behind the Armenian Genocide. After the war the three were put on trial (in their absence) and sentenced to death, although the sentences were not carried out. Talaat and Djemal were assassinated in exile in 1921 and 1922 by Armenians; Enver died in an ambush by Armenians in Tajikistan in 1922 while trying to raise a Muslim anti-Russian insurrection. Enver charged the Armenian assassins, which resulted in his death. =Reputation in the Republic of Turkey= After World War I and the ensuing Turkish War of Independence, much of the population of the newly established Republic of Turkey as well its founder Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk widely criticized the Three Pashas for having caused the Ottoman Empire's entrance into World War I, and the subsequent collapse of the state. As early as 1912, Atat√ºrk (then just Mustafa Kemal) had severed his ties to the Three Pashas' Committee of Union and Progress, dissatisfied with the direction that they had taken the party, as well as developing a rivalry with Enver Pasha. Although Enver Pasha later attempted to join the Turkish War of Independence, the Ankara government under Atat√ºrk blocked his return to Turkey and his efforts to join the war effort.

Start of career and military service Heine was the son of the German doctor and orthopaedist Jakob Heine, who became known as the discoverer of Poliomyelitis. He studied medicine in T√ºbingen and W√ºrzburg and received his doctor degree in 1861. After assisting his father in his orthopaedic institution he visited several European countries and stayed in Paris, London, Glasgow and Dublin. He reported on his experiences in English hospitals in the 'Journal of the W√ºrttembergian Medical Association' ('Correspondenzblatt des W√ºrttembergischen √Ñrztlichen Vereins'). In 1864 he volunteered in the Second war of Schleswig as a military surgeon. He wrote about his experiences in military surgery in a book published in 1866. He was decorated for his merits both from the Prussian and the Austrian government. =Professor in Heidelberg und Innsbruck (1865‚Äì1873)= In 1864/65 Heine went to Berlin and worked with well-known physicians like Rudolf Virchow. The following year he was an assistant doctor in Heidelberg and qualified as professor. He succeeded his teacher Karl Otto Weber as professor and director of the surgical hospital. In 1869 Heine took up the job of director of the surgical hospital at the University of Innsbruck. In the Franco-Prussian War Heine once more worked as a military surgeon and was highly decorated. =Head of Hospital and president of the doctors' fraternity in Prague (1873‚Äì1877)= Heine's successful work in Innsbruck induced the Austrian government to start a similar project in Prague. From 1873 onwards Heine established a second surgical hospital as an exemplary institute of European rank. At the same time he engaged in improving the hygienic situation and the water supply of the city. Heine was elected president of the German medical fraternity in January 1877. In 1876 he had become a citizen of Austria and was given a peerage. In the summer of 1877 he surprisingly came down with a diphtheritic angina and died at his parents' home in Cannstatt.

Newswatch's weekly print run can be as high as 100,000 copies. History and profile Newswatch was formed by Nigerian journalists Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu, Dan Agbese and Yakubu Mohammed in 1984, and the first edition was distributed on 28 January 1985. A 1989 description of the magazine said it \\"changed the format of print journalism in Nigeria [and] introduced bold, investigative formats to news reporting in Nigeria\\". However, in the first few months of the administration of General Ibrahim Babangida, who took power in August 1985, the magazine was shamelessly flattering. It printed his face on the cover four times and even criticized \\"anyone who attempted to make life unpleasant for Babangida\\". Giwa, the first editor-in- chief of Newswatch, was killed by a mail bomb in his home on 19 October 1986. The magazine was forced to shut down for six months from April 1987 by the Babangida administration for publishing information from what seemed to be a harmless government White Paper. Newswatch named Babangida \\"Man of the Year\\" (1989), and Babangida appointed Alex Akinyele, a Newswatch Director, as his information minister. In June 1992 the government expelled a journalist from the Financial Times who had written an article criticizing government use of oil money. Although papers such as Concord and The Guardian were critical, Newswatch remained silent. As of 1996 the magazine was said to have a circulation of 150,000 copies in Africa, Europe and North America. Prominent directors included Chief Tony Momoh, Otunba Mike Adenuga and Chief Alex Akinyele. In December 2010 the magazine celebrated its 25th anniversary at a ceremony in Lagos. The magazine gave out a book Jogging in the Jungle: The Newswatch Story to attendees. Former Ogun State Governor Aremo Olusegun Osoba presided as chairman.

History Emmarentia lies on land that once made up the Braamfontein Farm, one of many large farms that make what is Johannesburg and its suburbs. The land was bought in 1886 by Lourens Geldenhuys for its mining rights as it was hoped that the Confidence Reef would extend into his farm but it did not. Land remained as a farm and by 1891 it was divided, along what is now Orange Road, between his son's Frans and Louw where the brothers had already built two farm houses. Frans' farmhouse still exists as the clubhouse at the Marks Park Sports Club and Louw's which exists close by at 14 Greenhill Road. After the Second Boer War, in which Louw Geldenhuys and his brother had taken part of as members of the Krugersdorp Commando, he decided to help some landless and unemployed Boers war veterans. He used them to construct a stone and earth dam from blocks of stone from the Melville Koppies behind the farm and cost ¬£12,000. The dam was built over the Westdene spruit which is a tributary of the larger Braamfontein Spruit. The dam was then named after his wife Emmarentia Margaretha Botha. A hundred of these workers were then settled in 14 irrigated smallholdings on 145 morgens of the farm in what are now the suburbs of Emmarentia, Linden and Greenside where they grew fruits and vegetables with rent based on a third of the profits of the sale of the produce. Louw died in 1929 and his wife Emmarentia would begin to sell parts of the farm that became the suburbs Greenside in 1931, and Emmarentia on 28 April 1937, named after her and in 1941, Emmarentia Extension. In 1933, 13 hectares of the farm were donated to the City of Johannesburg for parks and recreation, and after further pieces of land were acquired, became the Jan van Riebeeck Park (1952) and the Johannesburg Botanical Garden (1964), Emmarentia Dam (1939), the Marks Park Sports Club (1951) and West Park Cemetery (1942). In 1938, Emmarentia Geldenhuys died and was buried at the family cemetery in Hill Road. The small cemetery still exists with 77 graves in the small cemetery with other names such as Swanepoel, Steyn, Ayres, Hopley and McGrath possibly the smallholding farmers Louw Geldenhuys had helped out.

It was released on November 6, 2001, through Metal Blade Records. According to an interview with Dave Brockie, it was originally supposed to be released on September 11, 2001, but Metal Blade would not release it until November. According to Slave Pit Inc., it was not finished. According to other official sources, they did not even start recording the album until July, and the Dave Brockie Experience had a tour in September. Overview Violence Has Arrived re-attains the brutal focus of the band's earlier albums. It has more of a thrash metal sound than any of their previous albums. It is similar to Scumdogs of the Universe, in that Dave Brockie was the dominant voice of the band again, and the theme is centered on generalized carnage. Gwar takes on more \\"medieval\\" themes this time, such as torture (\\"The Wheel\\") and conjures up some truly ugly imagery in songs such as \\"Licksore\\", \\"Beauteous Rot\\", \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" and \\"The Apes of Wrath\\". \\"Biledriver\\" is about a fluid- spewing cannon, which can be seen in the \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" video and on tour. The cannon itself has now become something of a staple at their live shows. \\"The Song of Words\\", inspired by the 11th-century French epic poem The Song Of Roland, is the only song with the voices of Jizmak Da Gusha (though Jizmak would later sing part of \\"El Presidente\\" on the album The Blood of Gods) and Flattus Maximus (though Maximus did sing lead vocals on the 2009 album Lust in Space), though neither of them are really singing. Nobody is really singing on the song (Beefcake the Mighty, Balsac the Jaws of Death and Oderus Urungus all speak, as opposed to sing - appropriately for a \\"Song of Words\\"). Technically, it is tied with \\"Jiggle The Handle\\" for the most vocalists on a Gwar song, though Maximus and Da Gusha each have five words. Indeed, the entire album has a narrative feel to it. Though touching on the \\"Gwar lore\\" that began on Hell-O, Violence Has Arrived follows no individual story. This was, in large part, because of the disappointing reaction to We Kill Everything by the band, and due to Slave Pit Inc.'s diminished ranks - the previous year Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) and Hunter Jackson (Techno Destructo) had left, as well as \\"slave\\" Davis Bradley (though retired from touring for spinal reasons, he did build the Biledriver). The cover artwork was created by the Games Workshop illustrator Adrian Smith. There are two versions of the illustration used for the cover. That on the album cover shows Oderus with a codpiece and the poster in the booklet has the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu uncovered. Departures Violence Has Arrived was Casey Orr's last Gwar album before he took an extended leave from the band. It is also the only Gwar album with Zach Blair on guitar. Blair left in early 2002, while Orr left shortly before the Halloween 2002 tour. Orr has since returned to the fold, replacing Todd Evans in April 2008. \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" is the only video from this album, and shows Orr in the role of Beefcake the Mighty for the last time before he left. It is also the final album on Metal Blade Records until 2009. In a 2004 interview, Beefcake the Mighty (then portrayed by Todd Evans) said that the reason for the switch was because Metal Blade had some European distribution problems, and they were not being fixed. However, Brockie has also said that their departure was a result of them being denied payments owed to them for a number of years, due to the poor sales of the previous two albums, which also led to cutting off the Europe deal. The band returned to Metal Blade Records for their 2009 release, Lust in Space, which is also their first album since reuniting with the bass guitarist Casey Orr. \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" is the only song on Violence Has Arrived with a music video, and is found only on the Ultimate Video Gwarchive DVD, released at the end of 2002. The DVD features commentary from Brockie, Scott Krahl, Matt Maguire, Bob Gorman and Michael Derks, with special commentary from Mike Bonner for the video to \\"The Road Behind\\". The video is Casey Orr's final video. Zach Blair had left just prior to recording, so fill-in Flattus Tim Harriss (who portrayed Flattus on their previous album) had to wear the Violence Has Arrived-era Flattus costume for the video. The spelling for \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" is incorrect - the word \\"corruptor\\" does not have the letter e. It is corrected on the back cover of Live from Mt. Fuji. The video has it with the Violence Has Arrived spelling. \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" was one of the two songs from this album to appear on Live From Mt. Fuji, along with \\"Biledriver\\". Both are favorite concert songs, by fans and band alike. Reaction Violence Has Arrived was an album that the band enjoyed recording - \\"Everyone was ecstatic when Gwar put out ‚ÄúViolence Has Arrived‚Äù in 2001 ‚Äî it marked Gwar‚Äôs triumphant return to metal, and the world breathed a collective sigh of relief that we hadn‚Äôt put out another ‚ÄúWe Kill Everything‚Äù\\" (from a March 23, 2006, news entry at gwar.net) - and is still featured heavily on tour, be it in song (\\"Biledriver\\" is often used to end shows) or in theme (storyless carnage has been a big part of Gwar's tours in the past few years, though that changed in fall 2006, with the tour supporting Beyond Hell). Violence Has Arrived was also a more successful album in terms of album sales, which had been on the decline since Ragnar√∂k. When asked about his favorite Gwar album to listen to, Don Drakulich (Sleazy P. Martini) named this album.

Mouvement franciste reached of membership of 10,000 and was financed by the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini. Its members were deemed the francistes or Chemises bleues (Blueshirts), and gave the Roman salute (a paramilitary character that was mirrored in France by Fran√ßois Coty's Solidarit√© Fran√ßaise). It took part in the Paris riots of 6 February 1934 during which the entire far right (from Action Fran√ßaise to Croix-de-Feu) protested the implications of the Stavisky Affair and possibly attempted to topple √âdouard Daladier's government. It incorporated the Solidarit√© fran√ßaise after Coty's death later in the same year. All of the movements that participated in the 6 February riots were outlawed in 1936, when L√©on Blum's Popular Front government passed new legislation on the matter. After a failed attempt in 1938, the movement was refounded as a political party (Parti franciste) in 1941, after France had been overrun by Nazi Germany. Together with Jacques Doriot's Parti Populaire Fran√ßais and Marcel D√©at's Rassemblement National Populaire, the francistes were the main collaborators of the Nazi occupiers and Vichy France. The Parti Franciste did not survive the end of World War II, and was considered treasonous.  Creation  Francisme was created in August-September 1933 by Marcel Bucard, a former seminarian and war hero, who had already participated in a number of nationalist and proto- fascist movements: French Action, Faisceau, French Solidarity and Croix de Feu. The official creation takes place on 29 September 1933 at 11 pm, during a ceremony organized at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Marcel Bucard whilst delivering a speech at the ceremony states that he wants: \\"(...) to found a movement of revolutionary action whose aim is to conquer the power\\" and \\"to stop the race to the abyss\\".https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book- search/title/bucard-francisme/author/alain-deniel/ The movement was heavily inspired by Mussolini's National Fascist Party and so received significant funding and support from the Italian fascist movement. In response to this Bucard wrote, \\"Our Francism is to France what Fascism is to Italy\\".  Collaboration with the Germans  During the Occupation, the Franciste Movement was relaunched and along with Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF) and Marcel D√©at's National Popular Rally (RNP) is one of the most notable political movement to collaborate with the occupying German authorities. . On May 5, 1941, Marcel Bucard and Paul Guiraud (associate of philosophy, son of Jean Guiraud, editor-in-chief of La Croix ) relaunched Francisme. Paul Guiraud attempted to give the movement a more \\"socialist\\" look. Similarly, Bucard defended the General Confederation of Labour (dissolved during the occupation) and criticized the Labor Charter elaborated by the Vichy regime, which he considered not socialist enough. Despite these attempts to appeal to the working class the movement still received the majority of its support from the far- right.https://www.amazon.fr/collaborateurs-1940-1945-Pascal-Ory/dp/2020054272 The movement, like the other collaboration movements, failed to become a mass movement. At its peak (summer 1943), according to historian duo Lambert-Le Marec it had some 5,500 members (4,000 in the provinces and 1,500 in the Paris region) or according to other sources reach a maximum of 8,000 members.http://www.chire.fr/A-137943-vichy-1940-1944-organisation-et- mouvements.aspx The newspaper Le Franciste reached a maximum circulation during the war of 20,000 copies. In 1943, it participated in a collaborationist front, dominated by the National Popular Rally, in an attempt to unify with other fascist movements. Like the other parties, the Franciste Movement was heavily collaborationist (creation of the Task Forces to fight against resistance was one such example). Many of its members participated in anti-Semitic and anti-communist operations as well as its members joining the Milice which actively targeted the French Resistance.https://www.cairn.info/revue-histoire-de-la- justice-2019-1-page-229.html Particularly well established in the departments of Seine-et-Oise and Morbihan where locals were involved in incidents of rare violence. On July 4, 1944, a policeman was killed and another injured by the bodyguards of Bucard during an altercation. Bucard is then imprisoned however released on July 29, just in time to flee to Germany on August 12 with the other Francists as the Allies launch Operation Overlord. Bucard was finally arrested, tried and sentenced to death on February 21, 1946, shot on March 19 at Fort Chatillon, near Paris. Facing the pole, he refused to wear a headband and once attached, shouted \\"Qui vive? La France!\\" before the salvo struck him dead. His family were denied a request that his body be deposited in the family vault and Marcel Bucard was buried in the Parisian cemetery of Thiais, in the current department of Val-de-Marne.

There were further fairs in the same tradition most years until the end of the 1980s. The East Anglian Fairs began with the Barsham Medieval Faire in 1972, and developed into a significant feature of rural counterculture in Britain, drawing on aspects of pop festival culture, the reinvention of traditional rural or nomadic seasonal gatherings, and a back-to-the-land early green ethos. The voluntary organisers worked under the name of the East Anglian Arts Trust (EAAT). Barsham Faire ran annually on the August Bank Holiday until 1976. In 1976 EAAT revived the Bungay May Horse Fair, which was also held in 1977. An ad hoc group of fair organisers and crew participated in the Eye Show in August 1977. This led to the formation, in the winter of 1977/1978, of Albion Fairs. Some events used the spelling Fayre or Faire. In the 1990s and 2000s a fairly vibrant if not quite as accessible successor to the Fairs in the region was organised as the mostly biennial gatherings of Dance Camp East.

Founded in 1875 as Dhaka Medical School, it was renamed in 1962 in honor of Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Salimullah, a former Nawab of Dhaka, politician, and patron of education. The school includes Mitford Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals in Bangladesh. History Sir Salimullah Medical College was established in 1961 as Dhaka Medical School in the old part of the capital city, Dhaka. Mitford Hospital was a part of the school. Donations from sixteen local nawabs and philanthropists financed the erection of a dedicated medical school building in 1889. Mitford Hospital in 1904 The school was made a medical college in 1962. To acknowledge the contributions of the nawabs, the college was named after Nawab Sir Salimullah (1871‚Äì1915). Until 1957 the License of Medical Faculty (LMF) degree was offered by this college. During 1963‚Äì1972 condensed courses for the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) degree were offered. In 1972 the school was upgraded as a full- fledged medical college and the first MBBS students enrolled in 1973. The civil surgeon of Dhaka was in charge of both the college and the hospital until 1974, when a principal and a superintendent were appointed for the above institutions. The superintendent was later (1984) made the director of the hospital. Campus It is located at Mitford Road, Babubazar, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Le√£o was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1913. He began studying medicine at the University of S√£o Paulo, but had to interrupt it due to a bout of tuberculosis. Under the influence of his uncle, Antonio Pacheco Le√£o, who was the director of the Botanical Gardens of Rio de Janeiro, he decided instead to follow a research career and went to the United States to study further. There he obtained a masters (1942) and a doctorate (1943) in physiology at the Harvard Medical School, with an experimental investigation of epilepsy in the cerebral cortex of rabbits. In collaboration with his supervisors, Arturo Rosenblueth and Hallowell Davis, he analyzed the cycle of excitability of cortex neurons (nerve cells) after the convulsive phenomena, and was the first to identify the important phenomenon of a decrease of the excitability, spread in increasing circles around the initial focus, which he named spreading depression. The phenomenon was named Le√£o's wave and brought him great attention after this work was published in 1944 in one of the main neurophysiology journals. Upon returning to Brazil, he continued his experiments with spreading depression, in the department of physiology of the medical school of the University of Brazil (presently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). Already in 1947 he published his first international paper on a research developed entirely in his new Brazilian lab, which was put together with great difficulty due to the lack of resources and specialized equipment. Some of his lifelong colleagues, such as Dr. Hiss Martins Ferreira joined him at that time. In the intervening years he added a great number of his students to the group, such as Drs. Romualdo Jos√© do Carmo, Gilberto de Oliveira Castro and others. Together with Prof. Carlos Chagas Filho (1910‚Äì2000), another influential neurophysiologist and biophysicist, Dr. Le√£o founded the Laboratory of Biophysics, which later became the world-famous Institute of Biophysics, a great cradle of two generations of Brazilian scientists and a center of excellence in neurophysiological research. Dr. Le√£o was for 15 years the president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and a member of the scientific council of the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) for many years. He died of respiratory failure when he was 79 years old, in Rio de Janeiro. References *Le√£o AAP. Spreading depression of activity in the cerebral cortex.

At the time, abortion was illegal in New York. The practice of abortion‚Äîthe termination of a pregnancy‚Äîhas been known since ancient history. Various methods have been used to perform or attempt an abortion, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques. Abortion laws and their enforcement have fluctuated through various eras. In many western countries during the 20th century abortion- rights movements were successful in having abortion bans repealed. While abortion remains legal in most of the West, this legality is regularly challenged by anti-abortion groups. Premodern era Bas relief at Angkor Wat, , depicting a demon performing an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld. The Vedic and smrti laws of India reflected a concern with preserving the male seed of the three upper castes; and the religious courts imposed various penances for the woman or excommunication for a priest who provided an abortion. In the epic Ramayana, there is description that the practice of abortion was being done by the surgeons or barbers in those days.Valmiki Ramayana Sunderkand 28th Sarga 6th Shlok https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=5&language;=dv&field;_sarga_value=28 The only evidence of the death penalty being mandated for abortion in the ancient laws is found in Assyrian Law, in the Code of Assura, c. 1075 BCE; Ancient History Sourcebook: The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BC and this is imposed only on a woman who procures an abortion against her husband's wishes. The first recorded evidence of induced abortion is from the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus in 1550 BCE. Many of the methods employed in early cultures were non- surgical. Physical activities such as: strenuous labor, climbing, paddling, weightlifting, or diving were a common technique. Others included the use of irritant leaves, fasting, bloodletting, pouring hot water onto the abdomen, and lying on a heated coconut shell. In virtually all cultures, abortion techniques developed through observation, adaptation of obstetrical methods, and transculturation. Physical means of inducing abortion, including battery, exercise, and tightening the girdle were still often used as late as the Early Modern Period among English women. Archaeological discoveries indicate early surgical attempts at the extraction of a fetus; however, such methods are not believed to have been common, given the infrequency with which they are mentioned in ancient medical texts. An 8th-century Sanskrit text instructs women wishing to induce an abortion to sit over a pot of steam or stewed onions. The technique of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant abdomen, has been practiced in Southeast Asia for centuries. One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, dated , depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld. Japanese documents show records of induced abortion from as early as the 12th century. It became much more prevalent during the Edo period, especially among the peasant class, who were hit hardest by the recurrent famines and high taxation of the age. Statues of the Boddhisattva Jizo, erected in memory of an abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or young childhood death, began appearing at least as early as 1710 at a temple in Yokohama (see religion and abortion). The native MƒÅori people of New Zealand colonisation terminated pregnancies via miscarriage-inducing drugs, ceremonial methods, and girding of the abdomen with a restrictive belt. Another source claims that the MƒÅori people did not practice abortion, for fear of Makutu, but did attempt abortion through the artificial induction of premature labor. =Greco-Roman world= Cyrenian coin with an image of silphium, a contraceptive plant, but could also have been an abortifacient. Much of what is known about the methods and practice of abortion in Greek and Roman history comes from early classical texts. Abortion, as a gynecological procedure, was primarily the province of women who were either midwives or well-informed laypeople. In his Theaetetus, Plato mentions a midwife's ability to induce abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.Plato (1921) []. \\"149d\\". Theaetetus. in Harold North Fowler. Plato in Twelve Volumes. 12. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. It is thought unlikely that abortion was punished in Ancient Greece. However, a fragment attributed to the poet Lysias \\"suggests that abortion was a crime in Athens against the husband, if his wife was pregnant when he died, since his unborn child could have claimed the estate. The ancient Greeks relied upon the herb silphium as an abortifacient and contraceptive. The plant, as the chief export of Cyrene, was driven to extinction, but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the family Apiaceae. Silphium was so central to the Cyrenian economy that most of its coins were embossed with an image of the plant.Pliny, XXII, Ch. 49 Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 CE) cited the refined oil of common rue as a potent abortifacient. Serenus Sammonicus wrote of a concoction which consisted of rue, egg, and dill. Soranus, Dioscorides, Oribasius also detailed this application of the plant. Modern scientific studies have confirmed that rue indeed contains three abortive compounds. Birthwort, a herb used to ease childbirth, was also used to induce abortion. Galen included it in a potion formula in de Antidotis, while Dioscorides said it could be administered by mouth, or in the form of a vaginal pessary also containing pepper and myrrh. The Greek playwright Aristophanes noted the abortifacient property of pennyroyal in 421 BCE, through a humorous reference in his comedy, Peace. Hippocrates (c. 460 ‚Äì c. 370 BCE), the Greek physician, would advise a prostitute who became pregnant to jump up and down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, so as to induce miscarriage. Other writings attributed to him describe instruments fashioned to dilate the cervix and curette inside of the uterus. Soranus, a 2nd-century Greek physician, prescribed diuretics, emmenagogues, enemas, fasting, and bloodletting as safe abortion methods, although he advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage, due to the risk of organ perforation. He also advised women wishing to abort their pregnancies to engage in energetic walking, carrying heavy objects, riding animals, and jumping so that the woman's heels were to touch her buttocks with each jump, which he described as the \\"Lacedaemonian Leap\\".Soranus. Gynaecology. 1.59‚Äì65. He also offered a number of recipes for herbal baths, rubs, and pessaries. In De Materia Medica Libri Quinque, the Greek pharmacologist Dioscorides listed the ingredients of a draught called \\"abortion wine\\"‚Äì hellebore, squirting cucumber, and scammony‚Äì but failed to provide the precise manner in which it was to be prepared. Hellebore, in particular, is known to be abortifacient. Tertullian, a 2nd- and 3rd-century Christian theologian, described surgical implements which were used in a procedure similar to the modern dilation and evacuation. One tool had a \\"nicely adjusted flexible frame\\" used for dilation, an \\"annular blade\\" used to curette, and a \\"blunted or covered hook\\" used for extraction. The other was a \\"copper needle or spike\\". He attributed ownership of such items to Hippocrates, Asclepiades, Erasistratus, Herophilus, and Soranus.Tertullian (1885) []. \\"Tertullian Refutes, Physiologically, the Notion that the Soul is Introduced After Birth\\". A Treatise on the Soul. in Philip Schaff. Ante-Nicene Fathers. 3. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark. Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a 1st-century Roman encyclopedist, offered an extremely detailed account of a procedure to extract an already-dead fetus in his only surviving work, De Medicina. In Book 9 of Refutation of all Heresies, Hippolytus of Rome, another Christian theologian of the 3rd century, wrote of women tightly binding themselves around the middle so as to \\"expel what was being conceived\\".Hippolytus (). \\"The Personal History of Callistus; His Occupation ...\\". Refutation of all Heresies. in Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. Ante-Nicene Fathers. 5. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark. =Natural abortifacients= Art from a 13th-century illuminated manuscript features a herbalist preparing a concoction containing pennyroyal for a woman. Botanical preparations reputed to be abortifacient were common in classical literature and folk medicine. Such folk remedies, however, varied in effectiveness and were not without the risk of adverse effects. Some of the herbs used at times to terminate pregnancy are poisonous. A list of plants which cause abortion was provided in De viribus herbarum, an 11th-century herbal written in the form of a poem, the authorship of which is incorrectly attributed to Aemilius Macer. Among them were rue, Italian catnip, savory, sage, soapwort, cyperus, white and black hellebore, and pennyroyal. Physicians in the Islamic world during the medieval period documented the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence. King's American Dispensatory of 1898 recommended a mixture of brewer's yeast and pennyroyal tea as \\"a safe and certain abortive\\". Pennyroyal has been known to cause complications when used as an abortifacient. In 1978 a pregnant woman from Colorado died after consuming 2 tablespoonfuls of pennyroyal essential oilPennyroyal poisoningColorado death which is known to be toxic. In 1994 a pregnant woman, unaware of an ectopic pregnancy that needed immediate medical care, drank a tea containing pennyroyal extract to induce abortion without medical help. She later died as a result of the untreated ectopic pregnancy, mistaking the symptoms for the abortifacient working. For thousands of years, tansy has been taken in early pregnancy to restore menstruation. (Catamenia is blood or other material discharged from the uterus during menstruation.) It was first documented as an emmenagogue in St. Hildegard of Bingen's De simplicis medicinae. A variety of juniper, known as savin, was mentioned frequently in European writings. In one case in England, a rector from Essex was said to have procured it for a woman he had impregnated in 1574; in another, a man advised his pregnant girlfriend to use black hellebore and savin be boiled together and drunk in milk, or else chopped madder boiled in beer. Other substances reputed to have been used by the English include Spanish fly, opium, watercress seed, iron sulphate, and iron chloride. Another mixture, not abortifacient, but rather intended to relieve missed abortion, contained dittany, hyssop, and hot water. The root of worm fern, called \\"prostitute root\\" in French, was used in France and Germany; it was also recommended by a Greek physician in the 1st century. In German folk medicine, there was also an abortifacient tea, which included marjoram, thyme, parsley, and lavender. Other preparations of unspecified origin included crushed ants, the saliva of camels, and the tail hairs of black-tailed deer dissolved in the fat of bears. =Attitudes towards abortion= The Stoics believed the fetus to be plantlike in nature, and not an animal until the moment of birth, when it finally breathed air. They therefore found abortion morally acceptable. Aristotle wrote that, \\"[T]he line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive.\\" Before that point was reached, Aristotle did not regard abortion as the killing of something human.A companion to bioethics By Helga Kuhse, Peter SingerReligiousTolerance.org W. den Boer, Private Morality in Greece and Rome (Brill 1979 ), p. 272 Aristotle considered the embryo to gain a human soul at 40 days if male and 90 days if female; before that, it had vegetable and animal souls. The Oath, ascribed to Hippocrates, forbade the use of pessaries to induce abortion. Modern scholarship suggests that pessaries were banned because they were reported to cause vaginal ulcers. \\"Contrary to popular opinion, the ancient Hippocratic Oath did not prohibit abortions; the oath prohibited 'vaginal suppositories' presumably because of the ulcerations they were said to cause.\\" Riddle is citing Soranus, p.13. This specific prohibition has been interpreted by some medical scholars as prohibiting abortion in a broader sense than by pessary. One such interpretation was by Scribonius Largus, a Roman medical writer: \\"Hippocrates, who founded our profession, laid the foundation for our discipline by an oath in which it was proscribed not to give a pregnant woman a kind of medicine that expels the embryo or fetus.\\"Scribonius, Compositiones Praef. 5. 20‚Äì23 (Translated and cited in Riddle's history of contraception and abortion) Other medical scholars disagree, believing that Hippocrates sought to discourage physicians from trying dangerous methods to abort a fetus. This may be born out by the fact that the oath originally also prohibited surgery (at the time, it was far more dangerous, and surgeons were a separate profession from physicians).https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/hippocratic- oath-today.html Soranus acknowledges two parties among physicians: those who would not perform abortions, citing the Hippocratic Oath, and the other party, his own. Soranus recommended abortion in cases involving health complications as well as emotional immaturity, and provided detailed suggestions in his work Gynecology.\\"Scribonius Largus\\" Punishment for abortion in the Roman Republic was generally inflicted as a violation of the father's right to dispose of his offspring.Johannes M. R√∂skamp, Christian Perspectives On Abortion-Legislation In Past And Present (GRIN Verlag 2005 Because of the influence of Stoicism, which did not view the fetus as a person, the Romans did not punish abortion as homicide.Jeffrey H. Reiman, Abortion and the Ways We Value Life (Rowman and Littlefield 1998 ), p, 19 Although abortion was commonly accepted in Rome, around 211 CE emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla banned abortion as infringing on parental rights; temporary exile was the punishment. Attitudes began to change with the spread of Christianity. The 3rd-century legal compilation Pauli sententiae (attributed to Julius Paulus Prudentissimus) wrote: \\"Those who give an abortifacient or a love potion, and do not do this deceitfully, nevertheless, [because] this sets a bad example, the humiliores [those of a lower status, e.g., freed slaves] will be banned to a mine, and the honestiores [those of higher status, e.g., patricians] will be banned to an island after having forfeited (part of) their property, and if on account of that a woman or man perishes, then they [Pharr: the giver] will receive the death penalty.\\"Pauli sententiae, PS 5.23.14 (BA PS 5.25.8). This seems to refer more to the killing of the woman who takes the abortifacient rather than to the killing of the fetus itself. The Roman jurist Ulpian wrote in the Digest: \\"An unborn child is considered being born, as far as it concerns his profits.\\" Despite this, abortion continued to be practiced \\"with little or no sense of shame\\". \\"We know that Romans practiced abortion with little or no sense of shame.\\" Hopkins cites R. H√§hnel's Der k√ºnstliche Abortus in Altertum, p. 127. Christianity The Bible's Exodus 21:22‚Äì24 describes two men fighting and accidentally hitting a pregnant woman's stomach causing a premature birth that does not result in further injury as a non-capital offense and a \\"non-serious injury\\", unless it results in the crime of murder.https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2021:22-24 Commentators such as Bruce Waltke have presented this as evidence that \\"God does not regard the fetus as a soul\\".http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/30/my-take-when-evangelicals-were- pro-choice/comment-page-30/Bruce Waltke, \\"The Old Testament and Birth Control\\", Christianity Today 13 no. 3 (1968) 3-6http://blog.chron.com/goplifer/2014/03/when-evangelicals-were-pro- choice/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/abortion.html C. Everett Koop disagreed with this interpretation. Numbers 5:11-31 describes the test of the unfaithful wife. If a man is suspicious of his wife's fidelity, he would take her to the high priest. The priest would make a substance for the woman to drink made from water and \\"dust from the tabernacle floor\\". If she had been unfaithful \\"her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.\\" If she was innocent the drink had no effect.https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+5%3A11-31 The early Christian work called the Didache (before 100 CE) says: \\"do not murder a child by abortion or kill a new-born infant.\\" Tertullian, a 2nd- and 3rd- century Christian theologian argued that abortion should be performed only in cases in which abnormal positioning of the fetus in the womb would endanger the life of the pregnant woman. Saint Augustine, in Enchiridion, makes passing mention of surgical procedures being performed to remove fetuses which have died in utero.Augustine (1885) []. \\"The Case of Abortive Conceptions\\". Enchiridion. in Philip Schaff. Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. 3. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark. Saint Augustine believed that abortion of a fetus animatus, a fetus with human limbs and shape, was murder. However, his beliefs on earlier- stage abortion were similar to Aristotle's, though he could neither deny nor affirm whether such partially formed fetuses would be resurrected as full people at the time of the Second Coming.Augustine (1885) []. \\"What Sins are Trivial and What Heinous is a Matter for God's Judgment\\". Enchiridion. in Philip Schaff. Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. 3. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark. *\\"Now who is there that is not rather disposed to think that unformed abortions perish, like seeds that have never fructified?\\" * \\"And therefore the following question may be very carefully inquired into and discussed by learned men, though I do not know whether it is in man's power to resolve it: At what time the infant begins to live in the womb: whether life exists in a latent form before it manifests itself in the motions of the living being. To deny that the young who are cut out limb by limb from the womb, lest if they were left there dead the mother should die too, have never been alive, seems too audacious.\\"Augustine (1885) []. \\"If They Have Ever Lived, They Must of Course Have Died, and Therefore, Shall Have a Share in the Resurrection of the Dead\\". Enchiridion. in Philip Schaff. Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. 3. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark. The Leges Henrici Primi, written c. 1115, treated pre-quickening abortion as a misdemeanor, and post-quickening abortion as carrying a lesser penalty than homicide.quasi-homicide \\"Quickening\\", a term often used interchangeably with \\"ensoulment\\" or \\"animation\\", was associated with the first movement of the fetus in utero. This movement is generally felt by women sometime in the third to fifth month of pregnancy. Midwives who performed abortions were accused of committing witchcraft in Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches), published in 1487 as a witch-hunting manual in Germany. Currently, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Evangelical Protestant and some mainline Protestant churches oppose abortion in varying degrees, while other mainline Protestant churches favor ‚Äì also in varying degrees ‚Äì permitting the practice.http://www.pewforum.org/2013/01/16/religious-groups- official-positions-on-abortion/ In Judaism From a Jewish perspective from biblical times, abortion is considered from a social perspective more than from a theological perspective. The mother's life is considered as a priority. Modern era =Criminalization= \\"Admonition against abortion\\". Late 19th-century Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print. 19th-century medicine saw tremendous advances in the fields of surgery, anaesthesia, and sanitation. Social attitudes towards abortion shifted in the context of a backlash against the women's rights movement. Abortion had previously been widely practiced and legal under common law in early pregnancy (until quickening), but the English- speaking world passed laws against abortion at all stages of pregnancy. There were a number of factors that contributed to this shift in opinion about abortion in the early 19th century. In the United States, where physicians were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, some of them argued that advances in medical knowledge showed that quickening was neither more nor less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step, and thus if one opposes abortion after quickening, one should oppose it before quickening as well. Practical reasons also influenced the medical field to impose anti-abortion laws. For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these \\"irregulars\\" were considered a nuisance to public health. The \\"irregulars\\" were also disliked by the more formalized medical profession because they were competition, and often cheap competition. Though the physicians' campaign against abortion began in the early 1800s, little progress was made in the United States until after the Civil War. The English law on abortion was first codified in legislation under sections 1 and 2 of Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803. The Bill was proposed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough to clarify the law relating to abortion and was the first law to explicitly outlaw it. The Act provided that it was an offence for any person to perform or cause an abortion. The punishment for performing or attempting to perform a post quickening abortion was the death penalty (section 1) and otherwise was transportation for fourteen years (section 2). In 19th-century America, there was little regulation of abortion, in the tradition of English common law, pre quickening abortions were considered at most a misdemeanor. These cases proved difficult to prosecute as the testimony of the mother was usually the only means to determine when quickening had occurred. The law was amended in 1828 and 1837 ‚Äì the latter removed the distinction between women who were quick with child (late pregnancy) and those who were not. It also eliminated the death penalty as a possible punishment. The latter half of the 19th century saw abortion become increasingly punished. One writer justified this by claiming that the number of abortions among married women had increased markedly since 1840.Transactions of the Washington Obstetrical and Gynecological Society The Offences against the Person Act 1861 created a new preparatory offence of procuring poison or instruments with intent to procure abortion. During the 1860s however abortion services were available in New York, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Cleveland, Chicago and Indianapolis; with estimates of one abortion for every 4 live births . Anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the United States from the 1820s. In 1821, a Connecticut law targeted apothecaries who sold poisons to women for purposes of abortion; and New York made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor eight years later. Criminalization accelerated from the late 1860s, through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and the American Medical Association. In 1873, the Comstock Law prohibited any methods of production or publication of information pertaining to the procurement of abortion, the prevention of conception and the prevention of venereal disease, even to students of medicine.https://archive.org/stream/anthonycomstockh00bennuoft#page/1017/mode/1up Anthony Comstock: His Career of Cruelty and Crime A Chapter from \\"Champions of the Church\\". DeRobigne Mortimer Bennett. 1878. By 1909 the penalty for violating these laws became a $5000 fine and up to five years imprisonment. By 1910 nearly every state had anti-abortion laws, but these were unevenly enforced, at best. In contrast, in France social perceptions of abortion started to change. In the first half of the 19th century, abortion was viewed as the last resort for pregnant but unwed women. But as writers began to write about abortion in terms of family planning for married women, the practice of abortion was reconceptualized as a logical solution to unwanted pregnancies resulting from ineffectual contraceptives. The formulation of abortion as a form of family planning for married women was made \\"thinkable\\" because both medical and non-medical practitioners agreed on the relative safety of the procedure. =Abortion methods= An 1845 ad for \\"French Periodical Pills\\" warns against use by women who might be \\"en ciente [sic]\\" (\\"enceinte\\" is French for \\"pregnant\\"). From 1870 there was a steady decline in fertility in England, linked by some commentators not to a rise in the use of artificial contraception but to more traditional methods such as withdrawal and abstinence. This was linked to changes in the perception of the relative costs of childrearing. Of course, women did find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. Abortifacients were discreetly advertised and there was a considerable body of folklore about methods of inducing miscarriages. Amongst working-class women violent purgatives were popular, pennyroyal, aloes and turpentine were all used. Other methods to induce miscarriage were very hot baths and gin, extreme exertion, a controlled fall down a flight of stairs, or veterinary medicines. So-called 'backstreet' abortionists were fairly common, although their bloody efforts could be fatal. Estimates of the number of illegal abortions performed in England varied widely: by one estimate, 100,000 women made efforts to procure a miscarriage in 1914, usually by drugs. In New York, surgical abortion in 1800s carried a death rate of 30% regardless of hospital setting, and the AMA launched an anti-abortion campaign that resulted in abortion becoming the exclusive domain of doctors . A paper published in 1870 on the abortion services to be found in Syracuse, New York, concluded that the method most often practiced there during this time was to flush inside of the uterus with injected water. The article's author, Ely Van de Warkle, claimed this procedure was affordable even to a maid, as a man in town offered it for $10 on an installment plan. Other prices which 19th-century abortion providers are reported to have charged were much more steep. In Britain, it could cost from 10 to 50 guineas, or 5% of the yearly income of a lower middle class household. A rash of unexplained miscarriages in Sheffield, England were attributed to lead poisoning caused by the metal pipes which fed the city's water supply. Soon, women began using diachylon, a substance with a high concentration of lead, as an abortifacient. In 1898, a woman confessed to having used diachylon to induce a miscarriage. The use of diachylon became prevalent in the English Midlands up until World War I. Criminal investigation of an abortionist in Calgary, Alberta in 1894 revealed through chemical analysis that the concoction he had supplied to a man seeking an abortifacient contained Spanish fly. Dr. Evelyn Fisher wrote of how women living in a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles intended for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix in an effort to self-induce abortion. Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Some commentators maintained that abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930.Abortion was more dangerous than childbirth throughout the 19th century. By 1930, medical procedures had improved for both childbirth and abortion but not equally, and induced abortion in the first trimester had become safer than childbirth. In 1973, Roe vs. Wade acknowledged that abortion in the first trimester was safer than childbirth. But others have said that in the 19th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe. In addition, some authors have written that, despite improved medical procedures, the period from the 1930s until legalization also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws, and concomitantly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime. =Advertising for abortifacients and abortion services= Suggestive advertisement for the use of Beecham's Pills as an abortifacient. The text at the bottom notes that the pills \\"assist nature in her wondrous functions\\". Despite bans enacted on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, access to abortion continued, as the disguised advertisement of abortion services, abortion-inducing devices, and abortifacient medicines in the Victorian era would seem to suggest. Apparent print ads of this nature were found in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. A British Medical Journal writer who replied to newspaper ads peddling relief to women who were \\"temporarily indisposed\\" in 1868 found that over half of them were in fact promoting abortion. A few examples of surreptitiously marketed abortifacients include \\"Farrer's Catholic Pills\\", \\"Hardy's Woman's Friend\\", \\"Dr. Peter's French Renovating Pills\\", \\"Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound\\", and \\"Madame Drunette's Lunar Pills\\". Patent medicines which claimed to treat \\"female complaints\\" often contained such ingredients as pennyroyal, tansy, and savin. Abortifacient products were sold under the promise of \\"restor[ing] female regularity\\" and \\"removing from the system every impurity\\". In the vernacular of such advertising, \\"irregularity\\", \\"obstruction\\", \\"menstrual suppression\\", and \\"delayed period\\" were understood to be euphemistic references to the state of pregnancy. As such, some abortifacients were marketed as menstrual regulatives. Beecham's Pills were marketed primarily as a laxative from 1842. They were invented by Thomas Beecham from St Helens, Lancashire, England. The pills were a combination of aloe, ginger, and soap, with some other more minor ingredients. The popularity of the pills produced a wide range of testimonials that were used in advertising. The poet William Topaz McGonagall wrote a poem advertising the pills, giving his recommendation in verse.McGonagall Online - Beecham's Pills Beecham's expenditure on advertising went from ¬£22,000 to ¬£95,000 in the 1880s. An 1897 advertisement in the Christian Herald edition for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee said: \\"Worth a guinea a box. Beecham's Pills for all bilious and nervous disorders such as Sick Headache, Constipation, Weak Stomach, Impaired Digestion, Disordered Liver and Female Ailments. The sale is now 6 million boxes per annum.\\" The text was printed alongside a picture of a young woman at a beach and was captioned \\"What are the wild waves saying? Try Beecham's Pills.\\" \\"The Female Abortionist\\". Madame Restell is portrayed as a villainess in an 1847 copy of the National Police Gazette. \\"Old Dr. Gordon's Pearls of Health\\", produced by a drug company in Montreal, \\"cure[d] all suppressions and irregularities\\" if \\"used monthly\\". However, a few ads explicitly warned against the use of their product by women who were expecting, or listed miscarriage as its inevitable side effect. The copy for \\"Dr. Peter's French Renovating Pills\\" advised, \\"... pregnant females should not use them, as they invariably produce a miscarriage ...\\", and both \\"Dr. Monroe's French Periodical Pills\\" and \\"Dr. Melveau's Portuguese Female Pills\\" were \\"sure to produce a miscarriage\\". F.E. Karn, a man from Toronto, in 1901 cautioned women who thought themselves pregnant not to use the pills he advertised as \\"Friar's French Female Regulator\\" because they would \\"speedily restore menstrual secretions.\\" Historian Ann Hibner Koblitz comments that \\"Nineteenth-century customers would have understood this 'warning' exactly as the sellers intended: as an advertisement for an abortifacient preparation.\\" In the mid 1930s abortifacients drugs were marketed in the United States to women by various companies under various names such as Molex Pills and Cote Pills. Since birth control devices and abortifacients were illegal to market and sell at the time, they were offered to women who were \\"delayed\\". The recommended dosage constituted seven grains of ergotin a day. These pills generally contained ingredients such as ergotin, aloes, Black Hellebore. The efficacy and safety of these pills are unknown. In 1940 the FTC deemed them unsafe and ineffective and demanded that these companies cease and desist selling these product. A well-known example of a Victorian-era abortionist was Madame Restell, or Ann Lohman, who over a forty-year period illicitly provided both surgical abortion and abortifacient pills in the northern United States. She began her business in New York during the 1830s, and, by the 1840s, had expanded to include franchises in Boston and Philadelphia. It is estimated that by 1870 her annual expenditure on advertising alone was $60,000. Because of her reputation, Restellism became a synonym for abortion. \\"Dr. Miller's Female Monthly Powders\\" ad copy reprinted in an 1858 article condemning such advertising. One ad for Restell's medical services, printed in the New York Sun, promised that she could offer the \\"strictest confidence on complaints incidental to the female frame\\" and that her \\"experience and knowledge in the treatment of cases of female irregularity, [was] such as to require but a few days to effect a perfect cure\\". Another, addressed to married women, asked the question, \\"Is it desirable, then, for parents to increase their families, regardless of consequences to themselves, or the well-being of their offspring, when a simple, easy, healthy, and certain remedy is within our control?\\" Advertisements for the \\"Female Monthly Regulating Pills\\" she also sold vowed to resolve \\"all cases of suppression, irregularity, or stoppage of the menses, however obdurate\\". Madame Restell was an object of criticism in both the respectable and penny presses. She was first arrested in 1841, but, it was her final arrest by Anthony Comstock which led to her suicide on the day of her trial April 1, 1878. Such advertising aroused criticisms of quackery and immorality. The safety of many nostrums was suspect and the efficacy of others non-existent. Horace Greeley, in a New York Herald editorial written in 1871, denounced abortion and its promotion as the \\"infamous and unfortunately common crime‚Äì so common that it affords a lucrative support to a regular guild of professional murderers, so safe that its perpetrators advertise their calling in the newspapers\\". Although the paper in which Greeley wrote accepted such advertisements, others, such as the New York Tribune, refused to print them. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to obtain a Doctor of Medicine in the United States, also lamented how such ads led to the contemporary synonymity of \\"female physician\\" with \\"abortionist\\". =Turning point in abortion legislation= The feminist Stella Browne was a major figure in the campaign for the liberalization of abortion law. Abortifacient advertising was highly effective in the United States, though apparently less so across the Atlantic. Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates in the United States suggest between 20% and 25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended in abortion. This era also saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions. Before the start of the 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. But, out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and of the married women well over 60 percent already had at least one child. In the post-Civil War era, much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning women's rights movement. Many feminists of the era were opposed to abortion.Gordon, Sarah Barringer. \\"Law and Everyday Death: Infanticide and the Backlash against Woman's Rights after the Civil War\\". Lives of the Law. Austin Sarat, Lawrence Douglas, and Martha Umphrey, Editors. (University of Michigan Press 2006) p.67Schiff, Stacy. \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\". October 13, 2006 The New York Times'.' Retrieved February 5, 2009. In The Revolution, operated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, an anonymous contributor signing \\"A\\" wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed. Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, \\"be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\\"Susan B. Anthony, \\"Marriage and Maternity\\", The Revolution (1869-07-08), via University Honors Program, Syracuse University.Federer, William. American Minute, page 81 (Amerisearch 2003). To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men. Even the \\"free love\\" wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women. Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women's right to abstinence. Socialist feminists tended to be more sympathetic to the need for abortion options for the poor, and indeed socialist feminist doctors, such as Marie Equi, Madeleine Pelletier, and William J. Robinson, themselves performed low-cost or free abortions for poor women. =Abortion law reform campaign= The movement towards the liberalization of abortion law emerged in the 1920s and '30s in the context of the victories that had been recently won in the area of birth control. Campaigners including Marie Stopes in England and Margaret Sanger in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need. In 1929, the Infant Life Preservation Act was passed in Britain, which amended the law (Offences against the Person Act 1861) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.HL Deb. Vol 72. 269. Stella Browne was a leading birth control campaigner, who increasingly began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy.Jones, Greta. \\"Women and eugenics in Britain: The case of Mary Scharlieb, Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, and Stella Browne.\\" Annals of Science 52 no. 5 (1995):481-502 In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not. In the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women‚Äôs health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics. These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman‚Äôs right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture \\"The Right to Abortion\\" in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women‚Äôs right to decide to have an abortion. She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning. Aleck Bourne was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape victim in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights. Other prominent feminists, including Frida Laski, Dora Russell, Joan Malleson and Janet Chance began to champion this cause ‚Äì the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the British Medical Association council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion. On 17 February 1936, Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins and Joan Malleson established the Abortion Law Reform Association as the first advocacy organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to abortion in the United Kingdom and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles. In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members. The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA‚Äôs Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen- year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA. This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public. In 1938, Joan Malleson precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year-old rape victim to gynaecologist Aleck Bourne. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in Rex v. Bourne as his actions were \\"an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession\\".R v Bourne [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, CCA This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause \\"mental and physical wreck\\". Finally, the Birkett Committee, established in 1937 by the British government \\"to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto\\", recommended a change to abortion laws two years later. The intervention of World War II meant that all plans were shelved. =Liberalization of abortion law= The Soviet Union first legalized abortion in 1920. The poster warns against unsafe abortion. Title translation: \\"Abortions performed by either trained or self-taught midwives not only maim the woman, they also often lead to death.\\" Russia The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the first government to legalize abortion and make it available on request, often for no cost.Heer, David, \\"Abortion, Contraception, and Population Policy in the Soviet Union\\" Demography 2 (1965): 531-39.Alexandre Avdeev, Alain Blum, and Irina Troitskaya. \\"The History of Abortion Statistics in Russia and the USSR from 1900 to 1991\\". Population (English Edition) 7, (1995), 42. The Soviet government hoped to provide access to abortion in a safe environment performed by a trained doctor instead of babki.I.S. Kon, The Sexual Revolution in Russia: From the Age of the Czars to Today (New York: The Free Press, 1995), 61. While this campaign was extremely effective in the urban areas (as much as 75% of abortions in Moscow were performed in hospitals by 1925), it had much less effect on rural regions where there was neither access to doctors, transportation, or both and where women relied on traditional medicine.Michaels, Paula, \\"Motherhood, Patriotism, and Ethnicity: Soviet Kazakhstan and the 1936 Abortion Ban\\". Feminist Studies 27 (2001): 309-11. In the countryside in particular, women continued to see babki, midwives, hairdressers, nurses, and others for the procedure after abortion was legalized in the Soviet Union.Barbara Evans Clements, Barbara Alpern Engel, and Christine Worobec. Russia's Women: Accommodation, Resistance, Transformation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 260. From 1936 until 1955 the Soviet Union made abortion illegal (except for medically recommended cases) again, stemming largely from Joseph Stalin's worries about population growth. Stalin wanted to encourage population growth, as well as place a stronger emphasis on the importance of the family unit to communism.Randall, Amy, Abortion Will Deprive You of Happiness!': Soviet Reproductive Politics in the Post-Stalin Era\\". Journal of Women's History 23 (2011): 13-38. Spain During the Spanish Civil War, on 25 December 1936, in Catalonia, free abortion was legalized during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with a decree signed by Josep Tarradellas, First Minister of the Government of Catalonia, and published on 9 January 1937 (Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya, n√∫m.9).La Segunda Rep√∫blica despenaliz√≥ el aborto con la ley m√°s avanzada de Europa, P√∫blico (Espa√±a), Patricia Campello, 15/2/2014Catalu√±a tuvo durante la Rep√∫blica la ley del aborto m√°s progresista de Europa, El Pa√≠s, 13/2/1983V√©ase el texto del decreto Decreto de Regulaci√≥n de la Interrupci√≥n Artificial del Embarazo , en cgtburgos; tambi√©n el reportaje de Jos√© Mar√≠a Garat, public√≥ en Mundo Gr√°fico el 12 de mayo de 1937, descargable desde la Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a -En Catalu√±a existe ya el aborto legal Great Britain In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association continued its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of reducing the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee. \\"Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967\\". 1 (2006-2007). Print. United States In America an abortion reform movement emerged in the 1960s. In 1963 The Society for Human Abortions was formed, providing women with information on how to obtain and perform abortions. In 1964 Gerri Santoro of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as \\"Jane\\" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find \\"Jane\\". In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. The forerunner of the NARAL Pro-Choice America was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion.National Women's Health Network  A Voice For Women, A Network For Change In late 1973 NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League. The American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Medical Association, the California Bar Association, and numerous other groups announced support behind new laws that would protect doctors from criminal prosecution if they performed abortions under rigid hospital controls. In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize a doctor performing an abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman. A bipartisan majority in the California legislature supported a new law introduced by Democratic state senator Anthony Beilenson, the \\"Therapeutic Abortion Act\\". Catholic clergy were strongly opposed but Catholic lay people were divided and non-Catholics strongly supported the proposal. Governor Ronald Reagan consulted with his father-in-law, a prominent surgeon who supported the law. He also consulted with James Cardinal McIntyre, the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles. The archbishop strongly opposed any legalization of abortion and he convinced Reagan to announce he would veto the proposed law since the draft allowed abortions in the case of birth defects. The legislature dropped that provision and Reagan signed the law, which decriminalized abortions when done to protect the health of the mother.Kristen Luker, Abortion and the politics of motherhood (U. of California Press, 1984) pp 88‚Äì89.Lou Cannon, Ronald Reagan: The Presidential Portfolio: History as Told through the Collection of the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum (2001) p. 51.Matthew W. Dallek, The right moment: Ronald Reagan's first victory and the decisive turning point in American politics (2000) p. 198. The expectation was that abortions would not become more numerous but would become much safer under hospital conditions. In 1968 the first full year under the new law that were 5,018 abortions in California. The numbers grew exponentially and stabilized at about 100,000 annually by the 1970s. It was abortion-on-demand, as 99.2% of California women who applied for an abortion were granted one. One out of every three pregnancies was ended by illegal abortion. The key factor was the sudden emergence of a woman's movement that introduced a very new idea‚Äîwomen had a basic right to control their bodies and could choose to have an abortion or not. Reagan by 1980 found his support among anti-abortion religious groups and said he was too new as governor to make a wise decision.Luker, Abortion and the politics of motherhood pp. 94, 118‚Äì122, 133. In 1970, Hawaii became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman, and New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Similar laws were soon passed in Alaska and Washington. A law in Washington, D.C., which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman, was challenged in the Supreme Court in 1971 in United States v. Vuitch. The court upheld the law, deeming that \\"health\\" meant \\"psychological and physical well-being\\", essentially allowing abortion in Washington, DC. By the end of 1972, 13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while Mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and Alabama and Massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the woman's physical health was endangered. The United States Supreme Court membership in 1973 at the time of Roe v. Wade. The landmark judicial ruling of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled that a Texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The immediate result was that all state laws to the contrary were null. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the right to privacy. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being. From the 1970s, and the spread of second-wave feminism, abortion and reproductive rights became unifying issues among various women's rights groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and Italy.LeGates, Marlene. In Their Time: A History of Feminism in Western Society Routledge, 2001 p. 363-364 =Development of contemporary abortion methods= Although prototypes of the modern curette are referred to in ancient texts, the instrument which is used today was initially designed in France in 1723, but was not applied specifically to a gynecological purpose until 1842. Dilation and curettage has been practiced since the late 19th century. The 20th century saw improvements in abortion technology, increasing its safety, and reducing its side-effects. Vacuum devices, first described by the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson in the 19th century, allowed for the development of suction-aspiration abortion. The process was improved by the Russian doctor S. G. Bykov in 1927, where the method was used during its period of liberal abortion laws from 1920 to 1936. The technology was also used in China and Japan before being introduced to Britain and the United States in the 1960s. The invention of the Karman cannula, a flexible plastic cannula which replaced earlier metal models in the 1970s, reduced the occurrence of perforation and made suction- aspiration methods possible under local anesthesia. In 1971, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, founding members of the feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap suction device that made it possible for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called menstrual extraction. During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in manual vacuum aspiration as a method of early surgical abortion. This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (as soon as a week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective early abortion options, both surgical and medical. An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe as soon as a positive pregnancy test is received. This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy. Intact dilation and extraction was developed by Dr. James McMahon in 1983. It resembles a procedure used in the 19th century to save a woman's life in cases of obstructed labor, in which the fetal skull was first punctured with a perforator, then crushed and extracted with a forceps-like instrument, known as a cranioclast. In 1980, researchers at Roussel Uclaf in France developed mifepristone, a chemical compound which works as an abortifacient by blocking hormone action. It was first marketed in France under the trade name Mifegyne in 1988. Abortion around the world At various times abortion has been banned or restricted in countries around the world. Multiple scholars have noticed that in many cases, this has caused women to seek dangerous, illegal abortions underground or inspired trips abroad for \\"reproductive tourism\\".Whittaker, Andrew. \\"Abortion in Asia: An Overview\\". In Whittaker, Andrea, ed. Abortion in Asia: Local Dilemmas, Global Politics New York, NY: Berghahn Books, 2010: 11-38.Kligman, Gail. The Politics of Duplicity: Controlling Reproduction in Ceausescu's Romania. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1998.Chandrasekhar, S. India's Abortion Experience Denton, TX: University of North Texas Press, 1994. Half of the world's current deaths due to unsafe abortions occur in Asia. But other authors have written that illegality has not always meant that abortions were unsafe. For example, in the U.S. in the 19th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe. =China= In the early 1950s, the Chinese government made abortion illegal, with punishments for those who received or performed illegal abortions written into the law.Jing-Bao, Nie. Behind the Silence: Chinese Voices on Abortion Lanham, ML: Rowman & Litterfield Publishers, 2005. These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth. As the decade went on, however, the laws were relaxed with the intent of reducing the number of deaths and lifelong injuries women sustained due to illegal abortions as well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control. In the early 1980s, the state implemented a form of family planning which used abortion as a \\"back-up method\\"; and in 2005, there has been legislation trying to curb sex-selective abortion. =India= India enforced the Indian Penal Code from 1860 to 1971, criminalizing abortion and punishing both the practitioners and the women who sought out the procedure. As a result, women died in an attempt to obtain illegal abortions from unqualified midwives and \\"doctors\\". Abortion was made legal under specific circumstances in 1971, but as scholar S. Chandrasekhar notes, lower class women still find themselves at a greater risk of injury or death as a result of a botched abortion. =Japan= Japan is known today worldwide for its acceptance of abortion.Norgren, Tiana. Abortion before Birth Control: The Politics of Reproduction in Postwar Japan Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001. It is estimated that two-thirds of Japanese women have an abortion by age forty, partially due to former government restrictions on contraceptive pills on 'public hygiene grounds'. The Eugenics Protection Law of 1948 made abortion on demand legal up to twenty-two weeks' gestation so long as the woman's health was endangered; in 1949, this law was extended to consider the risk the child's birth would place on a woman's economic welfare. Originally, each case would have to be approved by a local eugenics council, but this was removed from the law in 1952, making the decision a private one between a woman and her physician. In 1964, the creation of the conservative right-wing nationalist political lobbying group called Seicho-no-Ie brought about a strong opposition to the abortion laws. This campaign reached its peak strength in the early 1980s, but ultimately failed in 1983. =Romania= In 1957, Romania legalized abortion, but in 1966, after a decline in the national birthrate, Nicolae Ceau≈üescu approved Decree 770, which criminalized abortion and encouraged childbirth. As a result of this decree, women in want of abortion turned to illegal procedures that caused the deaths of over 9,000 women and left unwanted children abandoned in orphanages. Abortion remained illegal until 1989, when the decree was overturned.Kligman, Gail. \\"Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania\\". In Ginsburg, Faye D.; Rapp, Rayna, eds.

Unique Identifier : AIDSLINE KIE/49442. =Thailand= There was intense public debate throughout the 1980s and 1990s over legal abortion reform. These debates portrayed abortion as un-Buddhist and anti-religious; abortion opponents ultimately labeled it as a form of Western corruption that was inherently anti-Thai and threatened the integrity of the nation. Despite this, in 2006, abortions became legal in cases of rape or foetal impairment. Mental health also became a factor in determining the legality of an abortion procedure. The strict regulations involved in qualifying for a legal abortion, however, cause approximately 300,000 women a year to seek illegal avenues according to scholar Andrea Whittaker, with the poorest undergoing the most dangerous of procedures.

Mininova was once one of the largest sites offering torrents of copyrighted material, but in November 2009, following legal action in the Dutch courts, the site operators deleted all torrent files uploaded by regular users including torrents that enabled users to download copyrighted material. On April 4, 2017 Mininova shut down, saying that it had been running at a loss \\"for some years\\". Site history The site was based in the Netherlands and was launched in January 2005 as a successor to Suprnova.org, which went offline at the end of 2004 following legal difficulties. In April 2007, Mininova B.V. (the company running Mininova.org) won a domain dispute about the domain mininova.com, which had been exploited by a phisher. The word ‚Äòmininova‚Äô ranked 9 on Google's list of most queried terms in 2006. In May 2008, Mininova indicated that there had been over 5 billion downloads via the site. Mininova also ran a video sharing site, called Snotr. =Legal action= In May 2009, the Dutch copyright enforcement organization BREIN started a civil procedure against Mininova demanding that Mininova filter torrent files pointing to copyrighted works. During the proceedings, Mininova stated that it was not feasible for the site to identify such files, but said that it would remove torrent files that BREIN identified as infringing copyright. On May 6, 2009, Mininova began a trial of a content recognition system, which was intended to remove any torrents that were flagged as infringing copyright. On August 26, 2009, the court in Utrecht ruled that Mininova should remove all torrent files pointing to copyrighted material within three months or face damages of up to 5 million ‚Ç¨. On November 26, 2009, Mininova announced that it could not find a foolproof filtering system against copyrighted content, and limited its platform to Content Distribution torrents only, in compliance with the ruling of the Utrecht court. This resulted in more than 99.3% of the torrents on the site being removed. As a consequence, the website traffic dropped by 66% in a few days, and daily downloads fell down to 4% of the previous total.Mininova Traffic Plummets After Going ‚ÄòLegal‚Äô, TorrentFreak.

It is known from the entire span of the Late Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (mid Late Campanian to \\"middle\\" Maastrichtian stage, about 72.8-67 Ma ago) of southern Alberta, Canada. It contains two species, A. lambei and A. inceptus. Discovery Cast of referred A. lambei tail club AMNH 5245 Anodontosaurus was named by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1928, based on holotype CMN 8530, a partially preserved skeleton including the skull, half ring, armor and other postcranial remains.C. M. Sternberg (1929) \\"A toothless armoured dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta.\\" Canada Department of Mines Geological Survey Bulletin (Geological Series) 54(49):28-33 The badly crushed skeleton was collected by Sternberg in 1916 from a Canadian Museum of Nature quarry, 8 miles southwest of Morrin. It was collected from the upper part of the Lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation (unit 2), dating to the latest Campanian to the earliest Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 71-70.2 million years ago. The generic name means \\"toothless lizard\\" in Ancient Greek. It was inspired by the fact that compression damage to the specimen had removed the teeth, at the same time shifting various flat round elements below the skull and on top of the left lower jaw, misleading Sternberg into assuming that large \\"trituration plates\\" had replaced the normal dentition.Vickaryous, M.K. and Russell, A.P., 2003, \\"A redescription of the skull of Euoplocephalus tutus (Archosauria: Ornithischia): a foundation for comparative and systematic studies of ankylosaurian dinosaurs\\", Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 137: 157‚Äì186 The specific name, lambei, honours Lawrence Morris Lambe, the Canadian geologist and palaeontologist from the Geological Survey of Canada where the holotype was reposited. In 1986 Coombs examined specimen AMNH 5266, at the time by him referred to Euoplocephalus, and determined that it was a juvenile. Its consists of five vertebral centra, a neural arch, one dorsal and two sacral ribs, the right ischium, the complete right hindlimb, the right pes, an incomplete left pes, and various other fragments. AMNH 5266 was discovered in 1912 at Red Deer River and was collected by Barnum Brown with assistance from Peter Kaisen, George Olsen, and Charles M Sternberg in the sediments from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation.Coombs, W.P., Jr. (1986, June). A Juvenile ankylosaur referable to the genus euoplocephalus (reptilia, ornithischia). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 6(2), 162-173. Description Holotype skull of A. inceptus, TMP 1997.132.1 Anodontosaurus was a medium-sized ankylosaurid that was quadrupedal, ground-dwelling and herbivorous. Like other ankylosaurs, Anodontosaurus has armor on a majority of the dorsal surfaces of its body. It has a wide, pointed tail club at the end of its armored tail. The skull features postocular caputegulae, which are small polygonal plates of bone that are present on the cranium and are situated to the immediate rear of the eye. Coombs supported the assertion that specimen AMNH 5266 represented a juvenile by citing that the vertebral centra were not fused to their neural arches, and that sacral ribs were likewise not fused to vertebrae and to the ilium. Other morphological characters supporting that this is a juvenile specimen include (a) long bones that feature smooth surfaces, which are not marked by the rugosities characteristic of adult bone; (b) the head of the femur is less spherical in shape and is clearly delimited from the adjacent part of the femoral shaft; (c) the distal ends of the tibia and the fibula are not fused to the astragalus and the calcaneum; and (d) the ungual phalanx of the manus is not widest at the proximal articular end as is observed in adults. Classification Referred A. lambei skull Referred A. inceptus skull AMNH 5238 In 1971, Walter Coombs concluded that there was only one species of ankylosaurid during the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous of North America. He synonymised the species Anodontosaurus lambei, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, and Scolosaurus cutleri with Euoplocephalus tutus.Coombs W. (1971) The Ankylosauridae. Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, New York, NY, 487 p. The synonymisation of Anodontosaurus lambei and Euoplocephalus tutus was generally accepted and thus CMN 8530 was assigned to E. tutus. However, following the redescription of Dyoplosaurus as a valid genus by Arbour et al. (2009), In an abstract presented at the SVP 2010 conference, Victoria Arbour considered Anodontosaurus distinct from Euoplocephalus in distinctive skull and cervical half ring ornamentation, as well as tail club morphology, including the presence of pointed, triangular knob osteoderms in Anodontosaurus. She therefore reassigned all Horseshoe Canyon Formation ankylosaurine specimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus to Anodontosaurus. The validity of Anodontosaurus was formalized in three studies. The first, published by Paul Penkalski and William T. Blows in 2013, re-validated Scolosaurus as well. The second study, by Penkalski (2013), named and described Oohkotokia from Montana on the basis of remains that were originally thought to be referable to Euoplocephalus. Penkalski (2013) performed a small phylogenetic analysis of some ankylosaurine specimens. The only Anodontosaurus specimen that was included in this analysis was its holotype. Anodontosaurus was placed in a polytomy with the holotype of Euoplocephalus and some specimens that are referred to it, while Oohkotokia was placed in a clade with Dyoplosaurus, and specimens that are thought to represent either Dyoplosaurus or Scolosaurus. In a study based on the results of her 2010 SVP abstract, Arbour along with Philip Currie formalized the revalidation of Anodonotsaurus, and one specimen from the Dinosaur Park Formation, TMP 1997.132.1, was referred to Anodontosaurus extending the stratigraphic range of the genus back a few million years.Arbour VM, Currie PJ (2013) Euoplocephalus tutus and the Diversity of Ankylosaurid Dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, and Montana, USA.

It is known from the lower levels of the Late Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation (latest middle Campanian stage, about 76.5 Ma ago) of Alberta, Canada. It contains a single species, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus. History of discovery Dyoplosaurus was named by William Parks in 1924, based on holotype ROM 784, a partial skeleton including parts of the skull and lower jaws. It was collected from the bottom 10 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation, near what is now the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. Description Tail of the holotype specimen The type specimen of Dyoplosaurus was about long and about 5.8 feet (1.7 m) wide, with a skull measuring 14 inches (35 centimeters) across. Like most other ankylosaurids, it was quadrupedal, ground-dwelling and herbivorous, with an armored body and a bony club on the end of its tail. The club was composed of several armor plates fused together. The tail club possessed by Dyoplosaurus is relatively small and narrow, when compared to that of other ankylosaurids. Classification Reconstructed tail and pelvis In 1971, Walter Coombs proposed that Dyoplosaurus was a junior synonym of Euoplocephalus. The two were since generally assumed to be the same species and thus, former Dyoplosaurus specimens have been identified as Euoplocephalus tutus. However, a redescription of the genus published in 2009 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology claims that the genus is a valid taxon, suggesting that the proposed synonymy was due to the fragmentary nature of the holotype and other specimens of E. tutus. The cladistic analysis performed by Thompson et al., 2011 confirmed this separation. The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie: See also * Timeline of ankylosaur research References Ankylosaurids Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America Fossil taxa described in 1924 Taxa named by William Parks Dinosaur Park fauna Paleontology in Alberta Campanian genus first appearances Campanian genus extinctions ","title":"Dyoplosaurus"},{"id":"4289876","text":" ","title":"Autochanger"},{"id":"4289889","text":"Anoplosaurus (meaning \\"unarmored or unarmed lizard\\") is an extinct genus of herbivorous nodosaurid dinosaur, from the late Albian-age Lower Cretaceous Cambridge Greensand of Cambridgeshire, England. It has in the past been classified with either the armored dinosaurs or the ornithopods, but current thought has been in agreement with the \\"armored dinosaur\\" interpretation, placing it in the Ankylosauria. History Harry Govier Seeley named this genus in 1879 for a disarticulated partial postcranial skeleton that had been uncovered at Reach, Cambridgeshire, composed of a left dentary fragment, numerous vertebrae from the neck, back, and sacrum, parts of the pectoral girdle, humerus fragments, part of the left femur, left tibia, foot bones, ribs, and other fragments. He regarded it as possibly juvenile, due to its small size, with a length of about five feet. The type species is Anoplosaurus curtonotus. The generic name, derived from the Greek hoplo~, a word element used in combinations, with the meaning of \\"armed\\", refers to the fact no armour plates had been discovered. The specific name is derived from Latin curtus, \\"short\\", and Greek ŒΩ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ, noton, \\"back\\". A second species, Anoplosaurus major, \\"the larger one\\", was named by Seeley in 1879 for a neck vertebra and three partial caudal vertebrae he removed from the material previously referred to Acanthopholis stereocercus, from the same formation as the type species. This species now appears to be chimeric, the neck vertebra coming from an ankylosaur, the caudals from an indeterminate iguanodont.Norman, D.B. 2004. Basal Iguanodontia. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (second edition). University of California Press:Berkeley, 413-437. . Although Seeley assigned Anoplosaurus to a general Dinosauria, he understood its possible affinities with Scelidosaurus or Polacanthus, as shown by the genus name, and other workers began to see it as an armored dinosaur.Zittel, K.A. (1893). Trait√© de Pal√©ontologie III, Pal√©ozoologie, Vertebrata (Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves). Paris:Doin, xii-894. [French]Hennig, E. (1915). Kentrosaurus aethiopicus.

[German] In 1902, Baron Franz Nopcsa referred both species to Acanthopholis, creating a Acanthopholis curtonotus and a Acanthopholis major.F. Nopcsa, 1902, \\"Notizen √ºber cretacische Dinosaurier\\", Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch- Naturwissenschaftlichen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften 111(1): 93-114 In 1923 Nopcsa suggested that, while some of the remains belonged to Acanthopholis, other remains, which he removed from that genus, belonged to a camptosaurid. This suggestion led to considerable confusion, with some authors beginning to classify Anoplosaurus under the Camptosauridae,E. Stromer, 1934, \\"Ergebnisse der Forschungsreisen Prof. E. Stromers in den W√ºsten √Ñgyptens. II. Wirbeltierreste der Bahar√Æje-Stufe (unterstes Cenoman). 13. Dinosauria\\", Abhandlungen der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche Abteilung, Neue Folge 22: 1-79 a practice that was continued over several decades (with modifications as iguanodontian taxonomy changed over the years).Norman, D.B., and Weishampel, D.B. (1990). Iguanodontidae and related ornithopods. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria. University of California Press:Berkeley, 510-533. . In 1964, Oskar Kuhn renamed Syngonosaurus macrocercus Seeley 1879 into Anoplosaurus macrocercus. In 1969, Rodney Steel renamed Eucercosaurus tanyspondylus Seeley 1879 into Anoplosaurus tanyspondylus. Both Syngonosaurus and Eucercosaurus are today seen as nomina dubia and these last two Anoplosaurus species are hereby equally invalid. In 1998, Xabier Pereda-Suberbiola and Paul Barrett reexamined the material of Anoplosaurus curtonotus. They wrote that it all belonged to a \\"primitive\\" or basal member of the Nodosauridae, the lack of armor possibly due to the young age of the animal at death. The basal position would be indicated by the long tooth row and the low sacral vertebrae count. Seeley had never indicated a holotype among the syntype series. Pereda-Superbiola & Barrett therefore selected specimen SMC B55731, a right scapula piece, as the lectotype. Its ankylosaurian affinities would be proven by a high acromion process. The other nodosaurid fossils found at Reach, specimens SMC B55670 - 55742, were assigned as paralectotypes. Pereda-Superbiola & Barrett considered it possible that the discovery had in fact not been made in the Cambridge Green Sand but in the, also Albian, Upper Gault Clay, because the skeletal elements seemed to have belonged to a single individual which might preclude a provenance from the very reworked marine Green Sand deposits. Anoplosaurus curtonotus was by them considered a possibly valid taxon. Reviews since then have followed this interpretation of the genus as an armored dinosaur belonging to the Ankylosauria.Carpenter, K. (2001). Phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosauria.

It was about in length, and weighed around . Small dermal ossicles covered the body, while the pattern of armour plates on the back reminiscent of a turtle shell.

Lee left Brisbane in 1980 and went travelling around Asia and Europe for three years. He moved back to Australia in 1983 and settled in Sydney where he met The Triffids. They'd heard his dobro work on Eric Bogle's first album which contained the legendary track, \\"And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda\\", and invited him to guest on a demo they were recording at the Sydney Opera House - a recording subsequently released as Lawson Square Infirmary. The Triffids then returned to London but Lee stayed in Sydney and took up the pedal steel guitar. Work was scarce for everybody but occasionally something good came up - one session was for a young Melbourne singer songwriter called Paul Kelly who was making a record called 'Post'. He also played on the John Kennedy singles Forget / The End Of The Affair (Waterfront Records, Sept 1984) and Miracle (In Marrickville) / Two People (Waterfront Records, March 1985).Evil Graham Lee discography at Discogs When The Triffids returned to Sydney early in 1985, they asked Lee to join them full-time. Before the year was out the band moved back to London and this time Lee went too. For nearly five years they enjoyed success in Europe and released a number of records which are recognised as Australian classics - Born Sandy Devotional, The Black Swan and Calenture. However, life in London, the constant touring, and the incomprehensible nature of the record business eventually wore the band down and at the end of 1989 they decided to move back to Australia for a break, which became permanent and the band dissolved. In 1990 Lee moved to Melbourne and took a room upstairs at the Standard Hotel, in Fitzroy the pub owned by Steve Miller (The Moodists), his old tour manager. Miller, in partnership with Dave Walsh (the brother of Chris Miller, the bass player for the Moodists) establishing an independent record label, W.Minc Records (Walsh Miller Incorporated) in 1994. During the first few years, after the break-up of The Triffids, Lee was happy to book the bands at the pub and stay focused on music. He produced three of the first four W.Minc records and worked as a session player or a hired hand in various bands, including John Kennedy, The KLF, Blackeyed Susans, The Paradise Vendors, Truckasaurus (with Lisa Miller), David Chesworth, Essendon Airport, GB3, and All India Radio. It wasn't until he was back in Europe, on tour with David McComb's solo outfit, The Red Ponies, that he decided he really wanted to get involved with W.Minc. In 1996 he officially joined the W.Minc Records as the label manager and since then he and Miller have guided the label together. Lee also currently runs an official website for The Triffids and in June 2006 (in conjunction with the re-issue of Born Sandy Devotional) joined the other members of The Triffids to play three live performances, two concerts in Hasselt, Belgium and one in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

While spending most of his life in Washington DC, Martin briefly lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from 1990‚Äì1994, returned to Washington DC, and in 1996 moved to Lafayette, Louisiana with his wife, Suzanne Fredericq, a biologist, whom he married in 1988. In December 2001 he suffered simultaneously a brain hemorrhage and stroke while in Belgium. After undergoing physical therapy in Lafayette, Louisiana, he resumed painting and continued creating art until his death there.

Discovered in 1845, it was one of the first stegosaurians found. Its only remains, a partial skull, isolated teeth, and fragments of vertebrae, were found in the Kirkwood Formation. British paleontologist Richard Owen initially identified the fragments as those of the pareiasaur Anthodon. After remaining untouched for years in the British Museum of Natural History, the partial skull was identified by South African paleontologist Robert Broom as belonging to a different genus; he named the specimen Palaeoscincus africanus. Several years later, Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa, unaware of Broom's new name, similarly concluded that it represented a new taxon, and named it Paranthodon owenii. Since Nopcsa's species name was assigned after Broom's, and Broom did not assign a new genus, both names are now synonyms of the current binomial, Paranthodon africanus. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek para (near) with the genus name Anthodon, to represent the initial referral of the remains. In identifying the remains as those of Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed by the research of Coombs in the 1970s. In 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomic techniques, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. A 2018 review of Paranthodon could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauria based on similarity and multiple phylogenetic analyses, no diagnostic features of the group could be identified in Paranthodon. History of discovery Skull of alt=Fossils of Anthodon, what Paranthodon was once thought to be In 1845, amateur geologists William Guybon Atherstone and Andrew Geddes Bain discovered several fossils near Dassieklip, Cape Province, in the Bushman's River Valley. This was the first dinosaur find in Africa and in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1849 and 1853, Bain sent some of the fossils to palaeontologist Richard Owen for identification. Among them was an upper jaw Bain referred to as the \\"Cape Iguanodon\\", so the site was named \\"Iguanodonhoek\\". Atherstone published a short paper about the discovery in 1857, but lamented in 1871 that it had thus far received no attention in London. In 1876 Owen named a series of specimens from the collection Anthodon serrarius, basing the generic name on the resemblance of the teeth to a flower. The partial holotype skull BMNH 47337, the left jaw BMNH 47338, the matrix BMNH 47338 including bone fragments and impressions of the anterior skull, and the vertebrae BMNH 47337a were all assigned to Anthodon. In 1882, Othniel Charles Marsh assigned Anthodon to Stegosauridae based on BMNH 47338, and in 1890, Richard Lydekker found that although Anthodon was a pareiasaur, its teeth were similar to those of the Stegosauridae. Lydekker in 1890 also corrected a mistake of Owen, who had incorrectly summarised all the material as coming from a single locality, whereas there was separate material from two clearly distinct localities. In 1909, Robert Broom visited the collection of the British Museum of Natural History. He concluded that Owen had mixed the partial distorted skull, teeth, and a mandible of a pareiasaur and a partial upper jaw of a dinosaur, BMNH 47338, which were from two different species. Broom kept the name Anthodon for the pareiasaur, but identified the other fossil as a member of the genus Palaeoscincus, naming the new species Paleoscincus africanus in 1912. He found that the anatomy of the teeth were quite different, even though they resembled each other, as well as those of Stegosaurus. In 1929, Franz Nopcsa, unaware of Broom's previous publication, provided a second novel name as D. M. S. Watson believed that the jaw should be differentiated from Anthodon. Nopcsa named the species Paranthodon Owenii, with the generic name derived from the Latin para, meaning \\"similar\\", \\"near\\", or \\"beside\\", and Anthodon, and specific name honouring Owen. Following modern conventions, the specific name was later emended to owenii. Both names were brought into the current nomenclature by Walter P. Coombs in his 1971 dissertation as the new combination Paranthodon africanus, as the name Paranthodon was the first new generic name for the fossils and africanus was the first new specific name. This makes Paranthodon africanus the proper name for the taxon previously known as Palaeoscincus africanus and Paranthodon owenii. =Material= Previously referred tooth (NHMUK R4992) The holotype of Paranthodon, BMNH 47338, was found in a layer of the Kirkwood Formation that has been dated between the Berriasian and early Valanginian ages. It consists of the back of the snout, containing the maxilla with teeth, the posterior caudodorsal ramus of the premaxilla, part of the nasals, and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw. One additional specimen was assigned to it based on the dentition, BMNH (now NHMUK) R4992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. Some bones that were unidentified by Galton & Coombs (1981) were described as a fragment of a vertebra in 2018 by Raven & Maidment. The teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of Paranthodon, and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008. The teeth were identified in 2018 as also lacking any distinct stegosaurian features, and were thus designated as Thyreophora indeterminate. The Mugher Mudstone of Ethiopia was screened in the 1990s by the University of California Museum of Paleontology, and in it were discovered multiple dinosaur teeth, pertaining to many groups of taxa. The locality has been described as \\"the largest and most complete record of dinosaur fossils from a Late Jurassic African locality outside of Tendaguru\\". Two of the partial teeth discovered were referred to Paranthodon by Lee Hall and Mark Goodwin in 2011. The reasons for the referral to Paranthodon were not discussed. Description alt=Silhouette of Paranthodon is shown to be three times longer than the human silhouette is tall Paranthodon was a small relative of larger stegosaurids such as Stegosaurus. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. estimated that the animal was long and weighed between . The snout is elongated, though not extremely so, and convex on top. The back of the premaxilla is long and broad, and the external nares are large. The teeth have a prominent primary ridge. The fossilised nasal and maxillary bones are relatively complete, and an incomplete premaxilla is also preserved. The partial snout resembles Stegosaurus in its large posterior premaxillary process and the extension of the palate. Stegosaurus was the only stegosaurid known from adequate cranial material to compare with Paranthodon during the 1981 review of the taxon, and even though their resemblance is great, tooth morphology is very distinguishing among the stegosaurians. For example, cranial material is known from Stegosaurus, Paranthodon, Kentrosaurus, and Tuojiangosaurus, and the tooth morphology differs in all of them. Maxilla and premaxilla in multiple views The premaxilla of Paranthodon is incomplete, but the anterior process is sinuous and curves ventrally. This is similar to in Miragaia, Huayangosaurus, the ankylosaur Silvisaurus, and Heterodontosaurus, but unlike in Chungkingosaurus, Stegosaurus, Edmontonia and Lesothosaurus. The premaxilla also lacks any teeth, like in every stegosaur except Huayangosaurus where the premaxilla is preserved. Like in Huayangosaurus but not Stegosaurus or Hesperosaurus, the nasal fenestra faces anterolaterally, being visible from the front and sides. The naris is longer than wide like in other stegosaurs, and also has a smooth internal surface, so it was most likely a simple passage. The maxilla is roughly triangular, as in most other thyreophorans. The tooth row is horizontal in lateral view, and in ventral view it is sinuous. Stegosaurus and Huayangosaurus possess a straight tooth row in ventral view, although Scelidosaurus and Jiangjunosaurus do not. The maxilla of Paranthodon preserves the tooth row, and shows that there is little to no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, where there is a large overhang of the maxilla. As with Stegosaurus and Silvisaurus, there is a diastema (gap in the tooth row) on the maxilla in front of the tooth row. The posterior maxilla is incomplete so no information is known about the jugal or lacrimal contact. Paranthodon has an elongate, dorsally convex nasal, like in most other stegosaurs. There are thickened ridges along the sides of the nasals. The preserved portion of the nasal does not contact the premaxilla or maxilla. Known vertebra fragments, compared to a complete Stegosaurus dorsal vertebra (F) Thirteen teeth are preserved in Paranthodon, but as they extend to the back of the maxilla there were possibly more in life. The teeth are symmetrical as in stegosaurs except Chungkingosaurus. Along the base of the tooth crown there is a swelling (cingulum), which is seen in all other known stegosaurid teeth except Huayangosaurus. The teeth have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent buccal margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth. As only two fragments of a vertebra are known, few anatomical details can be observed. The right transverse process and prezygapophysis are preserved. The vertebra is possibly a middle dorsal, based on the angle of the transverse process and the orientation of the prezygapophysis. Similar to Stegosaurus and Chungkingosaurus mid-dorsals, the transverse process is angled about 60¬∫ dorsally. Unlike in all other stegosaurs except Stegosaurus, the prezygapophysis faces dorsally. Classification Currently, Paranthodon is classified as a stegosaur related to Stegosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus, and Loricatosaurus. Initially, when Broom assigned the name Palaeoscincus africanus to the Paranthodon fossils, he classified them as an ankylosaurian. This classification was later changed by Nopcsa, who found that Paranthodon best resembled a stegosaurid (before the group was truly defined). Coombs (1978) did not follow Nopcsa's classification, keeping Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, like Broom, although he only classified it as Ankylosauria incertae sedis. A subsequent review by Galton and Coombs in 1981 instead confirmed Nopcsa's interpretation, redescribing Paranthodon as a stegosaurid from the Late Cretaceous. Paranthodon was distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large cingulum, and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla. restoration based on related stegosauriansalt=A small-headed dinosaur standing on four legs. The back has numerous bony plates extending upward. Multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed Paranthodon in Stegosauria, and often in Stegosauridae. A 2010 analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that Paranthodon was outside Stegosauridae, and in a polytomy with Tuojiangosaurus, Huayangosaurus, Chungkingosaurus, Jiangjunosaurus, and Gigantspinosaurus. When the latter two genera were removed, Paranthodon grouped with Tuojiangosaurus just outside Stegosauridae, and Huayangosaurus grouped with Chungkingosaurus in Huayangosauridae. An elaboration upon this analysis was published in 2017 by Susannah Maidment and Thomas Raven, and it resolved relationships within Stegosauria much more. All taxa were remained included, and Paranthodon grouped with Tuojiangosaurus, Huayangosaurus and Chunkingosaurus as the most basal true stegosaurians. The position of Alcovasaurus was uncertain, and further work could change the result. Below is the analysis. Nasal bones of Paranthodon in multiple views Other analyses have found Paranthodon closely related to Tuojiangosaurus, Loricatosaurus, and Kentrosaurus within Stegosaurinae. Even though phylogenetic analyses recognise Paranthodon as a stegosaurid, the type material bears no synapomorphies of Stegosauria. The material is likely of stegosaurian nature, and phylogenies by many authors have found it to be within the group. Paleoecology The Kirkwood Formation is in South Africa, and many fossils of different species and genera have been discovered in it, with Paranthodon being the first uncovered. The formation is of a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, with the oldest deposits from the Tithonian, about 145.5 million years ago, and the youngest rocks being from the Valanginian, about 130 million years ago. The specific vertebrate-bearing portion of the formation is approximately level with the upper region of the Sundays River Formation, which has been dated to 139 to 131 mya based on microfossils. A large variety of different animal groups have been found in the formation, including dinosaurs, at least two different sphenodontian lizards, multiple teleost fishes, a few crocodylians, some frog specimens, and also turtles. A large amount of the material of the Kirkwood formation only includes isolated teeth or partial and fragmentary pieces of bone. Dinosaurs of the formation include a basal tetanuran, the primitive ornithomimosaurian Nqwebasaurus, the sauropod Algoasaurus, a potential titanosaurian, many ornithischians including Paranthodon, a genus of iguanodontian, and a \\"hypsilophodontid\\" (the family Hypsilophodontidae is no longer considered to be a natural grouping). Multiple additional sauropod taxa have been discovered, including a basal eusauropod, a brachiosaurid, a dicraeosaurid and a derived diplodocid. If the referral of teeth from Ethiopia to Paranthodon is correct, then the taxon's geographic range is extended significantly. The Mugher locality is approximately 151 million years old, about 14 million older than has previously been suggested for Paranthodon, as well as across both southern and eastern Africa. The fauna in the Mugher locality differ from elsewhere of the same time and place in Africa. While the Tendaguru has abundant stegosaurs, sauropods, ornithopods and theropods, the Mugher Mudstone preserves the stegosaur Paranthodon, a hypsilophodontid ornithopod, a probable sauropod, and theropods related to Allosauridae and Dromaeosauridae.

The screws were not intended for propulsion, but were to aid the two rudders in steering in the confined waters and unpredictable currents of the Mississippi. The engines were taken from steamer Ingomar, but two months were needed for their transfer. The casemate extended her full length, less 25 feet at each end. It was covered by T-rail iron in two courses, while its top was encompassed by sheet iron bulwarks nearly four feet high.Still, Iron afloat,, p. 45; Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, p. 266. Construction was delayed by several circumstances. First was the lack of materials, particularly iron. Always in short supply in the Confederacy, its procurement was made even more difficult by the blockade and by Army demands on the overstrained railroads of the South. The blockade also negated efforts to bring in needed light oak from Florida, forcing the builders to find alternative sources. Labor troubles led to a strike that lost about a week. Even more time was lost to demands of the local militia, which called out the workers for drills, including parades. Competition for skilled workmen with the builders of CSS Mississippi, an ironclad being built in an adjacent shipyard by Nelson and Asa Tift, also slowed down construction, until Murray and the Tifts agreed to let Louisiana have first call on the labor force; Mississippi would go forward only when work on Louisiana was halted for some other reason. She was not ready to launch until 6 February 1862, nearly four months after the keel was laid.Still, Iron afloat,, pp. 45-46; Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, p. 266. In battle Deck plan drawing of CSS Louisiana Shortly after Louisiana was launched, the Federal West Gulf Blockading Squadron, under Flag Officer (later Admiral) David G. Farragut had moved into the lower Mississippi River, threatening the Confederate-held Forts Jackson and St. Philip, about 120 kilometers or 75 miles below New Orleans. A portion of the squadron, a division of mortar boats led by Commander (later Admiral) David Dixon Porter, had on 16 April 1862 taken position downstream, and on 18 April they began their bombardment. Brigadier General Johnson K. Duncan, commanding the forts, and his immediate superior officer, Major General Mansfield Lovell, importuned Commander William C. Whittle, in charge of Confederate naval forces in the vicinity, to bring the ship down to the forts, even though she was not yet complete, and for that reason was still in the hands of her builders. Whittle yieldedHe took the ship only under positive orders from Richmond, and against his better judgment. Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, p. 280. to their pleas, and on 20 April commissioned the vessel in the CS Navy, with Commander Charles F. McIntosh commanding. At this time, the main engines of Louisiana had been installed, but those for the screws, needed for steering, had not. Furthermore, the main engines were found to be inadequate; even at dangerously high boiler pressure, she could barely make headway against the river current. Unable to move on her own, she had to be towed down to the forts, with workmen still aboard. There she was tied to the left bank (near, the north side of the river) a short distance above Fort St. Philip. This did not completely mollify General Duncan, who wanted the ship to be positioned below the forts, but Commander Whittle would not risk his vessel, with unarmored deck, against the plunging fire of the Union mortars. She remained at this position throughout the ensuing battle.ORN I, v. 18, p. 290. In assessing the battle-readiness of the ship, the engines are not alone in deserving attention. Many of her gun carriages were found to be either too high or too low, and had to be modified. Because the workmen and their tools occupied much of the gun deck, the gun crews were unable to practice. In addition, the crew was incomplete, as a result of the hasty commissioning; to handle the guns, soldiers had to be transferred from the forts.ORN I, v. 18, pp. 290-293. After nearly a week of bombardment, Farragut concluded that it was ineffective, so he moved his fleet past the forts on the night of 24 April. Because of her position on the river bank, Louisiana could use neither her stern guns nor those on her port side. The magnitude of her contribution to the ensuing firefight between the forts and the Federal fleet is not known; General Duncan stated that she may have fired as few as twelve shots.ORN I, v. 18, p. 269. Duncan's phrasing is opaque. He implied that the report had not been confirmed, but he did not discredit it. On the other hand, testimony from her enemies indicates that she exchanged shots with at least one attacking ship, (misidentified as in the Confederate reports). Three shots from Louisiana went all the way through the Federal vessel, while the return broadside bounced harmlessly off the Rebel's armor. Indeed, the armor was effective; only three men were killed on Louisiana, all of them in exposed positions. One of them was her captain, Commander McIntosh.ORN I, v. 18, pp. 197, 295. Destruction The Louisiana explodes Once the Federal fleet had passed out of range, Louisiana had no further part in the action. Her fate was henceforth tied to that of the forts, which prepared for an expected attack by the Union army accompanying the fleet, led by Major General Benjamin Butler. However, on the night of 28 April, the enlisted men in Fort Jackson mutinied and forced the surrender of both forts to Commander Porter. The naval officers on Louisiana were not consulted at any time during the negotiations between Porter and General Duncan, so they considered themselves not bound to respect the truce declared by the two sides. While discussions of terms were going on, they decided not to let their ship fall into enemy hands. Louisiana was set afire, and her crew went ashore. The flames soon parted the lines that held her to the bank, and she drifted down the river. When she was nearly abreast of Fort St. Philip, the fire reached her magazine, and she blew up with a blast that killed a soldier there.ORN I, v. 18, pp. 298-299. Assessment Perhaps to counter charges that the Confederate Navy was responsible, by its inaction, for the failure of the forts to turn back Farragut's fleet, Commander John K. Mitchell, second in command under Commodore Whittle, pointed out several shortcomings of Louisiana, any one of which would have seriously compromised her fighting ability. :1. The arrangement of the paddlewheels meant that the after wheel was always in the wash of the other, with the result that its power was wasted. :2. The wash also created an eddy at the rudders, making it impossible to steer. :3. The gun ports were too small to allow either elevation or traverse. Consequently, she would have to fight at close range, and furthermore her guns covered only 40 degrees of azimuth. :4. The gun deck was uninhabitable in summer, particularly when the boilers were in use. Today The wreckage of the Louisiana lays at the bottom of the Mississippi River. In November 1981, it was magnetically located by NUMA. The official website of the search is here.

It was written by Mindy Kaling and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr. It first aired on March 16, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Jazz Raycole as Melissa Hudson, Delaney Ruth Farrell as Sasha Flenderson, Spencer Daniels as Jake Palmer, and Jake Kalender as a young Michael Scott. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Take Your Daughter to Work Day results in four children spending the day at the office‚ÄîToby Flenderson's (Paul Lieberstein) daughter Sasha, Stanley Hudson's (Leslie David Baker) daughter Melissa, Kevin Malone's (Brian Baumgartner) fianc√©e's daughter Abby, and Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) son Jake. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) tries to befriend at least one child and ends up doing so by befriending Jake. Melissa develops a crush on Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Michael Scott (Steve Carell) develops a friendship with Sasha, and tries to impress the children by claiming he was a child star, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) struggles to show secret girlfriend Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) that he can be stern with Jake. \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" was one of the last episodes filmed for the season. Due to the presence of actual children on the set, all of the main cast members had to tone down their behavior, making sure that no one cursed or told inappropriate jokes. The installment received largely positive reviews from television critics. \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" received a Nielsen rating of 4.2 and was seen by 8.8 million viewers. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is frustrated that Take Your Daughter to Work Day will force him to tone down his office antics. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) bring their daughters, Sasha (Delaney Ruth Farrell) and Melissa (Jazz Raycole) respectively, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) brings his fianc√©e's daughter, Abby, and Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) brings her son, Jake (Spencer Daniels). Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is determined to befriend one child by the end of the day. She tries with Abby, who instead takes a liking to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Jim enlists Abby in emotionally conning her relatives into buying paper from him. Sasha walks into Michael's office and plays with his toys, and after he jokes she becomes quite fond of him. Melissa develops a crush on Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and asks for his number. A jealous Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) alerts Stanley that Ryan may be up to something. Stanley angrily reprimands a confused Ryan for his \\"motives\\", which Ryan later describes as \\"one of the most frightening experiences\\" of his life. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) begins to read one of his childhood horror stories to the children, but Michael enters and insists that he stop upsetting the kids. Michael shows the children and the office a video of him as a child (Jake Kalender) during an appearance on a kid's show, where he revealed his dream was to \\"get married and have 100 kids, so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say 'no' to being my friend.\\" He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name \\"Little Kid Lover\\"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight upsets him with a childish insult, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing \\"Teach Your Children\\". Production right \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" was written by Mindy Kaling, who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series. The episode was directed by Victor Nelli Jr., making it his second directoral credit after the earlier episode \\"The Carpet\\". The episode was one of the last installments filmed for the season. In addition, the episode took five days to film. Each day, over twelve hours was devoted to filming. The episode guest stars Jazz Raycole as Melissa Hudson, Delaney Ruth Farrell as Sasha Flenderson, Spencer Daniels as Jake Palmer, and Jake Kalender as a young Michael Scott. Jenna Fischer noted that, due to the presence of actual children on the set, \\"everyone had to be on their best behavior\\", meaning that there was no \\"cursing and no dirty jokes allowed\\". She later said that \\"we aren't a 'G-rated' bunch by nature.\\" Fischer later joked that \\"candy is one of my weaknesses\\", but she was able to get through the filming of the episode without eating any of it. She explained that during the filming of the earlier second season episodes \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Valentine's Day\\", she had eaten a majority of the candy the crew put on her desk. The second season DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include the Party Planning Committee squabbling over what food to serve, Stanley complaining that his daughter is spoiled, Dwight discovering an eraser in his coffee courtesy of Jake, Kelly complaining to Pam that \\"Stanley's daughter is such a slut\\", and Jim giving Abby an official certificate of appreciation. Cultural references Pam notes that by putting out candy to lure in children, she is acting just like the witch in the fairy tale \\"Hansel and Gretel\\". Michael complains about having to censor himself with children around; he compares himself to Eddie Murphy in his movie Raw and notes \\"they\\" want to make him into Murphy in Daddy Day Care. Michael, Jim, and Dwight get into an argument about superheroes. Michael claims that he is like Superman defending Gotham City. Both Jim and Dwight correct him, and he says that he is more like Aquaman. Jim and Abby discuss the book From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and talk whether they would want to spend a night in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or an aquarium. Sasha asks Phyllis if she is Mother Goose. Dwight later reads the short story \\"Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher\\" from Heinrich Hoffmann's 1845 book Struwwelpeter. Michael later refers to it as a book that Dwight's \\"Nazi war-criminal\\" grandmother read to him. This starts a short discussion about Nazis. Michael argues that Dunder Mifflin is better than Office Depot with the children. He later shows them his performance on Fundle Bundle, a parody of \\"those crappy little local kids' shows that used to fill time on Saturday mornings before there were such things as infomercials\\". Michael and Dwight end the party by performing Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \\"Teach Your Children\\". In an episode of the Office Ladies podcast, it was revealed that \\"Fundle Bundle\\" was based on a show called \\"The Land Of Hatchy Milatchy\\" which aired in Scranton in the 1980s. Reception \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" originally aired on NBC on March 16, 2006. The episode received a 4.2 rating/11 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode was viewed by 8.8 million viewers, and retained 93 percent of its lead-in My Name is Earl audience. Alt URL The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the scene where the office realizes Michael's loneliness \\"absolutely one of the saddest moments I've seen in recent memory\\" and noted that \\"you can't help but feel for him\\". M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A\\". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict called the entry \\"another great episode\\" for the series and awarded it an \\"A‚Äì\\". He noted that by bringing the supporting characters' kids into the office \\"hilarity ensues\\". Babish applauded the lack of an arching plot, allowing \\"Michael's faux pas\\" to take center stage. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" the \\"best episode yet this season\\" and noted that \\"the writers will be hard-pressed to come up with a better story than this one.\\" Sciannamea called \\"the transformation of Michael's indifference over the kids to one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around\\" as the \\"most interesting aspect of the episode\\". He also called Dwight and Michael's sing-along near the end \\"the single funniest moment of the season\\".

Biography He was the son of R. Joseph, author of Gib'ot 'Olam, and a pupil of R. Simon Spira of Prague, who gave him in marriage the daughter of his son Benjamin Wolf. Reischer was dayyan at Prague, whence he was called to the rabbinate of Rzesz√≥w in Galicia, deriving his name Reischer from that city, which is known as Reische among the Jews. He was subsequently called to the rabbinate of Ansbach, and then occupied a similar position at Worms, from 1713 to 1719, when he went to Metz, officiating there until his death in February 1733. He is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Metz.

It lived during the Late Cretaceous. Its fossils have mainly been found in Uzbekistan; a referred species is known from China and Mongolia. Discovery and naming The type species, Asiaceratops salsopaludalis, was formally described by Lev Nesov, L.F. Kaznyshkina and Gennadiy Olegovich Cherepanov in 1989. The generic name combines a reference to Asia with ~ceratops, \\"horned face\\". The specific name means \\"of the salt marsh\\" in Latin. In the same publication Microceratops sulcidens Bohlin 1953 was renamed into a second species of Asiaceratops: Asiaceratops sulcidens.L.A. Nessov, L F. Kaznyshkina, and G.O. Cherepanov. 1989.

In: Bogdanova and Khozatskii (eds.), Theoretical and Applied Aspects of Modern Palaeontology pp 144-154 The holotype of Asiaceratops salsopaludalis, CCMGE 9/12457, was found in Uzbekistan in a layer of the Khodzhakul Formation dating from the early Cenomanian, about ninety-nine million years old. It consists of a part of a left maxilla. Some other fragments were in 1989 referred to the species, among them teeth and a phalanx. In 1995 Nesov referred more material, from three Uzbek sites, mostly skull elements and a partial humerus, of individuals of different ages.L.A.

University of California Press, Berkeley, pp 478-493 Classification Asiaceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned faces\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. All ceratopsians became extinct at the end of this era. In 1995 Nesov assigned Asiaceratops to an Asiaceratopsinae of its own. Recent cladistic analyses indicated, despite the presumed status as a nomen dubium, a basal position in the Leptoceratopsidae.M.J. Ryan, D.C. Evans, P.J. Currie, C.M. Brown, and D. Brinkman, 2012, \\"New leptoceratopsids from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada\\", Cretaceous Research 35(1): 69-80 Diet Asiaceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads, and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.

The complex includes nine venues and hosts numerous professional and amateur sporting events throughout the year. In reference to the weekly ABC Sports television show, Wide World of Sports, the complex was originally known as Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex from 1997 until 2010 when it was re-branded with Disney's ESPN trademark. The rebranding was unveiled on February 25, 2010. The complex is a part of the sports tourism emerging market. The complex is mainly used for AAU tournaments; however, many prominent professional sporting events have taken place here, including the restart to the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season, MLS is Back Tournament, 2016 Invictus Games, Pro Bowl skills competition from 2017 to 2020, 1997 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, and Atlanta Braves spring training from 1997 to 2019 among other events. The complex will host the 2022 Special Olympics USA Games. History Disney built the US$100 million facility on former wetlands under the direction of Disney Vice President Reggie Williams. Construction started in July 1995. The complex was built to: * Publicize Walt Disney World * Fill hotel rooms * Grow sponsorship revenue * Build Walt Disney World's position as a sports destination. =Disney-branded= The venue opened on March 28, 1997, with an exhibition baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. On April 21‚Äì27, the main tennis courts hosted the U.S. Men's Clay Court Tennis Championships. A grand opening was held May 15, 1997. The initial build out consisted of nine venues with a 10th, the Olympic velodrome, expected in the third quarter 1997. Initial tenants were Braves & its rookie team, the Harlem Globetrotters, NFL Experience, the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, Amateur Athletic Union, Official All Star Caf√© and Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society.:2 Disney bid for the Florida state high school football finals for 1997 but lost to Gainesville. In June 1999, the complex made a deal with the Florida High School Activities Association to host the state prep volleyball championships at the Disney Fieldhouse for three years. USA Trampoline and Tumbling Championships was held at the complex the weekend of June 7, 1997. A former baseball umpire and an architect alleged that they approached The Walt Disney Company in 1987 with plans for a sports complex, and that Wide World of Sports, which opened 10 years later, was heavily based on their designs. Disney claimed that, while the designs had some similarities, the complex was also similar to numerous other sporting facilities, and the concept of a sports park was too generic for any one group to claim ownership. The two men, represented in part by noted attorney Johnnie Cochran, sued Disney in Orange County civil court. In August 2000, a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs with damages in the amount of $240 million, a fraction of the $1.5 billion sought. Disney appealed the judgment, and settled out of court in September 2002 for undisclosed terms. With Planet Hollywood just out of bankruptcy, Disney offered to purchase its All Star Caf√© located here in February 2000 and acquired the lease in March 2000. It became What's Next? Cafe in 2007 before being rebranded as ESPN Wide World of Sports Grill in 2010.https://waltdatedworld.com/id155.htm In August 2004, 20 acres of additional fields, four baseball diamonds with other multi-use fields, were added under the name of Hess Sports Fields. Plans for a 100 lane bowling stadium with restaurant was announced for the complex by Disney officials in May 2008. This stadium would be built and operated by a third party and was supposed to completed in 18 months. About 13 United States Bowling Congress tournaments were expected for facility. =ESPN-branded= During an ESPN the Weekend kick off event on February 25, 2010, the complex was rebranded as the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. It received a massive upgrade, having installed HD video scoreboards at several venues, a new complex-wide audio system, and a broadcast production facility. New venues and activities at the complex included the PlayStation Pavilion and Custom Tee Center by Champion. Prior to the rebranding in 2007, Disney announced a 450-acre Flamingo Crossings hotel-and-retail development. It would be located near the area for complex visitors and budget-minded Disney World visitors. Shelved due to economic downturn, the project was revived with the 2013 sale of the property to first phase developer JL Properties Inc. of Alaska. An October 16, 2014, groundbreaking took place for the first phase, consisting of two Marriott International brand hotels which opened in January 2016. In 2008 and 2009, the Disney Channel Games were held at the complex. May 9‚Äì11, 2014, a WNBA pre- season tournament consisting of four teams was held alongside an AAU girls basketball tournament at the complex, with the Minnesota Lynx winning the tournament over the Chicago Sky 76‚Äì69. While the Citrus Bowl was under repairs, the Orlando City Soccer Club played its 2014 home games at the complex. In July 2015, it was announced that the 2016 Invictus Games would be held at the complex. The Invictus Games were held from May 8 to 12, 2016. Prince Harry, Michelle Obama, and Morgan Freeman all spoke at the Opening and Closing ceremony. Over 500 service members were in attendance, along with other notable public figures, including former United States President George W. Bush and Second Lady Jill Biden. In early January 2018, The Arena opened at the complex as its third indoor multi-purpose sports and entertainment arena. Also that month, United States Specialty Sports Association left for the Space Coast Complex in Viera, Florida ending its use of ESPN's complex. Since 2017, the Complex is host of the NFL Pro Bowl activities prior to the game. Besides having open practices for fans, ESPN broadcasts the Pro Bowl Skills Showdown, a series of head-to-head competitions between the players. According to event organizers, over the last four years, the Pro Bowl and festivities surrounding it have generated an estimated $100-million economic impact for Central Florida. In March 2019, it was announced that Wide World of Sports would host the 2022 Special Olympics USA Games. NBA and MLS hosting (2020) In May 2020, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, there were news reports that both the MLS and NBA were in talks with Disney to host the teams to have their respective seasons in the complex. It was even reported the ESPN complex is in the process of renovating the facilities to be able to host the teams. It was then confirmed that the complex would host both leagues. The 2020 Major League Soccer season is to be hosted via the MLS is Back Tournament, which would host three regular season matches for each of the 26 teams as well as a World Cup-style tournament to determine a berth into the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League for a total of 54 matches from July 8 to August 11.ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex Welcomes Back Major League Soccer, Hosting MLS is Back Tournament Disney Parks Blog Meanwhile, the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season would conclude at the AdventHealth Arena, HP Field House, and the Visa Athletic Center. 22 teams were invited: the 16 teams in playoff position at the time of the season being put on hold due to the pandemic, including the host Orlando Magic, and the six teams within six games of the eighth and final playoff spot in either conference.

Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Carteaux (31 January 1751 ‚Äì 12 April 1813) was a French painter who became a General in the French Revolutionary Army. He is notable chiefly for being the young Napoleon Bonaparte's commander at the siege of Toulon in 1793. History Louis XVI as a citizen-king, painting by Carteaux Born in 1751, Carteaux followed the career of a painter, producing several works including a portrait of King Louis XVI on horseback. Following the French Revolution, he became a General and given a command of the Army of the Alps, despite the fact he had achieved no military training. Soon after his arrival, Carteaux was given the task of defeating a force of royalist Proven√ßal rebels. On 16 July 1793 he succeeded in defeating the small rebel force. In early August 1793, Carteaux was ordered to Marseille where he was given command of the efforts to recapture the vital port of Toulon. The citizens of Toulon had not only openly rebelled, but had granted the British and Spanish fleets access to the harbour. On 25 August Carteaux began the siege of Toulon. Carteaux handled the siege ineptly, concentrating his efforts on the relatively unimportant town of Ollioules. During these battles, Carteaux's artillery commander, Elz√©ar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin, was severely wounded and the Army was left with no capable artillery commander. Despite this, Carteaux focused his efforts on the construction of a battery in a gully near Ollioules, which he imagined would be able to bring fire to bear on the Anglo-Neapolitan ships. Once the battery was completed, it became apparent that the harbour was beyond its range. On 8 September a 6,000 man detachment from the Arm√©e d'Italie under the command of Jean Fran√ßois Cornu de La Poype arrived to the east of Toulon and began operations independently of Carteaux' force. Seeing the lack of progress of Carteaux and the ineptitude of his artillery, the officials from the Committee of Public Safety, Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti designated the young Artillery captain Napoleon Bonaparte as Carteaux new artillery commander. With the backing of the all-powerful Robespierre and Saliceti, the dynamic Bonaparte quickly devised a plan for the capture of forts l'Eguillette and Balaguier. Bonaparte correctly surmised that the capture of these would allow accurate fire to be brought to bear on the Anglo- Neapolitan fleet and force it to abandon Toulon. Carteaux was not convinced and ordered a half-hearted attack under the command of Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde. This attack not only failed, it also brought the importance of the position to the attention of the Anglo-Neapolitans, who immediately began strengthening their positions. Following this dismal failure, Carteaux allowed Bonaparte to begin construction of several batteries with which to bombard the newly reinforced Anglo-Neapolitan fortresses. Bonaparte virtually took control of the operation, despite Carteaux's protests that the army was his command. Late in October, Napoleon sent a letter to the Convention, complaining about the quality of his superiors, calling them a bunch of fools. As a result, Carteaux was relieved of his command on 11 November 1793 and for a while was imprisoned. He was replaced in rapid succession by La Poype and Fran√ßois Am√©d√©e Doppet who were then replaced by Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier. Despite his imprisonment, Carteaux survived the Reign of Terror and was later sent to fight in the War in the Vend√©e. When Bonaparte was elected First Consul, he appointed Carteaux as Administrator of the Loterie Royale de France.

The pieces were sold exclusively at its stores; the line almost instantly sold out. The line's second season was equally, if not more successful, with Fred Segal re- ordering its stock midway through the season. =2006= For the 2006 spring collection, each piece had a name that paid homage to art, literature or film. The dress worn for the CS (California Style) photo shoot was known as the \\"Carly\\", after Carly Simon. There was also the \\"Vivian\\", a white lace minidress inspired by illustrations of early 20th century artist Henry Darger, and a floral piece named \\"Sissy\\", which Jovovich dubbed \\"a Carrie prom dress\\" after Sissy Spacek's role in the horror film Carrie. In April, Jovovich and Hawk launched the Jovovich‚ÄìHawk clothing range at Harvey Nichols in London. In November, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and US Vogue nominated Jovovich‚ÄìHawk as for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award. The award was founded three years ago and underwritten by Vogue, Barneys New York, Coach, Juicy Couture, Kellwood Company, Nordstrom and Theory, with additional support from Gucci. The winner would receive $200,000 as well as a year of industry guidance and support. Jovovich‚ÄìHawk was nominated as a finalist, with Doo-Ri Chung taking the top prize. =2007‚Äì2008= In 2007, Jovovich‚ÄìHawk participated in FashionWeekLive, a tour produced by IMG Fashion that also included collections by Anne Klein and Badgley Mischka. Jovovich‚ÄìHawk also teamed together with Mango to create a limited edition special collection for Spring 2007. The Jovovich‚ÄìHawk for MNG collection would feature 10 dresses with a 1960s theme. In Jovovich's film, Resident Evil: Extinction, the costume she wore is a Jovovich‚ÄìHawk design. The shorts Alice, her character, wears are a variation on the \\"Alice Star\\" Shorts from the Spring 2007 collection. For the Fall 2007 collection, titled Le Petit Mort, the two drew inspiration from \\"everything from very classic Irving Penn to a Versailles whore in an alley in Paris.\\" In August 2007, Jovovich‚ÄìHawk participated with other designers to create a limited edition T-shirt for \\"Fashion Gives Back\\", Glamour's initiative to help benefit the \\"Malaria No More\\" organization. For every T-shirt sold, \\"Malaria No More\\" would donate bed nets to women in Tanzania. In early September, Jovovich-Hawk participated in the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City to showcase their Spring 2008 line. It was announced in late 2007 that Jovovich and Hawk signed a deal to design a diffusion collection for Target's Go International campaigns, following in the footsteps of Luella, Paul & Joe and Proenza Schouler. In the winter of 2007, Jovovich and Hawk shot a TV commercial for the collection in Los Angeles which was then shown during the New York Mercedes Benz Fall '08 Fashion Week in February 2008. The collection debuted on March 2, 2008. =Ceasing of operations= Jovovich‚ÄìHawk ceased operations as of mid-2008. Jovovich explained that the business folded because of increased demands on both her and Hawk's time, and because the business simply grew too big for them. \\"It was actually really amazing when we were very private and doing everything in-house, sewing all the clothes in- house, but as soon as the orders got too big and we had to outsource, it was disaster with production companies and factories. I mean, we just couldn't handle it,\\" Jovovich said. \\"We were two artist girls who didn't have our business together.\\" Jovovich further explained, \\"I'm an artist. I'm not someone who can deal with shipping rates and taxes.\\" http://millaj.com/pics/townandcountry08093.jpg She considers their Target line the final farewell to the public. \\"We were like, all right, let's end on a high note.\\" Jovovich plans to design again on a smaller scale in the future.http://millaj.com/model/jovovich-hawk.shtml References External links * *Jovovich-Hawk at Milla Jovovich's official website *Jovovich-Hawk at MySpace Clothing brands of the United States Clothing companies of the United States Products introduced in 2003 Companies based in Los Angeles 2008 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"Jovovich‚ÄìHawk"},{"id":"4290059","text":"Interstate 95 (I-95), the main Interstate Highway on the east coast of the United States, cuts through the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire. The majority of it, from the Massachusetts border to the Portsmouth Circle in Portsmouth, is the GRANIT GIS data - NH Public Roads Blue Star Turnpike or New Hampshire Turnpike, a toll road maintained by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) Bureau of Turnpikes. The final piece in Portsmouth splits from the turnpike south of the circle, running to the Piscataqua River Bridge, a steel arch bridge, towards Maine and the Maine Turnpike. In its short length through New Hampshire, Interstate 95 traverses six municipalities: Seabrook, Hampton Falls, Hampton, North Hampton, Greenland, and Portsmouth. Route description View south along I-95 just after crossing the Piscataqua River Bridge from Maine I-95 crosses from Massachusetts into New Hampshire in the town of Seabrook. There is a welcome center just north of the Massachusetts state line. The Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant is accessible via exit 1. The highway then continues through the coast towns of Hampton Falls and Hampton, with state-run liquor stores just prior to exit 2. I-95 interchanges with New Hampshire Route 101 (NH 101) in Hampton, then comes to a toll plaza soon after. That interchange also contains a ramp toll used by all traffic passing between the turnpike and NH 101. Traffic using the turnpike that does not pass by or use exit 2 does not pay a toll. I-95 then continues through the towns of North Hampton and Greenland before entering the city of Portsmouth. Near the north end, a connection to the Portsmouth Circle provides access to U.S. Route 1 Bypass (US 1 Byp.) and the Spaulding Turnpike (US 4/NH 16). I-95 crosses into Maine less than from the Portsmouth Circle. History The turnpike opened in 1950 as a four-lane highway parallel to US 1 and was widened to eight lanes in 1976. The blue turnpike shield for the New Hampshire Turnpike is no longer in use, but was similar to the present-day signs for the Spaulding Turnpike and Everett Turnpike. From its designation in 1957 until 1972, I-95 in Portsmouth did not connect to I-95 in Kittery, Maine. Instead, the expressway ended at the Portsmouth Circle. From there, motorists followed US 1 Bypass via the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge to a junction near the Kittery Circle with US 1. This bridge connected the New Hampshire and Maine Turnpikes. It was a drawbridge over the Piscataqua waterway, which created problems on busy days with frequent ship traffic. Not only was this an obstacle to traffic, but the bridge was a narrow three-lane undivided roadway where the center lane could either be used in the direction of the greatest traffic flow or left closed for greater safety. Lane identification was accomplished via repeated banks of three traffic lights, one over each lane, and was the reason for the third (center) traffic light on the bridge. This bridge has since been replaced by another drawbridge with the same name. Furthermore, US 1 Bypass is not a controlled-access highway, but an all-access divided highway (similar to US 1 between Saugus and Boston in Massachusetts). As far as most motorists were concerned, I-95 ended at the Portsmouth Circle and restarted in Kittery. The Piscataqua River Bridge, which unlike the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge is not a drawbridge, was completed in the early 1970s to correct this problem. Four construction workers fell to their deaths during construction of the bridge. Exit list Exit numbers are sequential.

The Lansing Board of Water & Light also provides steam and chilled water services within the City of Lansing.  History  The Lansing Board of Water & Light is a municipal utility, owned by the citizens of Lansing, Michigan. The utility's roots go back to 1885, when Lansing citizens approved a $100,000 bond issue to build a water system to provide for drinking water and fire protection. Electricity was added to its list of utility services in 1892, and steam heat in 1919.  System Information  The Lansing Board of Water & Light has an electric generating capacity of 510 megawatts. The BWL's transmission line voltage is 138,000 volts. The BWL's distribution voltages are 13,200/7,620Y, 8,320/4,800Y and 4,160/2,400Y. The Lansing Board of Water & Light pumps an average of approximately 23 million gallons per day (MGD) from two conditioning plants through approximately of water main. Maximum daily demand is on the order of 33 MGD, while the maximum hourly demand rate can be on the order of 42 MGD. Raw water is obtained exclusively by pumping from 124 wells located throughout the Lansing area. All system pressure is generated via pumping; the Lansing Board of Water & Light does not maintain any elevated water storage tanks.  Water Utility  The Lansing Board of Water & Light obtains all raw water from a series of wells located throughout the city of Lansing, making it one of the few public utilities for large cities that provides water exclusively from wells. The city sits atop, and draws its water from, the Saginaw Aquifer, a natural, but limited,McKenna, Brian. E-M:/ Study: The Saginaw Aquifer under Ingham County estimated to be 4 cubic miles! That is four times larger than Lake St. Clair (1 cubic mile)!, EnviroMich Listserv, www.greatlakes.net, Feb 18, 2001, retrieved 2012-Nov-4 underground reservoir , and in size. The raw water is pumped directly to two conditioning plants: the John Dye plant located in downtown Lansing and the Wise Road plant located on the southwest side of the city. At these plants, water hardness is reduced from approximately 411 parts per million (ppm) to about 85 ppm. The finished water is then chlorinated and fluorinated, and sent to storage prior to distribution. At the John Dye conditioning plant, two pumping stations draw finished water from three ground level storage facilities and pump to the distribution system. The Dye pump station, pumps water to the north towards Dewitt Township, Bath Township, and Watertown Township, to the west to Delta Township, and to the local distribution system. The Cedar Street pump station provides supplemental pumping capacity during periods of high demand. The Wise Road conditioning plants similarly pumps water directly into the distribution system, and generally feeds portions of Windsor Township, Delhi Township, and Alaiedon Township. The Lansing Board of Water & Light retail customers consist of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the service areas, totaling approximately 56,000 customers. Approximately 48,000 of these customers are residential, 7,000 commercial, while the remaining customers consist of industrial customers. In addition, the Lansing Board of Water & Light sells water on a wholesale basis to the local distribution systems in Delta Township and Meridian Township.  Electric Utility  Otto E. Eckert Station. BWL's largest power plant is the Otto E. Eckert Station, and was named after the utility's general manager from 1927 to 1966. The coal-fired generating station is located in downtown Lansing on the Grand River, adjacent to General Motors' Grand River Assembly Plant and the now-demolished Lansing Car Assembly Plant. Begun in 1922 and completed the following year, the power station has undergone numerous expansions and additions since, with the addition of the three chimneys in 1981. The station has a generating capacity of 351 megawatts, produced by burning coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin. This plant has three smokestacks, the tallest self-supporting structures in south central Michigan. These stacks are visible from fifteen miles (24 km) on a clear day. The stacks are known locally by the names of Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, after the fishermen in a poem of the same name by Eugene Field. It was announced in December 2017 that the plant decommissioning has been accelerated, and is now scheduled to go offline in 2020. The BWL's secondary generating plant is the Claud R. Erickson Station, named after general manager of the utility from 1966 to 1972. The plant located in Delta Township on Canal Road just south of Mt. Hope Road. This plant, built in 1973, is coal-fired and has a single generating unit with a capacity of 159 megawatts and is connected to the power grid by three 138,000 volt lines. The LBWL announced in December 2017 that they would be replacing Erickson Station with a $500 million natural gas-fired power plant capable of generating 250 megawatts to be completed by 2021. As an eventual replacement for the aging Eckert Station, the utility began operating the REO Town Cogeneration Plant on July 1, 2013.Howell, Brandon.

It also includes the utility's headquarters and a restored Grand Trunk Western Railroad depot, which is used as the boardroom for the utility and as meeting space. To achieve the state- mandated 10% renewable energy requirement, the company has built or acquired power through purchase agreements from several new sources.

The BWL has two 138KV interconnections (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis- Enterprise line) with Consumers Energy/METC from its substation on Jolly Road just east of Pennsylvania Ave on Lansing's south side. The utility also owns a portion of Detroit Edison's Belle River Power Plant near St. Clair, Michigan.http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/22806 The utility's power plant inventory once included the 25 megawatt Ottawa Street Station on the Grand River in downtown Lansing. This steam and electrical plant operated from its completion in 1940 until 1992, when it was decommissioned as a power station, with steam and electrical production transferred to the Eckert Station. The station was put back into partial usage as a water chiller plant for the utility in 2001 to cool downtown buildings. In late 2007, LBWL sold the mostly vacant station to Accident Fund Insurance Company, which was renovated into their headquarters. At the end of December of that year, in preparation for the renovation, the iconic smokestack portion of the building was taken down.

American Journal of Science, series 3, 14: 87‚Äì88 Marsh soon learned that the name Titanosaurus had already been used earlier that year by Richard Lydekker to describe a different sauropod from India, so he renamed it Atlantosaurus montanus. Marsh estimated the length of the animal at twenty- four metres, \\"if built like a crocodile\\". The skeletal remains discovered, two or three posterior sacral vertebrae connected to the ilia, were initially distinguished by their immense size and by the pleurocoels (air-filled pockets) in the vertebrae. However, since the time of its discovery, these features have been found to be widespread among sauropods, making it nearly impossible to distinguish the two known vertebrae of Atlantosaurus from those of its relatives. Since it is unclear whether or not Atlantosaurus montanus actually represents a distinct species, it is considered a nomen dubium (\\"dubious name\\"), McIntosh, J. S. (1990). Sauropoda. In D. B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H.

Discovery and species  The remains were discovered by Mr. H.B. Wade on Clutha Station near Maxwelton in north Queensland in 1932, who alerted the station manager H. Mackillop, who showed his brother who sent them to the Queensland Museum. Austrosaurus was described by Heber Longman in 1933.  Paleobiology  Originally it was thought that sauropods spent time near or in water to relieve weight from their legs. However, this theory is now rejected and it is believed that Austrosaurus like all sauropods lived on dry land. Fossil finds suggest a height of approximately 3.9 metres at the hip and 4.1 metres at the shoulder, which would have given it an almost level back. According to Gregory S. Paul, it was 20 meters long and weighed about 16, 000 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 206  Classification  Initially, Austrosaurus was considered a cetiosaurid, like Patagosaurus or Shunosaurus.

The type species, Azendohsaurus laaroussii, was described and named by Jean-Michel Dutuit in 1972 based on partial jaw fragments and some teeth from Morocco. A second species from Madagascar, A. madagaskarensis, was first described in 2010 by John J. Flynn and colleagues from a multitude of specimens representing almost the entire skeleton. The generic name \\"Azendoh lizard\\" is for the village of Azendoh, a local village near where it was first discovered in the Atlas Mountains. It was a bulky quadruped that unlike other early archosauromorphs had a relatively short tail and robust limbs that were held in an odd mix of sprawled hind limbs and raised forelimbs. It had a long neck and a proportionately small head with remarkably sauropod-like jaws and teeth. Azendohsaurus used to be classified as a herbivorous dinosaur, at first as an ornithischian but more often as a \\"prosauropod\\" sauropodomorph. This was based only on its jaws and teeth, which share derived features typically found in herbivorous dinosaurs. The complete skeletal material from Madagascar, however, revealed more basal characteristics ancestral to Archosauromorpha and that Azendohsaurus was not a dinosaur at all. Instead, Azendohsaurus was actually a more primitive archosauromorph that had convergently evolved many features of the jaws and skeleton shared with the later giant sauropod dinosaurs. It was found to be a member of a newly recognised group of specialised, mostly herbivorous archosauromorphs that was named the Allokotosauria. It is also the namesake and typifier of its own family of allokotosaurs, the Azendohsauridae; initially the only member, the family now includes other similar allokotosaurs, such as the larger, horned azendohsaurid Shringasaurus from India. Several other groups of archosauromorphs also adapted to herbivory in the Triassic, sometimes with dinosaur-like teeth that also caused confusion in their classification. Azendohsaurus is notable, however, for also convergently evolving a similar body shape to sauropodomorphs in addition to its jaws and teeth. Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorphs likely independently evolved to fill a similar ecological niche as long-necked, relatively high browsing herbivores in their environments. However, Azendohsaurus predates the large Late Triassic sauropodomorphs it resembles by several million years, and did not evolve similar body plans under the same environmental conditions. It may then have been one of the first herbivores to fill the high-browsing role that only large sauropodomorphs were thought to occupy during the Triassic, expanding the known ecological diversity of herbivorous archosauromorphs outside of dinosaurs in the Triassic Period. Azendohsaurus is also significant as it may be one of the earliest endothermic archosauromorphs known, and suggests that a warm-blooded metabolism was ancestral to the later archosaurs, including the dinosaurs. Description Azendohsaurus was a stocky mid-sized reptile estimated to be roughly long. It had a small, box-shaped head with a short snout on a long neck that was raised above the shoulders. The body was broad, with a barrel-shaped chest and shoulders much taller than the hips, together with an unusually short tail. Its posture was semi-sprawled, with sprawling hind limbs and slightly elevated forelimbs. The limbs themselves are relatively short and particularly robust, with digits that are shorter and stouter compared to other early archosauromorphs, each with notably large, curved claws on all four feet. Superficially its appearance is comparable to that of sauropodomorph dinosaurs, along with various details of its skeleton, suggesting Azendohsaurus converged on similar traits for a relatively high- browsing, herbivorous lifestyle. A. laaroussii is poorly known compared to A. madagaskarensis, and the two species are only known to differ in minor details of the jaw bones and teeth. Additional skeletal material of A. laaroussii has been reported from the type locality of the original skull fragments, but have yet to be formally described as of 2015. =Skull= Skull diagram of Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis The skull of A. madagaskarensis is almost completely known, and is robustly built with a short and boxy shape and a deep snout. The premaxillae are gently curved at the front of the upper jaw, forming a blunt, round snout tip, while the lower jaws have a deep, down- turned tip like those of sauropods. The bony nostrils are fused into a single (confluent) opening that faces forwards at the front of the snout, similar to those of rhynchosaurs. The skull has a number of traits convergent with sauropodomorphs, including the downward curving dentary, a robust dorsal process of the maxilla, and several features of the teeth. The process on the maxilla usually indicates the presence of an antorbital fenestra in archosauriforms, but in Azendohsaurus this space is occupied by the lacrimal bone in front of the eyes. This is a unique arrangement unknown in other Triassic archosauromorphs, except for the related Shringasaurus. The orbits are almost entirely occupied by the large sclerotic rings, suggesting large eyes. The lower temporal fenestra is open at the bottom, separating the jugal and the quadratojugal bones (a primitive trait for archosauromorphs). Also like other early archosauromorphs, Azendohsaurus has a small (3‚Äì5 mm across) parietal foramen (\\"third eye\\") on the roof of the skull. pterygoid, showing the numerous rows palatal teeth The lower jaw is especially convergent with those of sauropodomorphs, with an articular joint where the jaw hinges positioned below the level of the tooth row and downward curving dentaries, as well as the similarly shaped teeth. These features are variously found in other herbivorous Triassic archosauromorphs, but this combination is only known in Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorphs. The teeth are all roughly leaf- shaped (lancoelate) with expanded crowns and bulbous bases that are fused to the jaw bones (ankylothecodont). However, the upper and lower teeth are distinctly heterodont, and can be readily distinguished from each other. The upper teeth are relatively short and broad at their base, with 4‚Äì6 denticles on each surface, similar to ornithischians; the lower teeth are almost twice as tall and have twice as many denticles, more closely resembling the teeth of sauropodomorphs. The four premaxillary teeth are the longest teeth in the upper jaw, and are more recurved back in shape than the rest. Medial view of a right maxilla from A. madagaskarensis, showing the keel on its rear half The palate is unusually covered in numerous fully developed palatal teeth, with up to four sets on the pterygoid and additional rows on the palatine and vomers. Mature Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis have at least 44 pairs of palatal teeth, in addition to the 4 teeth in each premaxilla and 11‚Äì13 in the maxilla each, along with a maximum of 17 teeth in the dentary. Palatal teeth are not uncommon in herbivorous reptiles, but in Azendohsaurus they are almost identical in shape to those along the jaw margins, but a bit stouter. Other archosauromorphs with palatal teeth have a much simpler palatal dentition of small, domed teeth. Teraterpeton is the only other archosauromorph with similarly well developed palatal teeth. The only described material of A. laaroussii are dentaries, maxillae, a premaxilla and several teeth. They broadly resemble A. madagaskarensis in general form but with a few distinguishing differences. The tooth count of A. laaroussii is higher, with 15‚Äì16 teeth in the maxilla compared to the 11‚Äì13 of A. madagaskarensis. The teeth of A. laaroussii are also taller than those of A. madagaskarensis and have more closely packed denticles. Further distinguishing the two species is the presence of a prominent keel on the inside surface of the maxilla. This keel runs the whole length of the maxilla in A. laaroussii, but is only found along the back half of it in A. madagaskarensis. Any other possible differences between the two species cannot be determined without rest of the skull and skeleton. =Skeleton= All the known post-cranial information for the skeleton of Azendohsaurus comes from A. madagaskarensis. Much of the vertebral column is known in Azendohsaurus, and although incomplete, it is estimated to have 24 presacral vertebrae (including the atlas and axis). The sacrum of the hips has only two vertebrae, and the full number of caudal vertebrae in the tail is unknown, but it is estimated to be only around 45‚Äì55 (low for an archosaur). The cervical vertebrae change shape down the neck, beginning as characteristically elongated with long and low neural spines, and getting progressively shorter in length towards the base of the neck, but with increasingly taller and narrower neural spines. This shortening is seen in the necks of other allokotosaurs like Trilophosaurus, but is not found in other long-necked archosauromorphs (e.g. the middle cervicals are the longest in tanystropheids). The neck would have been held raised up above the body, indicated by the inclined angle of the zygapophyses that connect each vertebra, as well as the front zygapophyses of each vertebra being higher than those at the back. The neck was also likely held in a gentle arc, based on an articulated set of cervicals in this position. Medial view of a right palatine of A. madagaskarensis with palatal teeth The dorsal vertebrae of the back generally resemble the last cervicals, with tall, vertical neural spines. These vertebrae also decrease in length down the back, but less dramatically than in the neck. The last dorsal is unique, however, as it has a neural spine angled forward. Of the two sacrals, the first vertebra is larger and more robust, with a tall neural spines over its rear half. Both sacrals have large ribs completely fused to the vertebrae that articulate with the ilia (see below). The caudal vertebrae resemble the other vertebrae, but with backward inclined neural spines. The length of the caudals and the height of the neural spines gradually decreases down the tail, unlike some other archosauromorphs where the vertebrae elongate towards the tip. This implies that the tail was short and not tapering, but the very tip of the tail is unknown. They consistently have chevron facets from the 3rd or 4th vertebrae down to the last known caudals in the series. The cervical ribs are long and thin, becoming more robust and tapered as they move down the neck. Some of the cervical ribs from bottom half of the neck have a slight facet on the inside surface at their tips that may have held the tip of the preceding rib, forming a rigid cervical rib series (also suggested for the long necked Tanystropheus) that would stiffen the neck. The trunk ribs are long and curve outwards, indicating Azendohsaurus had a broad and deep barrel-shaped chest. The length and curvature of the ribs decreases down the spine, and the last rib is short, fused completely to the final dorsal vertebra, and points directly outwards to the sides. Only a single set of gastralia is known for Azendohsaurus, and their very delicate build and rarity compared to other bones suggests that it did not have a well developed basket of gastralia under the belly like some other archosauromorphs (e.g. Proterosuchus). Limbs and girdles Premaxilla of A. madagaskarensis with teeth The forelimbs and shoulders (pectoral girdle) of Azendohsaurus are well developed and robust. The scapula (shoulder blade) is long, about twice as tall as it is wide, matching the length and curvature of the ribs to accommodate the deep chest. The blade is concave on each side with a slightly expanded tip that is pointed at the back. The interclavicle is large and robust, and shares with Trilophosaurus and some rhynchosaurs a long \\"paddle-like\\" posterior process that is flattened and expanded towards the tip. It also has a unique forward-pointing process, a feature it shares only with Protorosaurus and some early diapsids (most other archosauromorphs have a notch instead). The coracoids are large and rounded, articulating with the scapula to form the glenoid (shoulder socket). The glenoid faces laterally, typical of sprawling reptiles, however, the scapular portion is directed slightly backwards, which could indicate the humerus was held in a more raised posture. The humerus itself is large and broadly expanded at both ends, leaving a relatively narrow \\"waisted\\" mid-shaft, with a very well developed deltopectoral crest. The radius is similarly stocky with slightly expanded ends, while the ulna is greatly expanded at both ends, though to a lesser extent distally. The hips (pelvic girdle) are not as deep as the shoulders, with the three hip bones being roughly equal in size. The illium is tall and curved along the top surface, with a short rounded process at the front and a longer tapering process behind it. The pubis points down and slightly forwards, and only has a slightly thickened expansion (boot) at the tip. The ischium is relatively short, shorter than the illium, and roughly triangular in shape with straight edges and a rounded rear tip. The articulation surfaces between each ischia are unusually expanded compared to other archosauromorphs. All three contribute to forming a deep, rounded acetabulum (hip socket). Unlike the open socket of dinosaurs, the internal wall of the acetabulum in Azendohsaurus is solid bone. The large sacral ribs articulate with the illium so that it is held almost vertically, angled only slightly downwards, with the hip socket facing out away from the body. The femur is long and vaguely S-shaped, with a slightly expanded head that is not turned inwards, unlike those of dinosaurs, indicating it was not held upright. The femur is also twisted along its shaft so that the faces of the head and the knee are offset from each other by about ~75¬∞. The tibia is roughly 75% the length of the femur, slightly bowed out, and is very robust compared those of other archosauromorphs except for the largest rhynchosaurs. The fibula by contrast is slender and more prominently twisted along its length. The extremities of Azendohsaurus are well represented in the fossils, including both a complete hand (manus) and foot (pes) each in articulation. All of the carpals and tarsal bones are well ossified and distinct, and the complicated tarsus is made up of nine bones. The metacarpals in the hand are notable as they diverge in a smooth arc, with the length of the digits almost symmetrical around the long third digit as well as relatively non-diverged first and fifth digits. This contrasts with the hands of other reptiles where first and fifth digits are spread out from each other and the fourth digit is the longest. The metatarsals and digits of the foot also diverge in a smooth arc, but unlike the hand they are not symmetrical, with a long fourth toe and a short, hooked fifth digit. All the digits of the hands and feet are unusually short for an archosauromorph, contrasting with the related Trilophosaurus. The claws (or unguals) are all very large, narrow and sharply recurved, and are significantly larger than the preceding finger bone they were attached to. The digits and claws share features with those of dromaeosaurid and troodontid maniraptorans, as well as other reptiles such as the turtle Proganochelys. These shared traits are associated with well developed flexor tendons, and it is suggested to be an adaptation for withstanding forces involved in digging. History of Discovery = A. laaroussii = Illustration of a partial A. laaroussii jaw bone with teeth  Early discoveries  The first fossils of Azendohsaurus laaroussii were discovered in a northern part the Argana Formation (also known as the Timezgadiouine Formation) in Morocco, part the Argana Basin near the Atlas Mountains. The fossil beds consist of sandstones and red clay mudstones, and were excavated by Jean-Michel Dutuit between 1962 and 1969. The fossils of A. laaroussii are known from only a single layer within the formation, in an outcrop numbered XVI by Dutuit at the base of the T5 (or Irohalene) member. The T5 member has traditionally been roughly dated to the early Late Triassic in age using vertebrate biostratigraphy based on the presence of the phytosaur \\"Paleorhinus\\" magnoculus, as part of the Carnian dated '\\"Palaeorhinus\\" biochron', although this method of correlating and dating global Triassic sequences may be inaccurate and the date for the T5 member remains uncertain. The first fossils consisted of only a partial tooth- bearing dentary fragment and some associated teeth. This material was discovered by J. M. Dutuit in 1965 and described in 1972, who believed it to belong to a herbivorous ornithischian dinosaur, as well as one of the oldest dinosaurs yet discovered. He named the genus \\"Azendoh lizard\\", after the nearby Azendoh village located only 1.5 km to the west of where the fossils were discovered. Dutuit's description of Azendohsaurus as an ornithischian was soon challenged by palaeontologist Richard Thulborn two years later in 1974, who was the first to suggest that Azendohsaurus was a \\"prosauropod\\" instead. The same conclusion was made by Jos√© Boneparte after examining the material himself in 1976. This re-identification was favoured by researchers in subsequent publications, and it was variously referred to the \\"prosauropod\\" families Anchisauridae and Thecodontosauridae without further explanation. Dutuit himself even agreed that Azendohsaurus was likely to be a \\"prosauropod\\" in 1983, although not long before in 1981 he had briefly regarded it as a \\"pre-ornithischian\\". In 1985, palaeontologist Peter Galton suggested that Dutuit's original \\"Azandohsaurus \\" material included the jaw of a \\"prosauropod\\" and the tooth of a fabrosaurid ornithischian (a now defunct grouping of early ornithischians), based on the differences in the shape of the teeth. This suggestion was refuted by Fran√ßois-Xavier Gauffre in 1993 when he re-described the material, as well describing additional jaw bones and teeth including two maxillae. He correctly concluded that the material belonged to a single taxon, but assigned the genus to \\"Prosauropoda\\" incertae sedis based again on the characteristics of the jaws and teeth. However, he could not determine its position within \\"Prosauropoda\\" due to the ambiguous distribution of these traits in early herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as a lack of any comparable Triassic reptiles, so he referred it to incertae sedis. His assessment was accepted by many other researchers in the years following up until the description of the new material from the Madagascan species.  Later finds to present  New material from the type locality of A. laaroussii, including parts of the post-cranial skeleton, was reported on in 2002 at the annual conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology by Nour-Eddine Jalil and Fabien Knoll. The additional material included presacral vertebrae, limb bones and limb girdles. The material was disarticulated, and was only attributable to A. laaroussii due to its association with recognised fragments of the skull and jaws. The post-cranial material was recognised as non-dinosaurian, but still believed to be an ornithodiran archosaur related to dinosaurs. If correctly associated with the jaws and teeth, this indicated Azendohsaurus was not closely related to any herbivorous dinosaurs, despite their similarities. Similarly, teeth from other purported Triassic ornithischians were later found to belong to previously unrecognised herbivorous reptiles, such as the pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus, highlighting the possibility for mistaken identities in other purported herbivorous Triassic dinosaurs, including Azendohsaurus. The new post cranial material from A. laaroussii was described as part of a Ph.D thesis by Khaldoune in 2014, but as of 2019 this thesis has not yet been published and the material remains officially undescribed in published literature. However, it has now more confidently been referred to A. laaroussii after the description of the Madagascan material, and was found to share at least two diagnostic post cranial traits with the Madagascan species. All the material from A. laaroussii, including the holotype and unpublished post crania, is housed at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, France. = A. madagaskarensis =  Initial discoveries  In 1997 through to 1999, fossils of a new archosauromorph were discovered by an international expedition in southwestern Madagascar and were recovered over the following decade. The fossils were found in a single bone bed, referred to as M-28, that was only tens of centimetres thick across a 100 metre stretch of outcrop exposed as an uplifted river terrace not far from the east bank of the Malio River, just outside of the Isalo National Park, north-west of the town of Ranohira and to the east of Sakahara. The locality was from the base of the Middle‚ÄìLate Triassic Makay Formation, also referred to as Isalo II, a part of the Isalo \\"Group\\" in the Morondava Basin. Previously, the formation had been believed to be Early to Middle Jurassic in age, although the earlier discovery of the rhynchosaur Isalorhynchus had revised that estimate to the Middle Triassic. The tetrapod fossils recovered in the 1997‚Äì99 expedition confirmed the Isalo II was Triassic in age, but instead suggested a younger Carnian age. The age of the formation has also been correlated to the Santacruzodon Assemblage Zone (AZ) from the Santa Maria Formation in South America based on the shared genera of traversodontid cynodonts, with a similar late Ladinian or early Carnian age. The Santacruzodon AZ has been more reliably dated through radioisotope U‚ÄîPb dating, suggesting a maximum depositional age of 237 ¬±1.5 million years in the early Carnian. The bone bed contained material from almost \\"a dozen\\" individuals of varying ages and size, all from a single species. The material was very well preserved, generally preserving the three- dimensional shape of the bones with very little crushing or distortion in some of the specimens. Based on the state of preservation, some of the bones were believed to have been buried rapidly while others were exposed for longer on the surface, where they were weathered, cracked and possibly trampled on before burial. As with A. laaroussii, the teeth and jaws were the first material to be recovered and described from the bone bed. These were initially mistaken to belong two different species based on the difference in tooth shape in the upper and lower jaws, but one of them was recognised as closely resembling A. laaroussii, sharing a keel on the inside surface of the maxilla and expanded, leaf-shaped teeth, among other features. Like A. laaroussii, both of these supposed species were also misidentified as \\"prosauropods\\"; a species of Azendohsaurus or a related taxon and another, more typical \\"prosauropod\\". Further discoveries of associated material clarified that all the jaw material and the rest of the skeletons were from a single, new species of Azendohsaurus.  Reinterpretation  Braincase of UA 7-20-99-653, the holotype of A. madagaskarensis, in occipital view Even preliminary examination of the rest of the skull and skeleton from the Madagascan species confirmed that Azendohsaurus was not a dinosaur, and was instead an aberrant herbivorous archosauromorph that was only distantly related to dinosaurs, let alone sauropodomorphs. A description of the cranial material was published first in May, 2010 by John J. Flynn and colleagues, who also officially named and diagnosed it as a new species of Azendohsaurus, Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis, named for its country of origin. This was also the first time Azendohsaurus was determined to be a non-dinosaur in the published literature. In December, 2015, the rest of the skeleton of A. madagaskarensis was formally described and published by Sterling J. Nesbitt and colleagues, providing the first detailed examination of the full anatomy of Azendohsaurus from the now almost completely known skeleton. In addition to comparing its anatomy, they were also able to analyse its evolutionary relationships to other Triassic reptiles in a phylogenetic context for the first time. The preservation of the material was described as \\"generally excellent\\" by Nesbitt and colleagues, and the amount of overlapping material made it easier to determine the original morphology from distorted and broken bones. Much of the material was found disarticulated and sometimes isolated, but a number of specific parts of the body were found articulated in life position, including sections of the neck, back, hands and feet. Most of the material was similarly sized, with a range of about 25% between the smallest and largest specimens, although the significance of this is not understood and it could be related to ontogeny, individual variation or sexual dimorphism. The well preserved nature of much of the material also allowed for reinterpretations of parts of the skeleton of other archosauormorphs, such as the hand of Trilophosaurus. The hands of other archosauromorphs are often poorly known, and so their preservation in Azendohsaurus is considered important for understanding their evolution in early archosauromorphs. All the specimens of A. madagaskarensis are permanently housed in both the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar (including the holotype) and at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, including casts of some of the original specimens. Classification = Initial attempts = Life restoration of Teraterpeton, another allokotosaur of previously uncertain placement Azendohsaurus was first misidentified as an ornithischian dinosaur by Dutuit, based on shared characteristics of its teeth such as the leaf-like shape and the number of denticles. It was later believed to be a sauropodomorph instead by other researchers, assigned to the defunct infraorder \\"Prosauropoda\\" (then believed to be a distinct monophyletic group related to sauropods, now known to be a paraphyletic grade) based on the morphology of its lower jaw, maxilla and teeth, such as the downward curving dentary and absence of a predentary bone, one of the characteristic traits of ornithischians. These misidentifications were caused by the convergence in jaw and tooth shape between it and the herbivorous dinosaurs while its true phylogenetic relationships could not be realised due to the absence of other bones of the skull and skeleton. The non- dinosaurian identity of Azendohsaurus was first hinted at after the discovery of additional skeletal material recovered from the type locality. This was based on the presence of traits such as a solid hip socket (acetabulum), and a proximal fourth trochanter on the femur that also lacked an inward-facing head, which are typical of dinosaur skeletons. While evidently not a dinosaur, it was tentatively interpreted as an ornithodiran archosaur, still closely related to dinosaurs. The discovery of more complete material from Madagascar prompted the first formal classification Azendohsaurus as non-dinosaurian by Flynn and colleagues in 2010 through a detailed description of its cranial anatomy and were able to clarify its relationships further. They instead recognised it to be a more basal archosauromorph, far removed dinosaurs and closely related to but outside of the clade of Archosauriformes. As well as the derived, sauropodomorph-like features, the skull also had numerous primitive traits for archosauromorphs, including an open-bottomed lower temporal fenestra, extensive palatal teeth, a pineal foramen and no external mandibular or antorbital fenestrae. However, its exact relationships still remained unknown beyond a position as an indeterminate non-archosauriform archosauromorph. = Recognition of Allokotosauria = Azendohsaurus was included in a phylogenetic analysis of Triassic archosauromorphs for the first time in 2015 by Nesbitt and colleagues, utilising all of the new information from the skull and skeleton and a broad sample of various Triassic archosauromorph species, where it was recovered as closely related to other enigmatic herbivorous Triassic reptiles such as Trilophosaurus and Teraterpeton. This newly recognised grouping of archosauromorphs was named Allokotosauria, meaning \\"strange reptiles\\", for the unusual qualities of the reptiles that belonged to the group. Azendohsaurus was found to be the sister taxon of the family Trilophosauridae, and was recognised as the sole member of its own family, the Azendohsauridae, due its distinctiveness even amongst other allokotosaurs. A similar result was recovered by another large analysis of archosauromorph phylogeny in 2016 by Mart√≠n D. Ezcurra, who found a monophyletic Allokotosauria containing Azendohsaurus and Trilophosaurus. Allokotosaurs are recognised as often having specialised jaws and teeth, as well as sharing a number of synapomorphies that include several reversals to more plesiomorphic (ancestral) traits of archosauromorphs, as well as at least two derived traits. The clade is considered to be well supported in these analyses. However, although closely related, the craniodental characteristics of allokotosaurs vary dramatically, and among them Azendohsaurus was characterised by having laterally compressed, serrated teeth present throughout the length of the jaws (unlike the 'beaked' jaws of trilophosaurids). Azendohsaurus broadly shares with other azendohsaurids features such as confluent nares, leaf-shaped teeth and a long neck, but Azendohsaurus itself is distinguished by the distinctive groove on the inside surface of the maxilla and tooth crowns that are expanded above the base. Life restoration of Shringasaurus, a closely related azendohsaurid In 2017, another large allokotosaur was described from the Middle Triassic of India by Saradee Sengupta and colleagues, named Shringasaurus indicus. Shringasaurus was very similar to Azendohsaurus, and they were found to be closely related, supporting the existence of Azendohsauridae as a distinct family from the trilophosaurids. The same analysis also recovered Pamelaria, another long necked archosauromorph from India, as a basal azendohsaurid. Similarities between Pamelaria and Azendohsaurus had been noted by Nesbitt and colleagues in 2015, including confluent nares, serrated teeth and low cervical spines, but their analysis favoured a position in Allokotosauria basal to azendohsaurids. The 2017 analysis also confirmed the close relationship between A. laaroussii and A. madagaskarensis within Azendohsauridae, strengthening their shared referral to the genus Azendohsaurus. A 2018 analysis of Triassic archosauromorphs failed to recover Allokotosauria, but still recovered both species of Azendohsaurus within a clade of azendohsaurids. The cladogram below follows the results of Sengupta and colleagues in 2017: = Evolutionary significance = The number of convergent traits shared between Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorph dinosaurs is remarkably high, especially as all the shared features are interpreted as being homoplastic, meaning that they evolved completely independently of each other. Some of the shared adaptations of the skeleton between Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorphs were previously considered to be unique to sauropodomorphs. However, the convergent evolution of these traits in Azendohsaurus as adaptations towards a herbivorous lifestyle show that they may be more broadly distributed amongst Triassic archosauromorphs, and do not necessarily indicate a close relationship to sauropodomorphs in fossil taxa. The pattern of convergences in Azendohsaurus is unusual, as they appear to be have arisen in only the front half of the animal, while the sprawling back legs and short tail of Azendohsaurus are characteristically primitive of earlier archosauromorphs, very unlike the columnar hind limbs and long tail of sauropodomorphs. This further highlights the non-uniform distribution and acquisition of typically sauropodomorph traits in other herbivorous archosauromorphs. The age of Azendohsaurus is also significant, as it was roughly coeval with the earliest known sauropodomorphs from Carnian South America, such as the lightweight, bipedal Saturnalia. However, Azendohsaurus resembles the later Norian sauropodomorphs more closely, both in general anatomy and its larger body size. This suggests that azendohsaurids had been the first reptiles to evolve as high browsing herbivores in Triassic ecosystems, prior to the evolution of the larger sauropodomorphs, which had previously been assumed to have been the first high browsing herbivores. It also indicates that the convergence between Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorphs did not occur under the same environmental circumstances, as Azendohsaurus was part of an initial wave of herbivory in archosauromorphs (along with rhynchosaurs, silesaurids and cynodonts) and large sauropodomorphs in a second wave (along with herbivorous pseudosuchians). Azendohsaurus also demonstrates that archosauromorphs were occupying roles as large herbivores in Triassic ecosystems earlier in their evolutionary history than had been assumed. These roles were previously thought to be dominated by large synapsids such as dicynodonts prior to the radiation of archosaurs in the Late Triassic, but Azendohsaurus suggests that earlier archosauromorphs were also capable of competing with synapsid herbivores. Palaeobiology = Feeding and diet = Closeup of implanted teeth and the maxilla UA 8-29-97-160 of A. madagaskarensis The leaf-shaped teeth of Azendohsaurus are clearly suited for a herbivorous lifestyle, and microwear‚Äîmarks left on the tooth surface during feeding‚Äîon the teeth of A. madagaskarensis suggest they were used for browsing on vegetation that was not especially tough or woody, preferring softer (but firm) vegetation. The microwear patterns also show that it used a simple up- and-down motion of the jaw, and did not use complex jaw movement to chew its food like ornithischian dinosaurs or contemporary cynodonts. This microwear has not yet been observed on the teeth of A. laaroussii, but it is unknown if this is a genuine feature relating to a difference in diet and feeding habits between the two species or if it is just a feature of preservation. The fully developed palatal teeth suggest that it was using them for feeding in a specialised manner. However, no functional studies have been performed on the palatal teeth so it is unknown exactly what they were used for, although their similar shape to the marginal teeth suggests they were used for processing similar food. A pterygoid from a younger individual of A. madagaskarensis has fewer rows of palatal teeth that are smaller in size than those of the larger, mature individuals, indicating that Azendohsaurus increased both the number and size of its palatal teeth as it grew into adulthood. Younger individuals also had fewer dentary teeth than adults, although the difference was much less extreme compared to the palatal teeth (16 compared to the 17 of mature specimens). = Body posture = The body posture inferred for Azendohsaurus is a mixture of sprawled and semi-sprawled. The hind limbs have been interpreted as being completely sprawled outwards from the body, with its femur held straight out and the lower leg bent 90¬∞ beneath it at the knee, like a lizard. The forelimbs and shoulder girdle, however, suggest that the front of the body was held more upright than the hind quarters, with a partly downward directed shoulder socket and a humerus more suited for being held partially erect, and was similar in shape to those of sauropodomorphs. This unusual combination suggests that Azendohsaurus stood with its front end raised up off from the ground, which combined with its long, arched neck and small head, allowed it to browse relatively high off the ground, unlike contemporary low-browsing rhynchosaurs and cynodonts. Adapting to high- browsing could possibly explain the convergence between Azendohsaurus and sauropodomorphs, acquiring similar traits of the neck, forelimbs and spine to perform in similar niches. However, the more sprawling posture of Azendohsaurus probably inhibited high-browsing like that of the fully erect sauropodomorphs. =Palaeopathology= Despite the multitude of specimens present in the bone bed that was examined, only a single pathology has been recorded in A. madagaskarensis. Specimen UA 7-16-99-620, one of the three preserved interclavicles, had been malformed so that the long posterior process had been sharply bent to the right, compared to the normal straight posterior processes of the other two interclavicles. =Metabolism and growth= In 2019, thin slices were cut from the humerus, femur and tibia of specimens attributed to A. laaroussii for histological examination of the microscopic bone structure to try and determine the rate of growth in Azendohsaurus. The vascular density (the density of blood vessels in the bone tissue) in all three limb bones was found to be comparable to those of fast- growing birds and mammals, and the types of bone tissue identified‚Äîparticularly energy-consuming fibrolamellar bone tissue‚Äîwere interpreted as indicating a high resting metabolic rate that was in the range of living birds and mammals. It was inferred then that, like birds and mammals, Azendohsaurus would also likewise have been endothermic, or \\"warm- blooded\\". High resting metabolic rates similar to those of Azendohsaurus had been identified in other more derived archosauromorphs (such as Prolacerta), and analyses suggested that endothermy may then have been ancestrally present in archosauromorphs as far back as their common ancestor with allokotosaurs. This suggests that Azendohsaurus may then have been ancestrally endothermic. By contrast, the related allokotosaur Trilophosaurus was previously found to not have any fibrolamellar bone tissue in its limb bones and so was inferred to have grown slowly. Palaeoecology Although the two species of Azendohsaurus are known from disparate locations in North Africa and Madagascar, during the Middle to Late Triassic these regions were connected as part of the supercontinent Pangaea. Because of this, the two regions share broadly similar faunas, as well as sharing some with other regions of the globe at the time. For example, the cynodonts in Madagascar are similar to those also found in South America, and the Moroccan temnospondyls may be related to those found in eastern North America. The climate was hot and dry at this time, but with evidence suggesting higher levels of rainfall during the Carnian, interrupting the increasing aridity trend and creating wetter environments around the globe. Life illustration of the Moroccan dicynodont Moghreberia =Argana Formation, Morocco= Other reptiles from the base of the T5 member of the Argana Formation contemporaneous with A. laaroussii include the phytosaur Arganarhinus, the predatory rauisuchid Arganasuchus, the herbivorous silesaurid Diodorus, a paratypothoracisine aetosaur, and procolophonid parareptiles, as well as the stahleckeriid dicynodont Moghreberia, a synapsid. Temnospondyl amphibians are represented by at least two genera of metoposauroids, the metoposaurid Dutuitosaurus and latiscopid Almasaurus. Fish are also known from the T5 member, including various ray- finned actinopterygians such as the locally endemic Dipteronotus gibbosus and Mauritanichthys, as well as other perleidiform and redfieldiiform fishes, alongside lobe-finned actinistians and lungfish such as Asiatoceratodus. The T5 member is composed of cyclical layers of alluvial sand and mudstone, and has been interpreted as an alluvial fan deposit grading into a system of meandering braided rivers and ephemeral lakes on a broad floodplain in an otherwise arid to semi arid environment. The fluvial sediments of the T5 member contrast with the playa sediments preceding it, suggesting it was deposited during an interval of increased rainfall. Numerous tracks and trackways from various animals are preserved in ephemeral stream beds, typically those of animals known from fossil remains such as phytosaurs, pseudosuchians, dinosauromorphs and basal archosauromorphs. The tracks also appear to indicate the presence of large to very-large dinosauromorphs or paracrocodylomorphs that are currently not yet known from skeletal remains. Additional traces mark the presence of burrowing invertebrates, bivalves, and clam shrimps. =Makay Formation, Madagascar= In Madagascar, Azendohsaurus co-existed with the hyperodapedontine rhynchosaur Isalorhynchus, the herbivorous traversodontid cynodonts Dadadon and Menadon, and the predatory chiniquodontid cynodont Chiniquodon kalanoro, as well as an undescribed kannemeyeriiform dicynodont, a sphenodontian reptile, a procolophonid parareptile, the diminutive lagerpetid Kongonaphon, various other undescribed dinosauromorphs, and an \\"enigmatic archosaur\\" of uncertain classification. The faunal composition of the Isalo II is believed to represent a Middle Triassic Ladinian aged assemblage, existing prior to the appearance of dinosaurs and associated Late Triassic faunas, particularly aetosaurs and phytosaurs that are absent from the formation, and also inferred from the dominance of traversodonts in the fauna. However, this age assessment remains uncertain, and the formation is possibly from the younger early Late Triassic during the Carnian, as has been proposed for the T5 member of the Argana Formation. Fossils of A. madagaskarensis have been exclusively recovered from a deposit of fine grained red mudstone, while other fossil bearing localities in the formation consist of medium grained channel sands, possibly reflecting a habitat preference in the ecosystem distinct from other animals or unique behavioural trait. The absence of any other species in the bone bed may also support this. However, this speculation cannot be confirmed, and it could instead be attributed to preservation bias. Possible niche partitioning in diet, though, is supported by differences in the tooth microwear of A. madagaskarensis and the contemporary traversodont Dadadon. Dadadon was inferred to be capable of feeding on tough, hardy vegetation by using complex chewing, in contrast to the simpler dentition and processing of Azendohsaurus, which was better suited for eating leaves. This may also be supported by its more elevated body posture and long neck.

Plot Since the alien symbiote to which he was bonded was destroyed during his capture,The Amazing Spider-Man #363 Cletus Kasady is presumed powerless and jailed at Ravencroft Asylum. However, the symbiote mutated his blood prior to its destruction, enabling Kasady to generate a copy of the symbiote and break out. During his escape, Kasady‚Äîagain calling himself Carnage‚Äîfrees fellow inmate Shriek. Over the course of their ensuing killing spree through New York City, they recruit Doppelganger, Demogoblin, and Carrion. Carnage dubs himself their \\"father\\", but in fact they all despise Carnage and stay with the group out of devotion to Shriek. As the death toll increases, Spider-Man, Venom, Captain America, Black Cat, Nightwatch, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Deathlok, Morbius, and Firestar all join the cause of stopping them. However, the heroes are polarized between Venom's desire to stop Carnage at all costs and Spider-Man's refusal to use violent methods, and Spider-Man ultimately abandons Venom to Carnage's mercies. In addition, Shriek uses her psychic powers to turn the populace of New York City into a bloodthirsty rabble, allowing the killers to continue their rampage with impunity. However, Carnage finally turns on the rest of his gang, and, in the ensuing battle, Shriek is distracted from using her psychic power. Taking advantage of the lull, the heroes acquire a device from Rand Corporation which projects feelings of love and hope into the villains, overwhelming them. Carnage flees, faking his death by covering a victim in a mock symbiote costume, and the others are captured. Once the heroes are dispersed, Carnage ambushes Venom. However, the device has left Carnage frantic and confused, and Venom pounds him relentlessly before tackling him into an electrical generator. Carnage is knocked senseless and left to be incarcerated.

It is known from a partial vertebral column, partial pelvis, and some ribs. Description Restoration Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Halszka Osm√≥lska based this genus on ZPAL MgD-1/110, a partial skeleton consisting of nine back vertebrae, nine hip vertebrae, fifteen tail vertebrae, a left ilium, parts of the left and right pubis, several ribs, and a few fragments of the hind limbs, with the backbone largely articulated. The most distinctive features of this skeleton are found in the neural spines. These are very tall, particularly over the hips, and were described as second only to those of Hypacrosaurus altispinus and the tips of those found in the first few vertebrae of the tail are club-shaped (possibly a sign of old age). In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave a length of 10 meters (33 ft) and a weight of 5 tonnes (5.5 short tons). Phylogeny Marya≈Ñska and Osm√≥lska described their new genus as a lambeosaurine (or hollow-crested duckbill), the first from the Nemegt Formation, although it lacked a skull. However, the sacrum has a keel along the bottom, a possible lambeosaurine feature, and the bones closely resemble those of Hypacrosaurus. With only one partial skeleton known, and no skull, the genus has been considered dubious or a possible lambeosaurine of uncertain placement. A newer study published in 2011 suggests that Barsboldia is actually a valid saurolophine.

While the female and male sexual organs of Congdon silktassel are on separate plants, the pendant male catkins are much more showy. This plant is reasonably attractive and neat enough in its growing habit to be appealing as a landscape species. It is stocked commonly at commercial plant nurseries. All Garrya are associated with warm temperate regions of North America. Description Leaves and spent blooms Congdon silktassel has a multi-furcate trunk branching structure yielding an almost spherical form. The height can attain four meters, but more commonly averages two to three meters in the wild. Congdon silktassel, as all the genus Garrya, have opposite leaves that have a tough leathery feel, glossy green on top, but paler, slightly furry and duller on the underside.*Jepson Flora Project: Garrya congdonii The dioecious flowers are concentrated in inflorescences which cascade downward as aments of approximately three to five centimeters in length.Eugene N. Kozloff and Linda H. Reidelman, Plants of the San Francisco Bay Region, Mendocino to Monterey, Sagen Press, Pacific Grove, Ca., Nov. 1994 While the Congdon silktassel manifests separate male and female plants, the pendant male catkins are much more evident, up to 25 centimeters long; those of the female are shorter and silver-grey. Although the flowers bloom in late January and February, dried bracts remain on the tree well into summer as light gray decorations. The plant has smooth dark bark, dark- greenish when young, but with age the bark roughens. New twigs are green and moderately stout. For pistillate flowers, above each small bract there is a solitary flower inside the inflorescence. This plant produces tiny dark seeds that can become airborne as small fluffy wind-blown cotton. The ripened purple to black fruit of about seven millimeters in diameter has a hard desiccated shell, but is somewhat fleshy on the interior. In the case of stamenate inflorescences, there are a total of four stamens per flower; moreover, above each bract pair there is a triplet of flowers. The unique characteristics of Congdon silktassel are its leathery convex green (with a very slight yellowish tinge) leaves with wavy leaf margins, coupled with dense individual hairs on the leaf undersides that are scarcely distinguishable with a hand lens. Its leaf blades are six to eight centimeters in length, and has petioles which range in length from six to twelve millimeters. For identification purposes, Congdon silktassel has leaf hairs that are distinguishable with a hand lens, and both leaf blades and petioles are about two thirds the size of those on Coast silktassel. Habitat Congdon silktassel is found in several plant communities, principally in drier inner coastal California ranges no more than 20 miles from the Pacific Ocean; the main associations are Coastal chaparral, Mixed evergreen forest (near a chaparral area) and Northern coastal sage scrub.Roxana S. Ferris, Native Shrubs of the San Francisco Bay Region, University of California Press, (1968) This plant can tolerate moderately heavy clay soils and serpentine areas, but likes soils pH to lie in the range of six to eight. An example of serpentine soils habitat is in The Cedars of Sonoma County, California.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Leather oak. eds. mark McGinley & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC This plant is rather resistant to being grazed by deer or rabbits, and is hardy to cold temperatures of about 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Congdon silktassel is moderately drought-tolerant, but is more luxuriant with rainfall of about 22 inches per annum. Differences with other Garrya species Congdon silktassel is usually found at elevations above 200 meters. This species is usually found within the mountains of the inner Pacific Coast range, such as Mount Hamilton ranging north to the inner coast range in Sonoma County, which is where the specimen photographed herein was found. Coast silktassel (Garrya elliptica) is most closely related species. Coast silktassel has similar wavy undulated entire leaf margins with somewhat darker glossier leaves, and the leaf topsides are more waxy and not quite so leathery as Congdon. The whitish hairs on the leaf underside of Coast silktassel are not readily visible with a hand lens as for Congdon silktassel. Coast silktassel is most commonly seen growing as individual plants rather than in groves, and can be found in the Montara Mountain range, San Bruno Mountain and outer coastal ranges in Marin County such as Mount Tamalpais. Both Fremont silktassel (Garrya fremontii) and Ashy silktassel (Garrya flavescens) have similar fruit characteristics, but have a flat leaf margin. Fremont silktassel has yellow-green leaves and fruits that are almost lacking in hairs. Fremont silktassel is found from the Mount Hamilton area and Loma Prieta area ranging north to Marin County (for example, on Mount Tamalpais. Ashy silktassel (Garrya flavescens pallida) has grayish leaves and is reported to occur in the Alameda County hills.

Its fossils were found in Shishugou Formation rocks in the northeastern Junggar Basin in China. Discovery and naming Restored skeleton The type and only known species is Bellusaurus sui, formally described by Dong Zhiming in 1990. The remains of Bellusaurus were found in the Shishugou Formation in the northeastern Junggar Basin in China. Seventeen individuals were found in a single quarry, suggesting that a herd had been killed in a flash flood. Some features suggest they may have all been juveniles. Bellusaurus sui was derived from the Latin bellus meaning small, delicate, and beautiful, as these sauropods were small and lightly built. The specific name, sui, was named in honor of Senior Preparator Youling Sui, a notable restorer of dinosaurs remains. Bellusaurus was the last restoration undertaken by Mr. Sui. Description Life restoration Size compared to a human It is unknown if the material representing Bellusaurus is from juvenile specimens. Juvenile characteristics of dinosaurs have been noted by Galton in 1982 of stegosaur growth, whose study would suggest that the group of small Bellusaurus sauropods were juveniles that were subjected to a single catastrophe resulting in the mass death assemblage seen from this discovery. Because of the uncertainty of the specimens age, it could be difficult to place the species into a specific taxonomic assignment due to having unstable morphological characteristics.

The following year Benda was summoned to Potsdam as a composer and arranger for his older brother Franz, himself an illustrious composer and violinist. Seven years later, in 1749, he entered the service of the Duke of Gotha as Kapellmeister, where he constantly cultivated his talents for composition, specializing in religious music. A stipend from the duke allowed Benda to take a study trip to Italy in 1764. He returned to Gotha in 1766, and devoted himself to composition. In all, he wrote about ten operas, several operettas, and the melodramas ', Medea and '. In 1778 he resigned his position and visited Hamburg, Vienna, and other cities, and finally settled at the little hamlet of K√∂stritz. Benda's most important contribution lies in the development of the German melodramas, a form of musical stage entertainment which influenced Mozart. In 1774, the Swiss-born director Abel Seyler's theatrical company arrived in Gotha, and Seyler commissioned Benda to write several successful melodramas, including ', Medea and Pygmalion. ' is generally considered his best work. At its debut in 1775, the opera received enthusiastic reviews in Germany and afterwards, in the whole of Europe, with music critics calling attention to its originality, sweetness, and ingenious execution. Besides that he wrote many instrumental pieces including many sinfonias, keyboard sonatas, keyboard concertos, violin concertos and a smaller number of trio sonatas, violin sonatas and flute sonatas. Benda also wrote music for masonic rituals.* Hill, Cecil (1980). \\"Masonic music\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

He was one of the last members of the Franco-Flemish school of polyphony, and was a notable composer of madrigals in a style that blended both Italian and native Netherlandish idioms. Life Verdonck was born in Turnhout. From his earliest years, he was in the household of Cornelis Pruenen, senator and treasurer of Antwerp; in addition he was a choirboy at Antwerp Cathedral until about the age of 9. In 1572 he went to Spain to be part of the choir of Philip II in Madrid, where he stayed until his voice broke in early 1580, at which time he returned to the Netherlands to study in Antwerp with S√©verin Cornet, and possibly with Hubert Waelrant as well. His earliest works, published along with those of Cornet, date from this period. In 1584 Verdonck returned to Spain, once again singing in the choir of Philip II, staying there until 1598 or 1599, after which he again returned to Antwerp. Also in 1599 he participated in the elaborate entry procession of the newly married Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella into Antwerp, writing a motet (Prome, novas) for the occasion: it was performed by a six-member boys' choir mounted on the back of an elephant, which rode along with the Archduke and Archduchess (accounts differ as to whether it was a real or artificial animal). It is the only known motet composed for performance on an elephant. Most likely Verdonck remained in the Netherlands until his death in 1625. He held a prebend at Eindhoven until 1622, and seems to have been in the service of wealthy burghers for all of his life except for his sojourn in Spain. One of his employers was Johannes Carolus de Cordes, the nephew of his original patron, as evidenced by the dedication of a book of madrigals Verdonck published in 1603. Music and influence Verdonck was a late representative of the Italian madrigal style in northern Europe, and was unusual in that he wrote madrigals in Italian without ever going to Italy. Stylistically he was relatively conservative, shunning the innovations of the early Baroque around 1600, including monody and the basso continuo, preferring instead to work in the polyphonic vocal style of the late 16th century. In the preface to a 1599 collection of madrigals, he wrote scathingly of the decline of musical standards in his native land, which had once been the musical center of Europe: \\"whether these sweet harmonies have been interrupted by the tempests of Mars, who has too long been master of these provinces, or whether music has ceased to be esteemed by those who, filled with confusion ..., cannot value what is full of agreement and harmony.\\"Quoted in Reese, p. 398. Most of Verdonck's surviving output consists of secular music, and he wrote both French chansons and Italian madrigals. Some of the chansons are for unusually large groups of voices (for example, his publication Po√©sies fran√ßaises de divers autheurs mises en musique par C. Verdonck of 1599 is for 10 independent voices), and the texture of his music is mostly contrapuntal, with sometimes lively syncopation. One of his madrigals, Donna belle e gentile, fitted with English words (as \\"Lady your look so gentle\\"), appeared in the 1588 Musica transalpina collection by Nicholas Yonge which inaugurated the madrigal vogue in England. Verdonck also wrote sacred music; his output includes several motets and a Magnificat, which are scored for four, five, or six voices. The Magnificat (1585, for five voices) survives in the original copper engraving. Notes References and further reading R. B.

Betasuchus is, besides Orthomerus, the only dinosaur genus named from remains found in the Netherlands and the only non-avian theropod found in the Maastrichtian Beds. Discovery Speculative reconstruction as an abelisaurid, based on relatives Its fossil, holotype BMNH 42997 (now NHM R 42997), a part of a right femur, 312 mm long, was found in the Netherlands near Maastricht, and originally described as a new species of Megalosaurus in 1883 by Harry Seeley: M. bredai, honouring the late Dutch biologist and geologist Jacob Gijsbertus Samu√´l van Breda, a director of the Teylers Museum, who had collected the fossil at some time between 1820 and 1860 from the chalkstone quarry at the St Pietersberg. Van Breda did not excavate the remains himself but bought them from quarry workers who in this period dug stone from tunnels at several levels in the mountain; it is therefore impossible to determine the exact temporal horizon, apart from a general Maastrichtian; however all dinosaurian material from the formation that could be dated, stems from the latest Maastrichtian, 67-66 million years old. Only the top part of the femur has been conserved; of the distal end about eight centimetres are missing as the bone was cleanly cut in two when the chalk block containing it was sawed out. Other saw cuts damaged the head of the thigh bone. The fossil was part of his personal collection, not the museum's, and sold to the British Museum of Natural History after his death in 1867. In 1892 Belgian/Dutch/German paleontologist Johan Casimir Ubaghs referred some teeth ‚Äî probably of mosasaurs ‚Äî to M. bredai. Megalosaurus bredai was in 1883 the first terrestrial vertebrate named from Maastrichtian layers.Zoltan Csiki- Sava, Eric Buffetaut, Attila ≈êsi, Xabier Pereda-Suberbiola & Stephen L. Brusatte, 2015, \\"Island life in the Cretaceous -- faunal composition, biogeography, evolution, and extinction of land-living vertebrates on the Late Cretaceous European archipelago\\", ZooKeys 469: 1-161 A re-evaluation of the fossil by Friedrich von Huene in 1926, however, showed that it came from a genus distinct from Megalosaurus ‚Äî which in the nineteenth and early twentieth century was a \\"wastebin taxon\\" where many unrelated carnivorous dinosaurs were lumped together. Von Huene thought that the fossil actually belonged to an ornithomimosaur, and gave it the provisional designation \\"Ornithomimidorum [sic]The normal genitive plural of \\"Ornithomimidae\\" is \\"ornithomimidarum\\" genus b\\" (in Latin: genus b of the ornithomimids), being the second of two Megalosaurus species he was reallocating to Ornithomimidae, the first being M. lonzeensis as \\"Ornithomimidorum genus a\\". \\"Ornithomimidorum\\" is sometimes mistakenly listed as a dinosaur genus name. Von Huene referred to this designation when he formally renamed M. bredai in 1932, calling it Betasuchus (or \\"B crocodile\\" in Greek). In 2017 its length was estimated to be 4 meters (13 feet). Phylogeny Betasuchus is known only from a single incomplete femur, so its exact relationships with other theropods have been difficult to determine. In 1972 Dale Russell confirmed Von Huene's opinion that Betasuchus was an ornithomimosaurid, but also considered the name a nomen vanum: a failed emendation. Some workers in reference to the material still use M. bredai instead of Betasuchus. David Norman in 1990 listed Megalosaurus bredai as a nomen dubium. Jean le Loeuff and Eric Buffetaut in 1991 concluded it was a small abelisaurid, close to Tarascosaurus and that it was distinct enough not to consider it a nomen dubium: they mentioned a more narrow femoral neck, a lack of orientation of the femoral head towards the front, the lack of an opening, or foramen, under the lesser trochanter and that the anterior face is narrower. Furthermore, at the lower end the beginnings of an anterointernal crest are visible, seeming to be homologous to the supracondylar crest of the femur of Carnotaurus. They rejected the placement within Ornithomimidae, partly because of the much higher position of the fourth trochanter on the back of the femur. In 1997 Betasuchus was concluded by Carpenter, Russell and Baird to be related to Dryptosaurus, a tyrannosauroid. In 2004 Tykoski and Rowe placed Tarascosaurus within the Abelisauroidea.

Life and career Born in Herzberg am Harz, Einem served in the Prussian army for much of his life when he was appointed Minister of War in 1903. During his six years of service, Einem oversaw the reorganization of the German army building much of the military's heavy armament in preparation for modern warfare, specifically the introduction of the machine gun and modern heavy artillery. In 1909, Einem was appointed commander of VII Corps serving under the command of Gen. Karl von B√ºlow's 2nd Army later taking part in the First Battle of the Marne soon after Germany entry into World War I in August 1914. Assigned to France, Einem succeeded Gen. Max von Hausen as commander of the Third Army in September 1914. Successfully repulsing the French Champagne-Marne offensive from February‚ÄìMarch and September‚ÄìNovember 1915 respectively, Einem would take part in all three Battles of the Aisne and would hold Gen. Anthoine's 4th Army (under Gen. Philippe Petain's Center Army Group) during the Second Battle of the Aisne as part of the Nivelle Offensive from April 16-May 15, 1917. Einem's right wing units would also participate in Gen. Erich Ludendorff's Champagne- Marne offensive on July 15‚Äì17, 1918 supporting the east flank of the German 1st Army. After suffering severe casualties in battle with Gen. John J. Pershing's Allied Expeditionary Force from September 26-November 11 in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, he was forced to retreat northward shortly before the war's end. On November 10, 1918, only one day before the declaration of the Armistice, command of Prince Wilhelm's Army Group German Crown Prince fell to Einem who would oversee Germany's demobilization.

The generic name Blikanasaurus is derived from Greek, meaning \\"lizard from Blikana\\". The species name cromptoni is taken from the surname of A.W. ‚ÄúFuzz‚Äù Crompton, an American paleontologist who led numerous field expeditions in Elliot Formation outcrop localities in South Africa. Blikanasaurus is only known from partial hindlimb bones that were recovered from the lower Elliot Formation (LEF) in the Eastern Cape. History of discovery Blikanasaurus was first discovered by a partial hindlimb (epipodium and pes) found in the lower Elliot Formation (LEF) at the foot of Blikana mountain in Herschel, Eastern Cape of South Africa around 1965. In the early 2000s, a second specimen - consisting of only a right metatarsal - was recovered from lower Elliot Formation deposits on the farm, Damplaats, in Ladybrand of the eastern Free State. A possible ilium that has been attributed to Blikanasaurus was found recently, although this remains to be confirmed. Description As the two known Blikanasaurus specimens are extremely incomplete, very little is understood of this sauropodomorph taxon. The only information that has been deduced is from the bones of its hindlimb anatomy, which are heavily built. This suggests that Blikanasaurus was thickly set and robust. Classification Due to its robust build, Blikanasaurus is hypothesized to have been an obligate quadruped, unlike what is characteristic of more derived sauropodomorphs. Due to this feature, Blikanasaurus was thought initially to be a basal sauropod. Blikanasaurus is now considered to be a basal sauropodomorph; however, due to the lack of complete specimens, little remains known about this enigmatic taxon. Some paleontologists claimed a case to group Blikanasaurus within the subfamily Blikanasauridae, but this subfamily has not been formally accepted due to it lacking definitive taxa. The cladogram below displays the currently accepted systematics between Blikanasaurus and other sauropodomorphs.

The Indira Gandhi Canal (Originally: Rajasthan Canal) is the longest canal of India. It starts from the Harike Barrage at Harike, a few kilometers below the confluence of the Satluj and Beas rivers in the Indian state of Punjab and terminates in irrigation facilities in the Thar Desert in the north west of Rajasthan state. Previously known as the Rajasthan Canal, it was renamed the Indira Gandhi Canal on 2 November 1984 following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The canal consists of the Rajasthan feeder canal with the first in Punjab and Haryana state and a further in Rajasthan followed by the of the Rajasthan main canal, which is entirely within Rajasthan. The canal enters Haryana from Punjab near Lohgarh village then runs through the western part of the Sirsa district before entering Rajasthan near Kharakhera village in the Tibbi tehsil of the Hanumangarh district. The canal traverses seven districts of Rajasthan: Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, and Sriganganagar. Sunset over the canal  Design and Construction  The idea of bringing the waters from the Himalayan Rivers flowing through Punjab and into Pakistan was conceived by an hydraulic engineer, Kanwar Sain in the late 1940s who proposed that of desert land in Bikaner and the northwest corner of Jaisalmer could be brought under irrigation from the stored waters of Punjab rivers. In 1960, Indus Water Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan which gave India the right to use waters of three rivers ‚Äìthe Satluj, Beas and Ravi. The proposed Rajasthan Canal envisaged use of 7.6 million acre feet of water.Ramtanu Maitra: The Indira Gandhi Canal: greening the desert in India EIR Volume 14, Number 7, February 13, 1987 The initial plan was to build the canal in two stages, Stage I consisting of feeder canal from Harike barrage in Punjab. Stage I also included constructing distributary canal system of about in length. The stage II involved construction of long main canal and distributary canal network of . It was planned that the main canal will be wide at the top and wide at the bottom with water depth of . The canal was scheduled to be completed by 1971. The canal faced severe financial constraints, neglect and corruption. In 1970 the plan was revised and it was decided that the entire canal will be lined with concrete tiles. Five more lift schemes were added. Flow command of stage II was increased by . With increased requirements, the total length of main, feeder and distribution canals was about . The stage I was completed in 1983 around 20 years behind the completion schedule.

Irrigation had already been provided in an area of in Jaisalmer district. The canal has transformed the barren deserts of this district into fertile and good fields. Crops of mustard, cotton, and wheat now grow in this semi-arid north-western region replacing the soil there previously. Improvement in living standard Rajasthan Canal(Indira Gandhi Canal) flowing in Thar desert near Sattasar village, Bikaner district, Rajasthan Besides providing water for agriculture, the canal will supply drinking water to hundreds of people in far-flung areas. As the second stage of work on the canal progresses rapidly, there is hope that it will enhance the living standards of the people of the state. Sand dune stabilization The Indira Gandhi Canal is a major step in reclaiming the Thar Desert and checking desertification of fertile areas. There is a planting programme for greening the desert in areas near the Indira Gandhi Canal which was started in 1965. This consists of the planting of shelter belts along roads and canals, blocks of plantations and sand dune stabilization. The tree species being used for planting are Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Morus alba, Tecomella undulata, Acacia tortilis, Azadirachta indica, Albizia lebbeck, Cassia fistula, Populus ciliata, Melia azedarach, and Vachellia nilotica. Environmental problems The excessive irrigation and intensification of agriculture over the years has caused environmental degradation and creation of new wastelands. There have been problems with water-logging caused by excessive irrigation, seepage from canals and poor drainage. These factors produced a rise in the water table (bringing soluble salts close to surface) , increased salinity and finally submergence of the land. These problems have been exacerbated by the cultivation of water intensive [cash crops].

The specific name is a combination of Latin gracilis, \\"lightly built\\", and crus, \\"shin\\", in reference to the elegant build of the lower leg.Osm√≥lska, H., 1987, \\"Borogovia gracilicrus gen. et sp. n., a new troodontid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia\\", Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 32: 133-150 The holotype specimen, ZPAL MgD-I/174, was found in the Nemegt Formation, dating from the early Maastrichtian. It consists of two lower legs of a single individual, including fragments of both tibiotarsi, the undersides of both metatarsi and the second, third and fourth toes of each foot. The tibiotarsi have an estimated length of twenty-eight centimetres. Borogovia is about two meters (6 feet) long, weighing some twenty kilograms (forty-five pounds). The tibiotarsus is very elongated. The third toe is narrow. The second phalanx of the second toe is short. The claw of the second toe is short and relatively flat. Osm√≥lska claimed that the second toe could not be hyperextended, and suggested that it had regained a weight-bearing function, compensating for the weakness of the third toe. Borogovia was assigned by Osm√≥lska to the Troodontidae in 1987.

It lived during the Late Jurassic. Discovery and naming The type species, Bothriospondylus suffossus, was described by Richard Owen in 1875. The specific epithet suffossus means \\"undermined\\" in Latin, a reference to the fact that pleurocoels had hollowed out the sides of the vertebra. It is often incorrectly spelled as \\"suffosus\\". Owen based the species on holotype NHMUK R.44592-5, a set of four dorsal vertebrae found in Wiltshire in stratum from the Kimmeridgian, the Kimmeridge Clay. Also three unfused sacral vertebrae were referred. Holotype of B. magnus (Lectotype of Ornithopsis) At the same time Owen named three other species of Bothriospondylus. B. robustus was based on NHMUK R.22428, a dorsal from the same location. B. elongatus was based on a vertebra from Sussex, NHMUK R.2239, an original syntype of Ornithopsis hulkei. Finally, Bothriospondylus magnus was a new name for another syntype of Ornithopsis hulkei Seeley 1870, the present lectotype NHMUK 28632. Owen himself in an addendum to the same publication renamed B. robustus to Marmarospondylus robustus. Friedrich von Huene in 1908 referred the material to Pelorosaurus and in 1922 made B. suffossus into a Ornithopsis suffossa because the latter generic name has priority. More complete material from Madagascar was named by Richard Lydekker as a fifth species, Bothriospondylus madagascariensis. Franz Nopcsa in 1902 assigned to Bothriospondylus a vertebra from Argentina that later would be renamed Nopcsaspondylus. A skeleton from France was assigned to Bothriospondylus madagascariensis, but has been described as a new genus and species of brachiosaurid, Vouivria. In 1986 Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte moved material from \\"B.\\" sp. into its own genus, Lapparentosaurus. The material, sometimes referred to B. madagascariensis, was separated into a few dorsal vertebrae to be the new lectotype of Lapparentosaurus. A revision in 2010 by Philip Mannion concluded that Bothriospondylus is a nomen dubium. However, \\"Bothriospondylus\\" madagascariensis was treated as valid and distinct from other Middle Jurassic sauropods from Madagascar. Classification Bothriospondylus has over the years been assigned to many groups ‚Äî even in a Bothriospondylidae of its own ‚Äî with Brachiosauridae lately being the most popular designation. However, the sparse and eroded material shows no synapomorphies of the Brachiosauridae and cannot be further determined than a very general Neosauropoda. =Current species= Humerus of \\"B. madagascariensis\\" (Vouivria) Only the type species of Bothriospondylus can be referred, because of the dubious nature of the genus. * Bothriospondylus suffossus Owen, 1875 (type species) = Ornithopsis suffosa (Owen, 1875) von Huene, 1922 * \\"Bothriospondylus\\" madagascariensis Lydekker, 1895 NHM R2598 NHM R2596‚Äì2615, R16588, R16589 Non neosauropod eusauropod distinct from Lapparentosaurus. =Reassigned species= Several species have been referred to Bothriospondylus over its existence, with nearly all being reassigned to a new genus. * Bothriospondylus robustus Owen, 1875 renamed Marmarospondylus (Owen, 1875) Owen, 1875 * Bothriospondylus elongatus Owen, 1875 non Bothriospondylus * Bothriospondylus magnus Owen, 1875 objective synonym of Ornithopsis hulkei Seeley, 1870 * Bothriospondylus madagascariensis Lydekker, 1895 renamed Vouivria (Mannion, Allain & Moine, 2017) * \\"Bothriospondylus madagascariensis\\" Lydekker, 1895 removed from species and named Lapparentosaurus Bonaparte, 1986 * \\"Bothriospondylus madagascariensis\\" Lydekker, 1895 removed from species and named Vouivria damparisensis Mannion et al., 2017 * \\"Bothriospondylus\\" Lydekker, 1895 MNHN MAJ 423, 424, 425, 426, 428, 429 removed from species and named Narindasaurus thevenini Royo-Torres et al., 2020 References  Further reading  *Nopcsa, F. 1902.

Floyd Strayer and was named and shortly described by Gilmore one year later. The generic name is derived from , brachys, \\"short\\", , keras, \\"horn\\" and , ops, \\"face\\", in reference to the short snout. The specific name refers to the provenance from Montana.C.W. Gilmore, 1914, \\"A new ceratopsian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Montana, with note on Hypacrosaurus\\", Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections 63(3): 1-10 Norman Ross completing the Smithsonian mount All that was found were incomplete and jumbled remains of five juvenile individuals of about 1.5 m (5 feet) in length. It has been speculated that these juveniles may have been nest mates that stayed together after hatching. The holotype specimen is USNM 7951, a partial skull. The paratypes are USNM 7952, a snout, USNM 7953, a partial skeleton with skull and USNM 7957, a foot. The material is disarticulated but the preservation is excellent.Dodson, P., 1996, The Horned Dinosaurs ‚Äî A natural history, Princeton University Press, p. 154 In 1917 Gilmore published a monograph on Brachyceratops in which a reconstruction of the skeleton as a whole was given.C.W. Gilmore, 1917, \\"Brachyceratops, a ceratopsian dinosaur from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, with notes on associated fossil reptiles\\", United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 103: 1-45 In 1939 Gilmore referred a larger subadult specimen, USNM 14765, to Brachyceratops.Gilmore C.W. 1939, \\"Ceratopsian dinosaurs from the Two Medicine Formation, Upper Cretaceous of Montana\\", Proceedings of the United States National Museum 87: 1‚Äì18 All specimens are currently part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., where a skeletal restoration is mounted. As Brachyceratops is known only from the remains of five juveniles ‚Äî plus the subadult that Gilmore found about a mile from the original specimens ‚Äî, it was long considered likely that these represented the immature forms of known centrosaurine ceratopsians, with Monoclonius often suggested as the likeliest candidate. By 2011 however, several studies had shown that the single specimen which was adult enough to be compared with related species, USNM 14765, represented the juvenile form of the later-named Rubeosaurus. Skull The skeleton mounted in the Smithsonian Among the five original specimens parts of three skulls were discovered, detached from their owner's body and fragmented. Despite this, the skull showed that the animal had only small bumps over the eyes rather than full-grown horns like in the more famous ceratopsians such as Triceratops. The nasal horn was thick and low, while its neck frill was moderately large. Unfortunately the specimens were incomplete so it cannot be determined if there were parietal openings in the frill like some other ceratopsians possessed. Classification Restoration of Rubeosaurus ovatus, the possible adult form Brachyceratops belonged to the Centrosaurinae, but its exact placement has been difficult to discover because it is known only from juvenile specimens. In 1997, Scott Sampson and colleagues re-examined Brachyceratops and noted that it is almost certainly the juvenile form of an already known centrosaurine dinosaur. However, because many features that distinguish ceratopsians from each other do not appear until adulthood, exactly which centrosaurine remained unknown, and Sampson et al. classified Brachyceratops as a nomen dubium, or dubious name.Sampson, S.D., M. J. Ryan, and D. H. Tanke. (1997). \\"Craniofacial ontogeny in centrosaurine dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae): taphonomic and behavioral implications.\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 121: 293‚Äì337. In 2007, Michael J. Ryan and colleagues suggested that Brachyceratops was possibly the juvenile form of Styracosaurus ovatus, which has since been reclassified as Rubeosaurus. A 2011 study supported this idea for the most mature specimen of Brachyceratops, USNM 14765, which shows one unique newly evolved feature (apomorphy) in common with Rubeosaurus to the exclusion of other centrosaurines. However, the same study suggested that because the holotype specimen of Brachyceratops is too incomplete and juvenile to preserve any determinable apomorphies, Brachyceratops must be considered a nomen dubium, and cannot be a senior synonym of Rubeosaurus.

REILY, E.M. Emmet Montgomery Reily (October 21, 1866 ‚Äì October 31, 1954), sometimes E. Mont Reily, was a Texas and, later, Missouri politician who served a number of local offices, especially in Fort Worth and Kansas City. He was active in the Republican Party. He was later appointed as Governor of Puerto Rico by President Warren G. Harding. Missouri/Texas career Reily was born in Sedalia, Missouri, but moved to Fort Worth, Texas as a teenager where he worked both in the newspaper and real estate businesses. During this time, he first became active in local politics and was appointed as the chairman of the Republican City Committee (which he served on for eight years) and the Republican County Committee, as well as being twice nominated for County Clerk. (However, he never won that office.) In 1892, Reily went to Kansas City and was appointed as the Secretary to the Mayor for two terms. Following that, he returned to private life, but was subsequently appointed as Chief Deputy to the County Assessor. In 1902, he was appointed as the Assistant Postmaster for Kansas City. In 1901, Reily founded the Roosevelt Club, which had a stated goal of nominating Vice President Theodore Roosevelt for President in the 1904 elections. The group was disbanded when Roosevelt became President after the assassination of William McKinley in September of that year. As a newspaper editor in Kansas City, Reily was said to be the first prominent figure to endorse Warren G. Harding for the office of President of the United States. When Harding was elected President in 1920, he is said to have sought an appointive office to which he could nominate Reily as a reward for his loyalty, without giving him too much power or presence in Washington. Puerto Rico On July 30, 1921, President Harding nominated Reily as Governor of Puerto Rico. During his time in office, he was a strong supporter of \\"Americanism\\", the introduction of some aspects of mainland United States culture and their advancement over native Puerto Rican culture. During his inauguration address, he insisted that the United States flag (\\"Old Glory\\") should be the only flag used over the island. Additionally, he placed several mainland politicians in prominent positions in the Puerto Rican government. Although Reily was a strong proponent of \\"Americanism\\", he reportedly saw Spanish culture--such as that of Texas, Florida, and California --to be part of this culture. During his term as governor, Spanish Renaissance Revival became the \\"official\\" architectural style of the territory for public buildings and the new Puerto Rico Capitol Building was erected in that style. During his time in office, Reily advocated reducing the use of Spanish in schools in favor of teaching exclusively in English. Reily was an extremely unpopular governor. A common nickname for him, given by the Puerto Rican populace, was \\"Moncho Reyes\\", a name closely resembling Reily's and giving the impression (\\"Moncho\\" being a common countryside nickname for the name \\"Ram√≥n\\") that Reily was an uncivilized hick. He became involved in disputes with numerous political factions in Puerto Rico, some of which called for his removal from office. Reily reported, in a letter to Harding, that he had received death threats. He was also the subject of corruption allegations and an investigation by Puerto Rican local officials. Under pressure to leave office, and suffering from an illness he had contracted during a return visit to the continental United States, Reily resigned as governor on March 1923. He was succeeded by U.S. Representative Horace Mann Towner, the Chairman of the House Committee on Insular Affairs, which had jurisdiction over Puerto Rico. A collection of original correspondence between Reily and President Harding is archived in the Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library.

The only remains discovered so far for this animal consist of a single fossil bone, excavated at the Chota Simla Hill near Jabalpur. In 1934, geologist Dhirendra Kishore Chakravarti, of the Geological Museum of the Banaras Hindu University, considered it a humerus, of a stegosaurian. He named it as the type species Brachypodosaurus gravis. The generic name is derived from Greek Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœçœÇ, brachys, \\"short\\", and œÄŒøœçœÇ, pous, \\"foot\\". The specific name gravis means \\"heavy\\" in Latin.Chakravarti, D.

The holotype is IM V9. The bone is over a foot long. Chakravarti based his identification of the element as a humerus on the presence of a large crest on the shaft, which he took for the deltopectoral crest. The status as a (dinosaurian) humerus is problematic. The bone is flat, has a crest on the other side of the shaft also, is not twisted around its longitudinal axis, is strongly constricted above and below the crests and lacks a clear caput or condyles. In any case, it lacks stegosaurian synapomorphies.Wilson, J. A., P. C. Sereno, S. Srivastava, D. K. Bhatt, A. Khosla, and A.

Even then, however, it was considered a nomen dubium as so few remains of the animal have been found.Maryanska T., 1977. \\"Ankylosauridae (Dinosauria) from Mongolia\\", Palaeontologia Polonica 37:85-151 In 2004, Matthew Lamanna e.a. considered it unlikely that any Ornithischia were present in the Maastrichtian of India.Lamanna, M.C., J.B.

History Harrison and Walker described two \\"bradycnemids\\" from Romania in 1975: B. draculae and Heptasteornis andrewsi. These specimens had initially been assigned to the supposed pelecaniform bird Elopteryx nopcsai.

Starting with Pierce Brodkorb,Brodkorb (1978): pp.223-224 the specimens were soon compared to small theropod dinosaurs. These three genera Bradycneme, Elopteryx and Heptasteornis have been synonymized, split, and reassessed numerous times since thenPaul (1988), Weishampel et al. (1991), Le Loeuff et al.

Usually, at least one of them is considered to be a troodontid. In the most recent assessments, Bradycneme and Heptasteornis were found to be the same and most likely basal members of the Tetanurae in one study,Csiki & Grigorescu (1998) but Darren Naish did not follow the synonymy and found Heptasteornis to be an alvarezsaurid, while classifying Bradycneme as an indeterminate maniraptoran.Naish & Dyke (2004) In a 2011 classification, Tom Holtz assigned Bradycneme to the Alvareszauridae along with Heptasteornis.Holtz, Thomas R.

On this double-decker bus‚Äîwhich operated in Vienna, Austria from the early 1960s‚Äîpassengers boarded at the rear, passed the conductor and exited through the middle or front doors. Bus conductors (also referred to as conductors, or clippies) were a common feature of many local bus services in larger towns and cities in the UK and Ireland, until the late 1970s and early 1980s. The main reason two-person crews were needed was that most towns and cities used double-decker buses for urban services. Until the 1960s, all double deck vehicles were built with front-mounted engines and a \\"half-cab\\" design, like the familiar AEC Routemaster London bus. This layout totally separated the driver from the passenger saloons. The conductor communicated with the driver using a series of bell codes, such as two bells to start (the well-known \\"ding-ding\\"). Many half-cab double-deckers were boarded from an open platform at the rear, while others were equipped with a forward entrance and staircase and driver-operated doors. Each case required a conductor to collect fares and, especially on the rear-entrance design, supervise passenger loading and unloading. Some bus services in the late 1960s and early 1970s experimented with later-model forward entrance half-cab double- deckers‚Äîremoving the conductor and having the driver sell tickets, as on the rear entrance buses that were common by that time. The hope was to have the benefits of one-person operation without the cost of replacing vehicles that still remaining service life. This idea was soon scrapped and the buses reverted to conventional conductor operation. Demise In the late-1950s, new double-decker bus designs appeared that provided higher capacity, with the engine compartment at the rear and the entrance door by the driver. From July 1966, UK transport regulations were changed to allow operation of urban double-deck buses by the driver only, who could now collect fares and supervise all passenger loading and unloading. Some municipal operators adopted rear-engine bus designs and \\"one-person operation\\" quickly, others more slowly. More conservative municipal operators continued to order new half-cab buses through the 1960s, but this type of vehicle ceased production in the UK by about 1970. This was accelerated by a UK Government grant that supported the purchase of \\"one person operated\\" vehicles, but was not available for purchase of traditional half-cab buses. Through the 1970s, the proportion of urban bus routes operated with conductors declined, as older vehicles were steadily replaced with new buses equipped for one-person operation, and operators grappled with staff shortages, rapidly increasing costs and falling usage. Exceptions =China= Bus conductors are still common on most buses in Beijing city. =Britain and Ireland= By the early 1980s bus conductors were largely obsolete in all cities except London and Dublin. London was a special case. Two-person crews continued to operate a number of bus routes in central London until late 2005, well beyond their demise in the rest of the country. This reprieve for conductors was due to continued use of the famous Routemaster bus. The Routemaster was purpose-built for London conditions and remained well suited to the busiest routes in the most congested parts of central London. This was because of its maneuverability, fast passenger loading/unloading capability, and fare collection by the conductor instead of the driver. The Routemaster construction was of high quality, the design robust, and mechanical and body parts could be easily rebuilt and refurbished. Importantly, the \\"traditional red bus\\" is also a unique tourism icon for London, instantly recognisable around the world. Though the majority of bus services in the London metropolis (and all routes outside the central area) have been operated by modern driver- only vehicles since the late 1980s, as of 2003, twenty regular routes retained Routemasters and conductors. Between 2003 and 2005, all of these were progressively converted to modern vehicles and one-person operation. The process was largely driven by political views on disability accessibility and encouraged to some extent by the increase in litigious passengers claiming injuries due to the Routemaster's open rear platform. There were also increasingly frequent robberies and attacks on conductors, who could find themselves working in an isolated and vulnerable environment. The last \\"regular\\" (as opposed to tourist-oriented) Routemaster-operated service was on route 159 from Marble Arch to Streatham. Conductor operation finally ceased on the 159 on 9 December 2005. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, there was a revival in conductor operation on buses in the UK with the development of the FTR routes in York, Leeds and Swansea. As of 2020,these have all been withdrawn however. Stagecoach Strathtay still uses conductors on service 73(A) from Arbroath, Carnoustie and Monifieth to Ninewells Hospital. Unfortunately, as of September 2020, Stagecoach Strathtay have announced their intention to withdraw their final conductors from the 73 ‚ÄúTayway‚Äù service resulting in 31 redundancies. Whilst the operator attributes this in part to the Covid-19 pandemic and it‚Äôs resultant drive towards contactless payment, staff had been aware for some time that the role of conductor was under threat. This news comes on the 40th anniversary year of the ‚ÄúTayway‚Äù route. Quantock Motor Services, Somerset, operates the service 400 'Exmoor Explorer' using crew- operated vintage open-top buses. Conductors also returned to London in 2012 with the introduction of the New Routemaster. Some of the routes served by the New Routemaster will not have conductors, so the service will be driver-only operation controlling three doors of the bus. The role of the conductor is to ensure passengers validate their Oyster card as they board the bus and supervise passengers using the open platform. These have since all been removed and buses now run one person operation with the open platform closed out of use. =India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Qatar, and Sri Lanka = In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Qatar, and Sri Lanka bus conductors are almost always present inside the buses throughout the journey. Government bus conductors may communicate with the driver via a bell, whistle, or by shouting, \\"right!\\" (Aa right in south India). Private bus conductors use whistles or just shout to the driver. Also its quite common practice for conductors to clap their hand firmly on the outside of the bus as a signal to the driver that all passengers have boarded and the bus is good to go. Indian actor superstar Rajinikanth began acting in plays while working in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor. = Mauritius = It is a common practice in Mauritius to see a bus driver and a bus conductor. The bus conductor's job is mainly to collect money and hand out travel tickets to the passengers.

The single species, Elopteryx nopcsai, is known only from very incomplete material, and therefore is considered a nomen dubium (\\"dubious name\\") by most paleontologists. History of discovery and naming =Initial finds= In the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the famous Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s found near S√Ænpetru, in what is now the Romanian region of Transylvania, some bone fragments of a small theropod. These were acquired by the British Museum of Natural History. In 1913, curator Charles William Andrews named these as the type species Elopteryx nopcsai. The genus name Elopteryx is from Ancient Greek helos (·ºïŒªŒøœÇ), \\"marsh\\" + pteryx (œÄœÑŒ≠œÅœÖŒæ), \\"wing\\". The specific name honors Nopcsa. Initially, Elopteryx was described from its holotype, a proximal left femur, specimen BMNH A1234. A second upper left thighbone fragment, BMNH A1235, was referred. A distal left tibiotarsus was also tentatively assigned to this taxon; it was initially classified with the same specimen number as the holotype and was found in close proximity, but may not be from the same individual (see below). This has since been relabeled and is now specimen BMNH A4359. The exact location and time of the discoveries are today unknown. The fossils date from the early-late Maastrichtian (Begudian) faunal stage, circa 71-66 million years ago, originating from the S√¢npetru Formation of the Ha»õeg Island. The animal was by Andrews believed to be a pelecaniform seabird.Harrison & Walker (1975)Andrews (1913) In 1929 the Hungarian paleontologist K√°lm√°n Lambrecht referred two more specimens: BMNH A PAL.1528 and BMNH A PAL.1588, respectively a left and a right tibiotarsus.Lambrecht, K., 1929, \\"Mesozoische und terti√§re Vogelreste aus Siebenb√ºrgen\\" Comptes- Rendus Xe Congres International de Zoologie, Budapest, section 8, 1262-1275 In 1933 Lambracht named a separate family Elopterygidae.Lambrecht, K., 1933, Handbuch der Palaeornithologie. Gebr√ºder Borntraeger, Berlin The supposed family Elopterygidae was initially placed in the suborder Sulae - then still in the polyphyletic \\"Pelecaniformes\\" - in 1963 by Pierce Brodkorb in his fossil bird catalogue, and the Cenozoic genera Argillornis and Eostega were moved to it.Brodkorb (1963): pp.248-249 These two are unequivocal derived neornith birds and the latter indeed seems to be an ancient sulid, whereas Argillornis has turned out to be referrable to the giant pseudotooth bird Dasornis which was almost certainly not very closely related to the Sulae.Mayr (2008) Reconstruction attempts of E. nopcsai like this are based on this presumed affiliation with gannets and cormorants. But more recent studies would result in radically different interpretations. =Later finds= Elopteryx nopcsai on 2005 Romanian stamp In 1975, the distal tibiotarsi BMNH A1588 and BMNH A1528, together with BMNH A4359, were by Colin James Oliver Harrison and Cyril Alexander Walker removed from Elopteryx, redescribed as Bradycneme draculae and Heptasteornis andrewsi respectively, and used to establish a supposed family of gigantic two metre tall owls, the Bradycnemidae. In 1978 Brodkorb had changed his opinion after the supposed Elopteryx material was divided among three species in total, and was actually the first scholar in modern times to suggest that these Mesozoic bones were not of birds but of non-avian dinosaurs.Brodkorb (1978): pp.223-224 In 1981, Dan Grigorescu and Eugen Kessler stated that Elopteryx was a non-avian coelurosaurian dinosaur. They also referred a supposed distal femur (FGGUB R.351) to Elopteryx,Grigorescu, D. & Kessler, E., 1981, \\"A new specimen of Elopteryx nopcsai from the dinosaurian beds of Hateg Basin\\", R√©vue Roumaine de G√©ologie, G√©ophysique et G√©ographie, G√©ologie, 24: 171-175 but this was eventually identified as a hadrosauroid distal metatarsal.Kessler, E., Grigorescu D. and Csiki, Z., 2005, \\"Elopteryx revisited - a new bird-like specimen from the Maastrichtian of the Hateg Basin\\", Acta Palaeontologica Romaniae. 5: 249-258 In 1992, it was proposed by Jean Le Loeuff e.a. that Bradycneme and Heptasteornis should be synonymized with E. nopcsai again, and a femur (MDE-D203), an anterior dorsal vertebra (MDE-D01), a posterior sacral vertebra (MDE collection, unnumbered) and some dorsal rib fragments from the Jurassic Gr√®s √† Reptiles formation of France were described as an indeterminate species of Elopteryx; that study placed all this material in the Dromaeosauridae or a family or subfamily (Elopteryginae) very close to these.Le Loeuff et al. (1992) The vertebrae were in 1998 separated again and assigned to a new dromaeosaurid, Variraptor mechinorum.Le Loeuff and Buffetaut (1998) The French femur is similar in general appearance to the Elopteryx type but it differs in diagnostic traits, e.g. lacking a fourth trochanter. Also, neither the ribs nor the tibiotarsi can be compared to the type specimen of Elopteryx, there being no overlapping material. In 2005, by Kessler yet another (distal) femur piece, FGGUB R.1957, has been placed with Elopteryx on the basis of the bone texture. Phylogeny Modern interpretations have differed on the question whether the Bradycneme and Heptasteornis material should be included ‚Äî they have meanwhile been synonymized and split from each other and Elopteryx many times ‚Äî and what the exact affiliations of the material would be. Various solutions were proposed for this problem.E.g. Le Loeuff et al. (1992), Csiki & Grigorescu (1998) During the eighties some researchers proposed Elopteryx were a member of the Troodontidae,Paul (1988), Weishampel et al. (1991) without being able to support this with much empirical evidence. In 1998 Csiki & Grigorescu suggested that Elopteryx belonged to the Maniraptora, while Bradycneme had a more basal position in the Tetanurae.Csiki & Grigorescu (1998) In 2004 Elopteryx was by Darren Naish and Gareth Dyke considered a eumaniraptoran incertae sedis, possibly either a non- ornithuromorphan pygostylian birdMost of these - like Confuciusornis or Enantiornithes - are only known since the late 20th century. or a troodontid, while Bradycneme would be a maniraptor, and Heptasteornis (at least its holotype BMNH A4359) a member of the Alvarezsauridae.Naish & Dyke (2004) Thus E. nopcsai seems to be some sort of birdlike eumaniraptoran, but not related to modern birds. In 2005 Kessler however, reunited all the material in Elopteryx but considered it an alvarezsaurid.

The specimens were originally described by Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Halszka Osm√≥lska in 1975 and named as a second species of Protoceratops, Protoceratops kozlowskii, the specific name honouring Polish paleontologist Roman Koz≈Çowski.Marya≈Ñska, T.; Osm√≥lska, H., 1975, \\"Protoceratopsidae (Dinosauria) of Asia\\", Palaeontologica Polonica 33: 133‚Äì181 The holotype, ZPAL MgD-I/117, was found in the Barun Goyot Formation dating from the late Campanian. It consists of a juvenile postcranial skeleton. Other specimens were referred: MgD-Ij116, a skull and lower jaws of a juvenile; MgD-Ij 118, fragmentary postcrania and lower jaws of a juvenile; MgD-Ij119, a dentary and three neural arches; MgD-IjI20, two dentaries and loose teeth; MgD-JjI21, a maxilla fragment with four teeth of a juvenile; and MgD-JjI22, teeth. They were then named as a separate genus, Breviceratops, by Sergei Mikhailovich Kurzanov in 1990, the generic name combining the Latin brevis, \\"short\\", with a reference to the Ceratopsia.Kurzanov, S., 1990, \\"A new Late Cretaceous protoceratopsid genus from Mongolia\\", Palaeontological Journal, 24: 85-91 Kurzanov also referred an additional number of fossils from Khermin Tsav, the type locality of Bagaceratops, to the new genus. The Khermin Tsav specimens closely resemble Bagaceratops, which has led to the proposal that Breviceratops and Bagaceratops are synonymous. However, the type specimen from Khulsan has premaxillary teeth and lacks a foramen between the premaxilla and maxilla, features inconsistent with Bagaceratops. Classification Breviceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. It has been assigned to the Bagaceratopsidae by Vladimir Alifanov, in which Magnirostris appears to be its closest relative.

It is known from partial remains including lower jaws, a tail vertebra, hand bones, and hind limbs, all found in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada. Caenagnathus weighted about a maximum of .  Description  Caenagnathus was a large oviraptorosaurian, with some specimens suggesting it achieved sizes comparable to its relative Anzu. Like Anzu, it had a toothless lower beak that was shallower in depth than those of elmisaurines. It also shared with Anzu less gracile proportions than those of elmisaurines. Like all oviraptorosaurs, it would most likely have possessed a coat of feathers. Classification This dinosaur has a confusing history. In 1936, a set of jaws (CMN 8776) were found, and later given the name Caenagnathus, meaning 'recent jaw'; they were first thought to be those of a bird. In 1988, a specimen from storage since 1923 was discovered and studied. This fossil were used to link the discoveries of several fragmentary oviraptorosaur species into a single dinosaur, which was assigned to the genus Chirostenotes, originally named for a pair of hands that were long considered to come from the same animal as Caenagnathus. Since the first name applied to any of these remains was Chirostenotes, this was the only name recognized as valid for many years. However, Senter and Parrish (2005) doubted the synonymy of Caenagnathus with Chirostenotes, noting that the maxillary remains included in the Epichirostenotes holotype didn't overlap with CMN 8776. A cladistic analysis of Coelurosauria by Senter (2007) found Caenagnathus to fall basally within Caenagnathoidea, while Chirostenotes fell as a derived taxon related to Elmisaurus.Senter, P (2007). \\"A new look at the phylogeny of Coelurosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\\". Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 5 (4): 429‚Äì463. . The status and relationships of Caenagnathus to other caenagnathid oviraptorosaurians began to be resolved with the discovery of more complete specimens in 2014 and 2015. The description of Anzu wyliei in 2014 represented the first nearly complete caenagnathid, and helped to clarify the differences between the more fragmentary specimens. Phylogenetic analyses found Caenagnathus collinsi to be more closely related to Anzu than to Chirostenotes. A second species which had previously been referred to Caenagnathus, \\"Caenagnathus\\" sternbergi, was found to be sister taxon to the grouping of Anzu and Caenagnathus in one 2014 analysis. In 2015, new fossil remains were found to belong to Caenagnathus collinsi. These appeared to be intermediate in size and anatomy between the smaller Chirostenotes and the larger Anzu, lending support to their hypothesized relationships. These bones can be distinguished from Chirostenotes and contemporary \\"Leptorhynchos\\" elegans by features of the limbs, specifically the hand and metatarsals. Mandible (left) compared to that of Chirostenotes (right) A new Chirostenotes specimen described by Funston and Currie (2020) preserving a mandible provides further evidence that Caenagnathus is a distinct genus from Chirostenotes despite both taxa being part of the Caenagnathidae.G.

The site was the first pre-Clovis site discovered in southeastern North America; radiocarbon evidence suggest that the site date from 14,200 to 14,550 BP. These dates are roughly 1,000 to 1,500 years before the advent of the Clovis culture.Dunbar: 414 Early dates for Page-Ladson challenge theories that humans quickly decimated large game populations in the area once they arrived. Prehistoric environment At the height of the last ice age (the Wisconsin glaciation), the sea level was up to 100 meters lower than at present. Much more land was above the water along the coast, which was extended much farther to the west. Most of Florida is a thick limestone platform, with typical Karst topography. As limestone is porous, salt water penetrates the lower part of the Florida platform, and fresh water floats on top of the salt water. With the lowered sea level of the ice age, the fresh water table in Florida also was lowered, leaving most of Florida much drier than it is at present. The only reliable sources of fresh water at elevations that are currently above sea level were sinkholes and the deeper parts of river beds. The Page-Ladson site was one of those watering holes, located in a ravine that is now the bed of the river.Brown:13-14Milanich:38-40 Before it was inundated by the Aucilla river, Page-Ladson was a sinkhole containing a small pond within it. Currently, Page-Ladson is about 60 m by 45 m wide and 10 m deep. The lower part of the Aucilla River (from the Cody Scarp to the Gulf of Mexico) crosses the Woodville Karst Plain, which consists of a thin layer of sand over limestone bedrock. Much of the flow of the Aucilla River has been captured by an underground drainage system created by karst processes. Sections of the river are entirely underground, surfacing for short stretches and then disappearing again. The Page-Ladson site is located in one of the above ground sections, known as Half-Mile Run (although it is closer to one mile long). Other sites on the Aucilla River also are yielding paleontological and archaeological finds, all as part of a long-running Aucilla River Prehistory Project.Brown:13-14 Aucilla River Prehistory Project Starting in 1959, Dick Ohmes and other scuba divers began retrieving artifacts and Pleistocene animal bones bearing butcher marks from the lower reaches of the Aucilla River. A team led by archaeologist James Dunbar and paleontologist S. David Webb began a survey of Half-Mile Run in 1983. A former U.S. Navy Seal, Buddy Page, showed them a site where he had found elephant bones. A test pit yielded elephant bones, bone tools, and chips from tool making. Radiocarbon dating of organic material from the pit yielded dates from 13,000 to 11,700 years Before Present. The owners of the land surrounding Half-Mile Run, the Ladson family, granted permission to the team to access and camp along Half-Mile Run. Therefore, the site was named Page-Ladson.Brown:14-15 Excavation of the Page- Ladson site under the lead of Dunbar and Webb spanned the period from 1983 until 1997. As the project progressed, the team developed new methods of recording the stratigraphic placement of all material in an underwater environment.Brown:14-18 This excavation yielded eight lithic artifacts associated with mastodon butchering.Dunbar 2006:90-91,414 This excavation dated the artifacts to approximately 14,400 BP, confirming that the Page- Ladson site was a Pre-Clovis site and the oldest site east of the Mississippi River. In 2012, archaeological excavation at Page-Ladson resumed, following Dunbar's discovery of the pre-Clovis component at the site, with the intention of finding the oldest dates for human remains and artifacts at the site. These excavations continued until 2014. This excavation yielded six lithic artifacts (bifaces and flakes) made from local coastal plain chert from layers dating before Clovis. This excavation dated the site to approximately 14,200 to 14,550 BP, reaffirming the earlier dating from the previous excavation. The 2012-2014 excavation was funded by the Center for the Study of First Americans, and led by Jessi Halligan from Texas A&M; University and other archaeologists at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, with local volunteers. Late Pleistocene animals and Paleoindians The lowest strata in Page-Ladson is late Pleistocene. It includes mastodon, mammoth, horse, ground sloth, palaeolama bones, and \\"straw mats\\" of chopped vegetation (leaves, bark, and wood) of relatively uniform length. The length of the chopped vegetation is consistent with the spacing between cusps on mastodon teeth, and the \\"straw mats\\" have been interpreted as equivalent to the layers of trampled elephant dung found around water holes in Africa. Elephant steroids have been identified in the \\"digesta\\" deposits at Page-Ladson and Latvis-Simpson (a 32,000-year-old mastodon site farther south in the Aucilla). Some of the bones from this level show apparently human-made cut marks, particularly a complete mastodon tusk. Ivory spear points (often called \\"foreshafts\\") are found more frequently in the Aucilla River than from any other sites in North America. Samples from the \\"straw mat\\" level have yielded radiocarbon dates from 13,130 +/- 200 to 11,770 +/- 90 years Before Present. The \\"straw mat\\" level is covered by a layer of mud that did not contain any bones of extinct animals. People of the early Archaic period In 1996 an Early Archaic Bolen habitation level was found. At least three hearths were identified along with various stone points, scrapers, adzes, and gouges that were found, as well as antler points used to press flakes off the stone tools. Three wooden stakes were found upright in the ground, and a cypress log that had been burned on the top side and hollowed out. Radiocarbon dating yielded dates approximately 10,000 years Before Present. The site was well preserved because it had been flooded by a rise in the river level within a hundred years after the site had been occupied. Evidence of Floridian human and mastodon coexistence Underwater archaeologists and other researchers reexamining the Page-Ladson site have shown that some Late Pleistocene human populations provisioned themselves with mastodons that were either butchered or scavenged 14,450 years ago (~14,550 cal yr B.P.) , about 2000 years before large mammal extinction. Prior to this determination, evidence of human scavenging or butchering of mastodons was deemed ambiguous. \\"The new discoveries at Page-Ladson show that people were living in the Gulf Coast area much earlier than believed, The stone tools and faunal remains at the site show that at 14,550 years ago, people knew how to find game, fresh water and material for making tools. These people were well-adapted to this environment. The site is a slam-dunk pre- Clovis site with unequivocal artifacts, clear stratigraphy and thorough dating\\" (Phys.org).

It serves North Whitehall Township, South Whitehall Township, Upper Macungie Township, and a part of western Allentown.Parkland School District Profile Retrieved on Feb 21, 2010 The district has eight elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school. A new elementary school is being built, and will be finished soon. Parkland School District has a total enrollment of 9,463 K-12 students across its eleven schools as of the 2018-2019 school year. Parkland's superintendent is Richard T. Sniscak, who has served the position since 2011. Parkland High School With 3,222 students in the 2016-2017 school year, Parkland High School is the largest high school in the Lehigh Valley. Orefield Middle School Orefield Middle School is located in Orefield, PA, on PA Route 309. It is the home of Parkland's football stadium and bus depot. The school serves the northern half of the district, primarily north of Tilghman Street. =History= Orefield Middle School was founded in 1999. Its predecessor, Troxell Junior High School, was established when students in grades 7 to 9 were moved from Parkland High School due to overcrowding. When the new and current Parkland High School was constructed in 1999, the school was moved from Troxell to the old high school building and renamed Orefield Middle School to serve students in grades 6 to 8. During the first two terms in the new building, the facility was renovated to accommodate middle school instruction. In 2014, a rain garden was installed in a courtyard to aid in environmental education. =Academics= Students at Orefield are assigned to teams of teachers that are instructors for core subjects. There are six teams for 6th grade, and three teams each for 7th and 8th grades. The school also has language, music, art, and technology classes. Orefield Middle School's 2014 performance profile indicated that the school has an academic score of 89.3. Springhouse Middle School Springhouse Middle School is located in Allentown, PA, on Springhouse road just behind the Administration building. It serves the southern half of the district, primarily south of Tilghman Street. = History = Springhouse Middle School was initially a Junior High School serving grades 7-9. However, when the new High School was constructed and Troxell Junior High School closed, Springhouse began serving grades 6-8. In 2006 the school underwent a renovation and expansion due to overcrowding (spurring from numerous new developments in Upper Macungie). The D-wing, auxiliary gymnasium, health class rooms, and a new dedicated band room were part of the expansion. Despite this, the school is again dealing with overcrowding and in 2016 had to recently cede some of its sending area to Orefield. =Academics= Students at Springhouse are assigned to teams of teachers that are instructors for core subjects. There are eight teams for 6th grade, and three teams each for 7th and 8th grades. The school also has language, music, art, and technology classes. Springhouse Middle School's 2016 performance profile indicated that the school has an academic score of 81.14. In 2014, the school became famous for becoming the first-ever Science Olympiad team to make the national competition, where they won the DuPont Enterprise Excellence Award. Springhouse has made the national competition in 2015 and 2016 as well, winning numerous gold medals in various categories. Cetronia Elementary School Cetronia Elementary School is currently rated the fourth best school out of the entire school district. With three floors and three hallways, the school holds almost 500 students during the school year. Cetronia is the home of the \\"hedgehogs\\". The students are exposed to various extra activities, such as library, gym, music, and art. At grade 3, students are asked to choose an instrument to play throughout school until their graduation of high school. With cleanly kept playgrounds, a track, and a basketball court, the students are exposed to fresh air for 20 minutes of their day. They are also rewarded for good behavior with a STARS ticket in rare occasions. Those also lead to more rewards of playing video games with the principal and gift cards for various places. Fogelsville Elementary School :Symbolized by a rosette encircled in a scalloped design on the front of the building, Fogelsville Elementary School was built in 1965. These seven separate rosettes, which are located both inside and outside the school, are mosaics set into the brickwork. According to Pennsylvania Dutch legend, the rosette repels ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù and the scalloped design helps the students inside ‚Äúsail smoothly‚Äù through life. Intended by its architects to reflect the historical roots of the school's community, the school was first called The Upper Macungie Elementary School and in 1970 renamed to Fogelsville Elementary School. When dedicated in 1965, the original building consisted of 13 classrooms, a library, a health room, and an activity building, which accommodated 411 students. Today, Fogelsville Elementary consists of 28 classrooms with an enrollment of 694 students, which presently is the largest of the eight elementary schools. Fogelsville Elementary School is the home of the ‚Äúfoxes‚Äù. Ironton Elementary School Ironton Elementary School was built in 1942. Kernsville Elementary School Built in the 1850s as a one room schoolhouse, Kernsville is located on Orefield Road in Orefield, PA. It is a mere mile away from Orefield Middle School, serving 396 students in the 2016-2017 school year. Kratzer Elementary School Named after Johannes Kratzer, a German immigrant and farmer who, near the turn of the 19th century and for the consideration of one dollar, donated a corner of his extensive family farm for the construction of a public schoolhouse. Later, when the Parkland School District was formed and unified, the original Kratzer schoolhouse served as the Parkland Community Center. The original building was torn down in the 1960s, but the modern building still retains the name of the original landowner, whose descendants still reside in Lehigh County. A portrait of Kratzer which hung inside the original building has been lost. There are approximately 400 students that attend Kratzer Elementary School. Parkway Manor Elementary School Schnecksville Elementary School Fred Jaindl Elementary School Named after Frederick J. Jaindl, farmer and philanthropist. It broke ground on March 29, 2009 and the school opened its doors in August 2010. The 20-acre site near Trexlertown accommodates approximately 600 students in grades K-5. It is also located near the Lehigh Valley Velodrome, and Grim Road.

Its jaws contained many small-to-medium-sized, serrated, leaf-shaped teeth. Its hands and feet had five digits each; the hands in particular were long and narrow, and bore a large claw. The forelimbs were longer than the hindlimbs, in contrast to the more derived sauropods. It has been calculated around 9-10 m long.Redelstorff, R. A. G. N. A., Sander, P. M., & Galtom, P. M. (2013).

Zentralbahn Interregio train following the Lake Brienz shoreline, near Niederried. The Zentralbahn is a Swiss railway company that owns and operates two connecting railway lines in Central Switzerland and the Bernese Oberland. It was created on January 1, 2005, with the acquisition of the independently owned Luzern‚ÄìStans‚ÄìEngelberg line, and the Br√ºnig line of the Swiss Federal Railways. The company has its headquarters in Stansstad. The railway owns the infrastructure of the long inter-regional Br√ºnig line, which links Lucerne and Interlaken over the Br√ºnig Pass, and the long Luzern‚ÄìStans‚ÄìEngelberg line from Hergiswil, on the Br√ºnig line some out of Lucerne, to Engelberg. Both lines are built to the , and use rack railway technology to climb their steepest gradients, although most of both lines uses conventional adhesion. The railway operates two hourly InterRegio express services, one between Lucerne and Interlaken, and one between Lucerne and Engelberg. It also operates two half-hourly services of the Lucerne S-Bahn, the S4 between Lucerne and Wolfenschiessen and the S5 between Lucerne and Giswil. At the Interlaken end of the line, an hourly Regio service is operated as far as Meiringen. Only the two InterRegio services traverse the company's rack sections and require rack equipped stock.  History  The two lines of the Zentralbahn have quite distinct histories. = History of the Br√ºnig line = The Br√ºnig line was constructed in incremental stages between 1888 and 1916. The first stages, over the Br√ºnig Pass between Brienz and Alpnachstad were opened by the Jura‚ÄìBern‚ÄìLucerne Railway (JBL), who also extended the line from Alpnachstad to Lucerne, giving connections to the rest of the Swiss railway network. Subsequently the JBL became part of the Jura‚ÄìSimplon Railway (JS) in 1891, and the JS became part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1903. The SBB opened the last section of the line, from Brienz to Interlaken in 1916. As constructed, the line was operated by steam locomotives, and used the Riggenbach rack system to overcome gradients of up to 12% on the approaches to each side of the Br√ºnig Pass. The line was electrified in 1941 and 1942, using the standard Swiss main line system of supplied by overhead line. The rack sections were retained. = History of the Luzern‚ÄìStans‚ÄìEngelberg line = The major part of the line to Engelberg was constructed by Stansstad‚ÄìEngelberg Railway (StEB) and opened in 1898. The line ran from Stansstad to Engelberg and, like the Br√ºnig line in its early days, relied on steamship connections with the rest of the Swiss railway network. Unlike the Br√ºnig line, the StEB line was electrified from its opening, using a three-phase alternating current overhead line supply. It also used the Riggenbach rack system on its final approaches to Engleberg, but with a very steep maximum gradient of 25%. In 1960 work started on connecting the Engelberg line to the Swiss railway network by constructing a new line between Stansstad and Hergiswil on the Br√ºnig line. This involved constructing a bridge over the narrow Alpnachersee arm of Lake Lucerne, followed by the Lopper II tunnel, under a shoulder of Mount Pilatus. In order to allow Engelberg trains to run over the Br√ºnig line into Lucerne, the whole railway was converted to the same electrical system (), and new rolling stock acquired. The line reopened in 1964, and the owning company changed its name to the Luzern‚ÄìStans‚ÄìEngelberg Railway (LSE). = Merger and since = For 40 years, the ownership structure of the two lines remained unchanged, with LSE owned trains running over SBB owned tracks between Hergiswil and Lucerne. However, in June 2004, the Swiss Federal Council empowered the SBB to transfer the Br√ºnig line to the LSE with effect from January 2005. In return the LSE issued shares to the SBB, and as a result 2/3 of its shares are now owned by SBB. The LSE was subsequently renamed the Zentralbahn to reflect its much larger scale of operation. At the end of 2009, the Zentralbahn took over the operation of the (standard gauge) tracks of the Kriens-Luzern-Bahn between Lucerne and Horw. Most of these tracks were already laid in a dual gauge configuration with the metre gauge tracks of the Br√ºnig line. Since the merger several major projects have been undertaken. In 2010, the Grafenort to Engelberg tunnel was constructed to replace the very steep final approach to Engelberg. Whilst still rack operated, the tunnel has a maximum gradient of 10.5% as opposed to 25%. In late 2012, a new tunnel route was opened between Kriens Mattenhof station and the approaches to Lucerne station, on the stretch of the Br√ºnig line also used by Engelberg trains. The tunnel replaces a less direct surface alignment, allowing the abolition of several congested level crossings and the provision of double track. A new station, Lucerne Allmend/Messe, built within the tunnel, serves the Swissporarena.

A live version of the song was recorded and released in 1997 during Bowie's Earthling Tour. Background The name is taken from the Greek goddess, Athena, who is famously depicted in Athenian statues under the form of Pallas Athena. Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man. The lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, \\"God is on top of it, that's all,\\" delivered as though from an African- American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrowful melody. The piece develops into a techno dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlaid atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with Lester Bowie on trumpet. A lyric, \\"We are, we are, we are, we are praying,\\" is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song restates Bowie's interest in how man relates with God. Bowie used to play a drum'n'bass version of the song during his 1997 Earthling Tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland 10 June 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12\\" vinyl.

Historically, it is very obscure and usually referred to Cetiosaurus, but recent analyses suggest that it is a distinct genus, and possibly related to Turiasaurus. Cardiodon was the first sauropod genus named.Taylor, Michael P., 2010, \\"Sauropod dinosaur research: a historical review\\", pp. 361-386 in: Richard T. J. Moody, Eric Buffetaut, Darren Naish and David M. Martill (eds.), Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: a Historical Perspective. Geological Society of London, Special Publication 343 History and taxonomy Richard Owen named the genus for a now-lost tooth, part of the collection of naturalist Joseph Chaning Pearce, found near Bradford-on-Avon, but did not assign it a specific name at the time. The generic name is derived from Greek Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒØŒ±, kardia, \\"heart\\", and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ, odon, \\"tooth\\", in reference to its heart-shaped profile.Owen, R. (1841). Odontography, Part II. Hippolyte Bailli√®re. 655 p. A few years later, in 1844, he added the specific name rugulosus, meaning \\"wrinkled\\" in Latin.Owen, R. (1844). Odontography, Part III. Hippolyte Bailli√®re. 655 p. Cardiodon was the first sauropod given a formal name to, though Owen was at the time completely unaware of the sauropod nature of the find. Within a few decades, he and others were viewing Cardiodon as a possible synonym of his most well-known sauropod genus, Cetiosaurus.Phillips, J. (1871). Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames. Clarendon Press:Oxford, 529 p.Owen, R. (1875). Monographs of the fossil Reptilia of the Mesozoic formations (part III) (genera Bothriospondylus, Cetiosaurus, Omosaurus). Palaeontographical Society Monographs 29:15-93. Richard Lydekker formalized this view in a roundabout way in 1890, by assigning Cetiosaurus oxoniensis to Cardiodon on the basis of teeth from Oxfordshire associated with a skeleton of C. oxoniensis.Lydekker, R. (1890). Suborder Sauropoda. In: Lydekker, R. (ed.). Catalogue of the Fossil Reptile and Amphibia of the British Museum (Natural History). Part 1. Taylor and Francis:London, p. 131-152. He also added a second tooth (BMNH R1527) from the Great Oolite near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. More typically, Cardiodon has been assigned to Cetiosaurus, sometimes as a separate species Cetiosaurus rugulosus,Steel, R. (1970). Part 14. Saurischia. Handbuch der Pal√§oherpetologie/Encyclopedia of Paleoherpetology. Part 14. Gustav Fischer Verlag:Stuttgart, p. 1-87. in spite of its priority. In 2003, Paul Upchurch and John Martin, reviewing Cetiosaurus, found that there is little evidence to assign the C. oxoniensis teeth to the skeleton, and the \\"C. oxoniensis\\" teeth differ from the Cardiodon teeth (Cardiodon teeth are convex facing the tongue); therefore, they supported Cardiodon being retained as its own genus.Upchurch, P.M., and Martin, J. (2003). The anatomy and taxonomy of Cetiosaurus (Saurischia, Sauropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of England. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 23(1):208-231. Upchurch et al. (2004) repeated this assessment, and found that though the teeth have no known autapomorphies, they are those of a eusauropod.Upchurch, P.M., Barrett, P.M., and Dodson, P. (2004). Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd edition). University of California Press:Berkeley, p. 259-322. More recently, Royo-Torres et al. (2006), in their description of Turiasaurus, pointed out Cardiodon as a possible relative to their new, giant sauropod, placing it in the Turiasauria.Royo-Torres, R., Cobos, A., and Alcal√°, L. (2006). A giant European dinosaur and a new sauropod clade. Science 314:1925-1927. Earlier, Cardiodon had been usually assigned to the Cetiosauridae or a Cardiodontidae of its own. Description The original tooth shows, as far as can be deduced from the surviving illustrations, the rare combination of being spatulate and having a convex inner side, though the convexity is slight. Its crown is short and wide, slightly curving to the inside. The outer side is strongly convexly curved from the front to the rear.

Early life  Webb was born February 14, 1847, in Keokuk County, Iowa, the seventh of twelve children born to William Webb Jr and Innocent Blue Brown Webb. Webb moved about often in his youth. The family moved to Nebraska in 1862, and later to Osage City, Kansas. Webb headed west on his own in 1871, working as a buffalo hunter and miner along the way.  Gunfighter  Webb drifted to Dodge City, Kansas, where he came into contact with several notable personalities of the old west, including Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. While there, he took part as a member of several posses and served as a deputy. By January 1878, Bat Masterson was the newly appointed sheriff of Ford County. Masterson deputized Webb and two others, Kinch Riley and Dave \\"Prairie Dog\\" Morrow, to track down outlaws who had robbed a train.John Joshua Webb - Lawman Turned Outlaw. One of those outlaws was \\"Dirty Dave\\" Rudabaugh. The deputies caught up with the outlaws and, during the arrest, Rudabaugh went for his gun but was overwhelmed by Webb and disarmed. Rudabaugh informed on his cohorts, and they received prison sentences, whereas he was later released. In September 1878, exaggerated reports of Cheyenne raids on the populace prompted the government to send firearms to Dodge City to be used for self-defense by the citizens. Army Lt. Colonel William Henry Lewis selected Webb, Bill Tilghman, and others to serve as Army scouts. In 1879, Webb was selected to serve as a hired gun by Bat Masterson during the fight for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway during the Railroad Wars in Royal Gorge Colorado. He moved on from there to Las Vegas, New Mexico, joining Dave Mather, Doc Holliday and others. Shortly after arriving there, he partnered with Doc Holliday in running a saloon, where Doc spent most of his time gambling. In 1880, Webb was appointed town marshal of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Soon afterwards he was made a member of the Dodge City Gang, led by Justice of the Peace Hoodoo Brown. The gang participated in several train and stage coach robberies and were alleged to have taken part in lynchings and murders.  Arrest for murder, jailbreak  On March 2, 1880, Webb and a deputy entered the Goodlet and Roberts Saloon in Las Vegas, where they observed a man named Michael Killiher, armed with a holstered pistol. When ordered to relinquish the pistol, Killiher refused. He then drew his pistol, but Webb quickly drew his own pistol and shot Killiher three times, twice in the chest and once in the head, killing him. Although seemingly justified, rumors quickly spread that JOP Hyman Niell had information that Killiher (a freightor by trade) had in his possession $1,900, and he had sent Webb to take it from him. Whether this was true was never verified, but Webb was arrested for the shooting. He was shortly afterwards convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. It was likely that the general dislike of the Dodge City Gang weighed more on his conviction than his actual guilt in this particular instance. However, on April 30, 1880, Dave Rudabaugh and a man named John Allen burst into the jail to free Webb. The jailbreak was unsuccessful, but Rudabaugh did shoot and kill the jailer, Antonio Lino. Rudabaugh escaped capture but was later arrested, while working with Billy the Kid, on December 23, 1880. Webb's sentence was later commuted to life in prison, and he and Rudabaugh were held together in prison. Determined to escape, Rudabaugh, Webb and two other men named Thomas Duffy and H. S. Wilson, attempted to shoot their way out again on September 19, 1881, but again they were unsuccessful, and Duffy was killed by lawmen. Two months later, Rudabaugh, Webb and five others chipped rocks from the jail wall and successfully escaped. Rudabaugh and Webb fled to Texas, then on to Mexico, where they separated. Rudabaugh was killed shortly afterwards. Webb drifted, changing his name to \\"Samuel King\\" and working for the railroad, eventually moving to Winslow, Arkansas, where he died of smallpox on April 12, 1882.\\"J.J.

He invented the drink in October 1929. Grigg became acquainted with the carbonated beverage business after moving to St. Louis, Missouri. Prior to inventing 7 Up, Grigg had created an orange soft drink named \\"Whistle\\" for the Vess Soda Company. It is still made and sold in St. Louis.  History  Charles Leiper Grigg was born in 1868 in Prices Branch, Missouri to Charles L. S. Grigg (1822-1883) and Mary Elizabeth Leiper Grigg (1839-1890). At the age of 22, Grigg moved to St. Louis and began working in the advertising field in which he was introduced to the carbonated beverage business through the various agencies he was partnered. By 1919, Charles Leiper Grigg was working as a salesman for a manufacturing company owned by Vess Jonea. It was there that Grigg invented and marketed his first soft drink called \\"Whistle\\". The success of the drink led to his promotion to the position of sales and marketing manager, however, eventually he and Voss came to loggerheads and Grigg left the company, leaving Whistle behind. He eventually settled at the Warner Jenkinson Company, developing flavoring agents for soft drinks. It was at this time that Grigg invented then his second soft drink, an orange- flavored beverage with 14% sugar named \\"Howdy\\". He partnered with financier Edmund G. Ridgway and lawyer Frank Gladney and formed the Howdy Company. Based on the quality of the product and supported by Ridgway's financing, the company grew quickly, adding bottling companies anxious to sell the drink. Grigg died in 1940 in St. Louis.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82133020 He was married to Lucy E. Alexander Grigg. Lucy and Charles had several children. Walter, Frank, Ann, Chris, Sebastian, and Joshua. Out of the children, Ann, was the only one with children. She had one child. Nicole Panuzio. Nicole took over the position of head leader at 7-up. Nicole passed away in 2009. She was survived by her three children Raven, Tiffany, and Dominic. The three children have authority of power in 7-up headquarters in California. The children have a large share in the company. The eldest child Raven, is head of entertainment in the department of television marketing. Tiffany and Dominic are underaged and currently are not employed with the company yet.  Urban legend  A common urban legend about Charles Leiper Grigg is that he was an albino, and that the red dot on the bottle is supposed to represent his red eyes. In fact there are no official references to Grigg having been an albino, and in (black-and-white) photographs his eyes appear normally pigmented. 7-up logo with the red dot came into use in the 1970s, after Grigg had died.

It contains one species: Cathetosaurus lewisi that was once thought to be within the genus Camarasaurus. The holotype specimen was originally described by James Jensen and is now in the Brigham Young University collection. Description Sacrum of holotype BYU 9047 Soft tissue from the mouth region of SMA 0002 made researchers propose in 2016 that the tooth crowns were covered by gingival tissue, and perhaps a keratinous beak. The diagnostic characters for Cathetosaurus are: the pelvis is rotated anteriorly, such that the pubis projects posteroventrally, and the ischium projects posteriorly (1), lateroventrally projecting spurs in the neural spines of the last dorsals (2); posterior cervical and anterior dorsal diapophyses bearing an anterior projection lateral to the prezygapophyses (3); frontals with anterior midline projection into the nasals (4); trapezoidal supraoccipital (more expanded dorsally than ventrally) (5); lateral spur on the dorsal part of the lacrimal (6); fenestrated pterygoid (7); and the large pineal foramen between the frontals (8). Because of this, the proportions of the genus are extremely unusual: it has a very large skull relative to the axial skeleton, the limbs are short relative to the axial skeleton, the ribcage is extremely deep, so that the bottom of the ribcage is below the knee level. These features, and the rotation of the pelvis provided larger belly volume to the species. Classification The holotype specimen of Cathetosaurus lewisi is contemporary with the middle of the C. grandis age range. This species was later synonymized with Camarasaurus. More recent research has split the two genera again, based on the recognition of a second specimen.Mateus, O., & Tschopp E. (2013).

He is now based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Background  Holland started competitive sailing at the age of eight and was apprenticed as a boatbuilder in Auckland, where he built his first design, the 26' sloop White Rabbit in 1966.  In the USA  While working in Florida, he designed the 24' Eygthene, which won the 1973 Quarter Ton Cup. (The name of the boat was a pun on the New Zealand pronunciation of the word 'eighteen': quarter-ton yachts are rated at 18-feet under the IOR rating rule). The success of Eygthene led to a commission to design a One-ton class yacht for Irish businessman Hugh Coveney. Golden Apple enabled Holland to set up as independent designer, and he relocated to County Cork in Ireland.  In the Republic of Ireland  In 1974 he designed, and Killian Bushe built Golden Shamrock, his 30' design for the Half Ton Cup in la Rochelle. This was followed in 1975 By Golden Leprechaun another variation of the Half-ton Class. The Shamrocks went into production in Cork. One of these boats, Silver Shamrock, built lightly by Killian Bushe at South Coast Boatyard and steered by Harold Cudmore won the 1976 Half-ton Cup in Trieste, Italy. This was followed by Silver Shamrock III in 1977 which was built in cold moulded spruce for the Half Ton Cup in Sydney Australia. The boat should have won the Half Ton Cup, but lost her mast in the last race. A later design along the same theme was called the Shamrock Silver Jubilee or Nicholson Half Tonner. Probably the best known of these yachts is Grimalkin, which took part in the Fastnet Race of 1979, and became the subject of a book entitled \\"Left for Dead: The Untold Story of the Tragic 1979 Fastnet Disaster\\". Although Grimalkin was abandoned at sea, she was later salvaged afloat and still sails. Meanwhile, Holland's Nicholson 33 design, for the English boatbuilder Camper & Nicholson, had begun production and one of these, Golden Delicious, won the 1975 Fastnet Race. This remarkable feat was repeated in the 2005 Fastnet when \\"Iromiguy\\", another Nicholson 33, took the trophy as overall winner. Other remarkable boat designs include Big Apple, Regardless, Golden Apple of the Sun and Silver Apple of the Moon. Further commissions followed, including a new Morning Cloud for the former British Prime Minister Edward Heath. Holland's designs featured prominently in the 1977 and 1979 Admiral's Cup series of races in Cowes. His 40-footer Imp won the 1977 Fastnet Race. This led to commissions for the 80-foot Maxi Class yachts Kialoa and Condor and for a series of designs for Finnish yachtbuilder Nautor's series of Swan yachts between 1979 and 1990. The Freedom 39 PH, a pilothouse cat-schooner with freestanding masts was also commissioned by Freedom Yachts and began production in 1982. A Holland 30, Screw Loose, won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1979. Condor, the Maxi Class yacht built in 1981, still sails as a passenger boat in Australia's Whitsunday Islands. In 1982, Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari), commissioned \\"Charley\\" - a 67-foot sloop, designed by Ron Holland using the same design thesis as \\"Kialoa\\". \\"Charley\\" went on to win Line-Honors in the 1983 Trans-Pacific Yacht Race and other Pacific racing events.Sail Magazine, July 1983 'NCB Ireland' was the Irish entry in the Volvo Ocean Race. Although built and launched with great fanfare, she did not perform as well as expected or as well as the more adventurous designs from the southern hemisphere sporting a Mizzen rig. The 103-foot Whirlwind, launched in 1986, was Holland's largest design to date and one of the first of a new breed of superyacht - large yachts which used new technologies to provide strong sailing performance without requiring a large crew.http://www.royalhuisman.com/p_mi_wi.htm The 247-foot Mirabella V, launched in 2003, was not only Holland's largest design, but also the largest ever single-masted sailing yacht.  In Vancouver, Canada  Ron Holland currently resides in Vancouver, Canada where he continues work at his yacht design studio.

Teinurosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic in what is now Portugal. The type species is Teinurosaurus sauvagei. It's been estimated to be 11.4 m (37.4 ft) in length and 3.6 tonnes (~4 short tons) in weight. Discovery and taxonomy The holotype was discovered in 1897. Also in 1897, French paleontologist Henri-√âmile Sauvage referred a tail vertebra from the Kimmeridgian of Portugal, catalogued in the collection of the Mus√©e G√©ologique du Boulonnais at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France, to Iguanodon prestwichii (now Cumnoria prestwichii), a herbivorous iguanodont.Sauvage, H.-E., 1897/1898, Les Vert√©br√©s fossiles du Portugal. Contributions √† l'√©tude des poissons et des reptiles du Jurassique et du Cr√©tac√©, M√©moires et Communications du Service g√©ologique du Portugal pp. 1‚Äì46 In 1928 Baron Franz Nopcsa recognised the fossil to be the vertebra of a theropod not an ornithopod. He decided to name it as the genus Teinurosaurus. The name is derived from Greek teinein, \\"to stretch\\", and oura, \\"tail\\", referring to the elongated form.Nopcsa, F., 1928, \\"The genera of reptiles\\", Palaeobiol. 1: 163‚Äì188 However, by a mistake of the printer, the footnote in which the new name was mentioned was not placed at the end of the section referring to the fossil but adjacent to a citation of Saurornithoides Osborn 1924, giving the false impression Nopcsa intended to rename the latter genus. After having discovered the typographical error, Nopcsa in 1929 added an addendum to the article, correcting the mistake.Nopcsa, F., 1929, Addendum \\"The genera of reptiles\\", Palaeobiol. 1: 201 In 1932 German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene again named the fossil, giving it the species name Caudocoelus sauvagei. \\"Caudocoelus\\" means \\"hollow tail\\" in Latin. The specific epithet honours Sauvage.F. v. Huene, 1932, \\"Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte\\", Monographien zur Geologie und Palaeontologie, serie 1 4(1‚Äì2): 1‚Äì361 The name Teinurosaurus was largely forgotten or not even understood to be a synonym of Caudocoelus, until in 1969 John Ostrom revealed its priority. Ostrom also pointed out that Nopcsa had not provided a specific name.Ostrom, J.H., 1969, Osteology of Deinonychus antirrhopus, an Unusual Theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana, Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History 30, pp. 1‚Äì165 In 1978 George Olshevsky was the first to combine the two names, making Teinurosaurus sauvagei (von Huene 1932) Olshevsky 1978 vide Nopcsa 1928 emend. 1929 a valid species name.Olshevsky, G., 1978, \\"The Archosaurian Taxa (excluding the Crocodylia)\\", In: Mesozoic Meanderings 1, pp. 1‚Äì50 The holotype (originally catalogued MGB 500 now BHN2R 240) is a distal caudal vertebra, 152 millimetres long. A number of authors (e.g. Lapparent 1967; Galton 1982) believed that the holotype was destroyed in World War II, but the specimen is still extant, as noted by Buffetaut et al. (1991).Lapparent, 1967.

He played domestic cricket for Karnataka and played two One Day Internationals for India in 1996 Early domestic career Somasundar got his chance on the basis of some fine performances in the domestic circuit with Karnataka. A gutsy batsman, Somasundar made his first appearance for Karnataka in the 1990‚Äì91 season of the Ranji Trophy. He played his first game against Maharashtra in February 1991 alongside another debutante and future India teammate Rahul Dravid. He made scores of 29 and 27 not out in the two innings. He played only one game in the following season, against Tamil Nadu, and returned figures of 3/15 in five overs. When no chances came his way to assure himself a permanent spot in the Karnataka side, Somasundar was backed by former India cricketer Gundappa Viswanath, who was impressed by the former while they played for City Cricketers, a local club. Viswanath's pushing his case and the retirement of Carlton Saldanha, an opening batsman for Karnataka, created a place in the side for Somasundar again. He flowered in 1994‚Äì95 when, pushed to open the batting, he responded immediately by scoring a century against Goa. Somasundar was a key member for Karnataka during the 1995‚Äì96 Ranji Trophy season. He hit two centuries and five half centuries to play a leading role in Karnataka's triumph in the Ranji Trophy. In the final, he made 99 and 53. He aggregated 803 runs at 61.76 for the season. International call-up After impressive performances in the domestic tournaments, Somasundar was called up to the Indian national team for the Titan Cup, a triangular One Day International (ODI) series that also featured South Africa and Australia. He made his debut against South Africa in the first game at Hyderabad. He only managed to score 9, before being run out by Daryll Cullinan. His next ODI would be his last; playing against Australia at his home ground, Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, Somasundar was dismissed by paceman Glenn McGrath for 7. He was subsequently dropped from the side and was replaced by Navjot Singh Sidhu for the rest of the games. Later domestic career Rejected by the national selectors, Somasundar continued to be in good form and in the 1997-98 season, aggregated 629 runs. This was followed by a fine performance the next year when he helped Karnataka to another Ranji Trophy triumph by scoring 529 runs. In the 1998 final against Uttar Pradesh, Somasundar scored a fine 68. During the 1990s, He was part of a Karnataka setup that contributed many players to the Indian team like Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Rahul Dravid, Venkatesh Prasad, David Johnson, Dodda Ganesh and Sunil Joshi. In 2002, playing for Kerala, he scored his highest first class score of 222 against Tripura. He scored over 1000 runs that season which was the highest aggregate by any batsmen that year. He turned out for Saurashtra in the final years of his career and retired in 2007. From November 2006 till May 2012, Sujith Somasundar worked as a Behavioural Expert & a Leadership Training Consultant for Wipro Technologies and was responsible for transforming the performance of their Business leaders and managers.

Crawley Films also produced the earlier 1961 animated series Tales of the Wizard of Oz and brought similar artistic character renditions to the special. There is also a 1985 live-action Disney film of the same name. In the special, Dorothy and Toto arrived back at Oz, after received a letter from one of her Oz friends wanting her back, only to later been warned by a good witch Glinda regarding about the Wicked Witch of the West who got restored back to life, and cast the dark spell by erasing her friends‚Äô abilities and kidnapping the Wizard of Oz for her revenge plot on Dorothy to steal away her magic silver slippers. So along with assist of her Oz pals, Dorothy and Toto must journey out to foil and rid of the Wicked Witch for good. Plot The plot is virtually a retelling of the storyline of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz; however, as this is a sequel to the animated series Tales of the Wizard of Oz, in which Dorothy and the gang went through an entirely different series of adventures, this adventure is new to them all. All of Dorothy's friends become trapped in the situations they were in when she first met them, meaning they all must visit the Wizard as they did in the pilot for the TV series. Dorothy receives a letter from the Scarecrow, called Socrates in the special, as in the series, telling her that everyone is happy with the gifts the Wizard gave them, and that they miss her very much. She goes to find her magic Silver Shoes and is instantly taken back to Oz again by another Kansas twister, this time not by house, but an apple tree. Once she arrives there she is greeted by the Munchkins in Munchkinville. Glinda arrives to tell her that the previously melted Wicked Witch of the West has become reconstituted and is wreaking havoc again, having taken Socrates' diploma and burned it, destroyed the heart of the Tin Woodman, called Rusty, by turning herself into a Tin Woman, and dropping him into a pond where he rusted over again. She has also stolen the medal that belonged to the Cowardly Lion, called Dandy, and turned it into a daisy, and is planning to get Dorothy's silver shoes again. Dorothy sets off to find her friends, without knowing the Wicked Witch is watching them in her Crystal Ball. She finds and oils Rusty who has rusted after the Witch tricked him. They find Socrates in a corn field on a pole scaring crows again and get him down. They find Dandy crying, and after some unexpectedly cruel bullying from Socrates and Rusty, they cheer him up. After the four friends are reunited, they arrive at the Emerald City, only to be tricked by the Witch, who has captured the Wizard and taken over as the ruler of Oz. The Wizard, who in this continuity is not an Omaha huckster but an Ozite born and bred and the elected ruler of Oz, tells them to destroy her again and he will give them what they want. She arrives back at her castle just before Dorothy and her friends, but before they arrive she sends flying alligators to kill them. Socrates' quick thinking saves them as they hide under his straw (a method employed in more than one of the Oz books). Rusty saves them from a lightning bolt by sacrificing himself, which kills him, despite his being made of tin. Dorothy asks Glinda if she will help and a glowing ball brings him back to life. They arrive and are trapped by the Witch. She grabs Dorothy and tries to take her silver slippers. The gang (including the Wizard himself) try to get her back from the Witch, who gives her and Dandy the slippers. Dorothy, who is being held upside-down from the window, tells Dandy that he will turn to stone if he takes them, but he takes them anyway without being turned to stone. The Witch takes them only to be turned into stone, crumble, and fall apart. The gang returns to the Emerald City, only to find out that the Wizard is, after all, a humbug, unable as he always was to return Dorothy home. Glinda appears to tell Dorothy the reason that her friends didn't turn to stone was because they had brains, a heart, and courage. She also explains that the Witch was cruel and heartless, brainless enough to think evil could conquer good and cowardly in that she used slaves and suppressed others. Dorothy wishes to go back, and instantly a Kansas twister whisks her and Toto back home to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry again.

In the latter stages of play, a second tier within the game becomes apparent, demanding a change of tactics. The game was designed by Martin H. Samuel and originally produced by Games Above Board. Sunnywood, Inc., of Hong Kong, licensed the game and published it by Sterling Games in 2003. Giseh Verlag launched the game in Germany at Essen Spiel in 2006. An Axiom-powered electronic version of Mozaic was programmed for PC by Greg Schmidt in 2010. Components Tiled game board 1 emerald-green, 1 ruby-red, 1 diamond-white, 1 onyx-black, 35 amber-golden and 35 cobalt-blue glass gemstones (extra gemstones are provided for each player) Velour pouch Instructions Objective The goal of the game is, to score the most points by placing your gemstones on the board ‚Äî building and/or blocking point- scoring squares. Gameplay The Mozaic game board consists of 64 tiles (8x8 squares) with a score-keeping \\"ladder\\" on either end. Players choose either amber or cobalt and use 32 same-color gemstones + 1 score-keeper each ‚Äî four exception gems are included: *ruby-red = miss this turn. *sapphire-green = slide any gem diagonally to an empty adjacent tile. *onyx-black = take two turns. *diamond-white = remove any gem from the board and replace it in the bag. Exception gemstones are always returned to the bag after a turn. Start with an empty board, end with a full board ... The gemstones are placed in the bag and the first player to draw their color from the bag starts. Players then take turns drawing gems, one at a time, and place them on any empty tile on the board. 4 points are scored when placement of four same-color adjacent gems forming a square is completed ‚Äî existing squares may be built on and expanded. Points are won with a player's own-color gems (even when placed by the opponent) and always accrued, never deducted. Several point-scoring combinations may be completed at one time with a single gem. Overlooked points are forfeited and, throughout the game, players keep score on their side of the board with an extra gem of their color. The game is over when the last gemstone is placed, all the tiles are covered and only the four exception gems remain in the bag then, by comparing accrued points totals, the player with the most points is the winner of the game.

Its fossils have been found in the Judith River Formation in Montana. Although poorly known, Ceratops is important in the history of dinosaurs, since it is the type genus for which both the Ceratopsia and the Ceratopsidae have been named. The material is too poor to be confidently referred to better specimens, and Ceratops is thus considered a nomen dubium. History Illustration of the type specimen by Marsh The first remains referred to Ceratops ‚Äî an occipital condyle and a pair of horn cores ‚Äî were found by John Bell Hatcher (1861‚Äì1904) in the late summer of 1888 near the Cow Creek in Blaine County in the uppermost Judith River Formation of Montana. Hatcher was at the time employed by Professor Othniel Charles Marsh who the same year named the find as the type species Ceratops montanus. The generic name was derived from Greek Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ, keras, \\"horn\\", and ·Ω§œà, ops, \\"face\\". The specific name referred to Montana. Marsh originally believed the animal to be similar to Stegosaurus, but with two horns on the back of its head, a body length of twenty-five to thirty feet, horizontal plates on its back and bipedal. According to Marsh it would have \\"represented a very strange appearance\\". In his illustration of the horn pair, purportedly showing them from behind, Marsh had switched their position and rotated their outside to the rear to make them point inwards.J.B. Hatcher, O.C. Marsh, and R.S. Lull, 1907 The Ceratopsia. Monographs of the United States Geological Survey 49 pp 198 The holotype, USNM 2411, was found in a layer dating from the Campanian. It consists, apart from the occipital condyle, of two supraorbital horn cores of about twenty-two centimetres length. The right horn is attached to a part of the prefrontal. Marsh later referred two squamosals to the species, specimens USNM 4802 and USNM 2415. These however are more likely centrosaurine; they have also been referred to Avaceratops.Penkalski, P.G., 1993, \\"The morphology of Avaceratops lammersi, a primitive ceratopsid from the Campanian of Montana\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 13(3, supplement): 52A In 1906 Richard Swann Lull noted that the name Ceratops had been preoccupied by a bird, Ceratops Rafinesque 1815, but also that this had been an undescribed nomen nudum, causing the name to have been still available in 1888. He nevertheless provisionally proposed a replacement name: Proceratops. This is thus a junior synonym of Ceratops. Already in the early twentieth century new finds made it increasingly difficult to distinguish the limited remains of Ceratops from several other related forms. Today, Ceratops is considered a nomen dubium.P. Dodson and P. J. Currie, 1990, \\"Neoceratopsia\\". In: D.B. Weishampel, H. Osmolska, and P. Dodson (eds.), The Dinosauria. First Edition. University of California Press, Berkeley pp 593-618 However, from time to time claims are made about discoveries that, also taking into regard their provenance, might have a provable connection with the Ceratops holotype. In 1995, David Trexler and F.G. Sweeney noted that complete material from a bonebed that had been found in Montana could enable Ceratops to be reexamined. The site, known as the Mansfield Bonebed, belongs to the same stratigraphic level as the one that yielded the original Ceratops remains. It had initially been interpreted as containing Styracosaurus, but what earlier authors considered the frill spikes of Styracosaurus turned out to be chasmosaurine orbital horns. Trexler and Sweeney pointed out that these horns closely resembled those of Ceratops, and could allow the genus to be rescued as a valid name.Trexler, D. and Sweeney, F.G. (1995). \\"Preliminary work on a recently discovered ceratopsian (Dinosauria: Ceratopsidae) bonebed from the Judith River Formation of Montana suggests the remains are of Ceratops montanus Marsh.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 15(3, Suppl.): 57A. The ceratopsids in the bonebed were later referred to the genus Albertaceratops, and later re-classified in their own genus, Medusaceratops.Ryan, Michael J.; Russell, Anthony P., and Hartman, Scott. (2010). \\"A New Chasmosaurine Ceratopsid from the Judith River Formation, Montana\\", In: Michael J. Ryan, Brenda J. Chinnery-Allgeier, and David A. Eberth (eds), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium, Indiana University Press, 656 pp. . In 1999, Paul Penkalski and Peter Dodson concluded that Ceratops, despite being is a nomen dubium because the material is too meager, appeared closely related to Avaceratops which may even be a juvenile Ceratops; there is not enough material to prove it. =Later species= In 1889 Marsh named a second species of Ceratops: Ceratops horridus. This would almost immediately in a subsequent article be renamed into Triceratops horridus. Ceratops horridus is thus the type species of Triceratops. In the same article Marsh renamed Bison alticornis, his misidentification of ceratopid material for a giant bovid, into Ceratops alticornis. In 1890 Marsh renamed Hadrosaurus paucidens into Ceratops paucidens; but the original assessment of Hatcher that this represented hadrosaurid material is probably correct. In 1905 Hatcher renamed three Monoclonius species into Ceratops species: Monoclonius recurvicornis Cope 1889 became Ceratops recurvicornis; Monoclonius belli Lambe 1902 was made Ceratops belli and Monoclonius canadensis Lambe 1902 was renamed Ceratops canadensis. C. canadensis later was made the separate genus Eoceratops, and C. belli was made the separate genus Chasmosaurus; in 1925 William King Gregory concluded that Ceratops and Chasmosaurus were identical, but this was rejected by most researchers. In 2005, remarkably well preserved cranial and postcranial elements of a Judithian ceratopsian were discovered in Fergus County, Montana. Nicknamed \\"Judith\\", preliminary examination suggested a close affinity with C. montanus. The locality has been determined to be on or in close proximity to the stratigraphic layer of C. montanus, and not too many miles away.\\"Judith the Dinosaur\\". Accessed 17-AUG-2013. In 2016, the new animal was named Spiclypeus, and the authors stated that it may be identical to Ceratops, which they considered a nomen dubium, or a growth stage of Albertaceratops. =Species list= The naming history can be summarised in a species list. *Ceratops montanus Marsh 1888: nomen dubium; type species of Ceratops Marsh 1888; = Proceratops montanus (Marsh 1888) Lull 1906 *Ceratops horridus Marsh 1889: = Triceratops horridus (Marsh 1889) Marsh 1889 *Ceratops alticornis (Marsh 1887) Marsh 1889: nomen dubium; = Bison alticornis Marsh 1887, = Triceratops alticornis (Marsh 1887) Lull vide Hatcher, Marsh & Lull 1907 *Ceratops paucidens (Marsh 1889) Marsh 1890: nomen dubium; = Hadrosaurus paucidens Marsh 1889; perhaps material of Lambeosaurus lambei *Ceratops belli (Lambe 1902) Hatcher vide Stanton & Hatcher 1905: = Monoclonius belli Lambe 1902; = Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe 1902) Lambe 1914 *Ceratops canadensis (Lambe 1902) Hatcher vide Stanton & Hatcher 1905: = Monoclonius canadensis Lambe 1902; = Eoceratops canadensis (Lambe 1902) Lambe 1915 *Ceratops recurvicornis (Cope 1889) Hatcher vide Stanton & Hatcher 1905: = Monoclonius recurvicornis Cope 1889 Classification Ceratops was placed by Marsh in the Ceratopsidae in 1888. It thus belonged to the Ceratopsia, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. In 1919 the group Ceratopsinae was named by Othenio Lothar Franz Anton Louis Abel,Abel, O.L.F.A.L., 1919, Die St√§mme der Wirbeltiere, Berlin und Leipzig : W. de Gruyter, 914 pp but this concept is problematic: Paul Sereno has defined it as equivalent to the Chasmosaurinae but other researchers limit it to Ceratops itself as its direct relationships are uncertain. Diet Ceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore biting off plant material with its beak and processing it with its tooth batteries.

Biological naturalism is a theory about, among other things, the relationship between consciousness and body (i.e. brain), and hence an approach to the mind‚Äìbody problem. It was first proposed by the philosopher John Searle in 1980 and is defined by two main theses: 1) all mental phenomena from pains, tickles, and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain; and 2) mental phenomena are higher-level features of the brain. This entails that the brain has the right causal powers to produce intentionality. However, Searle's biological naturalism does not entail that brains and only brains can cause consciousness. Searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states, our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness. In his own words: > \\"The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only > brains can be conscious. The brain is a biological machine, and we might > build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a > machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly > how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it > artificially.\\" (Biological Naturalism, 2004) Overview John Searle Searle denies Cartesian dualism, the idea that the mind is a separate kind of substance to the body, as this contradicts our entire understanding of physics, and unlike Descartes, he does not bring God into the problem. Indeed, Searle denies any kind of dualism, the traditional alternative to monism, claiming the distinction is a mistake. He rejects the idea that because the mind is not objectively viewable, it does not fall under the rubric of physics. Searle believes that consciousness \\"is a real part of the real world and it cannot be eliminated in favor of, or reduced to, something else\\" John R. Searle: Thinking about the Real World by Dirk Franken, Attila Karakus, and Jan G. Michel whether that something else is a neurological state of the brain or a computer program. He contends, for example, that the software known as Deep Blue knows nothing about chess. He also believes that consciousness is both a cause of events in the body and a response to events in the body. On the other hand, Searle doesn't treat consciousness as a ghost in the machine. He treats it, rather, as a state of the brain. The causal interaction of mind and brain can be described thus in naturalistic terms: Events at the micro-level (perhaps at that of individual neurons) cause consciousness. Changes at the macro-level (the whole brain) constitute consciousness. Micro-changes cause and then are impacted by holistic changes, in much the same way that individual football players cause a team (as a whole) to win games, causing the individuals to gain confidence from the knowledge that they are part of a winning team. He articulates this distinction by pointing out that the common philosophical term 'reducible' is ambiguous. Searle contends that consciousness is \\"causally reducible\\" to brain processes without being \\"ontologically reducible\\". He hopes that making this distinction will allow him to escape the traditional dilemma between reductive materialism and substance dualism; he affirms the essentially physical nature of the universe by asserting that consciousness is completely caused by and realized in the brain, but also doesn't deny what he takes to be the obvious facts that humans really are conscious, and that conscious states have an essentially first-person nature. It can be tempting to see the theory as a kind of property dualism, since, in Searle's view, a person's mental properties are categorically different from his or her micro-physical properties. The latter have \\"third-person ontology\\" whereas the former have \\"first-person ontology.\\" Micro-structure is accessible objectively by any number of people, as when several brain surgeons inspect a patient's cerebral hemispheres. But pain or desire or belief are accessible subjectively by the person who has the pain or desire or belief, and no one else has that mode of access. However, Searle holds mental properties to be a species of physical property‚Äîones with first-person ontology. So this sets his view apart from a dualism of physical and non-physical properties. His mental properties are putatively physical. Criticism There have been several criticisms of Searle's idea of biological naturalism. Jerry Fodor suggests that Searle gives us no account at all of exactly why he believes that a biochemistry like, or similar to, that of the human brain is indispensable for intentionality. Fodor thinks that it seems much more plausible to suppose that it is the way in which an organism (or any other system for that matter) is connected to its environment that is indispensable in the explanation of intentionality. It is easier to see \\"how the fact that my thought is causally connected to a tree might bear on its being a thought about a tree. But it's hard to imagine how the fact that (to put it crudely) my thought is made out of hydrocarbons could matter, except on the unlikely hypothesis that only hydrocarbons can be causally connected to trees in the way that brains are.\\" Fodor, Jerry. (1980) \\"Searle On What Only Brains Can Do\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences. vol. 3. pp. 217‚Äì219 John Haugeland takes on the central notion of some set of special \\"right causal powers\\" that Searle attributes to the biochemistry of the human brain. He asks us to imagine a concrete situation in which the \\"right\\" causal powers are those that our neurons have to reciprocally stimulate one another. In this case, silicon-based alien life forms can be intelligent just in case they have these \\"right\\" causal powers; i.e. they possess neurons with synaptics connections that have the power to reciprocally stimulate each other. Then we can take any speaker of the Chinese language and cover his neurons in some sort of wrapper which prevents them from being influenced by neurotransmitters and, hence, from having the right causal powers. At this point, \\"Searle's demon\\" (an English speaking nanobot, perhaps) sees what is happening and intervenes: he sees through the covering and determines which neurons would have been stimulated and which not and proceeds to stimulate the appropriate neurons and shut down the others himself. The experimental subject's behavior is unaffected. He continues to speak perfect Chinese as before the operation but now the causal powers of his neurotransmitters have been replaced by someone who does not understand the Chinese language. The point is generalizable: for any causal powers, it will always be possible to hypothetically replace them with some sort of Searlian demon which will carry out the operations mechanically. His conclusion is that Searle's is necessarily a dualistic view of the nature of causal powers, \\"not intrinsically connected with the actual powers of physical objects.\\" Haugeland, John. (1980) \\"Artificial Intelligence\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences. vol. 3. pp. 219‚Äì224. Searle himself actually does not rule out the possibility for alternate arrangements of matter bringing forth consciousness other than biological brains. He also disputes that Biological naturalism is dualistic in nature in a brief essay entitled \\"Why I Am Not a Property Dualist\\".

Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. Chaoyangsaurus belonged to the Ceratopsia (Greek for \\"horned faces\\"), Chaoyangsaurus, like all ceratopsians, was primarily a herbivore. Discovery Life restoration Chaoyangsaurus was found in the Chaoyang area of Liaoning Province in northeastern China. The specific name honours the Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young. =Spelling= Unlike many other dinosaurs, Chaoyangsaurus had been discussed in a number of sources before its official publication. As a result of this, several different spellings of its name have come and gone as nomina nuda (\\"naked names\\", names with no formal description behind them). The first name to see print was Chaoyoungosaurus, which appeared in the guidebook to a Japanese museum exhibit, and was the result of an incorrect transliteration. Zhao (1983) also used this spelling when he first discussed the species, so it is technically a nomen nudum. Two years later, Zhao again used this early spelling when he assigned a type specimen and species name, Chaoyoungosaurus liaosiensis (Zhao, 1985). According to Dong (1992), the name Chaoyoungosaurus had been officially described in a paper by Zhao and Cheng in 1983, but no cite for this supposed paper exists, and it is likely it was not properly published. Dong, in his 1992 paper on the subject, also emended the name to the \\"correct\\" spelling of Chaoyangosaurus (note the extra letter \\"o\\"). However, since this renaming was not accompanied by a formal description of the dinosaur, Chaoyangosaurus must also be considered a nomen nudum. It was not until 1999 that the dinosaur finally received an official name. Sereno (1999) used the name Chaoyangsaurus in an overview of ceratopsian taxonomy. Once again, that name was a nomen nudum. However, in December of that year, Cheng, Zhao, and Xu published an official description using the name Chaoyangsaurus youngi, and as the first name for this genus that is not a nomen nudum, it has official priority over all other spellings that have been used.

A sequel entitled The Gamers: Dorkness Rising was set to be released in 2006, but was delayed due to problems finding a distributor; it was eventually released on DVD in August 2008 at conventions and online. A second sequel The Gamers: Hands of Fate was funded via Kickstarter and its extended cut is as of GenCon 2013 revealed in segments via YouTube Plot The movie flips between following a group of gamers in a dorm immersed in a role-playing game, and their characters (played by the same actors) as they journey through a world of fantasy and wonder to defeat a being known as \\"The Shadow\\" and rescue a princess. The latter is theoretically a heroic quest, but while the game master attempts to foster in a narrative, the players tend to be more interested in their characters' tolerance for ale, trying to apply the sneak attack damage multiplier to siege weaponry, et cetera. The movie both makes fun of gamer stereotypes and plays the discrepancy between an optimal RPG plot and the events of an actual RPG session for maximum absurdity. Characters attempting something dangerous freeze as dice clatter in the distance. The party thief picks the pocket of a bystander, then steals that bystander's pants‚Äînot because he wants the pants in any way, but solely to see if his skill statistics allow it. One character, while present, does not interact with the others for most of the game, as his player is absent. When an unlucky dice roll causes the death of one character, the other players' characters mourn him for a moment, and then immediately start squabbling over the items he was carrying. Characters spring to action, then keel over as their players forget and are reminded that the characters are asleep, players argue and make snack runs, and their game is frequently interrupted by a girl from the same dorm who demands they keep quiet so that she can study. The Shadow is eventually defeated, after a long quest, and the characters find themselves in a strange tunnel. On the other side of the door, they hear voices‚Äîthe voices of their players, who are narrating the action in the hallway outside. Bursting into the room (as dictated by the players), the characters slaughter the gamers, then begin picking over the room for treasure. They discover that their entire adventure has been documented by the \\"strange sorcerers\\" they have just slain via their character sheets. In the midst of these revelations, the \\"Princess\\" (the girl who needs to study and is constantly interrupted by the gamers' noise) bursts in and reads them the riot act, thinking their outfits to be mere costumes; after she leaves, the adventurers seem quite stunned that their beloved Princess has such a foul mouth and temper. Sequels and spin-offs In 2013 Zombie Orpheus Entertainment in cooperation with Dead Gentlemen Productions and Lynnvander Inc produced two mini miniseries, Natural One and Humans & Households, set in the Gamers universe. Both series mirror the structure of \\"The Gamers\\" by showing both players of a roleplaying game and the fictitious characters they are playing. Natural One features the characters Leo and Gary (both are main characters in Dorkness Rising and Hands of Fate). The plot revolves around Monica, Gary's sister, who wants to marry her fianc√©, Ryan. However, since Ryan is not a geek and an old agreement between Gary and Monica states that both of them may only marry geeks, Ryan has to prove his geekiness by beating a roleplaying game scenario before Gary gives his blessing to the wedding. The fictitious roleplaying game featured in the film is an homage to the popular cyberpunk roleplaying game Shadowrun. Humans & Households (the title is a reference to Dungeons & Dragons) turns the concept of The Gamers on its head: Characters in the fantasy world of The Gamers play a roleplaying game set in our world. In April 2015, a web series continuation of the plot of The Gamers was announced. It will lead directly into the events of the next movie in the series and will chronicle exploits of the protagonists' characters who are now lost in the modern world. The project was be funded via Kickstarter, much like The Gamers: Hands of Fate. The first installment of the series dubbed The Shadow Menace was released in August 2017.

There are approximately 1,500 students currently enrolled at Lima Senior.  Overview  Lima Senior remained in the same building for 49 years until a new building was constructed over two and completed in 2004. Construction of the new buildings were contracted for $30,000,000 but went over budget by $20,000,000. The new Lima Senior High School building contained three small learning communities, including the Performance Based, the Progressive Academy, and the School of Multiple Intelligences. Each small school followed an instructional model of teaching core subjects of Ohio class requirements. As of the 2013-14 school year, Lima Senior High School has transitioned into a single institution, dissolving the three small schools. Spartan Stadium, home to the Lima Senior Spartans, is a registered historic building listed in the National Register on 2002-03-21. In 1987, Lima Senior High School began formally recognizing the accomplishments of its alumni who had received local, state or national recognition for achievements in their occupational fields, made significant contributions to society, or performed meritorious service for our country by inducting them into the Lima Senior High School Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1990 the Hall of fame was opened up to all students in the Lima City School District and the name was changed to the Lima City Schools Distinguished Hall of Fame. There are currently 87 alumni honored in the Hall of Fame. Every four years, ten to fifteen outstanding alumni are inducted into the Hall of Fame during an induction ceremony and banquet.

I-95 is concurrent with I-64 for in Richmond, and meets the northern terminus of I-85 in Petersburg. Although I-95 was originally planned as a highway through Washington, D.C. (following the route of what is now I-395), it was rerouted along the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. From Petersburg to Richmond, I-95 was most of the Richmond- Petersburg Turnpike (the south end of the toll road was on I-85.) It enters the Capital Beltway at the Springfield Interchange, also known as the Mixing Bowl. I-95 continues over the Woodrow Wilson Bridge into Washington, D.C. (for 0.11 miles on the bridge), and then into Maryland on the Beltway. The route between Fredericksburg and Springfield is consistently one of the most congested routes of highway in the United States, particularly during holidays and rush hours. The causes for this congestion are lack of alternative routes, fewer lanes than needed, and the spread-out suburbs of the Washington D.C. area. Route description I-95 entering Virginia from North Carolina in 2007 =North Carolina to Petersburg= Interstate 95 continues the pattern of being a four-lane highway from North Carolina. The welcome center forbids trucks, but truck stops at the first two interchanges provides a substitute place for truckers to stay before reaching Emporia. North of here, I-95 and US 301 are often intertwined with each other as they encounter interchanges with Virginia Secondary State Routes. In the Owens-Stony Creek area in Sussex County, the road not only runs parallel to US 301 but shares bridges with I-95, many of which have access to Route 301 from connecting roads. This pattern ends at Exit 33 at the corner of a fairly popular truck stop and travel center. Crossing the Sussex-Prince George County Line, the first site along I-95 is another rest area that also serves as the Petersburg Area Tourist Information Center. The road makes a slight northeast turn between Carson and Templeton, then turns straight north again before approaching the south end of Interstate 295 just before crossing the southern border of the City of Petersburg at Exit 47. A series of frontage roads connect the interchanges with US 460, US 301 and the northern terminus of Interstate 85. Immediately after the interchange with Interstate 85, remnants of the former toll booths for the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike can be found. =Petersburg to Richmond= View of I-95 southbound past SR 144 in Colonial Heights between Richmond and Petersburg North of Petersburg, I-95 crosses the Appomattox River and enters the City of Colonial Heights and then Chesterfield County. Pocahontas Parkway and an extraordinarily high Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge over I-95 and the James River just south of the Richmond City Limits. A CSX railroad line runs parallel to the northbound lane in the vicinity of the Port of Richmond, and the Commerce Road Industrial Area, a region that includes a Philip Morris office and an old bridge manufacturing plant. As I-95 itself crosses the James River, Main Street Station can be seen on the north bank, and the road winds around the station itself. The first interchange after it crosses the James River is the tolled State Route 195 and from there the road winds towards the multiplex with Interstate 64. I-64/95 curves to the northwest to cross under US 1/301, only to turn back north briefly, and curve northwest again, as it approaches VA 161. This pattern ends when I-64 turns west at the same interchange as the northern terminus of I-195. From here I-95 curves back to the northeast and has two interchanges with US 1, and later US 301 separately, the latter of which has separate carriageways on both side of I-95. Another interchange with Interstate 295 exists in Glen Allen. However, I-295 does not terminate there, and the south-to-eastbound and west-to- northbound off-ramps between the two can be accessed in the medians of both roads. =Central Virginia to Washington, D.C.= View north along I-95 north of US 17 in Stafford County Throughout much of central Virginia, I-95 climbs a series of hills, and contains wide tree-lined medians. Near mile marker 100 in Doswell, signs for the Kings Dominion amusement park are blended in with standard destination signs. US 17 overlaps I-95 from Massaponax at exit 126 to Falmouth at exit 133 as the highway passes west of Fredericksburg. The wide tree-line divider resumes north of here. At Exit 143 in Aquia, the northbound off and on ramps connect directly to US 1, even though the interchange is specifically for SR 610.Northbound I-95 image at Exits 143 A-B (AARoads.com)Aerial view of Exit 143 interchange on Interstate 95 (Google Maps) Crossing over the Chopawamsic Creek takes I-95 through the Quantico Marine Base, which includes restrictive interchanges.Sign requiring commercial vehicles to Quantico Marine Base to use Exit 148 (AARoads.com) Northbound, the bi-directional HOT lane begins in Stafford, and runs through the center of I-95 through most of the rest of its journey toward D.C. I-95 northbound at the SR 294 exit near Woodbridge Further north in Prince William County, there are four rest areas; two for trucks in Dumfries, and two for cars in Dale City. The truck rest areas, with weigh stations, are near exit 152. The car rest areas have uniquely positioned entrance and exit ramps. The southbound car rest area, near exit 156, is accessible only from the southbound collective-distributor road. In Lorton, a scissor interchange exists with US 1, and shortly after this Lorton Auto Train Station is located near exit 163. Due to public opposition of efforts to build I-95 through Washington D.C. and College Park, Maryland, I-95 is diverted onto a multiplex with Interstate 495 at the Springfield Interchange. I-95/495 continue east through Franconia, over the WMATA Blue Line and Rose Hill. At Huntington, I-95/495 run under the WMATA Yellow Line, and through Alexandria before crossing the Woodrow Wilson Bridge briefly into D.C., and then into Maryland.

The renumbering was never done because tolls were removed from the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike section of I-95. * State Route 895 is the Pocahontas Parkway, a connection from I-95 south of Richmond east to I-295. It was not numbered as an Interstate because the project opened as a toll road using federal funds, thus disqualifying it from Interstate status. HOV facilities I-95 with reversible HOT lanes in northern Virginia Interstate 95 extends the twin-lane barrier-separated HOV lanes that begin on I-395 at the 14th Street Bridge in Washington. These lanes have been extended south several times, most recently to just north of Stafford right before the Garrisonville Road exit. As part of the Quantico Creek bridge rebuilding project, a three-lane, bridge was constructed in the median just south of the old southern HOV terminus for use when the HOV facilities were extended. It was previously used as a detour bridge and retained its lane striping from such use. In December 2014, this bridge became part of the Southern HOV/HOT lane extension project that now runs to just north of Garrisonville Rd. (exit 143) in Stafford.The orphaned bridge over Quantico Creek is located at The new I-95 HOV/HOT lanes project created approximately of HOV/HOT lanes on I-95 from Garrisonville Rd. in Stafford County to the vicinity of Edsall Road on I-395 in Fairfax County. In July 2016, VDOT began construction of an additional extension of the HOV/HOT lanes on I-95 south of Garrisonville Rd. in Stafford County. This addition opened in November 2017.

The station is an exchange point for passengers on Dublin to Cork services to connect to via services.  Overview  The station opened on 1 September 1847 as Roscrea & Borris, was renamed Roscrea & Parsonstown Junction in 1858, and renamed again in 1871 as Ballybrophy. Lifts were fitted to the footbridge in late 2007. Therefore, disabled passengers who cannot use steps and are boarding or alighting from trains to Cork and Limerick via Limerick Junction are no longer required to cross the tracks at ground level, as was previously the case. This was only possible when trains were clear of the tracks.  The future  Ballybrophy's railway station is a connection point between the main Dublin-Cork main line and the Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy railway line. The branch line is lightly travelled, as the principal route between Dublin and Limerick is via Limerick Junction. This is faster and more comfortable due to higher line speeds. Since the introduction of a two-hourly Dublin-Limerick service in 2008, this journey does not usually require a change of train. Up until the mid-1980s the line to Limerick via Nenagh diverged from the mainline via a junction that faced Cork. This was replaced by a siding connection when the mainline was resignalled. For trains to enter the Nenagh branch from the Dublin bound mainline requires trains to set back into the bay platform before proceeding to Nenagh and Limerick. A train travelling from Dublin to Limerick via Nenagh would need to set back from the Down mainline onto the Up mainline before pulling forward into the bay platform. Prior to 1967, the only route from Dublin to Limerick that did not entail a reversal was via Athenry and the former Sligo to Limerick line of the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway. Some of those who favour retaining the line have theorised that replacing the south facing connection at Ballybrophy with a new line east to the more populated Borris- in-Ossory, and joining the line nearer Portlaoise would be better for Dublin connections. However, in addition to the substantial capital cost of this work, substantial parts of the line would still need to be re-laid nearer Limerick to eliminate severe speed restrictions. It also offers no advantages over the current through route from Dublin to Limerick via Thurles and the north curve at Limerick Junction. Recent upgrading of the N7 road to motorway also dissuades rail usage. =Closure of Ballybrophy-Roscrea-Nenagh-Limerick line proposed= A January 2012 national newspaper article suggested that Irish Rail was expected to seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line. On a trial basis an enhanced timetable was in force during 2012 however the service was again reduced from February 2013. In November 2016 it was announced the line was very likely to close in 2018 as the demand for the service is very low and CIE/IE wish to close it to save money.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp- content/uploads/2016/11/151116_2016_Rail_Review_Report_Complete_Online.pdf The old water tower from the days of steam, 2002  See also  * List of railway stations in Ireland  References  External links * Ballybrophy-Roscrea- Nenagh-Limerick line * Ballybrophy Station on Eire Trains Iarnr√≥d √âireann stations in County Laois Railway stations in County Laois Railway stations opened in 1847 1847 establishments in Ireland ","title":"Ballybrophy railway station"},{"id":"4290794","text":"Opel used the straight-6 engine configuration for many years.

Sam captained and coached the 1884‚Äì85 Harvard baseball team which accrued a record of 27‚Äì1, defeating Yale twice, and compiling a .306 team hitting average while winning the Intercollegiate Base Ball Association championship. Winslow both pitched and played outfield. During the summer of 1884, he pitched briefly for the Barnstable town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. Winslow's childhood friend and Harvard classmate Ernest Thayer often mentioned Sam when talking about his inspiration for \\"Casey at the Bat\\", which Thayer authored in 1888 as a contributor to the San Francisco Examiner. Winslow was appointed as a colonel on the staff of Governor John Q. A. Brackett in 1890. He was chairman of the Republican city committee of Worcester from 1890 to 1892, and became chairman of the Republican State committee in 1893. He was delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1908. He was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-third Congress, and to the five succeeding Congresses. Winslow's father Samuel, a manufacturer of skates, had served as mayor of Worcester from 1886‚Äì1889. Winslow was the chairman in the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce during the Sixty-seventh and Sixty-eighth Congresses. He was appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1926 as a member of the United States Board of Mediation, for the disposition of disputes between carriers and their employees. He was chosen chairman, and served until 1934.

It is the third novel featuring the mysterious Albert Campion, accompanied by his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg. Plot introduction Albert Campion rescues Val Gyrth from the streets of London, to help him save a family heirloom, the Gyrth Chalice, from a band of devious criminals. In Suffolk, he reunites the son with his family, but soon one of them is found dead, and preventing the theft of the chalice must be combined with solving the mysterious death. Plot summary Val Gyrth, heir to the Gyrth family and their traditional vocation of guarding the famous Gyrth Chalice, is homeless and wandering the streets. After a mysterious chain of events, he is plucked out of danger by Albert Campion, who explains that a conspiracy of art collectors and criminals hopes to steal the treasure his family is charged with protecting. Returning Gyrth to his family in the village of Sanctuary in Suffolk, Campion is shocked when Val's aunt Di, a bohemian who upset the family by being photographed with the chalice, is found lying dead in a spooky forest clearing, apparently frightened to death. With Val's 25th birthday, at which a great secret will be revealed to him, fast approaching, Campion and the Gyrths smuggle the chalice to London, evading ruthless crooks. There, they find it is a fake, a replacement made a few hundred years ago, while the genuine, thousand-year-old chalice remains out of sight. A crook informs them that someone named \\"Daisy\\" is behind the chalice thieves; Val is left in the safety of Campion's flat, protecting the decoy chalice. Back in Sanctuary, Lugg has been frightened by a monster in the woods, perhaps the same thing that scared Aunt Di to death. Accompanied by the Gyrths' neighbour Professor Cairey, a historian friend of Campion's, and a local woodsman, they trap the monster, revealed to be an aged witch of the village, protecting her slow- witted poacher son, descendants of a family of witches with the name Munsey. They further learn that she was encouraged to frighten Aunt Di by someone named Daisy, and the local woodsman tells Campion that a local stable owner, Mrs Shannon, whom Campion has met a few times already, is called Daisy. Awaking after his long night in the woods, Campion learns that his flat has been attacked, the chalice taken and Val Gyrth vanished in pursuit. He rushes off, leaving instructions that a pouch be delivered to Gypsies staying nearby. Later, the chalice arrives by post, and Penny and Beth find Val in a field, bedraggled and exhausted but alive, with a White Campion in his buttonhole. Campion strolls up to Mrs Shannon's stables, where he finds her playing cards with a band of well-known crooks, including a cat-burglar. Campion is locked in a room above the stables for a day, and visited by Mrs Shannon on the night of Val's birthday. Realising he knows too much, she pushes him through the floor into a stable with a wild, angry horse; he hides in a hay-feeder until rescued by Professor Cairey, who heard Daisy's name from the Munseys too. A gang of Gypsies, summoned by Campion's message, arrive and scatter Shannon's gang, but she escapes in a car. Campion follows on the wild horse, temporarily tamed by a gypsy. Arriving at the Gyrth's Tower, he finds Mrs Shannon lowering herself from the roof to see into the window of a secret room, only lit up on the heir's birthday and rumoured to contain a fearsome secret that protects the chalice. Looking in, she goes white with fear, and falls from her rope to her death. Campion reveals that he had found Val, knocked out by the crooks he pursued in London, and sent him home before heading to the stables. Next day a representative of royalty arrives to inspect the chalice, and Campion and the Professor are permitted to join the party; taken to the secret room, they see the chalice guarded by the skeleton of a giant, clad in armour, and the chalice, a beautiful bowl of red gold and rubies.

It is a tooth taxon, often considered dubious because of the fragmentary nature of the fossils, which include teeth but no other remains. The type species is Zapsalis abradens, from the Judith River Formation of Montana, dating to 75 million years ago, during the Campanian stage. Additional teeth attributed to Z. abradens have been found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, also dated to about 75 Ma ago. While Zapsalis-like teeth have been found in other formations dating to various time periods and assigned to this genus, they most likely belong to new genera and species. In 1876 Edward Drinker Cope named Zapsalis abradens based on a tooth found in Montana, presently specimen AMNH 3953. The generic name is derived from Greek za~, \\"thorough\\", and psalis, \\"pair of scissors\\". The specific name means \\"abrading\\" in Latin. In 1964 Richard Estes synonymised Zapsalis with Paronychodon,Estes, R., 1964 Fossil vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous Lance Formation, eastern Wyoming. University of California Publications in Geological Sciences 49. pp. 180 but in 2002 Julia Sankey e.a. concluded the teeth represented a separate \\"?Dromaeosaurus Morphotype A\\". In 2013 Derek Larson and Philip Currie recognised Zapsalis as a valid taxon from the Judith River and Dinosaur Park Formation. The teeth are typified by a combination of rounded denticles, straight rear edge and vertical grooves. Similar teeth from the older Milk River Formation were referred to a cf. Zapsalis. In 2019, Currie and Evans announced that the Zapsalis teeth from the Dinosaur Park Formation represented the second premaxillary tooth of Saurornitholestes langstoni, in a paper describing a complete skull of that species.

Route description Route 68 begins at Route 63 in Naugatuck. After crossing the Naugatuck River, it overpasses the Route 8 expressway, with access via Union Street (SR 723) and North Main Street (SR 710). Route 68 then leaves the Naugatuck River Valley and ascends to Prospect, where it intersects Route 69 in the center of town. It then descends once again into Cheshire, where it joins Route 70 for a 3.1 mile concurrency. In the center of Cheshire, the concurrency becomes a 0.15 mile triplex with Route 10. After the Route 70 concurrency ends, Route 68 becomes a 4 lane road as it enters Wallingford. The road narrows to 2 lanes as it passes through Yalesville where it intersects Route 150. After passing under the Wilbur Cross Parkway (Route 15) without an interchange, it meets US 5 at a grade separated interchange. Route 68 becomes a 4-lane undivided, partially access controlled road for the next 2.3 miles to its junction with I-91 at Exit 15. After overpassing I-91 and passing a couple of business parks, Route 68 becomes a 2 lane road once again. It then enters Durham, where it passes the southern end of Route 157 before ending at Route 17 in the center of town. History The road connecting Naugatuck and Cheshire was designated in 1922 as State Highway 325. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, former Highway 325 was renumbered to Route 68. The route was later extended east to Middlefield in 1966 along former SR 607 (Wallingford to Middlefield) and SR 730 (Cheshire to Wallingford) via an overlap with Route 70.

During his lifetime he was celebrated by the European ruling classes for his botanical garden and his introduction of plants and flowers from New Holland (Australia) to Europe's public gardens. Early life H√ºgel was born in Regensburg, Bavaria, on 25 April 1795. In 1813, after studying law at Heidelberg University, he became an officer in the Austrian Hussars and fought in the armies of the sixth and seventh coalitions against Napoleon. After Napoleon's abdication, H√ºgel visited Scandinavia and Russia, before being stationed with other Austrian troops in southern France and then Italy. In 1824, H√ºgel took up residence in Hietzing, a district of Vienna, where he established his botanical garden and set up a company to sell its flowers. He also became betrothed to a Hungarian Countess, Melanie Zichy-Ferraris, but in 1831 she broke off their engagement to marry the Austrian chancellor, Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich.  Grand Tour of Asia  =Kashmir and Punjab= In the wake of his misfortunes in love, H√ºgel undertook the grand tour of Asia that would establish his renown. From 1831 to 1836, he travelled to the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and Australasia, before returning to Europe by way of the Cape of Good Hope and Saint Helena. He seems to have been most intrigued by the Kashmir and Punjab regions of northern India, as he chose his experiences there to form the basis of the four-volume work published in the years following his return to Europe: Kaschmir und das Reich der Siek (literally \\"Cashmere and the Realm of the Sikhs\\"). The first and third volumes are an account of H√ºgel's journey across northern India, including his meetings with Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab, in Lahore and a number of other European adventurers; the second volume provides descriptions of Kashmir's history, geography, and resources; and the fourth volume is a gazetteer. After the final volume's publication, Major Thomas B. Jervis translated, abridged, and annotated an English edition of H√ºgel's work, published in London in 1845 by John Petheram.Charles von H√ºgel, translated, abridged and annotated by Thomas B. Jervis, Travels in Kashmir and the Panjab Translation of pts. 1 and 3 of the German original, Kaschmir und das Reich der Siek, containing a Particular Account of the Government and Character of the Sikhs, London: John Petheram, 1845. Reprinted 2003 by Oxford University Press (). Four years later, primarily on the basis of this publication, the Royal Geographical Society awarded H√ºgel its Patron's Medal, \\"for his enterprising exploration of Cashmere.\\" =Australia, November 1833 - October 1834= From November 1833 to October 1834, H√ºgel toured Australia, visiting the Swan River Colony and King George Sound (Western Australia), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), Norfolk Island and New South Wales to observe the flora and collect seeds for his garden. His large collection was later described by Endlicher et al. and his name is attached to a number of species, such as Alyogyne huegelii. During this time, H√ºgel wrote a journal, later translated by Dymphna Clark,Charles von H√ºgel, translated and edited by Dymphna Clark, New Holland Journal, November 1833 - October 1834, Melbourne: Miegunyah Press, 1994 (). which, in addition to his botanical observations, is a rare record of an aristocratic European's attitudes towards colonial Australia. Among those well-to-do settlers whom H√ºgel befriended in Sydney was the family of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes, who shared his interest in scientific and cultural matters. In general, however, H√ºgel's opinions of the administration, transportation, social life and missionary efforts that he encountered in Australia, and wrote about in his journal, were not favourable. Perhaps unexpectedly for a man of reactionary and establishment sympathies, H√ºgel took exception to the ill-treatment and exploitation of the indigenous Australians (Aborigines) whom he observed on his travels.  Return to Europe  After his return to Vienna, H√ºgel founded the Royal and Imperial Horticultural Society (K.K. Gartenbau-Gesellschaft), of which he was president between 1837 and 1848, and prepared his notes about northern India for publication. In 1847, he again became betrothed, this time to Elizabeth Farquharson, the daughter of a Scottish military officer, whom he had met in India during 1833. In 1849 he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Gold Medal for his exploration of Kashmir. Memorial. The H√ºgeldenkmal at Hietzing, Vienna, by Johann Benks, 1901. On the outbreak of the 1848 revolution, H√ºgel chaperoned his earlier rival in love Chancellor Metternich during his escape from Vienna to England. He then sold his garden, rejoined the Austrian army, and took part in the first Italian Independence war. From 1850 to 1859, he served as Austrian Envoy Extraordinary (ambassador) to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in Florence, finally marrying Elizabeth Farquharson there in 1851. In 1860 he became the Austrian ambassador in Brussels and published a second work based on notes from his Asian tour, this time about the Philippines: Der Stille Ocean und die spanischen Besitzungen im ostindischen Archipel (The Pacific Ocean and the Spanish possessions in the East Indian archipelago). He retired from the Imperial service in 1867 and took his family to live in the seaside town of Torquay, Devon, England. Three years later, on 2 June 1870, he died in Brussels while on his way to visit Vienna. H√ºgel‚Äôs published books were on Kashmir, Australia, and the Philippines, but there is evidence that his intention was to compile and publish material about the other areas he had visited. To date, however, there seems to be no trace of the many thousands of notes he made during his travels, from which further publications might yet be compiled.Charles von H√ºgel - Evidence of other journals at www.ciolek.com =Children= H√ºgel and his wife Elizabeth Farquharson had three children, of whom two became notable in their own right. Friedrich von H√ºgel, born 1852, became a well-known Roman Catholic theologian; Anatole von H√ºgel, born 1854, became an anthropologist; and their daughter Pauline von H√ºgel, born 1858, is regarded as the founder of Corpus Christi Church in Boscombe, now part of Bournemouth, in Dorset, England. According to Klemens von Metternich, Charles von H√ºgel had a natural son by Countess Jozefa Forg√°ch de Ghymes.

It is a tooth taxon, often considered dubious because of the fragmentary nature of the fossils, which include \\"buckets\\" of teeth from many disparate times and places but no other remains, and should be considered a form taxon. The type species, named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876,Cope, E.D., 1876, \\"Descriptions of some vertebrate remains from the Fort Union Beds of Montana\\", Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 28: 248-261 is Paronychodon lacustris, from the Judith River Formation of Montana, dating to 75 million years ago, during the Campanian stage. The holotype is specimen AMNH 3018. It is a tooth about one centimetre long, elongated, recurved, lacking serrations, possessing low vertical ridges and with a D-shaped cross- section, the inner side being flattened. Cope at first thought the tooth belonged to a plesiosaur, but the same year realised it represented a carnivorous dinosaur.Cope, E.D., 1876, \\"On some extinct Reptiles and Batrachia from the Judith River and Fox Hills Beds of Montana\\", Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 28: 340-359 A second species, Paronychodon caperatus, is known from the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota and Lance Formation of Wyoming (latest Maastrichtian stage, million years ago) and was originally referred to the mammal genus Tripriodon by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889,Marsh, O.C., 1889, \\"Discovery of Cretaceous mammalia\\", American Journal of Science, 3rd series 38: 81-92 but placed in Paronychodon by George Olshevsky in 1991.Olshevsky, G., 1991, A Revision of the Parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, Excluding the Advanced Crocodylia. Mesozoic Meanderings 2 pp 196 It is based on holotype YPM 10624, a tooth close in form to the holotype of P. lacustris but somewhat larger. In 1995 Olshevsky renamed Laelaps explanatus Cope 1876 into a Paronychodon explanatus;Olshevsky, G., Ford, T.L. & Yamamoto, S., 1995, \\"The origin and evolution of the tyrannosaurids\\", Kyoryugaku Saizensen 9: 92-119/10: 75-99 today the taxon is seen as based on Saurornitholestes teeth. Comparison of troodontid teeth; K is P. lacustris A very large number of other specimens matching these teeth in some or all aspects of their anatomy have been referred to Paronychodon. Some of these included serrated teeth, low teeth and teeth without a flattened side. These teeth of the general \\"Paronychodon\\" type have been reported from a wide variety of times and places, including the Early Cretaceous Una Formation of Spain, dating to the late Barremian age 125 million years ago. Paronychodon has been considered a coelurid, an ornithomimosaur, a dromaeosaurid, an archaeopterygid, and a troodontid, though it could also be another kind of coelurosaurian theropod. While most researchers have therefore considered it simply represents indeterminate theropod teeth, a small consensus has found them to be Deinonychosauria. The teeth assigned to Paronychodon are all small, and may have come from various juvenile deinonychosaurs. Jaws from adult individuals bearing identical teeth have never been found. Marsh already suggested such teeth were pathological, having formed when the first teeth of the lower jaws by accident grew back-to-back to each other on the mandible suture. Philip J. Currie in 1990 also concluded to a malformation, thinking the flattened side resulted from the tooth remaining attached too long to the inner wall of the tooth-socket. Serrated specimens of the type would thus simply be deviant dromaeosaurid teeth; however, unserrated teeth might represent a separate taxon or taxa.Currie, P.J., Rigby, Jr., J.K., and Sloan, R.E., 1990, \\"Theropod teeth from the Judith River Formation of southern Alberta, Canada\\", pp. 107‚Äì125 in: K. Carpenter and P. J. Currie (eds.), Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches. Cambridge University Press, New York One study, by Sunny Hwang, showed that the tooth enamel is identical to that found in Byronosaurus, a troodontid known from juveniles with serration-less teeth.Hwang, S.H. 2005. \\"Phylogenetic patterns of enamel microstructure in dinosaur teeth.\\" Journal of Morphology, 266: 208-240 Several taxa have on occasion been considered synonyms of Paronychodon, though there is little consensus. Paronychodon was in 1876 by Cope described as being similar to Zapsalis, another tooth taxon, itself often considered synonymous with Richardoestesia, a possible dromaeosaurid.

Because of incomplete knowledge of Jurassic Chinese sauropods, it has been hard to interpret, with some sources assigning it to Omeisaurus, some to Mamenchisaurus, and some to its own genus. History and taxonomy The genus was based on CV 00261, a specimen including a partial mandible, maxilla, and basioccipital (a bone from the braincase region). Additional bones from all areas of the skeleton, belonging to multiple individuals, were also described and assigned to the new genus. The authors thought it resembled Omeisaurus, but was distinct based on vertebral details. Early accounts in the popular press suggested it was a brachiosaurid. Chinese sauropod taxonomy became increasingly convoluted in the 1980s. In 1983, Dong, Zhou, and Zhang named a species Omeisaurus fuxiensis, which they based on different material than Zigongosaurus fuxiensis, but then suggested that the two were the same animal. Following this, the genus was thought to belong to Omeisaurus, possibly as a synonym of O. junghsiensis. In the mid-1990s, opinion shifted, and the genus was instead assigned, by Zhang and Chen, to Mamenchisaurus. They noted that it came from a stratigraphic level between the usual Omeisaurus and Mamenchisaurus beds in age, but more closely resembled Mamenchisaurus. In particular, the neural spines of the vertebrae (the part of the vertebra that sticks up, over the passage for the spinal cord) in both genera have distinctive weak bifurcation, or splitting, that is not found in Omeisaurus. The authors renamed it Mamenchisaurus fuxiensis. This assignment was followed provisionally in the most recent major review of sauropods, but at least one author (Val√©rie Martin-Rolland) has found it to be a distinct genus. Paleobiology Whichever genus it turns out to be, as a mamenchisaur- or omeisaur-like sauropod it would have been a large, quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck. It is regarded as a medium- to large-sized sauropod, with a length of around 15 meters (50 feet).

Infamously, the game released on the same day as the September 11 attacks. Overview Portal Runner is a spinoff in the Army Men video game series, focusing on a conflict between characters Vikki Grimm and Brigitte Bleu. Plot The story starts when General Plastro, the general of the Tan army, was captured by the Green Army and locked away (During the events of Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2). Brigitte Bleu observes this through a magic mirror and makes sinister plans to marry Sarge and get rid of Vikki Grimm, Colonel Grimm's daughter and Sarge's girlfriend. Brigitte decides that she is lonesome, and needs a king worthy of her magnificence, and says that Vikki is a treasure waiting to be buried. After Vikki saves Sarge from attacking gingerbread men, she is reprimanded by her father, Colonel Grimm for putting herself in danger. As she leaves, a Green Army soldier gives her a package from an unknown person. Inside was a dinosaur egg and a letter, saying \\"the story of your career awaits you. Follow the map and seek out the one called Rage. Tell no one, leave now‚Äù. Sarge walks up and tells her that her father‚Äôs rights about her being too adventurous for her own good. Vikki walks off in disgust, with Sarge commenting how that was a good start and how he‚Äôll be buying plastic flowers for a week. As she traverses the Lost Caves, she is ambushed by Rage (a WarBot, an evil toy robot; WarBots first appeared in Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2), Brigitte's WarBot friend who will do whatever she says, and is forced to the prehistoric jungle toy world. That was also when she meets a lion, who was also forced to the same world as Rage destroys the portal. Vikki decides to befriend with the lion, whom she calls Leo and they both help each other to get home. After enduring magic pillars, a pyramid, and magic air lifts, they come upon a volcano withanother portal. Once they step through, they end up in a medieval world. Vikki rescues a wizard named Merlin from a deadly chessboard. Merlin explains that he made a magic mirror that could see anywhere for Brigitte, thinking she would appreciate his mind. He directs Vikki to another portal, guarded by a ghosty barrier, an evil tree, and a moat dragon. When they reach the portal, they're captured by Rage and Tan Soldiers who appear to be minions of Brigitte. Brigitte had lured Sarge into the dollhouse where she lived and wanted to marry him. She and her henchmen found an space-alien themed toy set, which acted as a portal to an Outer Space World. Brigitte acquired a love gun from some Martians, who lived in the Space World in exchange for the secret of the portals; she used the gun on Sarge, and he instantly fell in love with her. Brigitte visited Vikki, who was being held in the dungeon, and told her that Sarge and she are going to get married. Brigitte leaves her mirror for Vikki to let her watch the wedding. As Vikki cries to herself, she's contacted by Merlin. He informs her that he left a few secrets in the mirror before handing it over. When Vikki asks about Sarge's situation, Merlin tells her only the kiss of his true love can apparently break the inducement. She asks if he‚Äôs kidding, which he isn‚Äôt. Meanwhile, in a toy store, Leo is being transported in a circus carriage, and is about to be burned in a microwave when he notices the bars are melting. He breaks out and travels to a portal that takes him back to the Medieval Castle. He and Vikki head to the Space World to stop the wedding. Once they acquire a stolen key from a Martian saucer, Vikki breaks into the room and kisses Sarge, breaking the trance on him. A voice tells all Martians to report for battle. Vikki tells Brigitte to call off the attack. She tries, but some monitors show they're now attacking all the other worlds. They split up; Sarge goes with Leo to stop most of the aliens while Vikki heads to the Alien Brain room, where the Brain, a cyborgic- style creature resembling a Martian head on a robotic spider body, refuses to call off the attack. After Vikki destroys the Brain, the attack stops. Sarge and Leo meet up with her, as Merlin congratulates Vikki for stopping the attack, and they head back to the Plastic World. At the Lost Caves, three lion cubs run up to Leo. Showing that he wasn't guarding the Portals, but protecting his family, he stays. Back at the Green Army Base, Vikki apologizes to Colonel Grimm and says that her home is wherever he is, with her father thanking her. The game ends with Brigitte sharing a cell with General Plastro, who tells her that before she gets any funny ideas, the top bunk is his and he blows a raspberry. Brigitte yells out ‚ÄúNoooooo!‚Äù Reception and controversy The PlayStation 2 version received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The Game Boy Color version gave an earliest review from Nintendo Power, which gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five, just nearly five months before the game was released. The PS2 version gained notoriety when it was panned by GamePro, with a rating of 2.3 out of 5. GamePro was the first to review the game, saying that it \\"looks like a late- generation PlayStation title rather than a second-generation PS2 effort.\\" Trip Hawkins, then-president of 3DO and publisher of Portal Runner, sent an angry email to John Rousseau, who was president of GamePro. The email was published on the internet in its entirety. In the email, Hawkins told Rousseau that Rousseau's customers were the advertisers, not the readers, and implied that the reviews should be written to keep the advertisers happy. Wrote Hawkins, \\"...there is something wrong with (the reviewer), not with Portal Runner. If you disagree with me, you do so at your own peril.... I should mention in passing that 3DO has been one of your largest advertisers. Effective immediately, we are going to have to cut that back.\\"Dubious Quality: The Shame of Trip Hawkins References External links 2001 video games Cancelled Game Boy Advance games Game Boy Color games Multiplayer and single-player video games Platform games PlayStation 2 games Video games developed in the United States Video games featuring female protagonists ","title":"Portal Runner"},{"id":"4290901","text":"Robert Sarsfield Maloney (February 3, 1881 ‚Äì November 8, 1934) was a United States Representative from Massachusetts.

It measured 20.2 metres (66 ft) long, and weighed 9.8 tonnes. Discovery O. tianfuensis Omeisaurus was first described in 1939. It was named after the sacred mountain Omeishan, which is where the first fossil example of Omeisaurus was found.

Mounted skeletons of Omeisaurus are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong, Sichuan Province and at Beipei Museum, near Chongqing, both in China. Classification Size comparison of O. tianfuensis It was once classified as a member of the family Cetiosauridae, which had long been a wastebasket taxon. The species O. fuxiensis is sometimes confused with Zigongosaurus, but the two are based on different material despite having the same species name. Omeisaurus was formerly assigned to Euhelopodidae. However, it and other Jurassic sauropods from Asia formerly assigned to Euhelopodidae are now placed in the separate family Mamenchisauridae. The cladogram below shows a possible phylogenetic position:J.A. Wilson, 2002, \\"Sauropod dinosaur phylogeny: critique and cladistic analysis\\", Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 136: 217-276  Paleoecology  Omeisaurus lived in dense forests. Different species of Omeisaurus sometimes shared habitats with each other (O. junghsiensis and O. tianfuensis, for example). In addition to other species of Omeisaurus, Shunosaurus and Datousaurus are also known from the Xiashaximiao Formation, while Mamenchisaurus is present in the Shangshaximiao Formation. Yangchuanosaurus is a large theropod from the Shangshaximiao, and it probably preyed on sauropods. The smaller Xuanhanosaurus was also present. In the Xiashaximiao, another theropod, Gasosaurus, was also present, as was the herbivorous stegosaur Huayangosaurus. The latter probably did not compete with sauropods for food.

It is based on a partial skull and postcranial fragments discovered in the Aptian-Albian-age Lower Cretaceous Cloverly Formation of Carbon County, Montana, USA. New remains are under description, and tracks from Maryland and Virginia, also in the US, have been attributed to animals similar to Zephyrosarus. Description Restoration of Zephyrosaurus being attacked by a Deinonychus Zephyrosaurus is still very incompletely known. Among other distinctive characteristics, it had a steep face, a raised knob on the upper jaw, and a larger knob on the cheekbone. Some of the bones may have allowed movement within the skull (cranial kinesis) as well. Like other orodromins, it had beak teeth. Classification Several studies have suggested that Zephyrosaurus and Orodromeus are closely related, mostly by virtue of both having bosses on their cheeks. Other studies have had difficulty classifying it, due to the sparseness of the original material. Oryctodromeus also shares several characteristics with Zephyrosaurus and Orodromeus, some of which may be related to burrowing. Phylogenetic analysis in the 2010s has classified Zephyrosaurus as part of the Thescelosauridae family. Discovery and history Hans-Dieter Sues named his new genus in recognition of the fossil being found in western North America, and Charles R. Schaff, who found the specimen. MCZ 4392, the type specimen, is composed of jaw fragments, the braincase and associated bones, several partial vertebrae, and rib fragments. He found the new genus to represent a previously unknown lineage of hypsilophodont (a taxon now considered not natural), similar in some respects to Hypsilophodon. Because of the fragmentary nature of the type, and lack of additional remains, Zephyrosaurus had not attracted much attention until recently, when two separate events brought it more recognition. First, Martha Kutter, in a 2003 abstract, reported on new remains of this genus under study at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, including the remains of at least seven individuals with bones from all regions of the body. Then, Stanford et al. (2004) published on dinosaur tracks from the Patuxent Formation of Maryland and Virginia, which they named Hypsiloichnus marylandicus and attributed to an animal akin to Zephyrosaurus based on the proportions of the hands and feet. Paleobiology Zephyrosaurus would have been a small, swift, bipedal herbivore. Like Orodromeus and Oryctodromeus, it may have burrowed as well.

The generic name is derived from the town of Walgett and Soukhos, the Greek name of the Egyptian crocodile god Sobek.

Dinosaurs of Australia and New Zealand and Other Animals of the Mesozoic Era, Harvard University Press, p. 104 The specific name means \\"resembling Ornitholestes\\". Remains of a megaraptorid, referred to by the public media as \\"Lightning Claw,\\" discovered in opal fields southwest of Lightning Ridge, Australia, may well represent more material of Rapator.Bell, P.

Gondwana Research. Description The bone has a length of seven centimetres. This manual element shows a prominent dorsomedial process, a feature shared with the much smaller Ornitholestes which occasioned the specific name. The process with Ornitholestes is much less distinctive though. On its upper end there is only one cotyle, from which von Huene deduced it must have been a metacarpal. However, several coelurosaurian groups lack a second cotyle on the first phalanx also. If Rapator had a build like Australovenator, it would have attained a considerable size: a body length of nine metres (30 ft) has been estimated. Classification life restoration as a megaraptoran The type specimen of Rapator was originally described as a metacarpal I, a bone from the upper part of a theropod's hand. It was later noted that the bone is similar to a finger bone, the first phalanx of the first finger, of an alvarezsaurHoltz, Molnar, and Currie (2004). \\"Basal Tetanurae.\\" In Weishampel, Dodson and Osmolska (eds.), The Dinosauria Second Edition.

With the discovery of Australovenator, which had a similar metacarpal, Rapator was recognized as a probable megaraptoran. In fact, Australovenator and Rapator differ only in some small details of the bone and may be synonyms, though Agnolin and colleagues in 2010 considered Rapator a dubious genus (nomen dubium) due to its fragmentary nature.Agnolin, Ezcurra, Pais and Salisbury, (2010). \\"A reappraisal of the Cretaceous non-avian dinosaur faunas from Australia and New Zealand: Evidence for their Gondwanan affinities.\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 8(2): 257-300. However, White et al. found differences between the hand bone of Rapator and the equivalent bone of Australovenator, supporting the distinction between the two. They also noted that the two genera come from formations separated chronologically by about 10 million years, making them unlikely to be synonymous. Rapator has been synonymised with Walgettosuchus, a theropod found in the same formation.Steel, R. (1970) Handbuch der Pal√§oherpetologie/Encyclopedia of Paleoherpetology. Part 14. Saurischia.

That none were recorded before 1876 is a mystery, in some ways akin to the long observational gap of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries; the 1876 Great White Spot (GWS) was extremely prominent, being visible in apertures as small as 60 mm. It is not known if the earlier record was simply poor, or if the 1876 GWS was truly a first for the telescopic era. Some believe that neither scenario is likely.Kidger (1992) p. 179 In 1992, Mark Kidger described three significant GWS patterns: #The GWSs alternate in latitude, with one apparition being limited to the North Temperate Zone (NTZ) or higher, and the following being limited to the Equatorial Zone (EZ). For instance, the 1960 GWS was high- latitude, and the 1990 GWS was equatorial. #The high-latitude GWSs recur at a slightly shorter interval than the equatorial GWSs (~27 versus ~30 years). #The high-latitude GWSs tend to be much less prominent than their equatorial counterparts. Based on these apparent regularities, in 1992 Kidger forecasted (incorrectly, given the 2010-11 storm) that the next GWS would occur in the North Temperate Zone in 2016, and would probably be less spectacular than the 1990 GWS.Kidger (1992) p. 180 Characteristics and causes The Great White Spot typically begins as discrete \\"spots\\", but then rapidly expands in longitude, as the 1933 and 1990 GWSs did; in fact, the latter eventually lengthened enough to encircle the planet.Kidger (1992) p. 187-189 Though computer modeling had by the early 1990s suggested these massive atmospheric upwellings were caused by thermal instability,Kidger (1992) p. 211-212 in 2015 two Caltech planetary scientists proposed a more detailed mechanism.Explaining Saturn‚Äôs Great White Spots  Caltech The theory is that as Saturn's upper atmosphere undergoes seasonal cooling, it first gets less dense as the heavier water rains out, passes a density minimum, and then gets more dense as the remaining hydrogen and helium continue to cool. Low-density upper-layer gases tend to suppress convection, but high-density upper layers are unstable and cause a thunderstorm when they break into lower layers. The theory is that the storms are significantly delayed from the winter solstice due to the time it takes for the very large atmosphere to cool. The team proposes that similar storms are not seen on Jupiter because that planet has less water vapor in its upper atmosphere. Saturn's rings block the view of the northern hemisphere from Earth during the winter solstice, so historical data on the GWS is unavailable during this season,Kidger (1992) p. 213-214 but the Cassini space probe has been able to observe the whole planet since it arrived shortly after the winter solstice in 2004.Cassini Solstice Mission: Introduction archive See also * Great Dark Spot * Great Red Spot * Dragon Storm * Extraterrestrial cyclone Notes References * Article on Saturn's Northern Electrostatic Disturbance on Sky and Telescope * 1990/1 Hubble Space Telescope image * 2006: observed with a 12\\" telescope by amateurs near Paris. * Volunteers Help NASA Track Return of the Dragon External links *The Great White Spot at ESA/Hubble *Christopher Go's Saturn Website Pictures of Saturn's Northern Electrostatic Disturbance (2011) Saturn Planetary spots Storms 1876 in science *[GWS]: Great White Spot ","title":"Great White Spot"},{"id":"4291023","text":"Gaston Berger (; 1 October 1896 ‚Äì 13 November 1960) was a French futurist but also an industrialist, a philosopher and a state manager. He is mainly known for his remarkably lucid analysis of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology and for his studies on the character structure. Berger was born in Saint-Louis, Senegal, French West Africa (now Senegal). He received his primary and part of his secondary education in Perpignan, France, and had to take up a position in an industrial firm. After having performed his military duties in World War I, he became an associate of the owner of the firm. Berger decided to continue his studies. He worked with Rene Le Senne and passed his baccalaureat. He then enrolled in the University of Aix-en-Provence, where he studied philosophy under Maurice Blondel. Having passed his licence, he obtained a diploma d‚ÄôEtudes Superieures with a thesis on the ‚ÄòRelations between the conditions of intelligibility on the one hand and the problem of contingency on the other hand‚Äô. In 1926 Berger founded with some friends the Societe de Philosophie du Sud-est and its periodical '. In 1938 he organized the first Congress of French Language Societies of Philosophy. In 1941 he submitted his two theses de doctorat d‚ÄôEtat, the first entitled ‚ÄòInvestigations on the conditions of Knowledge. Essay of Pure Knowledge‚Äô, the second ‚ÄòThe ‚ÄòCogito‚Äô in Husserl‚Äôs philosophy‚Äô. Berger then left his industrial firm and became first a 'Charg√© de Cours', then a 'Maitre de Conferences' for philosophy at the University of Aix-en Provence. In 1944 he became full professor. In 1949 he became secretary general of the Fulbright Commission, in charge of the cultural relations between France and the United States. After managing a fertilizer plant during the 1930s, he created in Paris the Centre Universitaire International et des Centres de Prospective and directed the philosophical studies (√âtudes philosophiques). The term prospective, invented by Gaston Berger, is the study of the possible futures. From 1953 to 1960 he was in charge of the tertiary education at the Minister of National Education and modernised the French universities system. He was elected at the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1955. In 1957 he founded the journal Prospective and the homonym centre with Andr√© Gros. This same year he created the Institut national des sciences appliqu√©es (INSA) of Lyon with the rector Capelle. He was the father of the French choreographer Maurice B√©jart (1927‚Äì2007), a stage name for Maurice-Jean Berger. The university of Saint-Louis, Senegal, where he was born is named after him.

The wave fields traditionally described are X-rays, neutrons or electrons and the regular lattice, atomic crystal structures or nanometer scaled multi-layers or self arranged systems. In a wider sense, similar treatment is related to the interaction of light with optical band-gap materials or related wave problems in acoustics. Laue and Bragg geometries, top and bottom, as distinguished by the Dynamical theory of diffraction with the Bragg diffracted beam leaving the back or front surface of the crystal, respectively. (Ref.) Reflectivities for Laue and Bragg geometries, top and bottom, respectively, as evaluated by the dynamical theory of diffraction for the absorption-less case. The flat top of the peak in Bragg geometry is the so-called Darwin Plateau. (Ref.) Principle of theory The dynamical theory of diffraction considers the wave field in the periodic potential of the crystal and takes into account all multiple scattering effects. Unlike the kinematic theory of diffraction which describes the approximate position of Bragg or Laue diffraction peaks in reciprocal space, dynamical theory corrects for refraction, shape and width of the peaks, extinction and interference effects. Graphical representations are described in dispersion surfaces around reciprocal lattice points which fulfill the boundary conditions at the crystal interface. Outcomes * The crystal potential by itself leads to refraction and specular reflection of the waves at the interface to the crystal and delivers the refractive index off the Bragg reflection. It also corrects for refraction at the Bragg condition and combined Bragg and specular reflection in grazing incidence geometries. * A Bragg reflection is the splitting of the dispersion surface at the border of the Brillouin zone in reciprocal space. There is a gap between the dispersion surfaces in which no travelling waves are allowed. For a non-absorbing crystal, the reflection curve shows a range of total reflection, the so-called Darwin plateau. Regarding the quantum mechanical energy of the system, this leads to the band gap structure which is commonly well known for electrons. * Upon Laue diffraction, intensity is shuffled from the forward diffracted beam into the Bragg diffracted beam until extinction. The diffracted beam itself fulfills the Bragg condition and shuffles intensity back into the primary direction. This round-trip period is called the Pendell√∂sung period. * The extinction length is related to the Pendell√∂sung period. Even if a crystal is infinitely thick, only the crystal volume within the extinction length contributes considerably to the diffraction in Bragg geometry. * In Laue geometry, beam paths lie within the Borrmann triangle. Kato fringes are the intensity patterns due to Pendell√∂sung effects at the exit surface of the crystal. * Anomalous absorption effects take place due to a standing wave patterns of two wave fields. Absorption is stronger if the standing wave has its anti-nodes on the lattice planes, i.e. where the absorbing atoms are, and weaker, if the anti-nodes are shifted between the planes. The standing wave shifts from one condition to the other on each side of the Darwin plateau which gives the latter an asymmetric shape.

He'd have a scarf and he'd have one of his girlfriend's shirts on, and I used to say, 'This guy is tryin' to look like a cross between Dottie West and Mick Jagger'...Towards his last days in the Burritos, he would be going to our gigs in a limousine ‚Äì I mean, these were $500 a night shows ‚Äì and we'd be piling into a separate car with our gear and Gram would show up in a limousine. Gram came from a very wealthy family and had this ongoing trust fund, which was about $55,000 a year, and it's sort of like he had been seduced by all that without quite earning it yet.\\" Parsons later blamed the album's shortcomings on producer Jim Dickson; in the 2007 book, ‚Äò‚ÄôTwenty Thousand Roads‚Äô‚Äô biographer David Meyer quotes Parsons: \\"The second album was a mistake ‚Äì it was a mistake to get Jim Dickson involved. We should have been more careful than that.\\" Parsons is also quoted expressing his dissatisfaction with steel guitarist \\"Sneaky\\" Pete Kleinow: \\"Chris (Hillman) knew all along that Sneaky wasn't the right steel player. Chris digs Sneaky more than I do 'cause he likes that dut dut dut dut that Sneaky could pull off. I wanted a Tom Brumley. Then I'd settle for anybody that played slide guitar with pedals on it. I wanted a brilliant-sounding, good, fast, pedal steel player.\\" Unlike the intriguing album cover that graced The Gilded Palace of Sin, the artwork for Burrito Deluxe is almost a throwaway by comparison, featuring a pair of stale burritos, the upper one edged in hand-sewn sequins, with a small photograph of the band wearing white coveralls superimposed over one of the burritos. Reception Burrito Deluxe was a commercial disappointment, failing to crack the Billboard 200. It was also a critical disappointment, unlike the band's lauded debut LP, with Mark Deming of AllMusic opining, \\"... while it is hardly a bad album, it's not nearly as striking as The Gilded Palace of Sin. Parsons didn't deliver many noteworthy originals for this set, with 'Cody, Cody' and 'Older Guys' faring best but paling next to the highlights from the previous album.\\" In the Parsons article ,\\"The Lost Boy,\\" Mojo writer John Harris observes that the album \\"mislaid just about all of the charm that had accompanied their debut, though it contained a handful of decent songs: 'Older Guys,' 'Cody Cody,' and 'High Fashion Queen.'\\" In the liner notes to the 1997 reissue that paired it with the Burritos's debut, Sid Griffin writes of Burrito Deluxe, \\"Out went the R&B; torch ballads, in came rock and roll...Burrito Deluxe is nonetheless required listening in Introducing To Country-Rock 101 at university.\\" Track listing =Side one= =Side two= Personnel =Musicians= * Gram Parsons ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards * Chris Hillman ‚Äì vocals, bass, mandolin * Sneaky Pete Kleinow ‚Äì pedal steel guitar * Bernie Leadon ‚Äì vocals, guitar, Dobro * Michael Clarke ‚Äì drums =Additional personnel= * Leon Russell ‚Äì piano * Byron Berline ‚Äì fiddle * Tommy Johnson ‚Äì tuba * Buddy Childers ‚Äì cornet, flugelhorn * Leopoldo C.

It lived during the Middle Jurassic, approximately 160 million years ago. Fossils of Volkheimeria have been found in the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Basin in Patagonia, Argentina. The type (and only known) species, V. chubutensis, was described by Jos√© Bonaparte in 1979. Volkheimeria is known from some incomplete postcrania, including a mostly complete pelvis and sacrum, caudal vertebrae and a femur and tibia. Many features of this scant material can distinguish Volkheimeria especially in the pelvic and vertebral regions, such as the very low flat neural spines.  Discovery and naming  Volkheimeria was first described in 1979 by Jose Bonaparte. In the paper, Bonaparte also named its type species, V. chubutensis. It was also shown to be a relative of Lapparentosaurus by Bonaparte due to similarities in the neural laminae. Originally identified as a possible cetiosaur along with Patagosaurus and then identified as a brachiosaur for a time, Volkheimeria is now considered a eusauropod along with Patagosaurus and Lapparentosaurus, with Volkheimeria and Lapparentosaurus relatively primitive eusauropods compared to the more derived Patagosaurus. The only known specimen of Volkheimeria is from the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits that also preserved Patagosaurus and Piatnitzkysaurus, both named in the same publication as Volkheimeria.

A painting of Noah's Ark, said to be constructed from gopher wood Gopher wood or gopherwood is a term used once in the Bible for the substance from which Noah's ark was built. Genesis 6:14 states that Noah was to build the Ark of gofer (Hebrew ), more commonly transliterated as gopher wood, a word not otherwise known in the Bible or in Hebrew. Although some English Bibles attempt a translation, older English translations, including the King James Version (17th century), leave it untranslated. The word is unrelated to the name of the North American animal, the gopher.  Identity  The Greek Septuagint (3rd-1st centuries BC) translated the phrase mentioning gopher wood as (), \\"out of squared timber\\". Similarly, the Latin Vulgate (5th century AD) rendered it as de lignis levigatis (l√¶vigatis, in the spelling of the Clementine Vulgate), \\"out of smoothed (possibly planed) wood\\". The Jewish Encyclopedia believes it was most likely a translation of the Babylonian gushure i·π£ erini, cedar beams, or the Assyrian giparu, reeds. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos, considered by many Jews to be an authoritative translation of the Hebrew scripture renders this word as qadros, cedar. The Syriac Peshitta translates this word as arqa, box. Many modern English translations tend to favor cypress (although otherwise the word for \\"cypress\\" in Biblical Hebrew is berosh). This was espoused (among others) by Adam Clarke, a Methodist theologian famous for his commentary on the Bible: Clarke cited the resemblance between Greek word for cypress, kuparisson and the Hebrew word gophar. Likewise the Nova Vulgata has it as de lignis cupressinis (\\"out of cypress wood\\"), in contrast to the \\"ligna levigata (smoothed or planed wood) of the Clementine Vulgate. Other suggestions include pine, cedar, fir, teak, sandalwood, ebony, wicker, juniper, acacia, boxwood, slimed bulrushes, and resinous wood. Others, noting the physical similarity between the Hebrew letters g (gimel ) and k (kaf ), suggest that the word may actually be kopher, the Hebrew word meaning \\"pitch\\"; thus kopher wood would be \\"pitched wood\\". Recent suggestions have included a lamination process (to strengthen the Ark), or a now-lost type of tree, but there is no consensus.

It is the last major town in Franche-Comt√© before the Sa√¥ne flows into Burgundy. History It was, since the Middle Ages, an important river port, an important trading center in Franche-Comt√©. Gray is believed to have acquired its name from an old landed estate in its vicinity owned by a family with Gallo-Roman origins bearing the name \\"Gradus\\", cognate with the Celtic \\"Grady\\" meaning \\"illustrious\\" or \\"noble\\". Sights The town includes many old buildings. An 18th century stone bridge spans the Sa√¥ne river, connecting the main town with the settlement of Arc les Gray. Gray is a popular place for fishing and various water activities. Gray's Basilica (Basilique Notre Dame) was built from 1478 to 1559, with a bell tower typical of Franche-Comt√©. An art museum, the Mus√©e Ch√¢teau Baron Martin, is housed in the Ch√¢teau of the Count of Provence, brother of Louis XVI, which in the 18th century replaced the fortress belonging to the Dukes of Burgundy. The 12th century \\"Paravis Tower\\" is the last remnant of the fortress and offers a panoramic view of the Sa√¥ne Valley. The museum displays some 1200 pieces of art from the 15th to the 20th century throughout 24 rooms. The Carmelite chapel (Chapelle des Carmelites) was built in 1667. Since 1978, it has held eight centuries of sacred art in Haute-Sa√¥ne, including paintings, sculptures, and religious objects. Gray is the site of France's National Esperanto Museum.

Its fossils were found in England. It is known only from bones of the feet. The holotype, BMNH R2559 (incorrectly given by Owen as BMNH R2556), was found near Cuckfield in layers of the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation dating from the late Valanginian. The specimen is damaged lacking parts of the upper and lower ends. It has a conserved length of and an estimated length of . This genus is paleontologically significant for being the first ornithomimosaur specimen known from England and represents the earliest record of ornithomimosaurs. Discovery In 1858 Richard Owen referred a fossil consisting of a set of three metatarsals, foot bones, part of the collection of the British Museum of Natural History, to the herbivorous dinosaur genus Hylaeosaurus because of its size and bone texture.Owen, R., 1858, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck Formations. Part IV. Dinosauria (Hylaeosaurus). [Wealden]. The Palaeontological Society, London 1856-1864: 8-26 Owen had a lithograph made of the bones that gave a mirrored image: although they were in fact from the left foot, it now seemed they were from the right foot. By 1881 John Whitaker Hulke had recognised that the specimen represented a foot from a carnivorous theropod. In 1888 Richard Lydekker referred the specimen to the theropod species Megalosaurus dunkeriLydekker, R., 1888, \\"On the remains and affinities of five genera of Mesozoic reptiles\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 45: 41-59 but in 1889 he named a separate species for it because of the more robust build: Megalosaurus oweni. The specific name honours Owen.Lydekker, R., 1889, \\"Note on some points in the nomenclature of fossil reptiles and amphibians, with preliminary notices of two new species\\" Geological Magazine, decade 3 6: 325-326 Lydekker was deceived by the 1858 illustration into thinking that it was the right foot. He also incorrectly assumed it had four metatarsals, a mistake repeated for over a century. Lydekker referred several other foot specimens to the species: BMNH 2574, 2661 and 2680 from the same stratigraphic horizon, and also BMNH R604d and BMNH R1525, uncovered from the earlier Wadhurst Clay Formation in the Hollington Quarry near Hastings. Classification Though originally classified as a species of Megalosaurus, in 1923 Friedrich von Huene assigned the species to Altispinax, making the combination Altipsinax oweni.F. v. Huene, 1923, \\"Carnivorous Saurischia in Europe since the Triassic\\", Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 34: 449-458 In 1991 George Olshevsky placed the species in a new genus, Valdoraptor, renaming its type species Megalosaurus oweni into Valdoraptor oweni. The generic name is derived from Latin Valdus, \\"Wealden\\", referring to the Wealden Group, and raptor, \\"plunderer\\".G. Olshevsky, 1991, A revision of the parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, excluding the advanced Crocodylia. Mesozoic Meanderings 2 pp. 1-196 The species has since been suggested to be identical to either Neovenator or Eotyrannus; it has also been held to be a nomen dubium.T.R. Holtz, R.E. Molnar, and P.J. Currie, 2004, \\"Basal Tetanurae\\". In: D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H. Osmolska (eds.), The Dinosauria (second edition). University of California Press, Berkeley pp. 71-110 However, Darren Naish in 2007 concluded that the specimen showed two unique derived traits or autapomorphies, in that the second metatarsal is both mediolaterally compressed and features a prominent dorsolateral ridge. These traits imply it is a valid taxon and different from Neovenator and Eotyrannus.D. Naish and D.M. Martill, 2007, \\"Dinosaurs of Great Britain and the role of the Geological Society of London in their discovery: basal Dinosauria and Saurischia\\", Journal of the Geological Society of London 164: 493-510 Olshevsky assigned Valdoraptor to the Allosauridae but Naish in 2007 stated that no more precise determination was possible than the more general Tetanurae. A 2014 re-evaluation found that Valdoraptor was likely one of the oldest known ornithomimosaurs, and a possible junior synonym of Thecocoelurus.R. Allain, R. Vullo, J. Le loeuff & J.-F.

It is the fourth novel with the mysterious Albert Campion, aided as usual by his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg and his policeman friend Stanislaus Oates. Plot introduction When Albert Campion is called in by the fiancee of an old college friend to investigate the disappearance of her uncle, he little expects the mysterious spate of death and dangers that follows among the bizarre inhabitants of Socrates Close, Cambridge. He and Stanislaus Oates must tread carefully, and battle some complex family dynamics, to solve the case. Plot summary Stanislaus Oates is being followed by a stranger, and runs into his friend Campion in the bizarrest of places. Campion is waiting for a client, Joyce Blount, the fiancee of his solicitor friend Marcus Featherstone, and when she arrives she clearly recognises Oates' stalker, but denies having seen him before. After Campion hears Joyce's story, of the disappearance of her Uncle Andrew on the way home from church, news reaches them that Andrew's murdered body has been found in a stream. They head to Cambridge, where Campion meets Marcus and hears more about the family of Andrew, his imperious Great-Aunt Caroline and the clutch of feckless relatives who live off her, including Uncle William, who was with Andrew when he went missing, and about the body, found tied up and shot in the head. He meets William, and learns that Oates' mysterious stalker was Cousin George, who visits rarely and has some power over Great-Aunt Caroline. Next morning, more bad news hits the family; Aunt Julia is found dead in her bed, poisoned by a surreptitious morning cup of tea. Campion heads to the house and meets the famous Caroline Faraday, who hires him to help them resolve matters. Oates analyses the teacup and finds traces of conium poison (hemlock, the poison that was used to execute Socrates, and one of the species in the carrot genus, including dill, and parsnip), while Campion finds a stash of weight-loss pills in Julia's room. Uncle William approaches Marcus, telling him he has been suffering from blackouts, and Campion also finds the old man's service revolver is missing, along with some cord from the same (unused) room. Later, Campion finds William in the corridor, his hand badly cut; he almost faints, and Campion suspects mild poisoning. He and Oates inspect the scene where Andrew's body was found, but find nothing but an old hat, presumably swapped for Andrew's missing bowler. Back at the house, there has been another scare; a mysterious symbol like a stylised letter B has been drawn in chalk on one of the library windows. Campion and Oates suspect it is a sign used by tramps to communicate amongst themselves. Great-Aunt Caroline reveals that Andrew had been writing to old girlfriends, and Campion has an idea which could solve the case. He finds Uncle William has an alibi, having been seen in a pub at the time of the murder, in the midst of an amnesia attack, and the inquest into Andrew's death returns a verdict of murder. Cousin George arrives at the house, and denounces his family, claiming to know who killed Andrew and insisting he be allowed to stay in the house, threatening to bring scandal on the family. He gets drunk and is locked in Andrew's room by Campion and Marcus. In the night, Campion spots a man in the gardens, and tackles him; he is a large-footed tramp named Beveridge. In the morning, Campion is missing, and George is found dead in his bed, with a strong smell of cyanide in the room. When Campion and Oates arrive, Campion explains all ‚Äì Andrew, watched secretly by George and his friend Beveridge, bound and then shot himself, arranging for the gun to fall from the bridge. George hid the gun in a tree and Beveridge took Andrew's hat.

The ballpark sat 10,500 fans. It was located at 1500 East Jefferson Boulevard (west, first base), Brazos Street (north, third base); Colorado Boulevard (south, right field); and the Trinity River (east, left field). The ballpark began as Gardner Park, or as some historians call it, \\"Gardner Park II\\". The original Gardner Park (\\"I\\") had opened in 1915, at Jefferson Boulevard and Comal Street. This park, in turn, had replaced Gaston Park, built in the 1880s at Second Avenue and Parry Avenue, currently the site of the Texas State Fairgrounds Music Hall. The original Gardner Park burned on July 19, 1924, following a game. The owners went to work right away and built a new Gardner Park, across the street from the old one, that would serve the club for the next 40 years. The club also played a home game on the fairgrounds once, when they staged their opening day game for 1950 at the Cotton Bowl, drawing over 50,000 fans before resuming play at their normal grounds. At various times, Dallas' minor league team was known as the Giants, Steers, Rebels, Eagles, and Rangers. The park itself was also renamed Steers Park, Rebels Park, and Eagles Stadium at various times. Burnett Field was its temporary name in 1948, and became permanent in 1951, named for Rangers owner Dick Burnett. The club played in the Texas League starting in 1888, continuing until they joined the American Association in 1959, a year after they had been renamed as the Dallas Rangers. In 1960 the club merged with Fort Worth and became the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers, playing half their home games at LaGrave Field in Fort Worth, Texas. The Rangers played in the Association through 1962, then had two seasons in the Pacific Coast League in 1963 and 1964 before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Dallas Cowboys used Burnett Field as their primary practice facility when the team was founded in 1960. The defense met in the clubhouse on the third-base side of the field while the offense met in the first-base clubhouse. 1964 was the end of professional baseball at Burnett Field. When the Texas League revived the franchise in 1965, as the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs, both LaGrave and Burnett Fields were replaced by Turnpike Stadium, later called Arlington Stadium, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth in Arlington, Texas. Google Maps shows the former ballpark lot as being currently a grass-filled vacant lot.

The band's original lineup consisted of Jake Snider (guitar/vocals), Nathan Turpen (guitar), Jeff DeGolier (bass), and Dan Dean (drums). Their music was a melodic, often soft, brand of rock with odd time signatures and an almost freeform jazz influence. History Snider, Turpen, and DeGolier had all previously played in the respected Seattle indie band State Route 522, and had released material with Seattle's Excursion Records under that name. State Route 522 broke up in 1997, following the release of their Samson Is Apollo EP for Excursion. Jay Clark was still playing with Kill Sadie but worked with the band as another guitarist. Within the next year, Snider, Turpen, and DeGolier found themselves playing together again, but this time leaving behind the post-hardcore sound of their previous band in favor of a much more melodic, but no less technical approach to their music. The band recruited Dan Dean (former drummer of nineironspitfire, another Seattle hardcore band) to round out the lineup. Snider has been quoted as saying that he chose the name Sharks Keep Moving after seeing the term used as a headline for a magazine article. Sharks Keep Moving picked up quickly in the independent rock scene, partially because State Route 522 had found more of fanbase after their demise then they had during their existence. The first recorded output for Sharks Keep Moving came in the form of a split 7\\" with fellow Seattle natives The Kentucky Pistol (which featured brothers Sonny and Rocky Votolato, later members of Bugs In Amber and Waxwing, respectively). The record was released by Snider on his own label, Henry's Finest Recordings, and caught the attention of independent music labels Status Recordings, and Second Nature Recordings, who both expressed interest in releasing material with the band. The band's next release was the Desert Strings and Drifters EP on Second Nature. Recorded by respected Seattle producer Matt Bayles, the four-song EP showed the band delve deeper into melody and odd time-signatures. Lengthy songs and sparse vocals set the tone for the group's later efforts, along with the incorporation of cello (played by Snider's future wife, Stephanie Goldade). Desert Strings and Drifters was fairly well received among independent rock critics, but the group remained largely unknown outside of their home area. They continued to play locally as well as up and down the west coast. The same year, Sharks Keep Moving recorded two compilation tracks ‚Äì ‚ÄúWestcott Bay, 1998‚Äù was recorded at their home studio for the Living Silent compilation on Status, while the instrumental track ‚ÄúLogger‚Äù appeared on the It Goes Without Saying compilation, a CD of all-instrumental songs released by Sign Language Records. Around this time, Jeff DeGolier left the band and Morgan Henderson (also of The Blood Brothers) joined as the group's new bassist. It was this lineup that recorded the group's only full-length LP. Released by Status in 1999, the record was simply titled Full Length Album and further explored and solidified the sound set forth on their EP. Again recorded with Matt Bayles, the LP consisted of eight songs (four of which were instrumental) of considerable length, and moved the band into a sound that was even less easy to define than before. Again the record met with fairly high praises from critics, but the band still remained largely unknown, partially due to their inability to tour extensively in support of the record. In the following year, less and less was heard from Sharks Keep Moving, and after a long period of little to no activity, most assumed that they had broken up, although no official announcement was made. At some point during this hiatus, Dan Dean left the band, and was replaced by former Kill Sadie member J. Clark on drums. Status Recordings released the State Route 522 Retrospective CD in 2001 ‚Äì a collection of all of that band's previous output, minus a few compilation appearances. Within the year, it had been announced that Sharks Keep Moving were, in fact, still a band, and were working on new material. Again, nothing materialized for a while, but Sharks members began to pop up in other bands. Jake Snider formed a new band, Minus the Bear, with Matt Bayles and former members of Botch and Kill Sadie, and also joined fellow Seattleite Tom Harpel's group, Onalaska. J. Clark started Pretty Girls Make Graves with former members of The Murder City Devils and Death Wish Kids, and Morgan Henderson continued to play with the increasingly popular The Blood Brothers. In 2002, Sharks Keep Moving released their final recording - a three-song EP entitled Pause and Clause. Recorded by Snider with assistance from Onalaska bandmate Tom Harpel at Spectre Studios, the EP was again released by Status Recordings. A final testament to the band's ever-evolving musical talent, Pause and Clause showed Sharks Keep Moving pushing their signature sound even further into freeform jazz territory. Again, vocals were few and far between, with more complex and distinct guitar parts from Turpen and Snider laid over top of Clark's scattered, technical drumming, and Henderson's flowing basslines. The songs give a feeling of both improvisation and structured songwriting. In support of the EP, the band toured the west coast for a few weeks before returning to Seattle. Despite hopes that the group would continue, the EP and tour seemed to be more a matter of the band not wanting to leave unfinished business. A final track, ‚ÄúLime Green Caf√©,‚Äù recorded during the Pause and Clause sessions, turned up on the Masculine Makeover compilation, a benefit compilation released by Satellite City. It was the last song released by Sharks Keep Moving. In the following years, the members of Sharks Keep Moving have found considerably more success with their other bands than they had in Sharks. Snider continues to front the successful Minus the Bear, who have to date released six full-length albums (the newest being VOIDS, released on March 3, 2017) and three EPs with Seattle label Suicide Squeeze Records (four of which Matt Bayles produced). He also played with Onalaska on their full-length album, To Sing For Nights. Nathan Turpen took a break from music to return to college and in 2014 joined Heiress who have released albums with Deathwish Inc. and The Mylene Sheath. Morgan Henderson played with The Blood Brothers until their break up in 2007, and now plays with Past Lives (along with fellow Blood Brothers members Mark Gajadhar and Jordan Blilie). Clark remained a member of Pretty Girls Make Graves until their break-up in 2007, and later joined ex-Blood Brother members Johnny Whitney and Cody Votolato in Jaguar Love until he left in 2009. Henderson and Dan Dean also played as backing musicians on Rocky Votolato‚Äôs second full length album, Burning My Travels Clean. An odds and ends collection of Sharks Keep Moving material was announced by Status following the group‚Äôs breakup. The record was to contain all of the band‚Äôs 7‚Äù and compilation appearances, as well as some possible unreleased material and a remix. To date, this release has not materialized, and no further announcement has been made about the record.

Early life After the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, many Cubans fled to the United States. Some thought it was a temporary measure and hoped to return soon afterwards, but when it became apparent that the revolution was going to continue, more Cubans left the island. In 1960, Willy Chirino came to the United States via \\"Operation Peter Pan\\", designed to get Cuban children out of the country due to, among other things, fears that the government would take them from their parents. This US government sponsored program, in conjunction with the Catholic Welfare Bureau, sent approximately 14,000 Cuban children to the United States and placed them in foster homes until their parents could leave the island. Chirino would later record \\"Nuestro D√≠a Ya Viene Llegando\\" (\\"Our Day is Coming\\"), a song loosely based on his experiences as a refugee which has become an anthem for Cuban exiles everywhere. Career Chirino began his artistic career in Miami, releasing his first album in 1974. Since then, he has recorded over 20 albums, several of which have attained platinum and gold status. In 2006, his album \\"Son del Alma\\", won a Grammy for Best Salsa/Merengue Album. As founder of the Willy Chirino Foundation, his philanthropic efforts have been recognized by UNICEF and the Department of State. He celebrated his 35th anniversary in music with his latest released album \\"Willy Chirino Live-35th Anniversary\\" (\\"Willy Chirino En Vivo-35 Aniversario\\"), a CD/DVD combo of the concert. This album brought him his first nomination for Best Salsa Album at the 2007 Latin Grammy Awards. Most recently, Chirino and his wife, singer/songwriter Lissette √Ålvarez, released their first album together, Amarraditos (Bound to One Another). The CD includes a potpourri of classic Spanish-language love songs. Chirino's album, \\"Pa'lante\\", was released at spring 2008, after which he launched a world tour. In 2011, when asked of how his recordings of My Beatles Heart, he said that Sony scrutinized every single one of his songs and their versions because they consider the songs by The Beatles as one of their most precious treasures, and wanted to make sure they were being used in a rightful manner. In 2014, Chirino received a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in Las Vegas for his music career. Personal life His first marriage was to Olga Maria Rodriguez and bore three daughters: Angie, Olga Maria and Jessica. He later married Lissette √Ålvarez and had three more children: Nicolle, Alana, and Gianfranco. He has three grandchildren, Elis Regina, Andres and Dashiel. He and his wife support the Cuban dissident movement, Yo No Coopero Con La Dictadura (I Don't Cooperate with the Dictatorship).

It consists of a left pubis, long. The specimen was re- studied by Fernando Novas and Federico Agnolin in 2004, who concluded that the orientation of the pubis had been misinterpreted: it pointed backwards, as was shown by the fossil still being attached to a displaced part of the pubic peduncle of the ilium.Novas and Agnolin, (2004). \\"Unquillosaurus ceibalii Powell, a giant maniraptoran (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina.\\" Rev.

Early life Hayata was born to a devout Buddhist family in Kamo, Niigata on December 2, 1874. When he was 16, Hayata became interested in botany, and he joined the Botanical Society of Tokyo in 1892. His schooling was delayed by a series of family tragedies, and he graduated middle school at the age of 23. He then attended high school and began to collect botanical samples.Ohashi, Hiroyoshi (2009). Bunzo Hayata and His Contributions to the Flora of Taiwan Taiwania, 54(1): 1-27 Hayata enrolled in the botany program at the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1900. He graduated in 1903, and entered the graduate program under Jinz≈ç Matsumura. He was appointed assistant at the Koishikawa Botanical Gardens in 1904. In 1907, he completed his Doctor of Sciences degree. Career In 1908, Hayata was promoted to lecturer in the Department of Botany at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Hayata undertook a botanical expedition to Tonkin in 1917, and was promoted to Associate Professor of the University of Tokyo in 1919. In 1922, he was promoted to a full professorship as the third Professor of Systematic Botany at the University of Tokyo after the departure of Matsumura. He was appointed director of the botanical garden in 1924. He retired in 1930, and he died in 1934 at the age of 59. Legacy Hayata described a total of over 1,600 different taxa, most of which are from Taiwan, but also include plants from Japan, China and Vietnam. From a list of Taiwanese plants currently recognized in the flora of Taiwan in 2003, 549 species, or 14% of Taiwan's flora, were described by Hayata. One example is the species Taiwania cryptomerioides, which Hayata himself saw the discovery of. Awards In 1920, the Imperial Academy of Japan awarded Hayata the Prince Katsura Commemoration Prize for his contribution to the flora of Formosa.

He was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in 1954, and ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1956. In 1958 Burke was elected to the Eighty-sixth Congress. He was reelected to the nine succeeding Congresses, and served from January 3, 1959 to January 3, 1979. He rose through seniority to become the second-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, and was considered an expert on the Social Security system. Burke was not a candidate for reelection in 1978 to the Ninety-sixth Congress. He was a resident of Milton, Massachusetts until his death in Boston, Massachusetts on October 13, 1983 and his interment was at Milton Cemetery in Milton, Massachusetts. Note :1. The 18th Suffolk District sent two representatives to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1939. Michael Paul Feeney and Frank J. Morrison succeeded Burke and Patrick J. Welsh.

It lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in the Campanian faunal stage. Its fossils were found in Mongolia. Discovery Restoration Udanoceratops is known only from the holotype specimen, a large, almost complete skull, which was long and moderately well preserved. It is the largest leptoceratopsid known so far. Like other leptoceratopsids, the skull had a short frill and no horns over the eyes or nose; the animal is estimated at about long. The holotype was collected in the Udan-Sayr locality from the Djadokhta Formation in √ñmn√∂govi Province, dating to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 83.5‚Äì72.1 million years ago. In 2007, Udanoceratops aff. tschizhovi was described based on a single specimen from the Campanian-stage Barun Goyot Formation, in Dornogovi Province. Etymology Udanoceratops was first named by Sergei Kurzanov in 1992 and the type species is Udanoceratops tschizhovi. The generic name is derived from the name of the locality in which the holotype was found (Udan- Sayr) and Greek ceras/Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ meaning \\"horn\\" and -ops/œâœà meaning \\"face\\". Classification Relative sizes of humans and Udanoceratops. Udanoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is derived Greek meaning 'horned face'), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. Within the order, Chinnery places it within the Leptoceratopsidae, as the only Asian representative at the time, along with the North American Leptoceratops, Montanoceratops and Prenoceratops. Diet Udanoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. The short, deep jaws would have given the animal a powerful bite. The toothless beak would have served to grasp and crop stems or leaves, and as in other leptoceratopsids, the teeth would have met with an action that combined shearing and crushing. The feeding adaptations seen in leptoceratopsids suggest a diet of relatively tough food items, however little is known about the plants that grew in the Gobi Desert during the Cretaceous.

Cronin was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 14, 1938 and graduated from Boston University in 1962 and the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1969. He was elected as an Andover, Massachusetts selectman at the age of 24, was later elected as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1967-1969. Before his election to Congress, he also served as a member of Rep. F. Bradford Morse's Congressional Staff, and as a delegate to Republican National Conventions in both 1968 and 1972. In 1972, he was elected as a Republican to the Ninety-third Congress, defeating future US Senator and Presidential candidate John Kerry, who had moved to the Fifth District to seek the seat after Rep. Morse resigned to take a post at the United Nations. Cronin's victory was a huge upset against the anti-war candidate Kerry. He had trailed at one point by more than 20%, and his victory was often accredited to harsh attacks by The Lowell Sun, which attacked Kerry for being an elitist carpetbagger and for his questioning of the patriotism of those who supported the war. In the House, Cronin served on the Interior Committee, and began a process that led ultimately to the creation, years later, of an urban park in Lowell. A businessman and non-ideologue at heart, Cronin placed himself in the moderate wing of his party. In 1974, his first bid for re-election, Cronin faced an assertive challenge from a Lowell-based county commissioner Paul Tsongas, who seized on President Nixon's impeachment troubles in what turned out to be a bad year, electorally, for Republicans nationwide. Tsongas demanded that Cronin release his income tax returns, but the congressman declined; Cronin also declined to debate Tsongas. Tsongas also made political hay over the failure of a technology firm, Mostek, to locate a facility in Lowell after Cronin had promised the firm would do so. A memorable Tsongas radio ad featured echoing footsteps in an empty building. In the November election, Tsongas won 61% of the vote‚Äîand went on to become a US Senator and a candidate for President of the United States in 1992. Cronin later in life would serve a number of positions at Massachusetts Port Authority, and he unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for governor against William Weld. In 1992, Cronin won the Republican nomination to regain his old seat against a weak incumbent Chester G. Atkins. However, Atkins, who had been caught up in the House check-kiting scandal, would be defeated in the primary by an up-and- coming Democratic star, Martin T. Meehan, who in turn would defeat Cronin in the General Election 52% to 38%. Cronin died on April 5, 1997, from a brain tumor at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Andover.

The Eight Anthologies and its companion anthology, the Ten Idylls (PattuppƒÅ·π≠·π≠u), is the oldest available Tamil literature. According to Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a scholar of Tamil literature and history, dating these Eight Anthologies or their relative chronology is difficult, but the scholarship so far suggest that the earliest layer were composed sometime between 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE, while the last layers were completed between 3rd and 5th century CE. Contents of the anthologies The Eight Anthologies consist of 2,371 poems varying from small stanzas of three lines in Ainkurnuru to stanzas of forty lines in Purananuru. The following poems form the Eight Anthologies: * Ainkurunuru (‡Æê‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡ØÅ) * Akananuru (‡ÆÖ‡Æï‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡ØÅ) * Purananuru (‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡ØÅ) * Kalittokai (‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æï‡Øà) * Kuruntokai (‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æï‡Øà) * Natrinai (‡Æ®‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æø‡Æ£‡Øà) * Paripatal (‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æ≤‡Øç) * Pathitrupathu (‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ) This compilation of eight anthologies into the Ettuttokai super-anthology is historic. It is attested to in a mnemonic Tamil venpa stanza, likely composed sometime at a much later date after the 5th-century. The stanza is found in the colophons of many of the surviving palm-leaf manuscripts, and confirms the cherished status of this Sangam collection in the Tamil history. This stanza aid reads: Translation:  Date  Tamil tradition mentions academies of poets that composed classical literature over thousands of years before the common era, a belief that scholars consider a myth. Some scholars date the Sangam literature between c. 300 BCE and 300 CE, while others variously place this early classical Tamil literature period a bit later and more narrowly but mostly before 300 CE. According to Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a Tamil literature and history scholar, the most acceptable range for the majority of Sangam literature is 100 BCE to 250 CE, based on the linguistic, prosodic and quasi- historic allusions within the texts and the colophons. Some of the later strata of the Sangam literature, including the Eight Anthologies, is approximately from the 3rd to 5th century CE. =Rediscovery= The Ettuttokai along with other Sangam literature had fallen into oblivion for much of the 2nd millennium of the common era, but were preserved by and rediscovered in the monasteries of Hinduism, particularly those related to Shaivism near Kumbhakonam. These rediscovered palm-leaf (Tamil: olai, Sanskrit: talapatra) manuscripts were published by the colonial era scholars in late 19th century.  Authors  There are 470 poets known either by their proper names or by causal names deduced from their works. The authors are unidentified in the case of a hundred stanzas. The poets belonged to different parts of Tamil Nadu and to different professions. Some of them were very popular like Kabilar, Nakkirar and Avvaiyaar and some others are rarely remembered by their names. Yet a general harmony prevails throughout these eight anthologies. The tone and temper of the age is reflected in all their poems with a singular likeness. They were moulded according to certain literary conventions or traditions that prevailed in the Sangam age. Yet they reveal the individual genius of the poets who sang them.  Examples  The Sangam literature is categorized into two: love or inner (Akam) or public life or outer (Puram). A verse from the 69th poem of Akana·πâ≈´·πüu : \\"‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ∞‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡ØÜ‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øà ‡Æá‡ÆØ‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡ÆÆ‡Øã‡Æ∞‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ©‡Øà ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æø ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æ§‡Æ∞ ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Øà‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡ÆÖ‡Æ±‡Øà ‡Æá‡Æ±‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡ÆÖ‡Æï‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æ©‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡ÆÜ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç, ‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ§‡ØÇ‡Æâ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ®‡ØÄ‡Æü‡Æ≤‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Æø ‡Æ§‡Øã‡Æ¥‡Æø!\\" The verse speaks about the elegant chariots on which the Mauryans rode through mountains and valleys and are referred to as \\"moriyar\\". These anthologies are significant source of cultural and historic information about ancient Tamil Nadu and South India. =Akaval metre= Of the eight anthologies five are on Agam, two on Puram, and one on both. Six of them are in 'agaval' metre which is a kind of verse, interspersed with alliterations and rhymes. The poems on Agam as well as Puram theme are written in this metre and its regulated and subtle music adds to the poetic beauty. This metre is a simple but wonderful instrument, which causes no impediment to the freedom of expression of the poet. It has been found to be an appropriate and natural medium for the expression of the valuable experience of the poets. =Kali metres= The other two anthologies that are not written in agaval metre are Kaliththogai and Paripaatal. The poems of Kaliththogai are in Kali metre which is known for its dramatic and lyrical qualities and which, according to Tolkappiyam is well suited to express the emotions of the lovers. There is repetition of certain lines and phrases and this, added to the haunting music of the metre, is very appealing. =Paripaadal metre= Paripaadal is a metre full of rhythm and music and the anthology known by this name consists of songs composed in this metre. There are religious poems as well as those on love-themes. The love-theme is worked against the background of bathing festivities. These songs were sung in different tunes as is evident from the notes on the music at the end of these. The names of the musicians who set tunes to these songs are also mentioned therein.  Religion in the Eight Anthologies  In general, the texts are non-religious, mostly about love, longing, bardic praise of the king, chieftain or patron and such topics. They occasionally mention reverence or include lines alluding to Hindu gods (particularly Murugan), goddesses, Vedas, Puranic legends and temples. The Paripaatal is a notable exception. This is a collection of devotional poems (bhakti), which are set to music and written primarily about Thirumal (Vishnu), Murugan and the river Vaigai.

It is claimed, but not proven, that this petition had 1,000 signatures of Puritan ministers. This carefully worded document expressed Puritan distaste regarding the state of the Church of England, and took into consideration James' religious views as well as his liking for a debate, as written in Basilikon Doron. While many of the main Puritan goals were rebutted, the petition did culminate in the Hampton Court Conference, which eventually led James to commission a new English translation of the bible, now known as the King James Version. Context and formulation In a time where it was unwise to criticise the King directly, there was no hint of dissatisfaction with the royal supremacy in the petition. The Puritan reformers stressed throughout that they were not separatists or schismatics. The document expressed much of the general Puritan feeling regarding the Church; namely, that the English Reformation had not gone far enough to purge the Church of England from all perceived errors of the Roman Catholic Church. The Demands The Puritans rejected the following ceremonies:Gee, Henry, and William John Hardy, ed., Documents Illustrative of English Church History, New York: Macmillan, 1896, 508-11, The Millenary Petition (1603) * The signing of the cross during baptism * Confirmation * The administration of baptism by lay people (It was common in some areas that mid-wives would baptize children.) * Use of the ring in marriage * Bowing at the name of Jesus * The requirement of the surplice and cap * The practice of giving men multiple ecclesiastical positions, receiving pay for each They also disliked the terms Priest and Absolution (terms they perceived as Roman Catholic), and rejected the surplice. They wanted a stricter observance of the Sabbath, which was originally supported by James up until The Book of Sports. They claimed that ministers should only be both \\"able and sufficient men\\". The Puritans also requested some changes to ecclesiastical discipline. First, they asked, in a rather ambiguous statement, that punishment only be enforced by Christ's own institution. Second, they claimed excommunication should not be imposed by lay officials. Third, they asked that men should not be excommunicated for \\"trifles and twelvepenny matters\\". Finally, they asked for better restraint in the use of ex officio oath. Text The following was claimed as the full content by Thomas Fuller in his Church-History of 1655: Most gracious and dread sovereign, Seeing it has pleased the Divine majesty, to the great comfort of all good Christians, to advance your highness, according to your just title, to the peaceable government of this Church and Commonwealth of England, we, the ministers of the gospel in this land, neither as factious men affecting a popular parity in the Church, nor as schismatics aiming at the dissolution of the State ecclesiastical, but as the faithful servants of Christ and loyal subjects to your majesty, desiring and longing for the redress of divers abuses of the Church, could do no less in our obedience to God, service to your majesty, love to His Church, than acquaint your princely majesty with our particular griefs; for as your princely pen writeth, 'the king, as a good physician, must first know what peccant humours his patient naturally is most subject unto, before he can begin his cure;' and although divers of us that sue for reformation have formerly, in respect of the times, subscribed to the book-- some upon protestation, some upon exposition given them, some with condition rather than the Church should have been deprived of their labour and ministry --yet now we, to the number of more than a thousand of your majesty's subjects and ministers, all groaning as under a common burden of human rites and ceremonies, do with one joint consent humble ourselves at your majesty's feet, to be eased and relieved in this behalf. Our humble suit, then, unto your majesty is that these offences following, some may be removed, some amended, some qualified: I. In the Church service: that the cross in baptism, interrogatories ministered to infants, confirmation, as superfluous, may be taken away; baptism not to be ministered by women, and so explained; the cap and surplice not urged; that examination may go before the communion; that it be ministered with a sermon; that divers terms of priests, and absolution, and some other used, with the ring in marriage, and other such like in the book, may be corrected; the longsomeness of service abridged, Church songs and music moderated to better edification; that the Lord's Day be not profaned; the rest upon holy days not so strictly urged; that there may be a uniformity of doctrine prescribed; no Roman Catholic opinion to be any more taught or defended; no ministers charged to teach their people to bow at the name of Jesus; that the canonical Scriptures only be read in the Church. II. Concerning Church ministers: that none hereafter be admitted into the ministry but able and sufficient men, and those to preach diligently and especially upon the Lord's day; that such as be already entered and cannot preach, may either be removed, and some charitable course taken with them for their relief, or else be forced, according to the value of their livings, to maintain preachers; that non-residency be not permitted; that King Edward's statute for the lawfulness of ministers' marriages be revived; that ministers be not urged to subscribe, but according to the law, to the Articles of Religion, and the king's supremacy only. III. For Church livings and maintenance: that bishops leave their commendams, some holding parsonages, some prebends, some vicarages, with their bishoprics; that double-beneficed men be not suffered to hold some two, some three benefices with cure, and some two, three, or four dignities besides; that impropriations annexed to bishoprics and colleges be demised only to the preachers incumbents, for the old rent; that the impropriations of laymen's fees be charged, with a sixth or seventh part of their worth, to the maintenance of the preaching minister. IV. For Church discipline: that the discipline and excommunication may be administered according to Christ's own institution, or, at the least, that enormities may be redressed, as namely, that excommunication come not forth under the name of lay persons, chancellors, officials, &c.; that men be not excommunicated for trifles and twelve-penny matters; that none be excommunicated without consent of his pastor; that the officers be not suffered to extort unreasonable fees; that none having jurisdiction or registers' places, put out the same to farm; that divers Roman Catholic canons (as for restraint of marriage at certain times) be reversed; that the longsomeness of suits in ecclesiastical courts (which hang sometimes two, three, four, five, six, or seven years) may be restrained; that the oath Ex Officio, whereby men are forced to accuse themselves, be more sparingly used; that licences for marriages without banns asked, be more cautiously granted: These, with such other abuses yet remaining and practised in the Church of England, we are able to show not to be agreeable to the Scriptures, if it shall please your highness further to hear us, or more at large by writing to be informed, or by conference among the learned to be resolved; and yet we doubt not but that, without any further process, your majesty (of whose Christian judgment we have received so good a taste already) is able of yourself to judge of the equity of this cause. God, we trust, has appointed your highness our physician to heal these diseases; and we say with Mordecai to Esther, 'Who knoweth whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time?' Thus your majesty shall do that which we are persuaded shall be acceptable to God, honourable to your majesty in all succeeding ages, profitable to His Church, which shall be thereby increased, comfortable to your ministers, which shall be no more suspended, silenced, disgraced, imprisoned for men's traditions, and prejudicial to none but to those that seek their own quiet, credit and profit in the world. Thus, with all dutiful submission, referring ourselves to your majesty's pleasure for your gracious answer, as God shall direct you, we most humbly recommend your highness to the Divine majesty, whom we beseech, for Christ His sake, to dispose your royal heart to do herein what shall be to His glory, the good of His Church, and your endless comfort. Your majesty's most humble subjects, the ministers of the Gospel that desire not a disorderly innovation, but a due and godly reformation.Gee, Henry and William John Hardy, ed., Documents Illustrative of English Church History, (New York: Macmillan, 1896), 508-11.

She is also member of the Pallache family. Background Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. Born in New York City, Rossant is the daughter of New Yorker James Rossant, architect and designer of Reston, Virginia, and Colette Rossant, a cookbook author and food writer. Rossant grew up on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. After graduating from St. Ann's School in Brooklyn, she attended Dartmouth College and then the Johns Hopkins University, where she studied Creative Writing. She started publishing poems in Extensions literary magazine when she was 14 years old. At Dartmouth, she co-founded The Stonefence Review literary magazine as an alternative to the highly conservative Dartmouth Review. She studied poetry under Richard Eberhart and Kenneth Koch. Career =Overseas= Courtyard of S√ºleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul. Rossant began work in journalism while living in Istanbul in the late 1980s. She continued as a journalist while based in Paris, Moscow, and Jeddah, writing for newspapers and magazines (including Business Week). Her reportage included the Kurds in Northern Iraq during the Gulf War, fighting between Armenians and Azeris in Nagorno-Karabagh, and developments in the oil industry in Central Asia and the Middle East. =Forbes= Forbes Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City (now owned by New York University) Returning to the U.S., Rossant joined Forbes and Forbes Global to write on international business including the Forbes annual, global Billionaires List. Because of her Middle East experience, she covered the \\"Africa and Middle East\\" sections of that list every year with Forbes. Rossant also started the Celebrity Chefs column in the Forbes annual Celebrity 100 issue, which she wrote for three years. =Super Chef= * Book: Simon & Schuster published Rossant's book Super Chef (Free Press imprint), based on a specific definition she developed from her work at Forbes. The book profiles six \\"super chefs\\": Wolfgang Puck, Charlie Palmer, Todd English, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger (AKA the \\"Too Hot Tamales\\"), and Tom Colicchio. The book was nominated by Fast Company magazine for best book. Several cooking schools for chefs have used the book as a textbook. * Magazine: Rossant continues to track the development of super chefs in Super Chef, online magazine by the same name. In 2005, the magazine championed the White House's selection of the first woman executive chef and then predicted the First Lady's choice of Cristeta Comerford. =Other= Rossant has consulted to a number of companies on branding issues related to super chefs. Rossant has become an expert, cited byNewsweek, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun, Brand Channel, and Gastronomica. She has lectured at the Culinary Institute of America and the Institute for Culinary Education. She has also contributed to publications, from Portfolio to Saudi Aramco World. She also continues to write books. Personal Street in Garden City, Cairo. Rossant traces her maternal line back to the Pallache/Palacci family, Sephardic Jews who moved from Spain to Morocco, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and Egypt. One ancestor, Samuel Pallache, served as dragoman in concluding a treaty between Morocco and the Netherlands (then a young Dutch Republic) in 1608. Several were \\"grand rabbis\\" in 19th Century Smyrna (Izmir): Haim Palachi (Haim Palacci, Hayyim Pallache), Abraham Palacci (Avraham Pallache), and Rahamim Nissim Palacci. Beth Hillel Synagogue (Turkish Bet-Ilel Sinagogu) in Izmir, stands in the former home of Avraham Palache. Great-grandfather Vita Palacci (born in Izmir ~ 1863) owned lemon perfume factories in Upper Egypt. In 1897, he founded the store \\"Palacci Menasce et Fils\\" (known in Egyptian Arabic as Balatshi) on Bayn Al-Nahdain Street in the Muski district of Cairo. By 1909, \\"Palacci\\" had become a full- fledged department store under the name \\"Palacci Fils, Haim et Cie\\" and comparable to Cairo's branch of Bon March√©: \\"a three-storey, 1,200-square- meter store, employing 20 office clerks and 120 salespeople in at least thirteen departments, and was 'doing a large share of the wholesale and retail trade in Egypt and the Soudan'.\\" After World War I, he bought one of five new villas in Garden City, Cairo, which replaced the Hotel Ritz Cairo (demolished 1905). The Palacci family were associated with the Sha'ar Hashamayim Synagogue (Cairo) on Adly Street in downtown Cairo and were one of many families who contributed to its maintenance. Vita's son Isaac, a commercial director who sourced items for the store all across the Mediterranean, met and married Marceline B√©mant in Paris. Later, Rossant's parents also met in Paris and came to live in America in the 1950s. She traces her paternal line back to Warsaw and Seirijai, the latter in Lithuania just across the Polish border.

Such fields often have less clear-cut barriers to entry than traditional professions like law and medicine, and their practitioners often lack the degree of control over their own work that has been traditionally associated with professionals such as doctors and lawyers. In addition, semiprofessions tend to have been historically identified as \\"women's work,\\" which has exacerbated prejudices against regarding them as \\"true\\" professions regardless of the amount of skill involved. In most semiprofessional fields, efforts at professionalization are ongoing. The question of whether nursing is properly considered a semiprofession in the present day is hotly debated. Arguments in favor of continuing to regard nursing as a semiprofession have included the toleration of part-time work and nursing's traditional subordination to medicine in making treatment decisions. Arguments in favor of regarding nursing as a profession, rather than a semiprofession, include the extensive postsecondary training requirements, formal certification as a registered nurse, self- regulation, and the existence of formal codes of professional ethics. AACTE list One group especially tied to this term, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), published a list of twelve checkpoints they believe help define a semiprofession.Howsam, RB et al (1976). \\"Educating a Profession\\", ERIC - Institute of Education Science # Lower in occupational status # Shorter training periods # Lack of societal acceptance that the nature of the service and/or the level of expertise justifies the autonomy that is granted to the professions # A less specialized and less highly developed body of knowledge and skills # Markedly less emphasis on theoretical and conceptual bases for practice # A tendency for the individual to identify with the employment institution more and with the profession less # More subject to administrative and supervisory surveillance and control # Less autonomy in professional decision making, with accountability to superiors rather than to the profession # Management by persons who have themselves been prepared and served in that semiprofession # A preponderance of women # Absence of the right of privileged communication between client and professional # Little or no involvement in matters of life and death Works cited * References See also *Semi-professional *Paraprofessional Employment classifications Occupations ","title":"Semiprofession"},{"id":"4291432","text":"Jim Burke (born 1973 in Manchester, New Hampshire) is an American illustrator, painter, and educator.

During its original run from 1952‚Äì1960, the show appeared at various times on every television network except DuMont (ABC, NBC, and CBS). A syndicated revival was produced for one season in 1974-75. A panel of celebrities met with another celebrity who was in heavy make-up and/or costume; this disguise would always provide clues to the celebrity's actual identity. For example, actor Gary Burghoff appeared in 1974 as a robot with a radar, alluding to his role as Radar O'Reilly on M*A*S*H. The panel asked yes-or-no questions to the celebrity, and then received another clue about the celebrity's identity at the end of the round. After the clue, the panel had one last chance to guess the identity, followed by the celebrity revealing their true identity. 1952‚Äì1960 The original show had several well-known celebrities on its panel including Pat Carroll, Buff Cobb, Sam Levenson, Audrey Meadows, Ogden Nash, Betsy Palmer, and Jonathan Winters. Comedian Allan Sherman was the producer, and Stefan Hatos was executive producer; The show's theme music was \\"The Comedians,\\" an orchestral composition by Dmitri Kabalevsky.

It was originally released in a gatefold sleeve in 1973. GP received critical acclaim upon release, but failed to reach the Billboard charts. In the original Rolling Stone review, which individually covered both GP and its follow-up, Grievous Angel, the reviewer praises Parsons' vocals and delivery paraphrasing Gram's lyrics, \\"boy, but he sure can sing\\". Background After being dismissed from his previous band, the critically acclaimed Flying Burrito Brothers, Parsons decided to embark on a solo career. Unlike his two albums with the Burritos, which melded country and western with soul and rock music, Parsons was determined to make a more traditional country record this time around. However, Parsons' ongoing drug problem (which was a deciding factor for his being fired from the Burritos) and his friendship with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones would delay his solo plans. As Mojo writer John Harris recalls in his article \\"The Lost Boy,\\" Parsons had spent March 1971 hanging out with the Stones entourage on their 10-day \\"Goodbye Britain\\" tour and then, after spending much of the summer in London, he and (girlfriend) Gretchen Burrell flew to the South of France and spent two months \\"living in Nellcote, Keith and Anita's rented abode-cum-zoo-cum-studio.\\" As the Stones spent months struggling to complete their ragged masterpiece Exile on Main Street in the basement, Parsons could be found upstairs where he was often joined by Richards spending hours passing the guitar back and forth singing old country songs. However, Parsons' condition eventually deteriorated to the point where he was booted from the premises, as David N. Meyer recounts in his 2007 Parsons biography Twenty Thousand Roads: \\"At Nellcote no one, not even Richards, saw rescuing Gram as a project that had much chance of success. Tolerance for his self-destruction had run out. The Stones had an album to record. Gram provided inspiration for much of what ended up on the record, but he had become a drag. It was time for him to go.\\" Devastated at being ousted from the Stones inner circle, Parsons returned to London and, for a brief period, stayed with his former bandmate from The International Submarine Band Ian Dunlop in Cornwall before returning to Los Angeles intending to make a solo album for Warner Bros. Recording and composition Initially, country megastar Merle Haggard agreed to produce Parsons's first solo album but backed out at the last minute. According to Meyer's Twenty Thousand Roads, Warner Bros. arranged a meeting at Haggard's Bakersfield home and the two musicians seemed to hit it off but later, on the afternoon of the first session, Haggard canceled. Parsons, an enormous Haggard fan, was crushed, with his wife Gretchen telling Meyer, \\"Merle not producing Gram was probably one of the greatest disappointments in Gram's life. Merle was very nice, very sweet, but he had his own enemies and his own demons.\\" Parsons did manage to hire Haggard's engineer Hugh Davies for his upcoming album, as well as the core of Elvis Presley's band: James Burton (who had also played on Haggard's records) on guitar, Glen D. Hardin on piano and organ, and Ronnie Tutt on drums. Parson's biggest coup, however, was discovering Emmylou Harris, an unknown singer from Washington, D.C., who was recommended to Parsons by Chris Hillman. In the BBC documentary Beyond Nashville Harris recalls, \\"I would say until I had met Gram and started working with him I didn't really understand or have a real love or feel for country music. Like most of my generation, you know, country music was politically incorrect for us at that point. It was associated with Republicans and Right Wing and that sort of thing. He taught me the beauty and the poetry, the simplicity, the honesty in the music. And the love of harmony came from really singing with him.\\" The sessions for GP ran from September through October 1972 and were produced by former Blind Faith bassist Ric Grech. Parsons was beside himself with excitement at being surrounded by such stellar musicians but also severely intimidated by their presence; in a February 2013 cover story for Uncut, David Cavanagh recalls the singer's reticence: \\"Rehearsals for GP descended into drug binges. The songs were coming together - 'Still Feeling Blue' (a Parsons original), 'Kiss The Children' (by Grech), 'Streets of Baltimore' (a 1966 composition by Tompall Glaser and Harlan Howard) - but Gram was falling apart at the seams. He was in the grip of alcoholism. He gorged on cocaine. He was bloated and sweaty; friends in Los Angeles estimated he'd put on three stone since his Burrito days. (Singer and rhythm guitarist Barry) Tashian remembers him being 'nervously excited' about the album, but strangely paralysed by inaction.\\" In the 2004 documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Harris admits, \\"Gram was drinking a lot during that recording, and so there were times when he was together and times when he wasn't. I hadn't done that much recording in my life but I thought, 'If this is the way people make records, I just don't get this.'\\" Realising he could be blowing his big chance, Parsons cut back on his drinking and finished the sessions. Gram Parsons in 1972 The songs on GP display Parsons appreciation for both the Bakersfield sound pioneered by Haggard and Buck Owens as well as his love for both mainstream country music and R&B.; The album is just as much a showcase for Harris, who performs two proper duets with Parsons in the style of George Jones and Tammy Wynette on \\"That's All It Took\\" (a song penned by Jones) and \\"We'll Sweep Out the Ashes in the Morning.\\" The latter is classic country fare about two lovers racked by guilt and who agree their affair has to stop - but not yet. As Mojo's David Cavanagh observed in 2013, several songs on the album, such as \\"A Song For You\\" and \\"She,\\" are about \\"the South Parsons emerged from - or at least the way he would wish to portray it to us - with Biblical imagery in every vista and trembling earth that shakes the trees loose...If it has such a thing as a concept, GP is a country album about country music itself.\\" Parsons demonstrates a quiet, restrained vocal approach on several songs, such as \\"Kiss the Children\\" and \\"How Much I've Lied,\\" infusing the material with a maturity that was not as evident on his previous recordings where his singing is noted for its almost childlike vulnerability. Parsons also recorded the J. Geils Band song \\"Cry One More Time,\\" transforming the standard R&B; lament into what he often referred to as Cosmic American Music, a mixture of several American musical styles. Engineer Hugh Davies would later recall to Parsons biographer David Meyers in 2007, \\"It was sort of funky country. Not quite rock, but beyond traditional country.\\" The cover of GP features Parsons sitting in a chair at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, where he lived with his wife when the first album was recorded. The Fallen Angels Parsons would also tour in support of the LP, assembling a band he called The Fallen Angels, which included Emmylou Harris. In the 2004 Fallen Angel documentary, steel guitarist Neil Flanz states that the rehearsals, which took place at manager Phil Kaufman's home in Van Nuys, California, were an unmitigated disaster: \\"It was just, like, party time most of the time. We weren't serious enough about the rehearsals. It was just wild. Everyone was playing music and having a good time but we weren't taking care of business.\\" Adds Kaufman: \\"We had a big party, Warner Bros. threw a big party for us to go on the tour. We had a tour bus, and the worst tour bus ever. Ever. Gram brought along Gretchen and we left my house and went on our tour, and the tour was just disaster after disaster.\\" By all accounts, it was largely Harris's determination that disciplined the band and turned the shows around. Reception Like his work with the Flying Burrito Brothers, GP was not a commercial success; neither the album or its single \\"She\\" cracked the Billboard 200. However, it was critically praised at the time of its release, with Bud Scoppa of Rolling Stone gushing, \\"Gram Parsons is an artist with a vision as unique and personal as those of Jagger/Richards, Ray Davies or any other of the celebrated figures,\\" and praised the album's \\"rustic authenticity\\" and Gram's \\"amazing voice.\\" The album has only risen in esteem since, with AllMusic giving it five stars out five and deeming it \\"probably the best realized expression of his musical personality...this album remains a haunting reminder of Parsons' talent and influence, and has only gotten better with the passing years.\\" In the liner notes to the 1982 compilation GP, Elvis Costello wrote, \\"Gram Parsons had helped create a Frankenstein's monster: country rock. But his first Warners LP, GP, paid no allegiance to this style...The songs are of lost or stolen love, crossed with an occasional R'nB beat...If it should fail to move you, then you have a big problem.\\" Amazon.com states, \\"Gram Parsons's debut solo album GP allowed audiences to appreciate Gram's incredible vocals and lyrical delivery.\\" Track listing Personnel * Gram Parsons ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar * Emmylou Harris ‚Äì vocals * Barry Tashian ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar * Ric Grech ‚Äì bass guitar * John Conrad ‚Äì bass * Ron Tutt ‚Äì drums * John Guerin ‚Äì drums * Sam Goldstein ‚Äì drums * Glen D.

It was originally located at 4630 Madison Avenue, in the building currently serving as Madison Middle School. As the 1960s progressed, the town was compelled to commission a new high school to accommodate further population growth. In 1971 a new school was constructed at 72 Strobel Road, offering a then-modern auditorium (originally designed as a lecture hall), two-story media center, and athletic complex. Middlebrook Junior High School was converted to Middlebrook Elementary School and the Madison Avenue complex was converted to Madison Junior High School. Trumbull High School housed grades 10‚Äì12 until 1987‚Äì1988, when ninth-graders were moved to the high school, and sixth-graders were moved to the Madison and Hillcrest middle schools.

There is no vegetation or icecap and it is generally free of snow due to the winds. Temperatures are low, there are often very high winds, blizzards are frequent, and the extreme altitude often took its toll. In spite of all this, the Karakoram Pass was considered a relatively easy pass due to the gradual ascent on both sides, and lack of summer snow and ice much of the year. Consequently, the pass was open throughout most of the year.Rizvi, Janet. (1999). Trans- Himalayan Caravans : Merchant Princes and Peasant Traders in Ladakh, pp. 28, 217. Oxford University Press. New Delhi. . There is no motorable road across the pass, and the pass currently remains closed to all traffic. Geopolitical issues The Karakoram pass falls on the boundary between Indian territory of Ladakh and China's Xinjiang autonomous region. It also plays a major geographic role in the dispute between Pakistan and India over control of the Siachen Glacier area immediately to the southwest of the pass. This situation arose from the Simla Agreement, signed in 1972 between India and Pakistan, when the treaty failed to specify the last or so of the cease-fire line from the end of the Line of Control to the border with China. A potential China- India-Pakistan tripoint at Karakoram Pass is referenced in a 1963 boundary treaty between China and Pakistan concerning the Trans-Karakoram Tract, but India was not party to that treaty nor any tripoint agreement. The entire Siachen Glacier, with all major passes and heights of the Saltoro Ridge (including Sia La, Bilafond La, Gyong La, Yarma La (6,100m), and Chulung La (5,800m).), has been under the administration of India (currently as part of the union territory of Ladakh) since 1984. The current de facto tripoint is about 100 km west of the pass near Indira Col in the Siachen Muztagh, where the Actual Ground Position Line between Indian and Pakistani forces meets the border with China.

The Ogden Museum of Southern Art holds the largest and most comprehensive collection of Southern art and is recognized for its original exhibitions, public events and educational programs which examine the development of visual art alongside Southern traditions of music, literature and culinary heritage to provide a comprehensive story of the South. Established in 1999, and in Stephen Goldring Hall at 925 Camp Street since 2003, the museum welcomes almost 85,000 visitors annually. It attracts diverse audiences through its broad range of programming including exhibitions, lectures, film screenings and concerts to broaden the knowledge, understanding, interpretation and appreciation of the visual arts and culture of the American South.  The building  The Ogden consists of two main buildings: the Patrick F. Taylor Library built in 1889 and designed by renowned architect Henry Hobson Richardson, and the adjacent Stephen Goldring Hall (named after Stephen Goldring), a 47,000-square-foot, five-story glass and stone building built in 2003. The museum also includes the Museum Store and the Center for Southern Craft and Design. The museum's location is across the street from the National World War II Museum and the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center. The three institutions anchor an arts district serving local residents and over 11 million visitors to New Orleans. The museum is a Smithsonian Affiliate. Collection Area from which the museum draws its collection The collection consists of work by artists from or associated with fifteen southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia. It is based upon the founding donation of more than 600 works from New Orleans businessman Roger H. Ogden's private collection. Since this original donation the museum's collection of paintings, watercolors, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, wood and crafts has grown to include more than 4,000 works donated from individuals and collectors from across the US. The collection is the largest and most comprehensive collection of Southern art in the world and embodies the visual heritage and history of the American South from 1733 to the present. Among the many artists represented in the museum's collection are John Alexander, Walter Anderson, Benny Andrews, Clementine Hunter, George Rodrigue, George Dureau, William Dunlap, Ida Kohlmeyer, Will Henry Stevens, Kendall Shaw, Hunt Slonem, James Michalopoulos and George Ohr. When the Ogden Museum opened in 2003, the New York Times observed that there is no easily identifiable Southern art style in the museum's collection. A sense of place, history and memory were themes that emerged. According to the Times, the artwork in the collection ‚Äúrange from folk art to shadowy paintings of bayous and back streets, from haunting old photographs to bright modern abstractions.‚ÄùEntrance to Ogden Museum of Southern Art, 925 Camp Street, New Orleans, LA The museum has permanent galleries and changing exhibitions throughout the year.  Exhibitions  = 2016 = Arthur Kern: The Surreal World of a Reclusive Sculptor Arthur Kern is a retired Tulane professor of art who all but withdrew from the outside world thirty years ago. Since then, he has spent much of his time working in his basement studio, creating scores of surreal sculptures that disturb as often as they enchant. The retired Tulane professor had been working without notice in his New Orleans studio when his unusual works were brought to the attention of the Ogden Museum. The sculptures of humans or horses were mostly made from polyester resin. This exhibition was the first major showing of the artist and was guest curated by John Berendt. Louisiana Contemporary Presented by the Helis Foundation. This annual event promotes contemporary art practices in the state of Louisiana, provides exhibition space for the exposition of living artists‚Äô work, and recognizes the role of New Orleans as a rising, international art center.

Top Mob: A History of New Orleans Graffiti - June 4 - November 6, 2016 Over the years, graffiti has evolved from a purely street level rebellion to a multimillion-dollar business, attracting a new generation of ‚Äústreet artists‚Äù and thus changing the perception of where graffiti culture comes from. This exhibition is a visual and historical retelling of the evolution of New Orleans graffiti by the ones who were there when it started and those who have kept it alive. This exhibition is sponsored by Mo's Art Supply. /‚ÄôPƒÄP∆èR/ - June 11, 2016 ‚Äì November 6, 2017 Works on paper are by nature light- sensitive and susceptible to the environment. For that reason, these works in museum collections are often kept in the dark, and only displayed for short periods of time. This exhibition brings many of the masterful works on paper from the Ogden Museum‚Äôs permanent collection out of the dark, climate- controlled drawers of the vault, and into the light of exhibition. Ranging from historic drawings to contemporary papier-m√¢ch√©, /‚ÄôpƒÅp…ôr/ will showcase the diversity and depth of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art's collection of paper works.

Scott, Dusti Bong√©, George Dureau, Caroline Durieux, Michael Meads, Jules Pascin, Gregory Saunders, Seymour Fogel, John Alexander, Minnie Evans, Clementine Hunter, Walter Anderson, William Dunlap, Andrew Bucci, Enrique Alferez, Fritz Bultman, William Hollingsworth, Noel Rockmore, James Surls, Hudson Marquez, George Biddle and others. Maude Schuyler Clay: Mississippi History - October 1, 2016 - January 15, 2017 Maude Schuyler Clay is a fifth generation Mississippian. Clay started her color portrait series Mississippi History in 1975 when she acquired her first Rolleiflex 2 ¬º‚Äù camera. At the time, she was living and working in New York and paying frequent visits to her native Mississippi Delta, whose landscape and people continued to inspire her. Over the next 25 years, the project, which began as The Mississippians, evolved in part as an homage to Julia Margaret Cameron, a definitive pioneer of the art of photography. Clay's expressive, allegorical portraits of her friends, family and other Mississippians, as well as her artful approach to capturing the essence of light, are the driving forces behind her recollection of moments of family life in Mississippi in the 1980s and 90s. Simon Gunning and the Southern Louisiana Landscape - October 1, 2016 - February 5, 2017 Australian-born Simon Gunning left his native country in the 1970s with plans to attend a graduate program in England for painting. On his way, he traveled through the United States and to New Orleans, where he was captivated by the city's urban landscape set amongst a lush backdrop of tropical flora and cypress swamps. Gunning moved to New Orleans in 1981 and began painting its neighborhood streets and later, the natural scenery of South Louisiana. Gunning's paintings depict a range of local subject matter, such as the Creole cottage-lined streets of the city's historic neighborhoods, passing barges on the Mississippi River, and the serenity of two fishermen in the Honey Island Swamp.

Over the past thirty-six years, Michalopoulos has created a singular body of work with a strong sense of place. He has been chosen as the official artist for the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival six times, and his works are held in private and public collections throughout the world. He continues to live and work in New Orleans, and, for the past ten years, has maintained a second studio in the rural M√¢connais district of France.

Solidary & Solitary celebrates the achievement of individual artists, the collective history told by their art, and the social changes that have changed the way we understand art history in the broadest sense. It is essential that these histories be told, that the possibilities of individual achievement, collective identity, and genuine, institutional social change be made vivid, concrete, and beautiful. Only by remembering and understanding these histories can we move forward towards a different future, collectively imagined.

Campuzano knew Taber through a Bible study group.HM Magazine issue No. 96 (July/August 2002), p. 58 Originally, Taber both sang and played drums, though drum machines were also used.Liner notes for \\"So Close...Yet So Far\\" The band auditioned Everett to play drums later that year after meeting at a Prayer Chain show in California. Their first album, The Neverland Sessions was recorded with Steve Hindalong at Neverland Studios and was released independently. After signing to Reunion Records they put out the Whirlpool EP and started touring, while focusing on their first album, Shawl, released in 1993. In 1993, The Prayer Chain released their first collection of all new material since 1990. In April 1994, the band released their first live recording toward the end of the tour for Shawl. It included several of bonus tracks from the Shawl era. After extensive national and international shows they started working on their album, Mercury, which was released in 1995.

Te MƒÅrua is situated on State Highway 2, and is the last significant township (and shop) on the road before it reaches the head of the Hutt Valley and crosses the Remutaka Range into the Wairarapa. Te MƒÅrua is situated in the original floodplain of the Hutt River and parts, particularly the Golf course, have been subject to flooding. Just north of Te MƒÅrua is the Te MƒÅrua water treatment plant and the twin Stuart Macaskill Lakes. Water is taken from the Hutt River at Kaitoke, and either goes directly to the treatment plant or is stored in the lakes for future use. The water treatment plant supplies 40 percent of Wellington's water requirements, including all of Upper Hutt, Manor Park and Stokes Valley in Lower Hutt, all of Porirua, and the northern and western suburbs of Wellington City. Te MƒÅrua residents are represented by the local community body, the Upper Hutt Rural Residents Association, and served by Maymorn railway station. In December 2019, the approved official geographic name of the locality was gazetted as \\"Te MƒÅrua\\".

Cran's work \\"investigates perception and illusion, and the viewer‚Äôs role in how images are formed...Widely exhibited across Canada and internationally recognized, Cran has become known for turning nothing into something, with the slightest push. Cran‚Äôs paintings, included in numerous Canadian collections, have to do with visual tricks, images that appear one way but have been made another way.\\" He has been described in The New York Times as a painter who \\"‚Ä¶has built a career on tampering with people‚Äôs perceptions.\\" In an article published in Galleries West, Jeffrey Spalding, who was senior curator at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in New Brunswick, described the 2015-2016 multi-partner major survey of Cran's work at the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) and the Southern Alberta Art Gallery (SAAG), Lethbridge, Alberta as a \\"remarkable and unique career milestone\\" with exhibition organizers describing Cran as \\"influential\\" and \\"one of the country‚Äôs most notable painters of the last few decades.\\" Education and artistic influences Cran studied at the Kootenay School of Art, Nelson, B.C. and Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD) (Honours painting, 1979). In 1978 Cran attended a lecture in Edmonton by renowned then-74-year-old American art critic Clement Greenberg (1904-1994) ‚Äî one of a series Greenberg presented in that city. Cran was provoked and irritated by Greenberg's already outdated dogma. Greenberg had held such sway in Canada as well as the United States and was considered by some to be one of the most renowned art critics in American history. and 1993 Critics such as Leo Steinberg and others argued that Greenberg dealt more with what artists and curators could not do, such as contextualize an art object and glorify kitsch. Cran was of the next generation of artists who embraced post-modernity and Greenberg's ideas were entrenched in modernity. Work In a 2003 review published in Canadian Art Magazine, Calgary Herald art critic Nancy Tousley compared Cran's creative process to meteorological events, storms, showers and \\"thunderous, lightning speed one offs\\" in which he produces experimental works based on an idea as catalyst using a handful of different styles. The result is a body of work that looks like it was not produced by one artist but many. In his review of Cran's 2009 exhibition entitled Bright Spiral Standard at Toronto's Clint Roenisch Gallery, The Globe and Mails art critic Gary Michael Dault described Cran's exhibition as a \\"dazzling sojourn in sophisticated visuality\\" and \\"fun\\" with its \\"shimmering, graphically delicate but exacting paintings.\\" Dault said that Cran's allusive work borders on visual satire in which Cran gleefully references, analyses, demystifies and skillfully manipulates different genres and styles including still life, portraiture, and abstraction informed by Pop Art, Photo-realism, and Op Art. One painting Sailor was a product of nine years from inception in 2000 at the Emma Lake Artist's Workshops to its completion for this exhibition. Canadian actor, writer, comedian, and film director Bruce McCulloch, who was asked by the National Gallery of Canada to write an essay for the exhibition catalogue,Sincerely Yours, described Crane's Self portrait; Accepting a Cheque for the Commission of this Painting, In 1999 Diana Nemiroff observed that the Canadian art scene in 1999 was highly compartmentalized and regional art suffered from both isolation and the small size of its arts communities. However, this didn't \\"mean they're not terrific..Those people who know [Chris Cran] really respect his work... He's quite rigorous, very alive, very vital, not an academic artist at all.\\" Art educator, mentor and activist After graduating from Calgary-based ACAD in 1979 Cran \\"served as a respected teacher\\" there from 1990 to 1993. Following a hiatus of five years he returned to ACAD where he is currently teaching. Cran is an instructor for One Yellow Rabbit's Summer Lab Intensive. Awards and honours Cran was inducted into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2002. Cran was elected a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 2015. In 2005 Cran was awarded the Keith Evans Memorial Scholarship to assist Cran in his senior artist-in- residence tenure at The Banff Centre, where he mentored other artists while producing his own new works. Cran's work was included in the second Canadian Biennial held November 2, 2012 to February 18, 2013 at the National Gallery of Canada (NGC).

Painted Cave is a small but archaeologically significant cave located south of the Niah Great Cave complex where ancient burial sites and cave paintings can be seen. Niah National Park, located within Miri Division, Sarawak, Malaysia, is the site of the Niah Caves limestone cave and archeological site. History Alfred Russel Wallace lived for 8 months at Simunjan District with a mining engineer, Robert Coulson, who had explored what is now northern Sarawak for mineral ores. Coulson later wrote to Wallace about finding bones in a number of caves in Sarawak. On further enquiry, Wallace learned that one cave in question \\"was situated in the district between Sarawak and Bruni (Brunei), on a mountain some distance inland.\\" In March 1864, Wallace favoured Coulson to explore the caves. However, later in May 1864, G. J. Ricketts, a British Consul to Sarawak was appointed to undertake the work. Ricketts did not remain in the post for long and subsequently Alfred Hart Everett was chosen to undertake the work. Everett surveyed 32 caves in three areas, including Niah/Subis (near Miri) and \\"Upper Sarawak Proper\\" (to the south of Kuching). In the 1950s, Tom Harrisson, the curator of Sarawak State Museum was searching for evidence of ancient human activity in Sarawak. He came across Niah Cave, which showed no evidence of ancient human activity in the area. However, he inferred that since the cave was cool and dry and there were millions of bats and swiflets which can used as food, ancient humans could have lived in the cave. Therefore, in October 1954, Harrisson with his two friends, Michael Tweedie and Hugh Gibb spent two weeks examining the Niah. They found evidence of long term human occupation, habitation, and burial. In 1957, the Sarawak museum organised a larger expedition with transport and equipment from Brunei Shell Petroleum and Sarawak Oilfields Ltd (Shell). Eathernware, shell scrapers, shell ornaments, stone pounders, bone tools, and food remains were found. Radiocarbon dating of the charcoal layers put the site at 40,000 years old, dating back to Paleolithic era. The expedition team led by Barbara Harrisson discovered the \\"Deep Skull\\" in the \\"Hell Trench\\" (for its unusually hot condition) at 101 to 110 inches below surface in February 1958. It is a partial skull with maxilla, two molar teeth and a portion of the base of the skull. The skull is highly fragile and is not fossilised. The morphology of the skull is suggestive of belonging to a female in her late teens to mid- twenties. Near the skull, a complete left femur and right proximal tibia were found which belongs to the same individual. Tom Harrisson also discovered Neolithic burial sites from 2,500 to 5,000 years ago. The discoveries led to more expeditions in 1959, 1965, and 1972. In 1960, Don Brothwell concluded that the Deep Skull belonged to an adolescent male who may be closely related to an indigenous Australian from Tasmania. In the 1960s, 122 human remains from Niah were brough to Nevada, United States. There is lack of paleogeography, stratigraphy, and archeological relationships to support Tom Harrisson's work. Therefore, more fieldwork was conducted by University of Leicester, in collaboration with other universities from Britain, Australia, United States and Sarawak State Museum from 2000 to 2003 to establish a more detailed history of Niah Caves. It was known as the \\"Niah Cave Project\\". Another dating of the charcoal and the Deep Skull itself was done in 2000. It showed that the age of the skeleton to be 37,000 years old. In 2006, studies from the Niah Cave Project found out that the ancient humans living in the Niah Caves probably already used mammal and fish trapping technologies, projectile technology, tuber digging, plant detoxification, and forest burning. In 2013 to 2014, uranium‚Äìthorium dating also confirmed the age of the skull. In 2016, another research done by Darren Curnoe noted that the Deep Skull was more resembling of a female adolescent and is more closely resembling the indigenous people of Borneo rather than Tasmanians or the two layer hypothesis which stated that original population of Southeast Asia were emigrated from Australia and later integrated with people from China. In 2010 and 2019, the Sarawak state goverfirnment nominated the park for an UNESCO's World Heritage Site title. In 2020, all the 122 pieces of Niah human remains were returned to Sarawak. Geography Niah Caves is located on the northern edge of a limestone mountain named Gunung Subis (Mount Subis). The entrance is located at the west mouth of the cave. The location is 15 km from the South China Sea and 50 m above sea level. The west mouth of the Niah Caves is 150 m wide and 75 m high. Archaeology The cave is an important prehistorical site where human remains from 40,000 years ago have been found.\\"The Great Cave of Niah\\" by Huw Barton This is the oldest recorded human settlement in east Malaysia. More recent studies published in 2006 have shown evidence of the first human activity at the Niah caves from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Painted Cave, situated in a much smaller limestone block of its own, some 150 metres from the Great Cave block's south eastern tip, has rock paintings dated as 1,200 years old. Archeologists have claimed a much earlier date for stone tools found in the Mansuli valley, near Lahad Datu in Sabah, but precise dating analysis has not yet been published. Items found at Niah Cave include Pleistocene chopping tools and flakes, Neolithic axes, adzes, pottery, shell jewellery, boats, mats, then iron tools and ceramics and glass beads dating to the Iron Age. The most famous find is the human skull dated at around 38,000 years BCE.The Niah Cave Project at the University of Leicester. Painted Cave has paintings and wooden coffin 'death ships'. Current activities The caves are also well known for the bird's nest industry. They are a popular tourist destination in Sarawak. Every section of the ceiling in the caves where there are swiftlets roosting is privately owned and only the owner has the right to collect the nests. Collection is done half-yearly (usually in January and in June). The collector climbs up hundreds of feet on a single pole to the cave ceiling and scrapes off the nest in flickering candlelight.

Burlington, TJ Maxx, and Five Below will move into the former Sears with both stores scheduled to open in fall 2020. History Pompano Fashion Square was originally developed by Leonard L. Farber, Inc. in 1970 and the first regional shopping hub in Broward County. The enclosed mall's original anchors were 2 level Burdines, Sears, and JCPenney stores and a 1-story Jordan Marsh. The center was renamed Pompano Square and renovated in 1985 to better compete with newer shopping centers in the area. Jordan Marsh became Mervyn's in 1992 which gave the mall a similar fashion to the newly opened Pembroke Lakes Mall. The store in turn closed in 1997 when Dillard's bought the building. The structure in turn didn't reopen by the retailer and instead remained vacant until it was demolished in 2003 for Lowe's which opened a year later. By the early 2000s, however, Pompano Square was a dead mall. Interest in redevelopment surfaced also in 2004, and Faison revitalized the center into its current state in 2006. Moreover, Burdines merged with Macy's also in 2003 and just simply to Macy's in 2005 while a downsized JCPenney and Sears were retained from the old mall. Sterling Organization purchased the mall from Faison in 2012. Since then, the new owners have worked on rebranding, a new website, to bring lively events to the mall and to also to fill the mall with more exciting tenants. Sears sold its store to Sterling on January 2, 2018 and the acquisition could give the opportunity to redevelop the store, which closed on December 16, 2018.

The fossils dated from the mid-late Turonian stage, roughly 90 million years ago. The skull bore a pair of long brow horns like those seen in the Ceratopsidae, although Turanoceratops appears to have been transitional between earlier ceratopsians and ceratopsids, and not a ceratopsid itself. Discovery and naming From the 1920s onwards, Soviet scientists discovered fragmentary fossils near Dzharakuduk in the district Navoi Viloyat, leading them to the conclusion that some ceratopsid must have been present. In 1988, paleontologist Lev Aleksandrovich Nesov based on these published the name Turanoceratops tardabilis,Nessov L.A., 1988, \\"[Assemblages of vertebrates of the late Mesozoic and Paleocene of Middle Asia]\\", Trudy XXXI Sess. Vsesoyuz Paleont. Obshchestva. Nauka, Leningrad, pp 93‚Äì101 but did not provide a description so that for the time being it remained a nomen nudum. In 1989, Nesov, L.F. Kaznysjkina and Gennady Olegovich Cherepanov validly named the type species Turanoceratops tardabilis. The generic name is a combination of Turan, an old Persian name for Turkestan, the general region of the finds, and ~ceratops, \\"horned face\\", a usual suffix in ceratopian names. The specific name means \\"retarding\\" in Latin, referring to the protracted research.L.A. Nessov, F. Kaznyshkina, & G.O. Cherepanov, 1989, \\"Ceratopsian dinosaurs and crocodiles of the middle Mesozoic of Asia\\", In: Bogdanova & Khozatsky (eds.) Theoretical and applied aspects of modern paleontology, pp 142-149 The holotype, CCMGE No. 251/12457, consists of a damaged left maxilla, the tooth- bearing upper jaw bone. Other fossils have been referred but some of these later were proven to have belonged to other types of dinosaur. A braincase e.g. (specimen CCGME 628/12457) was shown to be of a sauropod, while presumed frill material actually represented ankylosaur armour plates. Authentic material includes postorbitals with brow horn cores, teeth, a predentary and limb elements. In 2004, Peter Dodson considered it a nomen dubium,H. You and P. Dodson, 2004, \\"Basal Ceratopsia\\". In: D. B. Weishampel, H. Osmolska, and P. Dodson (eds.), The Dinosauria (2nd edition). University of California Press, Berkeley pp 478-493 but in 2009 Hans-Dieter Sues concluded that it was a valid taxon. Description Size of Turanoceratops tardabilis compared to a human Turanoceratops was a relatively small animal. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at two metres, its weight at 175 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 283 Sues in 2009 determined some typically basal traits, indicating a lower position in the evolutionary tree, and some more derived traits, showing a higher position. Basal traits are the variably developed secondary ridges on the tooth crowns and the possession of just two or three teeth per tooth position. Derived traits, relative to the more basal Zuniceratops, are the increase of the number of teeth to two or three and the possession of two roots per teeth. More general derived traits are the exclusion of the frontal bone from the upper rim of the eye socket and the presence of incipient cavities in the skull roof. Classification Turanoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned face\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended 66 million years ago. All ceratopsians became extinct at the end of this period. A 2009 study led by Hans-Dieter Sues analysed additional fossil material of Turanoceratops and concluded that, contrary to expectations, it represented a true (though \\"transitional\\") member of the family Ceratopsidae. If correct, it would represent an Asian ceratopsid. At the time of publication this would have been unique, as all other ceratopsids known to that point were from North America.Sues, H.-D., and Averianov, A. (2009). \\"Turanoceratops tardabilis‚Äîthe first ceratopsid dinosaur from Asia.\\" Naturwissenschaften, . Some scientists, such as Andrew Farke, disagreed with Sues' findings. Farke and colleagues ran an independent phylogenetic analysis of the new Turanoceratops fossils and found that it was a close relative of Ceratopsidae (the immediate sister group) but was not a true member of that clade.Farke, A., Sampson, S.D., Forster, C.A., Loewen, M.A. (2009). \\"Turanoceratops tardabilis‚Äîsister taxon, but not a ceratopsid.\\" Naturwissenschaften, 7 May 2009. . Sues and Alexander Averianov criticised that analysis, arguing that Farke and colleagues misinterpreted or mis-coded some characteristics of the fossil in their analysis.Sues, H.-D. and Averianov, A. (2009). \\"Phylogenetic position of Turanoceratops (Dinosauria: Ceratopsia).\\" Naturwissenschaften, 20 May 2009. . However, Xu et al. (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis and concluded that Turanoceratops was more derived than Zuniceratops and was outside of Ceratopsidae, because it lacks several important synapomorphies of this group. Paleobiology Restoration of a resting individual Turanoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.

He then matriculated to Harvard, where he earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1949. From there, he went on to Berkeley, earning his master and doctorate degrees in mathematics in 1951 and 1953, respectively. His dissertation, \\"On Uniform Convergence of Families of Sequences of Random Variables\\", was written under Michel Lo√®ve. Parzen went directly into academia after graduate school, first serving as a research scientist in the physics department and assistant professor of mathematical statistics at Columbia University. He left there in 1956 for Stanford University, where he stayed for the next 14 years. During this time, he wrote what has become one of the classical texts in probability theory.Parzen, E. (1960) Modern Probability Theory and Its Applications, John Wiley and Sons, New York. In 1970, he accepted the chair of the statistics department at SUNY Buffalo and in 1978 moved to his last post as a Distinguished Professor at Texas A&M; University. Parzen died in Boca Raton, Florida on February 6, 2016. His son, Michael Parzen, is a Senior Lecturer of Statistics at Harvard University.

Life and work Lustig was born in Prague. As a Jewish boy in Czechoslovakia during World War II, he was sent in 1942 to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, from where he was later transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, followed by time in the Buchenwald concentration camp. In 1945, he escaped from a train carrying him to the Dachau concentration camp when the engine was destroyed by an American fighter-bomber. He returned to Prague in time to take part in the May 1945 uprising against the German occupation. After the war, he studied journalism at Charles University in Prague and then worked for a number of years at Radio Prague. He worked as a journalist in Israel at the time of its War of Independence where he met his future wife, who at the time was a volunteer with the Haganah. He was one of the major critics of the Communist regime in June 1967 at the 4th Writers Conference, and gave up his membership in the Communist Party after the 1967 Middle East war, to protest his government's breaking of relations with Israel. However, following the Soviet- led invasion that ended the Prague Spring in 1968, he left the country, first to Yugoslavia, then Israel and later in 1970 to the United States. He spent the academic year 1970-1971 as a scholar in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. After the fall of communist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989, he divided his time between Prague and Washington, D.C., where he continued to teach at the American University. After his retirement from the American University in 2003, he became a full-time resident of Prague. He was given an apartment in the Prague Castle by then President V√°clav Havel and honored for his contributions to Czech culture on his 80th birthday in 2006.

It is known from the Early Cretaceous Tugulu Group in the Urhe area of the People's Republic of China. Discovery From 1964 dinosaur fossils were excavated in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang. In 1973 a number of these were described by paleontologist Dong Zhiming, among them the bones of a small theropod which he named Tugulusaurus faciles. The generic name refers to the Tugulu Group. The specific name is derived from Latin facilis, here with the meaning of \\"easily moving\\", referring to the agility of the animal as indicated by its \\"delicate bones\\".Dong, Z.-M. 1973. [Dinosaurs from Wuerho]. Memoirs of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Academia Sinica 11: 45‚Äì52 [Chinese] The holotype, IVPP V4025, was found in layers of the Lianmuqin Formation dating from the Barremian‚ÄìAlbian. It consists of a partial skeleton including four partial tail vertebrae, much of the left leg and part of the right, the first fingers of both hands, and a rib. The femur has a length of about . The left first metacarpal is very short: . The skeleton represents the only remains of the species that have ever been discovered. Classification Tugulusaurus was originally classified by Dong in 1973 as a member of the Ornithomimidae, within the Coelurosauria. In the years that followed, the genus was often considered a nomen dubium.Norman, D. B. (1990). \\"Problematic Theropoda: Coelurosaurs\\". 280-305 in Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., & Osm√≥lska, H.

It was about long and weighed 2.5 tonnes. The type species is Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus, first described by Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young in 1958. A hadrosaur, Tsintaosaurus had a characteristic 'duck bill' snout and a battery of powerful teeth which it used to chew vegetation. It usually walked on all fours, but could rear up on its hind legs to scout for predators and flee when it spotted one. Like other hadrosaurs, Tsintaosaurus probably lived in herds. Discovery and naming Left premaxilla In 1950, at Hsikou, near Chingkangkou, in Laiyang, Shandong, in the eastern part of China, various remains of large hadrosaurids were uncovered. In 1958 these were described by Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian (\\"C.C. Young\\") as the type species Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus. The generic name is derived from the city of Qingdao, earlier often transliterated as \\"Tsintao\\". The specific name means \\"with a nose spine\\", from Latin spina, and Greek ·ø•ŒØœÇ, rhis, \\"nose\\", in reference to the distinctive crest on the snout. The holotype, IVPP AS V725, was discovered in a layer of the Jingangkou Formation, part of the Wangshi Group dating from the Campanian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. The paratype is specimen IVPP V818, a skull roof. In the same area some additional partial skeletons and a large number of disarticulated skeletal elements were found. Some of these were by Yang referred to Tsintaosaurus, others were named as a Tanius chingkankouensis Yang 1958; also a Tanius laiyangensis Zhen 1976 exists. The latter two species are today either considered junior synonyms or nomina dubia. Later researchers would refer a larger part of the material to Tsintaosaurus. Description =Crest= Restoration showing modern interpretation of crest shape Tsintaosaurus was originally reconstructed with a unicorn-like crest on its skull. The crest, as preserved, consists of an about forty centimetres long process, protruding almost vertically from the top of the rear snout. The structure is hollow and seems to have a forked upper end. Comparable structures with related species are unknown: they possess more lobe-like crests. In 1990, David Weishampel and Jack Horner cast doubt on the presence of the crest, suggesting that it was actually a broken nasal bone from the top of the snout distorted upward by a crushing of the fossil. Their study further suggested that, without the distinctive crest to distinguish it, Tsintaosaurus was actually a synonym of the similar but crestless hadrosaur Tanius. However, in 1993 Eric Buffetaut e.a., after a renewed investigation of the bones themselves, concluded that the crest was neither distorted nor an artefact of restoration; besides, a second specimen with an upright crest part had since been discovered, indicating that the crest was indeed real and Tsintaosaurus is likely a distinct genus. Tsintaosaurus mount with outdated crest reconstruction, Paleozoological Museum of China. A new reconstruction in 2013, by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez and Jonathan Wagner and based on the identification of specimen IVPP V829, a praemaxilla, as a Tsintaosaurus element, came to the conclusion that the unicorn-like bone was just the rear part of a larger cranial crest that started from the tip of the snout. The front of the crest would have been formed by ascending processes of the praemaxillae. These had expanded rhomboid contact facets with the expanded upper parts of the crest processes of the nasal bones, forming the rear of the crest. The rear base of the crest was covered by outgrowths of the prefrontals. The fused nasal bones would have formed a hollow tubular structure. The height of the crest would have exceeded that of the rear skull, measured along the quadrates. Though largely vertical, the crest is directed slightly to the rear; the forward inclination of the holotype crest would be the result of a distortion of the fossil. Reinterpretation of the skull crest The new reconstruction by Prieto-M√°rquez and Wagner also led to a new hypothesis about the internal air passages of the crest. Yang had assumed that the tubular hollowing in the preserved part of the holotype would have served as the main intake of air. This was rejected by Prieto-M√°rquez and Wagner who pointed out that the tube was closed at its lower end and that with lambeosaurines in general the air passages are located in a more forward position, the bony nostrils being completely enclosed by the praemaxillae. They assumed that Tsintaosaurus would have had a standard lambeosaurine arrangement in the snout, the air, when inhaling, entering the skull through the paired pseudonares, the \\"fake nostrils\\" of the praemaxillae behind the upper beak. From there the air would have been transported through paired passages below the median processes of the praemaxillae to the top of the crest, subsequently entering a common median chamber within the lobe. The rear of the chamber was formed by the nasal bones and probably homologous to the nasal cavity. The chamber was divided into two smaller cavities, one at the front, the other at the rear, by curved median processes of the praemaxillae, forming hooks around a passage between the cavities. From the rear cavity the air was transported to below, towards the internal skull cavity. Although it is usually assumed that a single passage served for this purpose, Prieto- M√°rquez and Wagner saw indications in the form of the nasal that there were paired downward passages, to the inside of the lateral processes of the praemaxillae. From this they concluded that the entire airflow was likely separated, the common medium chamber probably being divided into a left and right section by a cartilaginous septum. The conclusion that the tubular structure in the rear nasal bones was not an air passage, forced Prieto- M√°rquez and Wagner to find an alternative explanation of its function. They suggested that it would have served to lessen the weight of the crest, such a tube combining relative strength with a low bone mass. Tsintaosaurus would have differed in this from more derived lambeosaurines, which have a front extension of the frontal bone, in the form of a bone sheet, supporting the crest. =Other distinctive traits= Size of Tsintaosaurus compared to a human Apart from the crest, Prieto-M√°rquez and Wagner identified several other distinctive traits (autapomorphies) of Tsintaosaurus. The rim of the upper beak is rounded and thick, wider than the transverse width of the front depression around the nostrils. As far as this depression is situated on the praemaxillae, it is at each side divided lengthwise by two ridges obliquely continuing to below and sideways. Internally, the fused nasal bones form a bony block in front of the braincase. The rear of the nasal bone is clipped by front extensions of the frontal bone, the topmost of which is elevated relative to the skull roof. The ascending branches of the praemaxillae have internal processes pointing to behind, below and slightly inside, dividing a shared chamber at the midline. The prefrontal possesses a flange, continuing from the lower part of the lacrimal bone to the lower part of the ascending process of the prefrontal, and connecting to a process on the side of the praemaxilla to form an elevation on the side of the crest base. The side and the underside of the prefrontal show deep vertical grooves. The supratemporal fenestra is, transversely, wider than long. Classification Tsintaosaurus may form a clade in Lambeosaurinae with the European genera Pararhabdodon and Koutalisaurus (probable synonym of Pararhabdodon). The position of Tsintaosaurus in the evolutionary tree according to a 2013 study by Prieto- M√°rquez e.a. is indicated by this cladogram: Left prefrontal Paleoecology A study of dinosaur eggs in successive layers of the Wangshi Series of Shandong province, of which the Jingangkou Formation is the most recent layer, shows that the region was one of high dinosaur diversity and that the climate had become drier from the preceding Jiangjunding Formation.

It lived in the Late Cretaceous of China. The type species, named and described in 1929 by Carl Wiman, is Tanius sinensis. The generic name honours the Chinese paleontologist Tan Xichou (\\"H.C. Tan\\"). The specific epithet refers to China. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length of Tanius at seven metres and the weight at two tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, p. 296 Discovery and Species Tan, in April 1923, discovered the remains in the east of Shandong at the village of Ch'ing-kang-kou, ten kilometres southeast of Lai Yang. In October of the same year they were excavated by Tan's associate, the Austrian paleontologist Otto Zdansky. Although the specimen was originally rather complete, only parts could be salvaged. The holotype, PMU R.240, was recovered from the Jiangjunding Formation of the Wangshi Series dating from the Campanian. It consists of the back of the skull, which was flat and elongated. Other species originally assigned to Tanius have been moved to other genera. These include: Tanius prynadai named in 1939 by Anatoly Nikolaevich Ryabinin, which was assigned to Bactrosaurus; and Tanius chingkankouensis named in 1958 by Yang Zhongjian, and Tanius laiyangensis named in 1976 by Zhen Shuonan, which were both later considered junior subjective synonyms of Tsintaosaurus. However, a more recent study, Zhang et al. (2017) determined that T. sinensis and T. chingkankouensis were valid species of Tanius, and that T. laiyangensis was probably not valid. Zhang et al. (2019) re-assessed \\"Tanius\\" laiyangensis as a member of the saurolophine clade Kritosaurini, the first of the clade from Asia. Paleoecology The type species Tanius sinensis was found in the Jiangjunding Formation of the Chinese Wangshi Group. The Jiangjunding formation consists purpley-grey or reddy-brown sandstones or various consistencies, siltstones and conglomerates. The Wangshi group of geologic formations is generally considered to be from the Late Cretaceous, although some regions are older. Based on the discovery of Pinacosaurus, only known elsewhere in the Djadokhta Formation or regions of the same age, the Wangshi Group was presumed to be a similar age of 75-71 million years old. The specific age for the Hongtuya Formation has been identified as 73.5-72.9 mya. As the Hongtuya is directly older than the Jiangjunding, it was identified that Tanius sinensis lived in the latest Campanian to earliest Maastrichtian by Borinder in 2015. The Jiangjunding Formation was deposited in a fluvial to lacustrine environment. The climate was warm and humid during the majority of the timespan, although it was beginning to dry out after the Jiangjunding. Taxa that lived alongside Tanius in the formation include the ankylosaur Pinacosaurus cf. grangeri; possibly the cerapodan Micropachycephalosaurus; intermediate sauropods; intermediate coelurosaurs; and intermediate cheloniids which show similarities to Nanhsiungchelyidae. Multiple localities of dinosaur eggs have also been idenfitied. Both T. chingkankouensis and T. laiyangensis were discovered in the Jingangkou Formation, which is directly above the Jiangjunding. This formation has been the site of massive excavations of hadrosaurs in both the 1950s and the 2010s. A majority of the strata is green- grey mudstone, where the bones excavated are coloured black. The sediment in the location of the hadrosaur excavations was deposited by a mudflow event, where the carcasses were trapped and moved a short distance before rapid burial. At least 20 individuals of hadrosaurs have been uncovered, of various ages. Hadrosaurs from these localities include Tanius, Tsintaosaurus, Laiyangosaurus and Shantungosaurus. Other taxa uncovered include the theropods Chingkankousaurus and cf. Szechuanosaurus campi, and the testudine Glyptops.

It has a convoluted taxonomic history. Discovery and naming Historical reconstruction by Heinrich Harder (as \\"Gigantosaurus\\"), 1912 In 1907, German paleontologist Eberhard Fraas who was working the Tendaguru Beds in German East Africa (presently Tanzania), discovered two sauropod specimens at a single site (\\"Quarry A\\"). The two individuals, designated \\"Skeleton A\\" and \\"Skeleton B\\", each represented a different sauropod species. In 1908 he named these respectively Gigantosaurus africanus (\\"African giant lizard\\") and G. robustus (\\"Robust giant lizard\\").E. Fraas, 1908, \\"Dinosaurierfunde in Ostafrika\\", Jahreshefte des Vereins f√ºr Vaterl√§ndische Naturkunde in W√ºrttemberg 64: 84-86 A third, unrelated African species, \\"Gigantosaurus\\" dixeyi, was named by Haughton in 1928, and has since been reassigned to Malawisaurus. However, the name Gigantosaurus had already been used for the European sauropod Gigantosaurus megalonyx Seeley, 1869. Fraas, not intending to place his species in the same genus as this English form, had believed that the name was available, since at the time the latter species was considered to be a junior synonym of Ornithopsis and Seeley in his opinion had not provided a sufficient description anyway. Another German paleontologist, Richard Sternfeld, renamed the Tanzanian sauropod Tornieria in 1911, making the two species Tornieria africana and T. robusta. The generic name honours the German herpetologist Gustav Tornier.Sternfeld, R., 1911, \\"Zur Nomenklatur der Gattung Gigantosaurus Fraas\\", Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin 1911: 398 A re-evaluation of Tornieria in 1922 by Werner Janensch concluded that one species, T. africana, was actually an African species of the North American sauropod genus Barosaurus: Barosaurus africanus.Janensch, W., 1922, \\"Das Handskelett von Gigantosaurus robustus und Brachiosaurus brancai aus den Tendaguru-Schichten Deutsch- Ostafrikas\\", Centralblatt f√ºr Mineralogie, Geologie und Pal√§ontologie 1922: 464‚Äì480 The other African species, T. robusta, later turned out to belong to a titanosaur. The titanosaur species for a time was called Tornieria, but this was incorrect as T. africana had been the type species. It needed a generic name of its own and this was provided in 1991 when Rupert Wild renamed it Janenschia. If Tornieria were the same genus as Barosaurus, then the name Tornieria would be abandoned as a junior subjective synonym. However, later researchers proposed generic distinction between the American and the African form. In the early 21st century this usage became prevalent and in 2006 Kristian Remes in a review concluded that Tornieria was indeed distinct and a valid genus.Remes, K., 2006, \\"Revision of the Tendaguru sauropod Tornieria africana (Fraas) and its relevance for sauropod paleobiogeography\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26(3): 651‚Äì669 A complication is formed by the fact that Janensch in 1961 recognised a variety of B. africanus: B. africanus var. gracilis, a morph distinguished by more gracile hind limbs.Janensch, W., 1961, \\"Die Gliedma√üen und Gliedma√üeng√ºrtel der Sauropoden der Tendaguru-Schichten\\", Palaeontographica Supplement 7(3): 177‚Äì235 In 1980 John McIntosh promoted this to a full species: Barosaurus gracilisD. Russell, P. Beland, and J. McIntosh, 1980, \\"Paleoecology of the dinosaurs of Tendaguru (Tanzania)\\", Memoires de la Societ√© Geologique de France, N.S. 139: 169-175 which then would become a Tornieria gracilis under the present usage, a combination already published by George Olshevsky in 1992.G. Olshevsky, 1992, A revision of the parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, excluding the advanced Crocodylia. Mesozoic Meanderings 2, pp. 1-268 However, Remes in 2006 concluded that B. gracilis had been a nomen nudum, neither holotype nor diagnosis having been provided in 1980. Specimens and description Elements of the original \\"Skeleton A\\" were designated by Fraas as a syntype series: SMNS 12141a, 12145a, 12143, 12140, 12142, all from the postcrania. Later some other bones from the same individual were recovered. Janensch would also refer many other fossils to B. africanus, in total 630 specimens representing at least 56 separate individuals. Of these 188 would be left after the bombardments during the Second World War. Remes, however, concluded that merely a second partial skeleton, \\"Skeleton k\\", including also some skull elements, could be reliably referred, and a series of caudal vertebrae. The remains are from the later strata of the Tendaguru, the obere Dinosauriermergel or \\"Upper Dinosaur Marl\\", dating from the Tithonian. Tornieria was a large sauropod, with a maximum known femur length of suggesting an animal around the same size as Barosaurus; and 23 metric tons. It shared elongated neck vertebrae and a rather long forelimb with Barosaurus. However, it differed from the American form by details in the anterior caudal vertebrae and from Barosaurus and Diplodocus both by its plesiomorphic hindlimb proportions with a short lower leg. Phylogeny After performing a cladistic analysis, Remes (2006) concluded that Tornieria was the sister taxon of a clade formed by Barosaurus and Diplodocus. It would thus be a member of the Diplodocinae. The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Whitlock in 2011, showing the relationships of Tornieria among the other genera assigned to the taxon Diplodocidae:Whitlock, J.A.

In 1947, the Overland Candy Company (makers of Whoppers brand malted milk candy) merged with the Chicago Biscuit Company, Leaf Confectionary Company, and Leaf Machinery to form Leaf Brands. In 1948, Leaf issued its first set of baseball cards, the first post-World War II color set. In 1949, Leaf Brands reintroduced Whoppers' Malted Milk Balls. In the 1960s, Whoppers Malted Milk Balls brand and other products manufactured by Leaf Brands were purchased by W. R. Grace and Company, which sold them back in 1976. In 1983, Leaf acquired Jolly Rancher. Also in 1983, the Leaf Candy Company in Illinois was purchased by Huhtam√§ki Oyj of Helsinki, Finland, who merged it with Phoenix Candy (the maker of Now and Later) and another candy company it had acquired, all under the Leaf name. Huhtam√§ki Oyj acquired the Donruss trading card division of General Mills at about the same time and merged it into Leaf. In 1986, Leaf purchased some confectionery brands from Beatrice Foods, maker of Milk Duds. Also in 1986, Leaf, Inc. sold Phoenix Candy to Kouri Capital, a Finnish investment firm, changing its name to Phoenix Confections. In 1988, Hollywood Brands, maker of Payday and Zero, was purchased from Sara Lee by Huhtam√§ki Oyj and became part of Leaf, Inc. In 1989, the Heath bar was purchased by Leaf. In the 1990s, Leaf became one of the world's top-ten confectionery companies; it was especially strong in non-chocolate products such as pastilles and chewing gum. By 1993 Leaf was the fourth largest candy producer in North America. In 1996, the Hershey Foods Corporation acquired the Leaf North American confectionery operations from Huhtam√§ki Oyj. Over the next few years, Leaf manufacturing and sales became integrated into existing Hershey manufacturing and sales operations, effectively ending Leaf's existence as a separate operating unit in the US. In 1999, Leaf's European and Asian business, with brands such as L√§kerol, Jenkki, and Sportlife, was sold to the Dutch company CSM, which added the brands to their confectionery unit, which already included Malaco, Red Band, and Venco.

From Ancient Greek the town name shifted to Koine Greek by the Roman period, evolved into Byzantine Greek in the Middle Ages, and finally became the Modern Greek name still used by its townspeople before their final evacuation in 1923. In late antiquity the inhabitants of the region had become Christian and, following the East-West Schism with the Catholic Church in 1054 AD, they came to be called Greek Orthodox Christian. These Greek-speaking Christian subjects, and their Turkish-speaking Ottoman rulers, lived in relative harmony from the end of the turbulent Ottoman conquest of the region in the 14th century until the early 20th century, when the rise of nationalism led to persecution of minorities within the Ottoman realm and the eventual creation of modern Turkey by the Turkish National Movement. The massacres of Greeks and other Christian minorities in the Ottoman Empire during World War I (1914‚Äì1918) led to the almost total depopulation of the town's 6,500 Greek inhabitants by 1918. These former inhabitants were bereaved of their properties and became refugees in Greece, or they died in Ottoman forced labour battalions (cf. Number 31328, an autobiography by a Greek-speaking novelist from a similar coastal town in Turkey). Following these events the Allied victors in World War I authorized the occupation of Smyrna, which still had many Greek inhabitants, by Greece in May 1919. This led to the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, the subsequent defeat of Greece, and the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. That treaty contained a protocol, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which barred permanently the return of any prior Greek Orthodox refugees to their homes in Turkey (including the previous Livissi refugees) and required that any remaining Orthodox Christian citizens of Turkey leave their homes for Greece (with an exception for Greeks living in Istanbul). The treaty also required that Greece's Muslim citizens permanently leave Greece for Turkey (with an exception for Muslims living in Greek Thrace). Most of these Turks/Muslims from Greece were used by the Turkish state to settle its now empty Greek Christian towns, but Turks/Muslims from Greece did not wish to settle in Livissi due to rumors of ghosts of the Greeks killed there. The ghost town, now preserved as a museum village, consists of hundreds of rundown but still mostly standing Greek-style houses and churches which cover a small mountainside and serve as a stopping place for tourists visiting Fethiye and nearby √ñl√ºdeniz. Livissi/ Kayak√∂y village The village is now empty except for tour groups and roadside vendors selling handmade goods. However, there is a selection of houses which have been restored, and are currently occupied. History An abandoned church Much of what remains of Livissi was built in the 18th century. Lycian style tombs can be found in the village and at Gokceburun, north of the village. Lebessus is mentioned as a Christian bishopric in the Notitia Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius composed under the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius in about 640, and in the similar early 10th- century document attributed to Emperor Leo VI the Wise, as a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia, to which Lebessus belonged.Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte und ungen√ºgend ver√∂ffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum , in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch- historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 539, n¬∫ 280, and p. 555, n¬∫ 343. Since it is no longer a residential bishopric, Lebessus is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 915 Livissi is probably the place where the inhabitants of Byzantine Gemiler Island fled to protect themselves from pirates. It experienced a renewal after nearby Fethiye (known as Makri) was devastated by an earthquake in 1856 and a major fire in 1885. More than 20 churches and chapels were built in the village and the plain (Taxiarhes ‚Äì the 'Upper' church ‚Äì and 'Panayia Pyrgiotissa' ‚Äì the 'lower' church ‚Äì St. Anna, St. George, etc.). Most of them are still standing in ruinous or semi-ruinous condition. The village population was over 6.000 people, according to Greek and Ottoman sources. The persecutions of Livissi inhabitants as well as Greeks of nearby Makri (Fethiye) were part of the wider campaign against all Ottoman Greeks and other Christians of the Empire (cf. Armenian deaths in World War I). The persecutions in the area started in 1914 in Makri. In 1916, a letter in Greek addressed to Sir Alfred Biliotti, the Consul General of Great Britain at Rhodes, explained the murders and persecution of Livissi and Macri Greeks who asked him for intervention. Unfortunately, the letter was intercepted at Livissi by Turkish authorities. Later that same year, many families of Livissi were deported and driven on foot to Denizli, around 220 km away. There, they suffered various extreme atrocities and tortures, facing even death. Two more exile phases followed in 1917 and 1918. Persecution and Extermination of the Communities of Livissi and Macri (1914‚Äì1918). Imprimerie Chaix, Rue Berg√®re, Paris 1919. p17 In 1917, families were sent in villages near Denizli, such as Acƒ±payam, through forced march of fifteen days, consisting mainly of the elderly, women and children, who had remained in the area. During that death march, the roads were strewn with bodies of dead children and the elderly who succumbed to hunger and fatigue. The exiles of the next year were no less harsh. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) Kayak√∂y was already nearly empty of its former inhabitants. When this war ended in September 1922, the few remaining Greeks of Livissi and Makri were forced to abandon their homes and embark on ships to Greece. Some of them founded the refugee settlement of Nea Makri (New Makri) outside of Athens. Many of the town's empty buildings were damaged in the 1957 Fethiye earthquake. Kayak√∂y today Today Kayak√∂y village serves as a museum and is a historical monument. Around 500 houses remain as ruins and are under the protection of the Turkish government, including two Greek Orthodox Churches, which remain the most important sites of the ghost town. There is a private museum on the history of the town. In the middle of the village stands a fountain that dates from the seventeenth century. Some sources claim that Kayak√∂y was adopted by UNESCO as a World Friendship and Peace Village. However this is officially untrue, and was most likely a rumor put out by a local tourist council. On 9 September 2014, the Turkish government announced plans to develop the village. It plans to offer a 49-year lease that will \\"partially open Kayak√∂y's archeological site to construction\\" and anticipated \\"construction of a hotel, as well as tourist facilities that will encompass one-third of the village.\\" Economy Villagers were mostly professional craftsmen. Currently the most important economic factor of the place is tourism. It is envisaged that the village will be partially restored. Inspiration Kayak√∂y, the fictional Eskibah√ße Kayak√∂y is presumed to be the inspiration behind \\"Eskibah√ße\\", the imaginary village chosen by Louis de Berni√®res as the setting of his 2004 novel Birds Without Wings. In 2014, Kayak√∂y also took centre stage in the closing scenes of Russell Crowe's film The Water Diviner.

In 1987 the find was reported by Sergei Kurzanov and later that year discussed by Halszka Osm√≥lska who suggested it could represent a specimen of the troodontid Borogovia.Osmolska, H., 1987, \\"Borogovia gracilicrus gen. et sp. n., a new troodontid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia\\", Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 32: 133-150 Later Osm√≥lska understood it was a species new to science.

It consists solely of the (left) metatarsus, the first discovered of an Asian troodontid. The first metatarsal is missing. The top of the fossil shows some damage that was originally somewhat inexpertly restored. Tochisaurus is a bipedal dinosaur. The metatarsus has a length of 242 millimetres, showing it was a relatively large troodontid. The second metatarsal, 222 millimetres long, is very reduced and narrow. The joint surface on top of the metatarsus is sloped forward and downward. Based on the partial fossils, Tochisaurus is thought to have been a member of the Troodontidae.

Theravada Buddhism is the official religion of Sri Lanka, with about 70.2% of the country's population as followers. Arahath Mahinda, son of Indian Buddhist emperor Ashoka, led the mission to Sri Lanka in 246 BCE when he converted the Sri Lankan king, Devanampiya Tissa, to Buddhism. Arahath Sanghamitra, daughter of King Ashoka, brought a sapling of the Bodhi tree in Buddha Gaya to Sri Lanka. She also established the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka. The Sapling of the Bodhi tree, known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in Anuradhapura by the King Devanampiya Tissa. From then on, the royal families had helped to encourage the spread of Buddhism, aiding Buddhist missionaries and building monasteries. Around 200 BCE, Buddhism became the official religion of Sri Lanka. The Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka in 4th century by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala. Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation. During the periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contacts with Myanmar and Thailand. Later on, however, Hindu and European colonial influences contributed to the decline of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The religion of Buddhism originally started in India, which is now the home to most of the Hinduism. In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as Upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Siamese Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy. By the mid-19th century, Buddhist leaders such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala started a successful national Buddhist movement for the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Hinduism Statue of Ravana at Koneswaram Temple. Hindus make up 12.6% of Sri Lanka's population. The origins of the religion are linked to early Tamil immigration into the island since the Chola conquests in the 10th century or even earlier with the Saivite devotional movement that swept South India. Hinduism in Sri Lanka is largely identified with the Tamil population and is concentrated in the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The population declined since the 1981 census on account of Sri Lankan Tamil emigration overseas and the repatriation of 'Indian' Tamils. A significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is Satguru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna. One of the mystics of the 20th century, Yogaswami was the official satguru and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is somewhat active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts while the Shaiva Siddhanta school of philosophy of Shaivism sect of hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the Shaiva Siddhanta and he was 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. Islam  Meeran Mosque in Galle. By the 7th century, Arab traders had controlled much of the trade on the Indian Ocean, including that of Sri Lanka's. Many of these traders settled down in Sri Lanka, encouraging the spread of Islam. However, when the Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka during the 16th century, many of the Arabs' Muslim descendants were persecuted, thus forcing them to migrate to the Central Highlands and to the east coast. In modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka have the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Today, about 9.7% of Sri Lankans adhere to Islam; mostly from the Moor and Malay ethnic communities on the island. Christianity St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo. According to a Christian tradition, Christianity was introduced _by Thomas the Apostle_ in Sri Lanka (as well as India) during the 1st century. The first evidence of Christianity in Sri Lanka is the account in the 6th-century Christian Topography, which says a community of Persian Nestorians lived on the island. The Anuradhapura cross, discovered in 1912, is probably a relic of this community. However, the population of Christians in Sri Lanka didn't dramatically increase until the arrival of Portuguese missionaries during the 15th century. In the 17th century, the Dutch took over Sri Lanka and Dutch missionaries were able to convert 21% of Sri Lanka's population to Christianity by 1622. In 1796 the Dutch were displaced by the British and in 1802 Ceylon became a Crown colony. Anglican and other Protestant missionaries arrived at Sri Lanka during the early 19th century, when the British took control of Sri Lanka from the Dutch. Under British rule missionary work was undertaken by English societies: Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, the CMS and SPG.Sri Lanka, Christianity in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church  2000  E. A. Livingstone The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses are also present in Sri Lanka. The percentage of Christians has slowly declined from the height of 13% in 1891 they were 12.6% and numbered were 302,000. In 2012 they numbered 1.509 million of 20,263 million or 7.4 percent. The percentage of Buddhists has declined from 66% to 59.3% and of Muslims from 7.5% 11 9.7% while the percentage of Hindus has fallen from 21% to 15.5%. By the 1980s, the population of Christians was mostly concentrated in the northwest of Sri Lanka and in the capital where they are 10% of the population. Of these Christians, about 58% are Roman Catholics and the rest are Anglicans, Methodists and other Protestants.

He believed in the unity of the Godhead and vehemently disagreed with any attempt at division of the personalities or personages of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Christian Church. He was opposed by Tertullian in his tract Against Praxeas (Adversus Praxean), and was influential in preventing the Roman Church from granting recognition to the New Prophecy. An early anti-Montanist, he is known only by virtue of Tertullian's book \\"Adversus Praxean\\". His name in the list of heresies appended to the \\"De Praescriptionibus\\" of that writer (an anonymous epitome of the lost \\"Syntagma\\" of Hippolytus) is a correction made by some ancient diorthotes for Noetus.A History of Christianity: Volume I: Beginnings to 1500: Revised Edition pg 144-146 By Kenneth S. Latourette Published by HarperCollins, 1975 , He taught Monarchian doctrine there, or at least a doctrine which Tertullian regarded as Monarchian: \\"Paracletum fugavit et patrem crucifixit.\\" Adversus Praxen 1,12, in: CC SL, 2 (E. Kroymann / E. Evans, 1954), p. 1159-1205 - \\"Having driven out the Paraclete, he [Praxeas] now crucified the Father\\". He was refuted, evidently by Tertullian himself, and gave an explanation or recantation in writing, the \\"carnal\\" as he affects to call them, which, when Tertullian wrote several years afterwards, was still in the hands of the authorities of the Carthaginian Church. Monarchianism had sprung up again, but Tertullian does not mention its leaders at Rome, and directs his whole argument against his old enemy Praxeas. But the arguments which he refutes are doubtless those of Epigonus and Cleomenes. There is little reason for thinking that Praxeas was a heresiarch, and less for identifying him with Noetus, or one of his disciples. He was very likely merely an adversary of the Montanists who used some quasi-Monarchian expressions when at Carthage, but afterwards revised them when he saw they might be misunderstood.

In the early 1970s, he formulated the Akaike information criterion (AIC). AIC is now widely used for model selection, which is commonly the most difficult aspect of statistical inference; additionally, AIC is the basis of a paradigm for the foundations of statistics. Akaike also made major contributions to the study of time series. As well, he had a large role in the general development of statistics in Japan. Akaike information criterion The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection. AIC was first formally described in a research paper by . As of October 2014, the paper had received more than 14000 citations in the Web of Science: making it the 73rd most-cited research paper of all time.Van Noordon R., Maher B., Nuzzo R.

(As of April 2016, the paper had received about 17000 citations.\\"Number of Citations\\", Hirotugu Akaike Memorial Website (Institute of Statistical Mathematics).) Nowadays, AIC has become common enough that it is often used without citing Akaike's 1974 paper.

The Fresh Air Society began in Michigan in 1902, and recently celebrated its 100-year anniversary in the summer of 2002. Tamarack operates three major camps, as well as teen trip programs. These camps are Maas, Agree, Kennedy, and Western, Alaska and Appalachian trips. Camp Maas Camp Maas, the major residential camp of Tamarack Camps, is located in Ortonville, Michigan, off Perryville Road. Camp Maas , named for the Detroit area's philanthropist Benard Maas, caters to children from grades 2 through 9.It is made up of eleven villages, ranging by age and gender. Each is led by a supervisor and cabins subdivided with 2 counselors each. As of 2016, 4 villages, The Nature Program (Or Teva), and Arts and Crafts have been redone with A/C and fine upgrades. The villages, which are named for the sole or major donors of that specific village, are: Brighton (Junior) Side: *Applebaum - 2nd and 3rd grade boys *Shiffman - 2nd and 3rd grade girls *Deroy - 4th and 5th grade boys *Fishman - 4th and 5th grade girls Mid-side: *Levison - 6th grade boys *Charach-Sheruth - 6th grade girls *Hermelin - 7th grade boys *Berman - 7th grade girls Senior Side: *Robinson Pioneer - 8th grade co-ed *Groseberg Ruach - 8th grade co-ed *Kaufman Specialty - 9th grade co-ed *Teen Leadership Village - 12th grade co- ed As a Jewish camp, Tamarack campers participate in Jewish programming focusing on Israel, the Torah, Jewish holidays and the Holocaust. Prayer services take place on Shabbat evening and morning. All meals served at the Tamarack Camp facilities are prepared and served in accordance with the Jewish Kosher Dietary Laws and are under rabbinic supervision. Agree Outpost Located in the woods of Canada, the Agree Outpost Camp is home to kids going into 10th and 11th grade's who have a love for camping. It is limited in number and strives to cultivate a sense of community. Agree is located between Wawa, Ontario and White River, Ontario. There is one 6 week session for both boys girls, this is a coed program. Agree consists of an eight-day hiking trip, and a kayaking trip. Each camper receives a canoe paddle to personalize as a memento of the summer and to use on the canoeing trip. The first week of camp consists of programs like camp craft that promotes the Leave No Trace approach, canoe skills and other community building activities as well as plenty of time to work on paddles or other projects. When at the base camp, campers pitch in after breakfast to keep Melvin and Matilda (the outhouses) smelling fresh, kitchen duties and other chores that keep camp running. Agree is also home to the Teen Tripping program, in which staff going into their freshman year of college train to be outpost staff by facilitating trips of campers from Mass' Pioneer village. The trippers also go on multiple trips without any campers, which allow them to hone their staffing skills. In 2011 Teen Tripping was canceled but, in 2015 the program was reinstated. Camp Kennedy In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is Camp Kennedy. Kennedy is the site of Governor Green's former hunting lodge. It is located off H-58 in Shingleton, near Munising. Like Agree, Kennedy is limited in number to make an unforgettable experience. Kennedy has only one program, for 9th and at one time 10th graders. Kennedy campers go on several trips, including a hiking trip at the Porcupine Mountains in the northwestern Upper Peninsula and a canoeing trip in Obatanga Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada. Western Tenth graders have the option to go on a Western Trip. This trip is 5 weeks long, and travels by charter bus through the country. Western campers go on 2 backcountry trips; one in the Rocky Mountains and one in Yosemite National Park. Western trips also travel and hike through places such as Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Badlands National Park and other locations. They visit cities such as Aspen, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Alaska Eleventh graders can attend a trip to Alaska. This trip is seven weeks long, and travels by charter bus. The first week is in Canada and goes to Banff to do day hikes in the area, after which the campers take a ferry to Alaska. A staple of the trip is hiking the Chilkoot Trail. Though the itinerary changes each summer, previous groups have hiked the Pinnell Mountain Trail and Kesugi Ridge. Ice climbing on the Matanuska Glacier, salmon fishing in Seward and a kayak trip other such activities are common on the Alaskan trip itinerary. The trip has its final banquet and debriefing at Camp Kennedy. Appalachian Adventure Campers on the Appalachian Adventure Trip will create memories and friendships that last a lifetime while exploring stunning state and national parks, including Acadia National Park in Maine, Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, and the Great Smoky Mountain National Park in North Carolina. In addition to the many great day hikes, campers will visit Niagara Falls and go on a four-day backpacking trip. Campers will become more self- reliant and as a group they will plan and cook their meals and help to determine their daily hikes. These experiences will help develop their leadership skills and confidence. The trip encourages an atmosphere of face- to-face communication as it excludes modern devices, such as cell phones, where campers will unplug and experience nature at its best. Other Tamarack programs Formerly located at Camp Maas, the Pine Forest day camp catered to younger children in the area. Pine Forest campers used the facilities at Maas until it was closed in 2007. Recently closed, the Silverman Village was home to campers with behavior or emotional difficulties. Silverman Village is a separate property with its own lodge and waterfront, but Silverman campers used many of the Camp Maas amenities. The Butzel Conference Center, renovated between December 2008-March 2009, is made up of three guest house cabins and a central lodge for meetings and groups. The popular boy band T5 made their name with their hit single pump it up tamarack camps in the summer of 2009.

She was born in the small town of Krakƒós in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania)http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/gorshman-shira to an extremely poor family and began working at a young age. She was able to achieve a basic education, and like many Lithuanian Jews was multi-lingual. She was self- supporting by the time she was 14, and had her first daughter when she was 16. At a young age, Gorshman moved to Kaunas, where she became active in Zionist organizations. In 1924 she moved to Palestinehttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07713.html as a pioneer, and there worked doing heavy labor with Gdud HaAvoda, a short- lived, left-wing Zionist organization intended to create mobile labor pools for the nascent Jewish colonies in Palestine. In Gdud ha-Avodah, members worked and lived together, pooling all income, while completing major construction projects such as road-building. In 1928, with others from this group, Gorshman returned to the Soviet Union to build another utopian commune, this one an agricultural colony in Crimea. Her much later memoir, In di shpurn fun gdud ha-avodah (In the Footsteps of Gdud ha-Avodah), published in 1998, describes both communal undertakings. In Crimea Gorshman met Mendl Gorshman, a painter, and they moved to Moscow together. There she began writing. Her stories were published in Yiddish newspapers in Kiev and Moscow, and in numerous anthologies. Gorhsman remained in Moscow for many years, writing short stories and memoirs. \\"The central hero in her work is the woman as a folk-figure in this uneasy historical epoch,\\" wrote The Forward in her obituary. \\"This particular figure, through whom the writer embodied the important problems of reality, always appears in a time when the foundations of old forms of social organization are broken, and new relationships and alliances in social life and in the life of a new kind of family are being constructed.\\" Gorshman moved to Israel in 1990, where she continued to write and publish her stories. She died in Ashqelon in 2001. Her books include Der koyekh fun lebn (The Power of Life), 33 noveln (33 Stories), Lebn un likht (Life and Light), Yontef in mitn vokh (Mid-Week Holiday), Oysdoyer (Resistance), Khanes shof un rinder (Chana‚Äôs Sheep and Cows), Ikh hob lib arumforn (I Love to Wander), Vi tsum ershtn mol (As If For the First Time), On a gal (Without Malice), and the aforementioned In di shpurn fun gdud ha- avodah.

He has been called \\"Father of Japanese Botany\\".Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Makino Tomitar≈ç\\" in . He was one of the first Japanese botanists to work extensively on classifying Japanese plants using the system developed by Linnaeus. His research resulted in documenting 50,000 specimens, many of which are represented in his Makino's Illustrated Flora of Japan. Despite having dropped out of grammar school, he would eventually attain a Doctor of Science degree, and his birthday is remembered as Botany Day in Japan. Early life Tomitaro Makino was born in Sakawa, K≈çchi to a prestigious sake brewer. His parents died during his early childhood, and he was raised mainly by his grandmother. Though he dropped out of school after two years, he cultivated a strong interest in English, geography, and especially in botany. In 1880, he became a teacher at the primary school in his hometown, where he published his first academic botanical paper. In 1884, he moved to Tokyo to pursue his botanical interests at the University of Tokyo where he worked with Ry≈çkichi Yatabe. He married in 1890 and would later have 13 children. Career In 1887, Makino started to publish an academic journal of botany. In 1936, he published Makino Book of Botany, a six volume text on botany, in which he describes 6000 species, 1000 of which he discovered. He is best known for his Makino's Illustrated Flora of Japan, published 1940, which is still used as an encyclopedic text today. In 1948, he was invited to the Imperial Palace to lecture on botany for Emperor Hirohito. Legacy In total, Makino named over 2500 plants, including 1000 new species and 1500 new varieties. In addition, he discovered about 600 new species. After his death in 1957, his collection of approximately 400,000 specimens was donated to Tokyo Metropolitan University. The Makino Herbarium in Tokyo and the Makino Botanical Garden on Mount Godai in his native K≈çchi were named in his honor. He was also named an Honorary Citizen of Tokyo.

It was released on April 4, 2006 via Purple Ribbon Records and Virgin Records, a follow-up to Deliverance. Unlike the previous installments, it is the first album to have very little input from Timbaland, with production being handled and provided by Mr. Collipark and Organized Noize, and Big Boi serving as executive producer on the album. The guest appearances featured on the album were fellow rappers Cool Breeze, Duddy Ken, Killer Mike and the Ying Yang Twins, and singers Frankie J, Scar and Sleepy Brown. The album received a generally positive reception but critics found it uneven in its amalgam of mainstream hip-hop songs and serious internal tracks. The Charm debuted at number 9 on the Billboard 200 with 51,000 copies sold in its first week released and spawned two singles: \\"Ms. New Booty\\" and \\"Heat It Up\\".  Critical reception  The Charm garnered favorable reviews but music critics were divided by Bubba's decision to leave Timbaland for Big Boi and change his production and lyrical content. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 18 reviews. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club praised the production work from Organized Noize and Bubba for still being able to deliver strong philosophical lyrics with bits of humor in them, concluding that \\"Sparxxx will probably never move enough units to justify his early billing as rap's next great white hope, but creatively, he continues to exceed even the loftiest expectations\\". Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times also praised Organized Noize's production for making Bubba sound commercially viable while allowing him to add more lyrical depth to his repertoire. Justin Cober-Lake of Stylus Magazine felt that the change in production from Deliverance didn't hamper Bubba's ability to continue delivering aggressive lyricism over club tracks. Pitchfork writer Tom Breihan, despite finding some tracks that demean women, praised the upbeat and energetic production for allowing Bubba to lace them with introspective lyrics and funny punchlines, concluding that he \\"wants to become a pop star, and he probably won't succeed, but he hasn't lost his heart\\". Justin Monroe of Vibe said that despite mainstream tracks like \\"Run Away\\" and \\"Ms. New Booty\\", Bubba maintains his tendency to bring sharp lyricism to his rhymes, concluding that \\"While his hedged bets reduce both risk and reward, his rural raps restore at least some of the magic in The Charm\\". Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews felt a little disappointed with the album, finding most of the material filled with either both strong production and tight lyricism or sub-standard beats and deflated delivery, concluding that \\"Bubba still has that potential and does come with some good tracks, but it's a short album you can finish in under an hour that compared to his prior works sounds and feels vaguely unsatisfying\\". Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly was mixed towards the record, saying that crunk tracks like \\"Ms. New Booty\\" dour the experience after tracks like \\"Ain't Life Grand\\" exhibit Bubba's true talents as a rapper. Jeff Vrabel of PopMatters felt that the lack of Timbaland and presence of Big Boi as executive producer throughout the album allowed for dull and meandering beats for Bubba to use to deliver uninspired brag raps without any creativity, calling it \\"one of year's most disappointing belly-flops\\". Peter Relic of Rolling Stone criticized the record's production and Bubba's lyricism for feeling generic and lacking in charm like his previous efforts, concluding that \\"Though newly aligned with Big Boi's Purple Ribbon stable, Bubba Sparxxx appears only able to follow for now\\".

He founded the German journal Der Monat in 1948 and, from 1958 to 1991, edited Encounter, one of many journals revealed to have been secretly funded by the CIA through the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). From 1950 to 1963, the CIA covertly supported the CCF and a number of its publications, including Encounter. While Lasky did admit he knew of the CIA's role as a funding source prior to its reveal in 1966, rumors that he was a CIA agent have not been substantiated by evidence.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 44. \\"And what of Melvin Lasky? Was he not an ideal candidate to join the swelling ranks of the CIA? It would later be alleged that Lasky had become an agent. This he consistently denied. Like Thaxter in [Saul Bellow's novel] Humboldt's Gift, the rumour 'greatly added to his mysteriousness.' His constant presence at the forefront of the CIA's cultural Cold War for the next two decades would not go unnoticed.\\" In 1947, Lasky wrote an influential document that made the case for a cultural Cold War intended to win over European intellectuals. He was the older brother of Floria Lasky, an influential entertainment lawyer, and Joyce Lasky Reed, the President and founder of the Faberg√© Arts Foundation and former Director of European Affairs at the American Enterprise Institute.  Early life and World War II  Lasky was born in The Bronx of New York City and schooled at City College of New York, where he wrote for the student newspaper, The Campus.Melvin J. Lasky, Media Warfare: The Americanization of Language (Vol. 3) (Transaction Publishers: 2005), p. 274. He continued his education at University of Michigan and Columbia University. He briefly considered himself a Trotskyist but at 22 moved away from communism entirely because of disgust with Stalin. He began working for the New Leader in New York and was editor from 1942‚Äì1943. Lasky wrote an editorial during this time criticizing the Allies for failing to address The Holocaust directly in their World War II efforts. He served in World War II as a combat historian for the 7th Army. Lasky remained in Germany after the war, making his home in Berlin, where he worked for American military governor Lucius D. Clay. During this time, Lasky was an outspoken critic of the United States' earlier reluctance to intervene to stop the genocide of European Jews. Germany and Der Monat After Lasky left the Army, he became a German correspondent for the New Leader and for the Partisan Review.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 28. In 1947, Lasky sent a message to General Lucius D. Clay which became known as \\"The Melvin Lasky Proposal\\". In this document, Lasky argued for a more aggressive campaign of cultural and psychological operations to combat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. It reads: > The time-honored U.S. formula of 'shed light and the people will find their > own way' exaggerated the possibilities in Germany (and in Europe) for an > easy conversion . . . It would be foolish to expect to wean a primitive > savage away from his conviction in mysterious jungle-herbs simply by the > dissemination of modern scientific and medical information . . . We have not > succeeded in combatting the variety of factors‚Äîpolitical, psychological, > cultural‚Äîwhich work against U.S. foreign policy, and in particular against > the success of the Marshall Plan in Europe.quoted in: Saunders, Cultural > Cold War (1999), p. 29. Soon after, Lasky received Marshall Plan funding to create the German-language journal Der Monat (\\"The Month\\"), airlifted into Berlin during the 1948 Soviet blockade. Its purpose was to support U.S. foreign policy and win over German intellectuals views that were socially progressive but anti- communist.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 30. \\"The result was Der Monat, a monthly magazine designed to construct an ideological bridge between German and American intellectuals and, as explicitly set forth by Lasky, to ease the passage of American foreign policy interests by supporting 'the general objectives of U.S. policy in Germany and Europe. Set up with General Clay's backing on 1 October 1948, under Lasky's editorship, it was printed initially into Munich and airlifted into Berlin aboard the allied cargo planes on which the city depended during the blockade.\\" Der Monat continued as a prominent highbrow Germanophone journal, incorporating essays and articles from many Western European and North America intellectuals as well as dissidents from the Eastern Bloc. Contributors included Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Franz Borkenau, Thomas Mann, Arthur Koestler, Raymond Aron, Ignazio Silone, Heinrich B√∂ll, Hans Sahl, Max Frisch, T. S. Eliot, Saul Bellow, Milovan Djilas, Richard L√∂wenthal, Peter de Mendelssohn, Hilde Spiel, and Hermann Kesten. The journal also received funding from the Ford Foundation and the CIA.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 30. \\"Across the years, Der Monat was financed through 'confidential funds' of the Marshall Plan, then from the coffers of the Central Intelligence Agency, then with Ford Foundation money, and then again with CIA dollars. For its financing alone, the magazine was absolutely a product‚Äîand an exemplar of‚ÄîAmerican Cold War strategies in the cultural field.\\" Lasky helped to found the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) at a 1950 conference he organized in West Berlin. Frank Wisner, of the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination, criticized Lasky for making American sponsorship of the conference too obvious.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 85. \\"Wisner returned to the problem of Melvin Lasky, whose peacock presence throughout the Berlin conference had so infuriated him. His earlier command to have Lasky removed from centre-stage having been so blatantly ignored, he wrote an angry internal memo, 'Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom: Activities of Melvin Lasky,' stating that Lasky's visibility was 'a major blunder and was recognized as such by our best friends in the State Department . . .'\\" Although temporarily expelled from the CCF by Wisner, Lasky was included again in 1953 as a member of the \\"Tri-Magazine Editorial Committee\\", which established policies and topics for Der Monat, Preuves, and Encounter.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 217.\\" As part of this committee, Lasky argued that these magazines must express some dissent against the American government or risk being exposed as propaganda.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 218\\" Der Monat was sold to Die Zeit and temporarily ceased publication in 1971. From 1978 until 1987, Der Monat (now titled Der Monat (Neue Folge) or simply Der Monat (N. F.)) re-surfaced as a Die Zeit quarterly without Lasky's involvement as editor-in-chief, but Lasky remained publisher along with his German wife Helga Hegewisch, while the journal's new editor-in- chief was SPD politician and later German Minister of Culture Michael Naumann. A new economy and marketing publication called Der Monat appearing in Germany since 1997 has nothing to do with the former journal's socio-political concept and design. Encounter In the English-speaking world, Lasky was best known for his role as Editor-in-Chief of Encounter. He succeeded Irving Kristol, the original editor and founder, in 1958 and helped turn the young magazine into one of the most highly regarded periodicals in Europe. Lasky steered Encounter to represent the point of view of the anti-Communist, anti-Totalitarian Left, and reportedly favored the journal's political side over its more purely cultural endeavors. He remained at Encounter until the magazine folded in 1991. Both Encounter and Der Monat had long received funding from the CIA- sponsored Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). Lasky denied knowledge of CIA funding in a 1966 letter (written jointly with Irving Kristol and Stephen Spender) to The New York Times.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 378. \\"Spender added his signature to that of Kristol and Lasky in a letter to the New York Times, dated 10 May 1966, which stated: 'We know of no \\"indirect\\" benefactions. . . we are our own masters and part of nobody's propaganda,' and defended the 'independent record of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in defending writers and artists in both East and West against misdemeanors of all governments including that of the US.\\" However, Lasky confessed privately to Frank Kermode (recruited as editor in 1965) that he had known about CIA funding for some years.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p. 384. \\"This was the moment of Lasky's soi-disant confession: he admitted to Kermode that he had known of CIA support for some years now, but that he could not possibly say this publicly.\\" In 1967, Ramparts and other publications revealed the CIA's relationship to the CCF and its publications, embarrassing many who were involved.  Other activities and private life  Lasky's grave in Berlin Lasky was the author of many books including Utopia and Revolution, Voices in the Revolution, On the Barricades and Off, and The Language of Journalism. He was married twice, to Brigitte Lasky (n√©e Newiger) with whom he had two children, Vivienne Lasky and Oliver Lasky, and to German novelist Helga Hegewisch. Lasky died in May 2004 of a heart ailment. A portion of Lasky's unpublished memoirs appears in News from the Republic of Letters, as well as in The Berlin Journal, Spring, 2007.  Lasky Center for Transatlantic Studies  In October 2010, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich opened the Lasky Center for Transatlantic Studies, a research center associated with the university's American Studies department. The Lasky Center is home to Lasky's personal library and papers. Its director is Christof Mauch.

In Venezuela it is known as cajaro and in Brazil it is known as pirarara, stemming from the Tupi language words pir√° and arara. It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.  Fossil species  Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene and only are known from fossil remains. P. nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P. acreornatus is known from the Solim√µes Formation, Acre, Brazil.Paleobiology Database This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5 million years. (video) Redtail catfish swimming in an aquarium. Description Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about in length and about in weight.Fishing. World Records: Phractocephalus hemioliopterus. Retrieved 9 May 2013 However this is exceptionally rare and most do not approach this size. They average in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides and characteristic orange- red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw and two pairs on the lower jaw. Distribution and habitat The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia and Brazil. It is found only in fresh water and inhabits larger rivers, streams and lakes.Seriously Fish Relationship to humans Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56 kg (123 lb 7 oz). It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.Axelrod, Herbert R. (1996). Exotic Tropical Fishes. T.F.H. Publications. In Thailand it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia and alligator gar. In some places it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos when it sank. =In the aquarium= Phractocephalus hemioliopterus in aquarium The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly and require tanks of at least when fully adult. Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species. It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish such as tetras, and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium. The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish such as the tiger shovelnose Pseudoplatystoma sp. through the use of hormones in attempts to create a viable food fish, the Tiger redtail catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.

This individual possesses the complex knowledge and skills necessary to provide patient care and transportation. Paramedics function as part of a comprehensive EMS response, under medical oversight. Paramedics perform interventions with the basic and advanced equipment typically found on an ambulance. The paramedic is a link from the scene into the health care system. One of the eligibility requirements for state certification or licensure requires successful completion of a nationally accredited Paramedic program at the certificate or associate degree level.http://www.ems.gov/pdf/EMSScope.pdf Each state varies in requirements to practice as a paramedic, and not all states require licensure. History Prior to 1970, ambulances were staffed with advanced first-aid level responders who were frequently referred to as \\"ambulance attendants.\\" There was little regulation or standardized training for those staffing these early emergency response vehicles or the required equipment carried inside. Around 1966 in a published report entitled \\"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society\\", (known in EMS trade as the White Paper) medical researchers began to reveal, to their astonishment, that soldiers who were seriously wounded on the battlefields of Vietnam had a better survival rate than those individuals who were seriously injured in motor vehicle accidents on California freeways. Early research attributed these differences in outcome to a number of factors, including comprehensive trauma care, rapid transport to designated trauma facilities, and a new type of medical corpsman; one who was trained to perform certain critical advanced medical procedures such as fluid replacement and airway management, which allowed the victim to survive the journey to definitive care. During the 1960s a Los Angeles cardiologist named Walter S. Graf became concerned about the lack of actual medical care being given to coronary patients during emergency transportation to a hospital. In 1969, while serving as president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Heart Association, he created a \\"mobile critical care unit\\", consisting of a Chevy van, a registered nurse, and a portable defibrillator. The same year his patient Kenneth Hahn, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, persuaded the Supervisors to approve a pilot program to train county firefighters as \\"Mobile Intensive Care Paramedics\\". A change in state law was necessary to allow personnel other than doctors and nurses to render emergency medical care. Hahn recruited two state legislators who wrote the Wedworth- Townsend Paramedic Act of 1970, signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan on July 15, 1970, despite opposition from doctors, nurses, and attorneys. Paramedic training began the next month at the Freeman Memorial Hospital under Graf's direction. It was the first nationally accredited paramedic training program in the United States. Other communities in the United States were also experimenting with advanced emergency medical care. Pittsburgh's branch of Freedom House paramedics are credited as the first emergency medical technician (EMT) trainees in the United States. Pittsburgh's Peter Safar is referred to as the father of CPR. In 1967, he began training unemployed African-American men in what later became Freedom House Ambulance Service, the first paramedic squadron in the United States. Almost simultaneously, and completely independent from one another, experimental programs began in three U.S. centers; Miami, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and Los Angeles, California. Each was aimed at determining the effectiveness of using firefighters to perform many of these same advanced medical skills in the pre- hospital setting in the civilian world. Many in the senior administration of the fire departments were initially quite opposed to this concept of 'firemen giving needles', and actively resisted and attempted to cancel pilot programs more than once. In Seattle, the Medic One program at Harborview Medical Center and the University of Washington Medical Center, started by Leonard Cobb, M.D., began training firefighters in CPR in 1970. Dr. Eugene Nagel trained city of Miami firefighters as the first U.S. paramedics to use invasive techniques and portable defibrillators with telemetry in 1967. Dr. Jonathan Wasserberger helped actualize the teaching curriculum associated with this innovative training in 1973.Wasserberger, J. (1974). \\"The EMT's Training and Future.\\" In Findeiss, C.J. (ed). Emergency Medical Care, Symposia Specialists. New York, International Medical Book Corp., 297-304 Elsewhere, the novel approach to pre-hospital care was also evolving. Portland's Leonard Rose, M.D., in cooperation with Buck Ambulance Service, instituted a cardiac training program and began training other paramedics. Baltimore's R. Adams Cowley, the father of trauma medicine, devised the concept of integrated emergency care, designing the first civilian Medevac helicopter program and campaigning for a statewide EMS system. Other communities that were early participants in the development of paramedicine included Jacksonville, Florida, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (in an expanded program), and Seattle, Washington (in an expanded program). In 1972 the first civilian emergency medical helicopter transport service, Flight for Life opened in Denver, Colorado. Emergency medical helicopters were soon put into service elsewhere in the United States. It is now routine to have paramedic and nurse-staffed EMS helicopters in most major metropolitan areas. The vast majority of these aeromedical services are utilized for critical care air transport (inter- hospital) in addition to emergency medical services (pre-hospital). A television producer, working for producer Jack Webb, of Dragnet and Adam-12 fame, was in Los Angeles' UCLA Harbor Medical Center, doing background research for a proposed new TV show about doctors, when he happened to encounter these 'firemen who spoke like doctors and worked with them'. This novel idea would eventually evolve into the Emergency! television series, which ran from 1972‚Äì1977, portraying the exploits of a new group called 'paramedics'. The show captured the imagination of emergency services personnel, the medical community, and the general public. When the show first aired in 1972, there were only 6 full-fledged paramedic units operating in 3 pilot programs (Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle) in the whole of the United States. No one had ever heard the term 'paramedic'; indeed, it is reported that one of the show's actors was initially concerned that the 'para' part of the term might involve jumping out of airplanes! By the time the program ended production in 1977, there were paramedics operating in every state. The show's technical advisor was a pioneer of paramedicine, James O. Page, then a Battalion Chief responsible for the Los Angeles County Fire Department 'paramedic' program, but who would go on to help establish other paramedic programs in the U.S., and to become the founding publisher of the Journal of Emergency Medical Services. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the field continued to evolve, although in large measure, on a local level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what it was felt that the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in- service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set was in a state of constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would go in and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment. Physicians began to take more interest in paramedics from a research perspective as well. By about 1990, most of the 'trendiness' in pre- hospital emergency care had begun to disappear, and was replaced by outcome- based research and evidence-based medicine; the gold standard for the rest of medicine. This research began to drive the evolution of the practice of both paramedics and the emergency physicians who oversaw their work; changes to procedures and protocols began to occur only after significant outcome-based research demonstrated their need. Paramedics became increasingly accountable for their errors as well, and these too led to changes in procedure. Such changes affected everything from simple procedures, such as CPR, to changes in drug protocols and other advanced procedures. As the profession of paramedic grew, some of its members actually went on to become not just research participants, but researchers in their own right, with their own projects and journal publications. Image:MS1 on stretcher.jpgAt the ER Image:Immobilized Patient.jpgManaging a trauma patient Image:Bicycle Paramedics.JPGBicycle paramedics, Los Angeles, California  Education  The education and skills required of paramedics vary by state. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) designs and specifies a National Standard Curriculum for EMT training. Most paramedic education and certifying programs require that a student is at a minimum educated and trained to the National Standard Curriculum for a particular skill level. The National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is a private, central certifying entity whose primary purpose is to maintain a national standard. NREMT also provides certification information for paramedics who relocate to another state. Paramedic education programs can be as short as six months or as long as four years. An associate degree program is two years, often administered through a community college. Degree programs are an option, with two-year associate degree programs being most common, although four-year bachelor's degree programs exist. In contrast to commonwealth countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, generally the minimum education is a two- to three-year degree at an accredited college or university for the entry-level paramedic, with four-year or even graduate degrees becoming the preferred credential in such jurisdictions. Many paramedic programs in the United States are through adult career and technical schools that provide a certificate of completion upon completion of the program. All programs must meet the current national standard curriculum. The institutions offering such training vary greatly across the country in terms of programs and requirements, and each must be examined by the prospective student in terms of both content and requirements where they hope to practice. Regardless of education, all students must meet the same state requirements to take the certification exams, including the National Registry exams which consist of a psychomotor skills practical examination and a Computer Based Testing (CBT). In addition, most locales require that paramedics attend ongoing refresher courses and continuing medical education to maintain their license or certification. In addition to state and national registry certifications, most paramedics are required to be certified in pediatric advanced life support, pediatric prehospital care or pediatric emergencies for the prehospital provider, prehospital trauma life support; international trauma life support, and advanced cardiac life support. These additional requirements have education and certification from organizations such as the American Heart Association. Credentialling and oversight In the U.S., the community college training model remains the most common, although some university-based paramedic education models exist. These variations in both educational approaches and standards has led to tremendous differences from one location to another. There may be situations in which a group of people with 120 hours of training, and another group (in another jurisdiction) with university degrees, were both calling themselves 'paramedics'. There were some efforts made to resolve these discrepancies. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) along with National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) attempted to create a national standard by means of a common licensing examination, but to this day, this has never been universally accepted by U.S. States, and issues of licensing reciprocity for paramedics continue, although if an EMT obtains certification through NREMT (NREMT-P, NREMT-I, NREMT-B), this is accepted by 40 of the 50 states in the United States. This confusion was further complicated by the introduction of complex systems of gradation of certification, reflecting levels of training and skill, but these too were, for the most part, purely local. To clarify, at least at a national level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is the federal organization with authority to administer the EMS system, defines the various titles given to prehospital medical workers based on the level of care they provide. They are EMT-P (Paramedic), EMT-I (Intermediate), EMT-B (Basic), and First Responders. While providers at all levels are considered emergency medical technicians, the term \\"paramedic\\" is most properly used in the United States to refer only to those providers who are EMT-P's. Apart from this distinction, the only truly common trend that would evolve was the relatively universal acceptance of the term 'emergency medical technician' being used to denote a lower level of training and skill than a 'paramedic'. Changes in procedures also included the manner in which the work of paramedics was overseen and managed. In the earliest days of the field, medical control and oversight was direct and immediate, with paramedics calling into a local hospital and receiving orders for every individual procedure or drug. This still occurs in some jurisdictions, but is becoming very rare. As physicians began to build a bond of trust with paramedics, and experience in working with them, their confidence levels also rose. Increasingly, in many jurisdictions day-to-day operations moved from direct and immediate medical control to pre-written protocols or 'standing orders', with the paramedic typically only calling in for direction after the options in the standing orders had been exhausted. Medical oversight became driven more by chart review or rounds, than by step by step control during each call. Examples of procedures performed by paramedics Just as with the use of medications, the other medical procedures and procedures permitted to paramedics varies broadly from one jurisdiction to another. It is not possible to provide a complete list of every skill and procedure paramedics are good at. =Procedures by certification level= These are the minimum skills recommendations put forth by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and endorsed by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians. Each State, region, and agencies may add to or deduct from this list as they see medically fit. =Skills common to all EMTs and paramedics= * Assessment and evaluation of general incident scene safety. * Effective verbal and written reporting skills (Charting). * Routine medical equipment maintenance procedures. * Routine radio operating procedures. * Triage of patients in a mass casualty incident. * Emergency vehicle operation. =Medications administered= Paramedics in many jurisdictions administer a variety of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that is beating too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. The list may include sympathomimetics like norepinephrine or dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiogenic shock. Diabetics often benefit from the fact that paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Ketamine or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac. This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.  Employment  Paramedics are employed by various public and private emergency service providers. These include private ambulance services, fire departments, public safety or police departments, hospitals, law enforcement agencies, the military, and municipal EMS agencies in addition to and independent from police or fire departments, also known as a 'third service'. Paramedics may respond to medical incidents in an ambulance, rescue vehicle, helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, motorcycle, or fire suppression apparatus. Paramedics may also be employed in medical fields that do not involve transportation of patients. Such positions include offshore drilling platforms, phlebotomy, blood banks, research labs, educational fields, law enforcement and hospitals. Aside from their traditional roles, paramedics may also participate in one of many specialty arenas: * Critical care transporters move patients by ground ambulance or aircraft between medical treatment facilies. This may be done to allow a patient to receive a higher level of care in a more specialized facility. Registered Nurses with training in Emergency Nursing may work with paramedics in these settings. Paramedics participating in this role generally also provide care not traditionally administered by Paramedics who respond to 911 calls. Examples of this are blood transfusions, intra-aortic balloon pumps, and mechanical ventilators. * Tactical paramedics work on law enforcement teams (SWAT). These medics, usually from the EMS agency in the area, are commissioned and trained to be tactical operators in law enforcement, in addition to paramedic duties. Advanced medical personnel perform dual roles as operator and medic on the teams. Such an officer is immediately available to deliver advanced emergency care to other injured officers, suspects, innocent victims and bystanders. The advantage to having dual role paramedics is that medical care is provided almost immediately. * Hospital paramedics are sometimes employed in either of the outpatient and inpatient areas. Emergency departments employ the largest number of paramedics working inside of hospitals. Considered ambulatory care, emergency departments are classified as an outpatient area of a hospital. Depending on their scope of practice and job description within the emergency department, paramedics are allowed to triage and assess incoming patients, provide analysis and interpretation of both labs and EKGs, intravenous therapy, drug administration, transportation of emergency department patients to diagnostic testing or their inpatient rooms. Paramedics are also employed indireclty in the inpatient areas of hospitals as well. Paramedics are utilized in intensive care units assisting other licensed staff with ICU patients and they are utilized on high risk transport teams by providing transportation, continuation of care and assisting in sedation of patients during minimally invasive and invasive procedures at the bedside and in diagnostic areas. Because of the nature and purpose of these teams, paramedics work closely with radiology, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine and anesthesiology. Salary The salary of a paramedic in the US varies. The mean average is $30,000, with the lowest 10% earning under $20,000 and the top 10% earning over $50,000, considerably less than the salaries of paramedics in Canada. Factors such as education and location of the paramedic's practice influence the salary. Paramedic supervisors and managers may make between $60,000- $80,000, depending on location.

Beginnings On April 18, 1648, around forty five hundred Dutch soldiers and five artillery pieces marched south, coming from Recife. On their way south, they eliminated a small defensive outpost on the village of Barreta. The few survivors regrouped at the village of Arraial Novo do Bom Jesus, headquarters of the Pernambucana resistance, where they reported the incident. Commanders of the resistance called for a march of 2,000 combatants towards the Jaboat√£o dos Guararapes (\\"Drums\\" in native language) Hills against an enemy better equipped and in superior numbers. Forces involved in the conflict =Dutch Forces= Sigismund van Schoppe, the Dutch commander, experienced in Brazilian campaigns where he used to fight since he was a Captain, intended to proceed to the South, targeting initially the village of Muribeca - a key point to reach Santo Agostinho Cape. His plan was to isolate the resistance troops from reserves and supplies that might have come from the South, and then have them destroyed by his superior force. =Portuguese Forces= Francisco Barreto de Meneses, the Portuguese commander (Mestre-de- Campo-General) had recently arrived to that region and decided to follow his subordinate's suggestions: they would go to their enemy instead, and force the Dutch troops into a decisive encounter. This was a bold move, considering they were in half the numbers of their adversaries, and had no artillery. At this point, information sent from the fallen Barreta outpost had come to them, and they knew exactly the size and equipment available to the Dutch forces. Battle At the beginning of the fight, Von Schoppe may have realized that he would have to fight a much stronger force than the one he had defeated in Barreta. Also, the opportunity to choose the proper place to meet a superior force was crucial for the Portuguese victory. The terrain was damp, mostly swamp, and did not allow for the classical in-line formation of European armies. Forced into a narrow front, the Dutch's advantages had been almost nullified. The Portuguese forces were divided in five ter√ßos commanded by Barreto de Menezes, Fernandes Vieira, Filipe Camar√£o and Henrique Dias. Andr√© Vidal de Negreiros was the commander of the fifth ter√ßo kept in reserve. Barreto de Menezes concentrated his efforts on the space between the East face and the main swamp. In the center, Fernandes Vieira's ter√ßo had the mission to penetrate as deep possible into the enemy's formation. On the right flank, Filipe Camar√£o would use the long experience of the natives in fighting in the swamped terrain. Henrique Dias would use the \\"ter√ßo dos negros\\" (black's ter√ßo) to keep the Dutch from advancing and then avoiding the spear head advance from being flanked. Limited by the lack of space for maneuver, Von Schoppe concentrated most of his forces on the space between the east face and the main swamp. Three of his battalions were face-to-face against the ter√ßos of Vieira and Camar√£o, while two other battalions of his would try to flank the advancing forces and would be contained by the ter√ßo of Dias. Two Dutch battalions would not be allowed to maneuver and would stay back, out of action. The closed space also did not allow the use of firearms to its full potential and maximized the use of native weapons and the short sword. Diogo Lopes Santiago, a possible eye witness of that event, gives his gruesome account of that encounter: \\"(...) and as they ran away, our soldiers would follow them with their swords with cuts and slashes, cutting legs, arms, heads, some killing, others wounding badly, laying on the field bodies without arms, trunks without heads (...) holding their sword in the middle of those squadrons, piles of enemies, giving spokes to some and to others death, showing the sword, tinted in blood\\".

It stars Brigitte Mira, Ingrid Caven, Karlheinz B√∂hm and Margit Carstensen. The film was shot over 20 days between February and March 1975 in Frankfurt am Main.Braad Thomsen, Fassbinder, p. 332 The film drew on both Sirk-style melodramas and Weimar era workers' films to tell a political coming of age story. Synopsis Emma K√ºsters (Mira), a working- class woman, lives in Frankfurt with her son and daughter-in-law. While she is doing outreach work assembling electric plugs, Frau K√ºsters learns that her husband Hermann (a tire-factory worker for twenty years) has killed his supervisor or his supervisor's son and then committed suicide. It later becomes apparent that Mr. K√ºsters had become temporarily insane after hearing layoff announcements. A group of reporters take advantage of the grieving Mother K√ºsters to sensationalize the deaths. Finding no solace from her son Ernst (Meier), daughter-in-law Helene (Irm Hermann), who promptly go on holiday, or daughter (Caven), K√ºsters turns to Karl and Marianne Th√§lmann (B√∂hm and Carstensen), two members of what turns out to be the German Communist Party (DKP). They introduce themselves at Hermann's funeral, and invite her to their home, which Marianne had inherited. The Communists see K√ºsters's husband as a 'revolutionary' and a misguided victim of capitalism, but she is initially unpersuaded; her husband saw communists as troublemakers. Her daughter Corinna advises her mother to have nothing to do with them, and points out the differing conditions enjoyed by the authorities and the people in the East. An article on the tragedy by Niemeyer (Gottfried John), a photojournalist who had earlier shown a particular interest in the family, appears in a magazine. Emma finds the article objectionable, but her daughter, who has embarked on an affair with Niemeyer, defends him on 'earning a living' grounds. At the factory, Emma K√ºsters finds that the company pension scheme will not apply in her case; the workers' council and the company board are at one on the issue. Her daughter leaves, and Ernst and Helene, newly returned from holiday, announce they are to set up home on their own. Helene, expecting a child, does not get along with her sister-in-law. Emma K√ºsters now joins the Communist Party, having found Karl's newspaper article more sympathetic, but after K√ºsters speaks at her first DKP political gathering she meets a young male paper seller who claims to really have her interests at heart in clearing her husband's name. He gives her his contact details. She quickly grows impatient with the communists' passive tactics; they have to campaign in the forthcoming elections Karl explains. She connects with a small group of anarchists, who, though even smaller in number than the communists, claim to have more spirit. There are two endings to the film: *The anarchists' leading member, Horst Knab, demands to see Niemeyer at the magazine's offices but the secretary ('Lilo Pempeit', Fassbinder's mother) says he is unavailable. The editor suggests K√ºsters send in a letter which he might publish. The anarchists take the staff hostage at gunpoint, including Niemeyer, now living with Corinna, who arrives unaware how far the situation has developed. The anarchists demand the release of all political prisoners in West Germany, a Mercedes 600 to take them to the airport and a Boeing 707 to take them out of the country. K√ºsters looks horrified at the anarchists' demands but is killed in a subsequent clash with the police. Knab kills Linke (the editor) but Knab is also shot. (The last stages of the narrative are detailed with captions.) *In another ending (primarily used for the American edition), Niemeyer is at the magazine offices but as the staff start to leave at the end of their working day, the two anarchists grow bored with the sit-down strike and leave with K√ºsters remaining. After being told by her daughter Corinna, clearly now living with Niemeyer who has 'phoned her, that she is making herself ridiculous, Emma K√ºsters meets the friendly janitor of the newspaper's offices, whose wife is dead. The widow and widower leave to have dinner together, apparently beginning a romantic relationship.The two versions are included in the Arrow Films Region 2 (UK) DVD edition of the film. Fassbinder's film criticizes the bloodthirst of the 1970s German media in a similar manner to The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (directed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff and Margarethe von Trotta). However, Fassbinder's film goes further by criticizing the overwhelming selfishness present in contemporary society. Nearly everyone who Mother K√ºsters encounters is self-serving and unconcerned with comforting her. Fassbinder also clearly criticizes the small German Communist Party's moderation and \\"armchair activism\\".

Her body was discovered before dawn on Sunday, August 5. She was a major sex symbol and one of the most popular Hollywood stars during the 1950s and early 1960s. She was a top-billed actress for a decade, and her films had grossed $200 million by the time of her death. Monroe had suffered from mental illness and substance abuse for several years prior to her death, and she had not completed a film since The Misfits, which was released in 1961. She had spent 1961 preoccupied with her various health problems, and in April 1962 had begun filming Something's Got to Give for 20th Century Fox, but the studio fired her in early June. The studio publicly blamed her for the production's problems, and in the weeks preceding her death, Monroe attempted to repair her public image by giving several interviews to high-profile publications. She also began negotiations with Fox on being re-hired for Something's Got to Give and for starring roles in other productions. Monroe spent the last day of her life, August 4, at her home in Brentwood. She was accompanied at various times by publicist Patricia Newcomb, housekeeper Eunice Murray, photographer Lawrence Schiller and psychiatrist Ralph Greenson. At Greenson's request, Murray stayed overnight to keep Monroe company. At approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, she noticed that Monroe had locked herself in her bedroom and appeared unresponsive when she looked into the bedroom through a window. Murray alerted Greenson, who arrived soon after, entered the room by breaking a window, and found Monroe dead. Her death was officially ruled a probable suicide by the Los Angeles County coroner's office, based on precedents of her overdosing and being prone to mood swings and suicidal ideation. No evidence of foul play was found, and accidental overdose was ruled out owing to the large amount of barbiturates she had ingested. On August 8, Joe DiMaggio directed her funeral at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, where she was interred in a crypt at the Corridor of Memories. Despite the coroner's findings, several conspiracy theories suggesting murder or accidental overdose have been proposed since the mid-1960s. Many of these involve President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert, as well as union leader Jimmy Hoffa and mob boss Sam Giancana. Owing to the prevalence of these theories in the media, the office of the Los Angeles County District Attorney reviewed the case in 1982, but found no evidence to support them and did not disagree with the findings of the original investigation. Background For several years heading into the early 1960s, Monroe had been dependent on amphetamines, barbiturates and alcohol, and she experienced various mental health problems that included depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and chronic insomnia. She had acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with, and she frequently delayed productions by being late to film sets in addition to having trouble remembering her lines. By 1960, this behavior was adversely affecting her career. For example, although she was author Truman Capote's preferred choice to play Holly Golightly in the film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's, Paramount Pictures declined to cast her due to fear that she would complicate the film's production. The two films Monroe completed in the 1960s, Let's Make Love (1960) and The Misfits (1961), were both critical and commercial failures. During the filming of the latter she had had to spend a week detoxing in a hospital. Her third marriage, to author Arthur Miller, also ended in divorce in January 1961. Instead of working, Monroe spent a large part of 1961 preoccupied with health problems and did not work on any new film projects. She underwent surgery for her endometriosis and a cholecystectomy, and spent four weeks in hospital care ‚Äì including a brief stint in a mental ward ‚Äì for depression. Later in 1961, she moved back to Los Angeles after six years in Manhattan; she purchased a Spanish hacienda-style house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in Brentwood. In early 1962, she received a \\"World Film Favorite\\" Golden Globe award and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century Fox, Something's Got to Give, a remake of My Favorite Wife (1940). Days before filming began, Monroe caught sinusitis; Fox was advised to postpone the production, but the advice was not heeded and filming began on schedule in late April. Monroe was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to pressure her by publicly alleging that she was faking it. On May 19, she took a break from filming to sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" on stage at President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York ten days before his actual birthday. Monroe and Kennedy had mutual friends and although they sometimes had casual sexual encounters, there is no evidence that their relationship was serious. After Monroe returned to LA from New York City, she resumed filming and celebrated her 36th birthday on the set on June 1. She was again absent for several days, which led 20th Century Fox to fire her on June 7 and sue her for breach of contract, demanding $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after co-star Dean Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio publicly blamed Monroe's drug addiction and alleged lack of professionalism for the demise of the film, even claiming that she was mentally disturbed. To counter the negative publicity, Monroe gave interviews to several high-profile publications, such as Life, Cosmopolitan and Vogue, in her last weeks. After successfully renegotiating her contract with Fox, filming with Monroe was scheduled to resume in September on Something's Got to Give, and Monroe made plans for starring in What a Way to Go! (1964) as well as a biopic about Jean Harlow. Timeline Monroe spent the last day of her life, Saturday, August 4, at her Brentwood home. In the morning, she met with photographer Lawrence Schiller to discuss the possibility of Playboy publishing nude photos taken of her on the set of Something's Got to Give. She also received a massage from her personal massage therapist, talked with friends on the phone, and signed for deliveries. Present at the house in the morning were also her housekeeper, Eunice Murray, and her publicist Patricia Newcomb, who had stayed overnight. According to Newcomb, they had an argument because Monroe had not slept well the night before. Monroe's house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in Los Angeles At 4:30 p.m. PDT on Saturday, August 4, Monroe's psychiatrist Ralph Greenson arrived at the house to conduct a therapy session and asked Newcomb to leave. Before Greenson left at around 7 p.m., he asked Murray to stay overnight and keep Monroe company. At approximately 7‚Äì7:15, Monroe received a call from Joe DiMaggio Jr., with whom she had stayed close since her divorce from his father. He told her that he had broken up with a girlfriend she did not like, and he detected nothing alarming in Monroe's behavior. At around 7:40‚Äì7:45, she telephoned Greenson to tell him the news about the breakup of DiMaggio and his girlfriend. Monroe retired to her bedroom at approximately 8 p.m. She received a call from actor Peter Lawford, who was hoping to persuade her to attend his party that night. Lawford became alarmed because Monroe sounded like she was under the influence of drugs. She told him to \\"Say goodbye to Pat, say goodbye to the president (Lawford's brother-in-law), and say goodbye to yourself, because you're a nice guy\\", before drifting off. Unable to reach Monroe, Lawford called his agent Milton Ebbins, who unsuccessfully tried to reach Greenson, and later called Monroe's lawyer, Milton A. \\"Mickey\\" Rudin. Rudin called Monroe's house, and was assured by her housekeeper that she was fine. At approximately 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, Murray woke up \\"sensing that something was wrong\\" and saw light from under Monroe's bedroom door, but she was not able to get a response and found the door locked. Murray telephoned Greenson, on whose advice she looked in through a window, and saw Monroe lying facedown on her bed, covered by a sheet and clutching a telephone receiver. Greenson arrived shortly thereafter. He entered the room by breaking a window and found Monroe dead. He called her physician, Hyman Engelberg, who arrived at the house at around 3:50 a.m. and officially confirmed the death. At 4:25 a.m., they notified the Los Angeles Police Department. Inquest and 1982 review Deputy coroner Thomas Noguchi conducted Monroe's autopsy on the same day that she was found dead‚ÄîSunday, August 5‚Äîwhich was the day after she died. The Los Angeles County coroner's office was assisted in the inquest by psychiatrists Norman Farberow, Robert Litman, and Norman Tabachnik from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, who interviewed Monroe's doctors and psychiatrists on her mental state. Based on the advanced state of rigor mortis at the time her body was discovered, it was estimated that she had died between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. on August 4. The toxicological analysis concluded that the cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning; she had 8 mg% (mg/dl) of chloral hydrate and 4.5 mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood and a further 13 mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. The police found empty bottles of these medicines next to her bed. There were no signs of external wounds or bruises on the body. The findings of the inquest were published on August 17; Chief Coroner Theodore Curphey classified Monroe's death a \\"probable suicide\\". The possibility of an accidental overdose was ruled out because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit and had been taken \\"in one gulp or in a few gulps over a minute or so\\". At the time of her death, Monroe was reported to have been in a \\"depressed mood\\", and had been \\"unkempt\\" and uninterested in maintaining her appearance. No suicide note was found, but Litman stated that this was not unusual, because statistics show that less than 40 percent of suicide victims leave notes. In their final report, Farberow, Litman, and Tabachnik stated: > Miss Monroe had suffered from psychiatric disturbance for a long time. She > experienced severe fears and frequent depressions. Mood changes were abrupt > and unpredictable. Among symptoms of disorganization, sleep disturbance was > prominent, for which she had been taking sedative drugs for many years. She > was thus familiar with and experienced in the use of sedative drugs and well > aware of their dangers ... In our investigation we have learned that Miss > Monroe had often expressed wishes to give up, to withdraw, and even to die. > On more than one occasion in the past, she had made a suicide attempt, using > sedative drugs. On these occasions, she had called for help and had been > rescued. It is our opinion that the same pattern was repeated on the evening > of Aug. 4 except for the rescue. It has been our practice with similar > information collected in other cases in the past to recommend a > certification for such deaths as probable suicide. Additional clews for > suicide provided by the physical evidence are the high level of barbiturates > and chloral hydrate in the blood which, with other evidence from the > autopsy, indicates the probable ingestion of a large amount of drugs within > a short period of time: the completely empty bottle of Nembutal, the > prescription for which (25 capsules) was filled the day before the > ingestion, and the locked door to the bedroom, which was unusual. In the 1970s, claims surfaced that Monroe's death was a murder and not suicide. Due to these claims, Los Angeles County District Attorney John Van de Kamp assigned his colleague Ronald H. \\"Mike\\" Carroll to conduct a 1982 \\"threshold investigation\\" to see whether a criminal investigation should be opened. Carroll worked with Alan B. Tomich, an investigator for the district attorney's office, for over three months on an inquiry that resulted in a thirty-page report. They did not find any credible evidence to support the theory that Monroe was murdered. In 1983, Thomas Noguchi published his memoirs, in which he discussed Monroe's case and the allegations of discrepancies in the autopsy and the coroner's ruling of suicide. These included the claims that Monroe could not have ingested the pills because her stomach was empty; that Nembutal capsules should have left yellow residue; that she may have been administered an enema; and that the autopsy noted no needle marks despite the fact that she routinely received injections from her doctors. Noguchi explained that hemorrhaging of the stomach lining indicated that the medication had been administered orally, and that because Monroe had been an addict for several years, the pills would have been absorbed more rapidly than in the case of non-addicts. He also denied that Nembutal leaves dye residue. He noted that only very recent needle marks are visible on a body, and that the only bruise he noted on Monroe's body, on her lower back, was superficial and its placement indicated that it was accidental, and not linked to foul play. Noguchi finally concluded that based on his observations, the most probable conclusion is that Monroe committed suicide. Public reactions and funeral Monroe's former husband Joe DiMaggio mourning at her funeral. New York Daily Mirror front page, August 9, 1962. Monroe's unexpected death was front-page news in the United States and Europe. According to biographer Lois Banner, \\"it's said that the suicide rate in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of most newspapers expanded that month\\", and the Chicago Tribune reported that they had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public requesting information about her death. French artist Jean Cocteau commented that her death \\"should serve as a terrible lesson to all those, whose chief occupation consists of spying on and tormenting film stars\\", her former co-star Laurence Olivier deemed her \\"the complete victim of ballyhoo and sensation\\", and Bus Stop director Joshua Logan stated that she was \\"one of the most unappreciated people in the world\\". Monroe's funeral was held on August 8 at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, where her foster parents Ana Lower and Grace McKee Goddard had also been buried. The service was arranged by her former husband Joe DiMaggio and her business manager Inez Melson, who decided to invite only around thirty of her closest family members and friends, excluding most of Hollywood. Police were present to keep the press away and to control the several hundred spectators who crowded the streets around the cemetery. The funeral service, presided over by a local minister, was conducted at the cemetery's chapel. Monroe was laid out in a green Emilio Pucci dress and held a bouquet of small pink roses; her longtime make-up artist and friend, Whitey Snyder, had done her make-up. The eulogy was delivered by Lee Strasberg, and a selection from Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony as well as a record of Judy Garland singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" were played. Monroe was interred at crypt No. 24 at the Corridor of Memories. DiMaggio arranged for red roses to be placed in a vase attached to the crypt three times a week for the next 20 years. Administration of estate In her will, Monroe left several thousand dollars to her half-sister Berniece Baker Miracle and her secretary May Reis, a share for the education of her friend Norman Rosten's daughter, and established a $100,000 trust fund to cover the costs of the care of her mother and the widow of her acting teacher Michael Chekhov. From the remaining estate she granted 25 percent to her former psychiatrist Marianne Kris \\"for the furtherance of the work of such psychiatric institutions or groups as she shall elect\\", and 75 percent, including her personal effects, film royalties and real estate, to Lee Strasberg, whom she instructed to distribute her effects \\"among my friends, colleagues and those to whom I am devoted\\". Due to legal complications, the beneficiaries were not paid until 1971. When Strasberg died in 1982, his estate was willed to his widow Anna, who claimed Monroe's publicity rights and began to license her image to companies. In 1990, she unsuccessfully sued the Anna Freud Centre, to which Kris had bequeathed her Monroe rights, in an attempt to gain full rights to Monroe's estate. In 1996, Anna Strasberg hired CMG Worldwide, a celebrity-legacy licensing group, to manage the licensing rights, and in the same year prevented Odyssey Group, Inc. from auctioning effects that Monroe's business manager Inez Melson had obtained when she died. Between 1996 and 2001 CMG entered into 700 licensing agreements with merchandisers. Against Monroe's wishes, Lee Strasberg had never distributed her effects amongst her friends, and in 1999 Anna Strasberg commissioned Christie's to auction them, netting $13.4 million. In 2000, she founded Marilyn Monroe LLC. Marilyn Monroe LLC's claim to exclusive ownership of Monroe's publicity rights became subject to a \\"landmark [legal] case\\" in 2006, when the heirs of three freelance photographers who had photographed her‚ÄîSam Shaw, Milton Greene, and Tom Kelley‚Äîsuccessfully challenged the company in courts in California and New York. In May 2007, the courts determined that Monroe could not have passed her publicity rights to her estate, as the first law granting such right, the California Celebrities Rights Act, was not passed until 1985. The estate terminated their business relationship with CMG Worldwide in 2010, and sold the licensing rights to Authentic Brands Group the following year. Also in 2010, the estate sold Monroe's Brentwood home for $3.8 million, and published a selection of her private notes, diaries and correspondence as a book called Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters. Conspiracy theories =1960s: Frank A. Capell, Jack Clemmons= During the 1960s, there were no widespread conspiracy theories about Monroe's death. The first allegations that she had been murdered originated in anti-communist activist Frank A. Capell's self- published pamphlet The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe (1964), in which he claimed that her death was part of a communist conspiracy. He claimed that Monroe and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had an affair, which she took too seriously and was threatening to cause a scandal; Kennedy therefore ordered her to be assassinated to protect his career. In addition to accusing Kennedy of being a communist sympathizer, Capell also claimed that many other people close to Monroe, such as her doctors and ex-husband Arthur Miller, were communists. Monroe with U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy at a private party in the midtown Manhattan penthouse home of Arthur B. Krim and Mathilde Krim that celebrated JFK‚Äôs birthday 10 days before his actual birthday; Monroe had sung Happy Birthday to him publicly earlier that night; she died 77 days later. Capell's credibility has been seriously questioned because his only source was columnist Walter Winchell, who in turn had received much of his information from him; Capell, therefore, was citing himself. His friend, LAPD Sergeant Jack Clemmons, aided him in developing his pamphlet; Clemmons became a central source for conspiracy theorists. He was the first police officer on the scene of Monroe's death and later made claims that he had not mentioned in the official 1962 investigation: he alleged that when he arrived at Monroe's house, her housekeeper was washing her sheets, and he had \\"a sixth sense\\" that something was wrong. Capell and Clemmons' allegations have been linked to their political goals. Capell dedicated his life to revealing an \\"International Communist Conspiracy\\" and Clemmons was a member of The Police and Fire Research Organization (FiPo), which sought to expose \\"subversive activities which threaten our American way of life\\". FiPo and similar organizations were known for their stance against the Kennedys and for sending the Federal Bureau of Investigation letters incriminating them; a 1964 FBI file that speculated on an affair between Monroe and Robert F. Kennedy is likely to have come from them. Furthermore, Capell, Clemmons, and a third person were indicted in 1965 by a California grand jury for \\"conspiracy to libel by obtaining and distributing a false affidavit\\" claiming that senator Thomas Kuchel had once been arrested for a homosexual act. They had done this because Kuchel had supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Capell pleaded guilty, and charges against Clemmons were dropped after he resigned from the LAPD. In the 1960s, Monroe's death was also discussed in Charles Hamblett's Who Killed Marilyn Monroe? (1966) and in James A. Hudson's The Mysterious Death of Marilyn Monroe (1968). Neither Capell's, Hamblett's, or Hudson's accounts were widely disseminated. =1970s: Norman Mailer, Robert Slatzer, Anthony Scaduto= The allegations of murder first became part of mainstream discussion with the publication of Norman Mailer's Marilyn: A Biography in 1973. Despite not having any evidence, Mailer repeated the claim that Monroe and Robert F. Kennedy had an affair and speculated that she was killed by either the FBI or CIA, who wished to use the murder as a \\"point of pressure ... against the Kennedys\\". The book was heavily criticized in reviews, and later that year Mailer recanted his allegations in an interview with Mike Wallace for 60 Minutes, stating that he had made them to ensure commercial success for his book, and that he believes Monroe's death was \\"ten to one\\" an \\"accidental suicide\\". Two years later, Robert F. Slatzer published The Life and Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe (1975), based on Capell's pamphlet. In addition to his assertion that Monroe was killed by Robert F. Kennedy, Slatzer also controversially claimed to have been married to Monroe in Mexico for three days in October 1952, and that they had remained close friends until her death. Although his account was not widely circulated at the time, it has remained central to conspiracy theories. In October 1975, rock journalist Anthony Scaduto published an article about Monroe's death in soft porn magazine Oui, and the following year expanded his account into book form as Who Killed Marilyn Monroe? (1976), published under the pen name Tony Sciacca. His only sources were Slatzer and his private investigator, Milo Speriglio. In addition to repeating Slatzer's claims, Scaduto alleged that Monroe had kept a red diary in which she had written confidential political information she had heard from the Kennedys, and that her house had been wiretapped by surveillance expert Bernard Spindel on the orders of union leader Jimmy Hoffa, who was hoping to obtain incriminating evidence he could use against the Kennedys. =1980s: Milo Speriglio, Anthony Summers= In 1982, Slatzer's private detective Milo Speriglio published Marilyn Monroe: Murder Cover-Up, in which he claimed that Monroe had been murdered by Jimmy Hoffa and mob boss Sam Giancana. Basing his account on Slatzer and Scaduto's books, Speriglio added statements made by Lionel Grandison, who worked at the Los Angeles County coroner's office at the time of Monroe's death. Grandison claimed that Monroe's body had been extensively bruised but this had been omitted from the autopsy report, and that he had seen the \\"red diary\\", but it had mysteriously disappeared. Speriglio and Slatzer demanded that the investigation into Monroe's death be re-opened by authorities, and the Los Angeles District Attorney agreed to review the case. The new investigation could not find any evidence to support the murder claims. Grandison was found not to be a reliable witness as he had been fired from the coroner's office for stealing from corpses. The allegations that Monroe's home was wiretapped by Bernard Spindel were also found to be false. Spindel's apartment had been raided by the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 1966, during which his tapes were seized. He later made a claim that he had wiretapped Monroe's house, but it was not supported by the contents of the tapes, to which the investigators had listened. Journalist Anthony Summers, one of the most prominent biographers to allege that Monroe's death involved a cover-up The most prominent Monroe conspiracy theorist in the 1980s was British journalist Anthony Summers, who claimed that Monroe's death was an accidental overdose enabled and covered up by Robert F. Kennedy. His book, Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe (1985), became one of the most commercially successful Monroe biographies. Prior to writing on Monroe, he had authored a book on a conspiracy theory of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His investigation on Monroe began as an assignment for the British tabloid the Sunday Express to cover the Los Angeles District Attorney's 1982 review. According to Summers, Monroe had severe substance abuse problems and was psychotic in the last months of her life. He alleges that Monroe had affairs with both John F. and Robert F. Kennedy, and that when Robert F. Kennedy ended their affair, she threatened to reveal their association. Kennedy and Peter Lawford attempted to prevent this by enabling her addictions. According to Summers, Monroe became hysterical and accidentally overdosed, dying in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. Kennedy wanted to leave Los Angeles before Monroe's death became public to avoid being associated with it, and therefore her body was returned to Helena Drive and the overdose staged as a suicide by Lawford, the Kennedys and J. Edgar Hoover. Summers based his account on interviews he had conducted with 650 people connected to Monroe, but his research has been criticized by biographers Donald Spoto and Sarah Churchwell. According to Spoto, Summers contradicts himself, presents false information as fact, and misrepresents what some of Monroe's friends said about her. Churchwell, meanwhile, has stated that while Summers accumulated a large collection of anecdotal material, most of his allegations are speculation; many of the people he interviewed could provide only second- or third-hand accounts, and they \\"relate what they believe, not what they demonstrably know\\". Summers was also the first major biographer to find Slatzer a credible witness, and relies heavily on testimonies by other controversial witnesses, including Jack Clemmons and Jeanne Carmen, a woman whose claim to have been Monroe's close friend has been disputed by Spoto and Lois Banner. Summers' allegations formed the basis for the BBC documentary Marilyn: Say Goodbye to the President (1985), and for a 26-minute segment produced for ABC's 20/20. The 20/20 segment was never aired, as ABC President Roone Arledge decided that the claims made in it required more evidence to back them up. Summers claimed that Arledge's decision was influenced by pressure from the Kennedys. =1990s: Brown and Barham, Donald H. Wolfe, Donald Spoto= In the 1990s, two new books alleged that Monroe was murdered: Peter Brown and Patte Barham's Marilyn: The Last Take (1992) and Donald H. Wolfe's The Last Days of Marilyn Monroe (1998). Neither presented much new evidence but relied extensively on Capell and Summers as well as on discredited witnesses such as Grandison, Slatzer, Clemmons, and Carmen; Wolfe also did not provide any sources for many of his claims, and disregarded many of the findings of the autopsy without explanation. In his 1993 biography of Monroe, Donald Spoto disputed the previous conspiracy theories but alleged that Monroe's death was an accidental overdose staged as a suicide. According to him, her doctors Greenson (psychiatrist) and Engelberg (personal physician) had been trying to stop her abuse of Nembutal. In order to monitor her drug use, they had agreed to never prescribe her anything without first consulting with each other. Monroe was able to persuade Engelberg to break his promise by lying to him that Greenson had agreed to it. She took several Nembutals on August 4, but did not tell this to Greenson, who prescribed her a chloral hydrate enema; the combination of these two drugs killed her. Afraid of the consequences, the doctors and Monroe's housekeeper then staged the death as a suicide. Spoto argued that Monroe could not have been suicidal because she had reached a new agreement with 20th Century Fox and because she was allegedly going to remarry Joe DiMaggio. He based his theory of her death on alleged discrepancies in the police statements given by Monroe's housekeeper and doctors, a claim made by Monroe's publicist Arthur P. Jacobs's wife that he had been alerted of the death already at 10:30 pm, as well as on claims made by prosecutor John Miner, who was involved in the official investigation. Miner had alleged that her autopsy revealed signs more consistent with an enema than oral ingestion. =2000s: John Miner, Matthew Smith= John Miner's allegations that Monroe's death was not a suicide received more publicity in the 2000s, when he published transcripts that he claimed to have made from audiotapes that Monroe recorded shortly before her death. Miner claimed that Monroe gave the tapes to her psychiatrist Greenson, who invited him to listen to them after her death. On the tapes, Monroe spoke of her plans for the future, which Miner argues is proof that she could not have killed herself. She also discussed her sex life and use of enemas; Miner alleged that Monroe was killed by an enema that was administered by her housekeeper. Miner's allegations have received criticism. During the official review of the case by the district attorney in 1982, he told the investigators about the tapes, but did not mention that he had transcripts of them. Miner claimed that this was because Greenson had sworn him to silence. The tapes themselves have never been found, and Miner remains the only person to claim they existed. Greenson was already dead before Miner went public with them. Biographer Lois Banner knew Miner personally because they both worked at the University of Southern California; she further challenged the authenticity of the transcripts. Miner had once lost his license to practice law for several years, lied to Banner about having worked for the Kinsey Institute, and had gone bankrupt shortly before selling the alleged transcripts. He had first attempted to sell the transcripts to Vanity Fair, but when the magazine had asked him to show them to Anthony Summers in order to validate them, it had become apparent that he did not have them. The transcripts, which Miner finally sold to British author Matthew Smith, were therefore written several decades after he alleged to have listened to the tapes. Miner's claim that Monroe's housekeeper was in fact her nurse and administered her enemas on a regular basis is also not supported by evidence. Furthermore, Banner wrote that Miner had a personal obsession about enemas and practiced sadomasochism; she concluded that his theory about Monroe's death \\"represented his sexual interests\\" and was not based on evidence. Matthew Smith published the transcripts as part of his book Victim: The Secret Tapes of Marilyn Monroe (2003). He asserted that Monroe was murdered by the CIA due to her association with Robert F. Kennedy, as the agency wanted revenge for the Kennedys' handling of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Smith had already written about the topic in his previous book, The Men Who Murdered Marilyn (1996). Noting that Smith included no footnotes in his 1996 book and only eight in Victim, Churchwell has called his account \\"a tissue of conjecture, speculation and pure fiction as documentary fact\\" and \\"arguably the least factual of all Marilyn lives\\". The Miner transcripts were also discussed in a 2005 Los Angeles Times article.

It is based on Charles Perry's novel Portrait of a Young Man Drowning. Plot Eighteen-year-old Harry (Norman Reedus), is an innocent, bashful burger boy who lives with his overly attentive mother Kate. Harry's father left the family sometime before the events of the film, leaving Kate for another man. They live in a ratty old apartment, where Kate treats her son like a child, even going as far to draw his bath water and connect a wire to his reading lamp, shutting it off when Harry is busy to get his attention. One day, Arnie (Adrien Brody), Harry's oldest and best friend, goes to a strip club, where the boss owes Arnie's mob boss money. Harry watches as Arnie beats the owner, and snaps, releasing his rage out on the owner, pummeling him to the point where Arnie has to pull Harry off to avoid killing him. Outside, both are visibly shocked by Harry's outburst, but Harry is shocked and confused at the fact that he liked it. Not long after, Arnie's boss Abie Pinkwise, meets the two at a local diner, where he remarks how much potential Harry has in the mob business. He invites Harry to become his apprentice, and Harry accepts. After leaving, Arnie attempts a heist at a small store, but backfires when the clerk holds him at gun point, sending him to jail. When Harry is told to ditch a car (evidence in a homicide), by his bosses, he leaves evidence (a magazine with his name on it), and a witness. He is arrested but is proven to be loyal to his employers by keeping silent, despite being beaten by the police. Now trusting him, the bosses get him out of jail and take him out to celebrate at a brothel. When alone with one of the women, Harry is unaroused, and timidly asks the prostitute if he seems normal. When he answers that he doesn't feel that way for neither men nor women, she gently replies that she isn't the kind of professional he should be talking to. He goes home dejected, and when his mother smells perfume on him the first signs of her jealous tendencies begin to show. As the months pass Abie shows Harry the ropes but when faced with killing someone, Harry hesitates, but ultimately does the crime, letting himself go as he did when beating the strip club owner. That night, upset by what he did, Harry goes to Louis Varga's house, only to find it empty, sans for Iris, his Hungarian maid. She offers him coffee, and it is here where Harry's alter-ego Madden (Holter Graham), appears. With Madden in control, Harry frightens Iris and thus causes her to quit. Angry, Mr. Varga makes Harry apologize to Iris, and makes Harry say he is in love with her to prompt her to come back under Mr. Varga's employment. Hesitantly, Iris accepts Harry's timid offer and the two begin dating, with Harry actually falling in love with Iris along the way, much to his mother's anger and jealousy. When Harry finds a house that he likes, he is set on moving into it as a means to escape his mother's controlling nature, but when she moves with him, she decorates the house as a replica of their old apartment, much to her sons anger. Arnie is then released from prison, and Harry hopes to get him back in the game as their getaway driver for a new hit coming up. However, the hit goes awry when it is revealed far too late that the man to be killed by both Harry and Abie, is actually Abie's long-lost uncle. Devastated, Abie pauses long enough for the police to be called, which is where Arnie flees. Abie and Harry manage to escape. While Abie grieves at home, falling off the wagon after years of sobriety, Harry and \\"Madden\\" meet up again and this leads him to Iris' house, where the consummate their relationship. Arnie then comes forward with the promise of immunity, and flips on Harry and Abie. Both Abie and Harry keep quiet during the interrogation. The mob has the three released, but now that it is clear that Arnie is a liability and cannot be trusted, Mr. Varga orders Abie and Harry to kill him. When Abie hesitates, still drinking and distraught over his uncle, Harry kills Arnie himself, despite his friend's pleading. Once again, in this blood-lust haze, Harry seeks comfort with Iris. At Arnie's funeral, Mr. Varga reminds Harry that when Abie drinks, he starts talking, and this makes him a liability. Mr. Varga hints that they may need to kill Abie to keep him silent. When Kate finds Iris' hair in Harry's underwear, he admits to having a girlfriend and Kate calmly says she would like to meet her. The stress puts a strain on Iris and Harry's sex life, and even \\"Madden's one-track mind\\" is of no use (during past sexual encounters, Harry has only had sex with Iris under Madden's persona). Worried for Harry's mental health, Iris resolves they really try, without Madden's help. The two go to a hotel, where they make love after Harry has her put on a mourning veil. At the family dinner where Iris was to meet Kate, things seem to be going well, until Kate has her son go out for ginger ale, leaving the two women alone. When Harry returns he finds Iris gone, his mother having driven her away in a jealous rage. Harry admits that he may be in love with Iris and is about to go after her when his mother stops him. Harry remains home and breaks off contact with Iris, his mother's hold over him stronger than ever. Despite the fact that Abie has stopped drinking and is no longer a threat, Mr. Varga orders Harry to kill Abie anyway. Harry kills Abie with the same ice-pick he gave Harry earlier in the film, in front of a diner full of witnesses. More upset than ever, Madden is revealed again, and though he goes to first Iris, then a brothel for relief, he turns to his mother. It is revealed though flashbacks that Madden is truly Harry. Harry then has sex with Kate, who proclaims that she had waited \\"so long\\" for this. The next morning is mundane, Harry takes his usual bath while his mother is in the kitchen. He hears a thud and goes to investigate, and there finds his mother hanging from the ceiling thinking she killed herself (Harry actually killed her, but his mental state won't let him notice). Mr. Varga calls Harry to inform him that they are relocating elsewhere, as Harry's act in the diner put them all under danger of arrest. Harry, clearly distraught from Kate's death, says that he will take his mother's corpse with him, and that she will \\"not get in the way\\" of their escape. Disturbed, Mr. Varga agrees to pick him up, only to attempt to kill him when Harry gets into the backseat. Harry draws his own gun and shoots both Mr. Varga and his henchman dead and takes the car to the bus station. Iris, who had left the city for California to be with her brother, is delighted to have Harry going with her. They sit on the bus, overjoyed to breakaway from the city and the mob altogether. Harry looks away across the seat with a smile, and shows Kate's body bag resting casually in the seat.  Cast  * Norman Reedus as Harold * Deborah Harry as Kate, Harold's overly attentive mother.

Elements of some versions of the song suggest that it dates from at least the mid 18th century. The Curragh of Kildare speaks of the actual Curragh, which is a large area of common land in Kildare, Ireland, used to rally the Irish Army. Textual history The history of the text is rather complicated. Versions were taken down at different times in Ireland by collectors like George Petrie and P. W. Joyce. The song has also been collected in Scotland and even in England; the singer Frank Purslow collected a version (The Winter's Gone and Past) in Dorset.Purslow, F. The Foggy Dew, EFDS, 1974, p.96 Petrie was of the opinion that it was an \\"old Anglo-Irish song\\" and argued that the Scottish versions were most likely developed from it.Petrie, G. The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland, Cork UP, 2002, p.193 Several printed ballad versions exist, under titles such as The Lamenting Maid. The most well known version of the text, usually referred to by the title The Winter it is Past, is attributed to Robert Burns. Burns appears to have developed it from a popular stall-ballad, The Lovesick Maid, which referred to a highwayman called Johnson, who was hanged in 1750 for robbery in the Curragh.Low, D. (ed) The Songs of Robert Burns, Routledge, 1993, p.311 Burns polished the original text considerably and removed two stanzas referring directly to Johnson. The resulting ballad was published in the collection the Scots Musical Museum. Different airs have been used for the song.Folk Songs and Ballads Popular in Ireland Vol. 2, edited by John Loesberg. Ossian Publications. Petrie suspected that one had been composed expressly for the stall-ballad, probably in Scotland around 1750, but expressed an opinion that \\"the same song united to a melody unquestionably Irish has been [...] known in Ireland [...] for an equal or much longer period\\".Petrie, G. The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland, Cork UP, 2002, p.193 The tune used for Burns' version has been identified as a (distant) relative of that used for the American ballad Fare You Well, My Own True Love.Cazden, N. Notes and Sources for \\"Folk Songs of the Catskills\\", SUNY, 1982, p.35 The song as currently performed was popularised by The Johnstons, and later by Christy Moore, while versions also exist by Paddy Reilly, The Fureys, Bert Jansch and others. Modern renditions have tended to use a text where the singer is male, and the \\"true love\\" female, whereas in the early ballads such as The Lamenting Maid the opposite was the case.

Situated in the Arusha province, it is famed for its irrigation and cultivation structures. It is considered one of the most important Iron Age archaeological sites in eastern Africa. The site Sometime in the 15th century, an Iron Age farming community built a large continuous village area on the footslopes of the Rift Valley escarpment, housing several thousand people. They developed an intricate irrigation and cultivation system, involving a stone-block canal channelling water from the Crater Highlands rift escarpment to stone-lined cultivation terraces. Measures were taken to prevent soil erosion and the fertility of the plots was increased by using the manure of stall fed cattle. For an unknown reason Engaruka was abandoned at latest in the mid-18th century. The site still poses many questions, including the identity of the founders, how they developed their farming system, and why they left.Stump, Daryl. 2003. The soils of Engaruka: preliminary soil exhaustion tests on a pre-colonial agricultural landscape in Tanzania‚Äô, in P. Mitchell, A. Haour and J. Hobart (eds.) Researching Africa‚Äôs past: new contributions from British archaeologists. pp. 101-109. Oxford: Oxford University School of Archaeology. Construction of Engaruka has traditionally been credited to the ancestors of the Iraqw, a Cushitic-speaking group of cultivators residing in the Mbulu Highlands of northern Tanzania. The modern Iraqw practice an intensive form of self-contained agriculture that bears a remarkable similarity to the ruins of stone-walled canals, dams and furrows that are found at Engaruka. Iraqw historical traditions likewise relate that their last significant migration to their present area of inhabitation occurred about two or three centuries ago after conflicts with the Barbaig sub-group of the Datoga, herders who are known to have occupied the Crater Highlands above Engaruka prior to the arrival of the Maasai. This population movement is reportedly consistent with the date of the Engaruka site's desertion, which is estimated at somewhere between 1700 and 1750. It also roughly coincides with the start of the diminishment of the Engaruka River's flow as well as those of other streams descending from the Ngorongoro highlands; water sources around which Engaruka's irrigation practices were centered. According to the Maasai, who are the present-day occupants of Engaruka, the Iraqw also already inhabited the site when their own ancestors first entered the region during the 18th century. Engaruka has also been linked to the Sonjo, a numerically small Bantu-speaking living some 60 miles to the northwest. Like the Iraqw, they are known for their use of irrigation systems in agriculture. The Sonjo also maintain terraced village sites, albeit of considerably more rudimentary form than what is found at Engaruka. New studies have also revealed new information about the Middle Stone Age and Pastoral Neolithic occupational histories of the area.Seitsonen, Oula. 2005. ‚ÄòStone Age observations in the Engaruka area‚Äô, in Nyame Akuma 63, 27-32. History of archaeological research The first explorer to record the existence of these ruins was Gustav Fischer, who passed them on July 5, 1883, and compared them to the tumbled-down walls of ancient castles. Scoeller and Kaiser mentioned the ruins of \\"Ngaruku\\" including great stone circles and dams in 1896-97. The first detailed and archaeological investigation was by Hans Reck, in 1913. Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey investigated the site in 1935, but were disappointed by the lack of burial sites. They estimated a population of 30,000, but this figure is now considered exaggerated. John Sutton of the British Institute in Eastern Africa later conducted excavations at Engaruka, and in 2002-2005 Ari Siiriainen led a research team from the Department of Archaeology at the University of Helsinki. In 2001-2004, studies were conducted by Daryl Stump of University College London as part of his PhD thesis work. In 2006, the University of Helsinki resumed Siiriainen's work, concentrating on the connections between Engaruka and the Sonjo area. Modern Engaruka Engaruka is also the name of a modern village not far from the archaeological site. The Maasai conduct tourist tours of the site.
